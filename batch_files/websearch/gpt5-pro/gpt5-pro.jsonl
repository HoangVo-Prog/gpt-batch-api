But former Texas Gov. Rick Perry says building such a wall wouldn’t be so simple.\nIs that true? Gardner Selby of the Politifact Texas fact-checking team has the answer.\n“Building a wall” on the border “will take literally years. I don’t care how good of a builder you are,” Perry said about 40 minutes into an interview on the Jan. 15, 2016, edition of the Simon Conway Show on WHO in Des Moines. “And plus the private property rights,” Perry said. “This is an issue that really gets complex in a hurry. I know because I’ve had to deal with it.”\nHear how Perry’s claim scored in the player above.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The cheerful paintings of flowers on the tall metal posts on the Tijuana side of the border fence between the U.S. and Mexico belie the sadness of the Mexican families who have gathered there to exchange whispers, tears, and jokes with relatives on the San Diego side.\nMany have been separated from their family members for years. Some were deported to Mexico after having lived in the United States for decades without authorization, leaving behind children, spouses, siblings, and parents. Others never left Mexico, but have made their way to the fence to see relatives in the United States. With its prison–like ambience and Orwellian name—Friendship Park—this site is one of the very few places where families separated by immigration rules can have even fleeting contact with their loved ones, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Elsewhere, the tall metal barrier is heavily patrolled.\nSo is to be the wall that President Donald Trump promises to build along the border. But no matter how tall and thick a wall will be, illicit flows will cross.\nUndocumented workers and drugs will still find their way across any barrier the administration ends up building. And such a wall will be irrelevant to those people who become undocumented immigrants by overstaying their visas—who for many years have outnumbered those who become undocumented immigrants by crossing the U.S.–Mexico border.\nNor will the physical wall enhance U.S. security.\nThe border, and more broadly how the United States defines its relations with Mexico, directly affects the 12 million people who live within 100 miles of the border. In multiple and very significant ways that have not been acknowledged or understood it will also affect communities all across the United States as well as Mexico.\nThe wall comes with many costs, some obvious though hard to estimate, some unforeseen. The most obvious is the large financial outlay required to build it, in whatever form it eventually takes. Although during the election campaign candidate Trump claimed that the wall would cost only $12 billion, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) internal report in February put the cost at $21.6 billion, but that may be a major underestimate.\nThe estimates vary so widely because of the lack of clarity about what the wall will actually consist of beyond the first meager Homeland Security specifications that it be either a solid concrete wall or a see–through structure, “physically imposing in height,” ideally 30 feet high but no less than 18 feet, sunk at least six feet into the ground to prevent tunneling under it; that it should not be scalable with even sophisticated climbing aids; and that it should withstand prolonged attacks with impact tools, cutting tools, and torches. But that description doesn’t begin to cover questions about the details of its physical structure. Then there are the legal fees required to seize land on which to build the wall. The Trump administration can use eminent domain to acquire the land but will still have to negotiate compensation and often face lawsuits. More than 90 such lawsuits in southern Texas alone are still open from the 2008 effort to build a fence there.\nThe Trump administration cannot simply seize remittances to Mexico to pay for the wall; doing so may increase flows of undocumented workers to the United States. Remittances provide many Mexicans with amenities they could never afford otherwise. But for Mexicans living in poverty—some 46.2 percent in 2015 according to the Mexican social research agency CONEVAL—the remittances are a veritable lifeline which can represent as much as 80 percent of their income. These families count on that money for the basics of life—food, clothing, health care, and education for their children.\nThe remittances enable human and economic development throughout the country, and this in turn reduces the incentives for further migration to the United States — precisely what Trump is aiming to do.\nI met the matron of one of those families in a lush but desperately poor mountain village in Guerrero. Rosa, a forceful woman who was initially suspicious, decided to confide in me. Her son had crossed into the United States eight years ago, she said. The remittances he sent allowed Rosa’s grandchildren to get medical treatment at the nearest clinic, some thirty miles away. Like Rosa, many people in the village had male relatives working illegally in the United States in order to help their families make ends meet. Sierra de Atoyac may be paradise for a birdwatcher (which I am), but Guerrero is one of Mexico’s poorest, most neglected, and crime and violence–ridden states. “Here you have few chances,” Rosa explained to me. “If you’re smart, like my son, you make it across the border to the U.S. If you’re not so smart, you join the narcos. If you’re stupid, but lucky, you join the [municipal] police. Otherwise, you’re stuck here farming or logging and starving.”\nAny attempt to seize the remittances from such families would be devastating. Fluctuating between $20 billion and $25 billion annually during the past decade, remittances from the United States have amounted to about 3 percent of Mexico’s GDP, representing the third–largest source of foreign revenue after oil and tourism. The remittances enable human and economic development throughout the country, and this in turn reduces the incentives for further migration to the United States—precisely what Trump is aiming to do.\nWhy the DHS believes that a 30–foot tall wall cannot be scaled and a tunnel cannot be built deeper than six feet below ground is not clear.\nDrug smugglers have been using tunnels to get drugs into the United States ever since Mexico’s most famous drug trafficker, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán of the Sinaloa Cartel, pioneered the method in 1989. And the sophistication of these tunnels has only grown over time. In April 2016, U.S. law enforcement officials discovered a drug tunnel that ran more than half a mile from Tijuana to San Diego and was equipped with ventilation vents, rails, and electricity. It is the longest such tunnel to be found so far, but one of 13 of great length and technological expertise discovered since 2006. Altogether, between 1990 and 2016, 224 tunnels have been unearthed at the U.S.–Mexico border.\nOther smuggling methods increasingly include the use of drones and catapults as well as joint drainage systems between border towns that have wide tunnels or tubes through which people can crawl and drugs can be pulled. But even if the land border were to become much more secure, that would only intensify the trend toward smuggling goods as well as people via boats that sail far to the north, where they land on the California coast.\nAnother thing to consider is that a barrier in the form of a wall is increasingly irrelevant to the drug trade as it is now practiced because most of the drugs smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico no longer arrive on the backs of those who cross illegally. Instead, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, most of the smuggled marijuana as well as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines comes through the 52 legal ports of entry on the border. These ports have to process literally millions of people, cars, trucks, and trains every week. Traffickers hide their illicit cargo in secret, state–of–the art compartments designed for cars, or under legal goods in trailer trucks. And they have learned many techniques for fooling the border patrol. Mike, a grizzled U.S. border official whom I interviewed in El Paso in 2013, shrugged: “The narcos sometimes tip us off, letting us find a car full of drugs while they send six other cars elsewhere. Such write–offs are part of their business expense. Other times the tipoffs are false. We search cars and cars, snarl up the traffic for hours on, and find nothing.”\nBeyond the Sinaloa Cartel, 44 other significant criminal groups operate today in Mexico. The infighting within and among them has made Mexico one of the world’s most violent countries. In 2016 alone this violence claimed between 21,000 and 23,000 lives. Between 2007 and 2017, a staggering 177,000 people were murdered in Mexico, a number that could actually be much higher, as many bodies are buried in mass graves that are hidden and never found. Those Mexican border cities that are principal entry points of drugs into the Unites States have been particularly badly affected by the violence.\nTake Ciudad Juárez, for example. Directly across the border from peaceful El Paso. Ciudad Juárez was likely the world’s most violent city when I was there in 2011 and it epitomizes what can happen during these drug wars. In 2011 the Sinaloa Cartel was battling the local Juárez Cartel, trying to take over the city’s smuggling routes to the United States, and causing a veritable bloodbath. Walking around the contested colonías at the time was like touring a cemetery: Residents would point out places where people were killed the day before, three days before, five weeks ago.\nJuan, a skinny 19–year–old whom I met there that year, told me that he was trying to get out of a local gang (the name of which he wouldn’t reveal). He had started working for the gang as a halcone (a lookout) when he was 15, he said. But now as the drug war raged in the city and the local gangs were pulled into the infighting between the big cartels, his friends in the gang were being asked to do much more than he wanted to do—to kill. Without any training, they were given assault weapons. Having no shooting skills, they just sprayed bullets in the vicinity of their assigned targets, hoping that at least some of the people they killed would be the ones they were supposed to kill, because if they didn’t succeed, they themselves might be murdered by those who had contracted them to do the job.\nI met Juan through Valeria, whose NGO was trying to help gang members like Juan get on the straight and narrow. But it was tough going for her and her staff to make the case. As Juan had explained to me, a member who refused to do the bidding of the gangs could be killed for his failure to cooperate.\n“And America does nothing to stop the weapons coming here!” Valeria exclaimed to me.\nWhile President Trump accuses Mexico of exporting violent crime and drugs to the United States, many Mexican officials as well as people like Valeria, who are on the ground in the fight against the drug wars, complain of a tide of violence and corruption that flows in the opposite direction. Some 70 percent of the firearms seized in Mexico between 2009 and 2014 originated in the United States. Although amounting to over 73,000 guns, these seizures still likely represented only a fraction of the weapons smuggled from the United States. Moreover, billions of dollars per year are made in the illegal retail drug market in the United States and smuggled back to Mexico, where the cartels depend on this money for their basic operations. Sometimes, sophisticated money–laundering schemes, such as trade–based deals, are used; but large parts of the proceeds are smuggled as bulk cash hidden in secret compartments and among goods in the cars and trains daily crossing the border south to Mexico.\nSome 70 percent of the firearms seized in Mexico between 2009 and 2014 originated in the United States.\nAnd of course it is the U.S. demand for drugs that fuels Mexican drug smuggling in the first place. Take, for example, the current heroin epidemic in the United States. It originated in the over–prescription of medical opiates to treat pain. The subsequent efforts to reduce the over–prescription of painkillers led those Americans who became dependent on them to resort to illegal heroin. That in turn stimulated a vast expansion of poppy cultivation in Mexico, particularly in Guerrero. In 2015, Mexico’s opium poppy cultivation reached perhaps 28,000 hectares, enough to distill about 70 tons of heroin (which is even more than the 24–50 tons estimated to be necessary to meet the U.S. demand).\nMexico’s large drug cartels, including El Chapo’s Sinaloa Cartel, which is estimated to supply between 40 and 60 percent of the cocaine and heroin sold on the streets in the United States, are the dominant wholesale suppliers of illegal drugs in the United States. For the retail trade, however, they usually recruit business partners among U.S. crime gangs. And thanks to the deterrence capacity of U.S. law enforcement, insofar as Mexican drug–trafficking groups do have in–country operations in the U.S., such as in wholesale supply, they have behaved strikingly peacefully and have not resorted to the vicious aggression and infighting that characterizes their business in Mexico. So the U.S. has been spared the drug–traffic–related explosions of violence that have ravaged so many of the drug–producing or smuggling areas of Mexico.\nBoth the George W. Bush administration and the Obama administration recognized the joint responsibility for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, an attitude that allowed for unprecedented collaborative efforts to fight crime and secure borders. This collaboration allowed U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agents to operate in Mexico and help their Mexican counterparts in intelligence development, training, vetting, establishment of police procedures and protocols, and interdiction operations. The collaboration also led to Mexico being far more willing than it ever had been before to patrol both its northern border with the United States and its southern border with Central America, as part of the effort to help apprehend undocumented workers trying to cross into the United States.\nThe Trump administration’s hostility to Mexico could jeopardize this progress. In retaliation for building the wall, for any efforts the U.S. might make to force Mexico to pay for the wall, or for the collapse of NAFTA, the Mexican government could, for example, give up on its efforts to secure its southern border or stop sharing counterterrorism intelligence with the United States. Yet Mexico’s cooperation is far more important for U.S. security than any wall.\nAlthough President Trump has railed against the “carnage” of crime in the United States, the crime statistics, with few exceptions, tell a very different story.\nIn 2014, 14,249 people were murdered, the lowest homicide rate since 1991 when there were 24,703, and part of a pattern of steady decline in violent crime over that entire period. In 2015, however, murders in the U.S. did shoot up to 15,696. This increase was largely driven by three cities—Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Baltimore and Chicago have decreasing populations, and all three have higher poverty and unemployment than the national average, high income and racial inequality, and troubled relations between residents and police—conditions conducive to a rise in violent crime. In 2016, homicides fell in Washington and Baltimore, but continued rising in Chicago.\nThere is no evidence, however, that undocumented residents accounted for either the rise in crime or even for a substantial number of the crimes, in Chicago or elsewhere. The vast majority of violent crimes, including murders, are committed by native–born Americans. Multiple criminological studies show that foreign–born individuals commit much lower levels of crime than do the native–born. In California, for example, where there is a large immigrant population, including of undocumented migrants, U.S.–born men were incarcerated at a rate 2.5 times higher than foreign–born men.\nUnfortunately, the Trump administration is promoting a policing approach that insists on prioritizing hunting down undocumented workers, including by using regular police forces, and this kind of misguided law enforcement policy is spreading: In Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million undocumented immigrants, Republican Governor Greg Abbott recently signed a law to punish sanctuary cities. Among the punishments are draconian measures (such as removal from office, fines, and up to one–year imprisonment) to be enacted against local police officials who do not embrace immigration enforcement. Abbott signed the law despite the fact that police chiefs from all five of Texas’s largest cities—Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth—published a statement condemning it: “This legislation is bad for Texas and will make our communities more dangerous for all,” they wrote in their Dallas Morning News op–ed. They argued that immigration enforcement is a federal, not a state responsibility, and that the new law would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities, discouraging cooperation with police on serious crimes, and resulting in widespread underreporting of crimes perpetrated against immigrants. There is powerful and consistent evidence that if people begin to question the fairness, equity, and legitimacy of law enforcement and government institutions, then they stop reporting crime, and homicides increase.\nPolice chiefs in other parts of the country, from Los Angeles to Denver, have expressed similar concerns and also their dismay at having to devote their already overstrained resources to hunting down undocumented workers.\nThe Trump administration has broadened the Obama–era criteria for “expedited removal.” Under Obama any immigrant arrested within 100 miles of the border who had been in the country for less than 14 days—i.e., before he or she could establish roots in the United States—could be deported without due process. The result: In fiscal year 2016, 85 percent of all removals (forced) and returns (voluntary) were of noncitizens who met those criteria. Almost all (more than 90 percent) of the remaining 15 percent had been convicted of serious crimes.\nNow, however, any undocumented person anywhere in the country who has been here for as long as two years can be removed. And although it claims it will focus on deporting immigrants who commit serious crimes, the Trump administration is gearing up for mass deportations of many of the 11.1 million undocumented residents in the U.S., by far the largest number of whom come from Mexico (6.2 million), Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador, and Colombia. To that end, it is vastly expanding the definition of what constitutes deportable crime, including fraud in any official matter, such as abuse of “any program related to the receipt of public benefits” or even using a fake Social Security number to pay U.S. taxes. The Trump administration is also reviving the highly controversial 287(g) program under which local law enforcement officials can be deputized to perform immigration duties and can inquire about a person’s immigration status during routine policing of matters as insignificant as jaywalking.\nMany of the people being targeted have for decades lived lawful, safe, and productive lives here. About 60 percent of the undocumented have lived in the United States for at least a decade. A third of undocumented immigrants aged 15 and older have at least one child who is a U.S. citizen by birth. The ripping apart of such families has tragic consequences for those involved, as I have seen first–hand.\n“Many of the people being targeted [for deportation] have for decades lived lawful, safe, and productive lives here.”\nAntonio, whom I interviewed in Tijuana in 2013, had lived for many years in Las Vegas, where he worked in construction and his wife cleaned hotels. Having had no encounters with U.S. law enforcement, he risked going back to Mexico to visit his ailing mother in Sinaloa. But he got nabbed trying to sneak back into the U.S. After a legal ordeal, which included being handcuffed and shackled and a degrading stay in a U.S. detention facility, he was dumped in Tijuana, where I met him shortly after his arrival there. He dreaded being forever separated from his wife and their two little boys, who had been born seven and five years before. But Sinaloa is a poor, tough place to live, strongly under the sway of the narcos, and Antonio did not want his loved ones to sacrifice themselves in order to rejoin him. As Antonio choked back tears talking about how much he missed his family, I asked him whether they might travel to San Diego to speak with him across the bars of Friendship Park. But Antonio wasn’t sure how long he could stay in Tijuana. He was afraid he would be arrested again, this time in Mexico, because in order to please U.S. law enforcement officials by appearing diligent in combating crime, Tijuana’s police force had gotten into the habit of arresting, for the most minor of infractions, Mexicans and Central Americans deported from the United States. Sweeping homeless poor migrants and deportees off the streets made Tijuana’s city center appear peaceful, bustling, and clean again, after years of a cartel bloodbath. Mexican businesses were pleased by the orderly look of the city center, the U.S. was gratified by Mexico’s cooperation, and tourists were returning, with U.S. college students again partying and getting drunk in Tijuana’s cantinas and clubs. If harmless victims of U.S. deportation policies like Antonio had to pay the price for these benefits, so be it.\nIf immigrants are not responsible for any significant amount of crime in the United States and in fact are considerably less likely than native–born citizens to commit crime, then what about the other justification for President Trump’s vilification of immigrants, legal and illegal, and his determination to wall them out: Do immigrants steal U.S. jobs and suppress U.S. wages?\nThere is little evidence to support such claims. According to a comprehensive National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine analysis, immigration does not significantly impact the overall employment levels of most native–born workers. The impact of immigrant labor on the wages of native–born workers is also low. Immigrant labor does have some negative effects on the employment and wages of native–born high school dropouts, however, and also on prior immigrants, because all three groups compete for low–skilled jobs and the newest immigrants are often willing to work for less than their competition. To a large extent, however, undocumented workers often work the unpleasant, back–breaking jobs that native–born workers are not willing to do. Sectors with large numbers of undocumented workers include agriculture, construction, manufacturing, hospitality services, and seafood processing. The fish–cutting industry, for example, is unable to recruit a sufficient number of legal workers and therefore is overwhelmingly dependent on an undocumented workforce. Skinning, deboning, and cutting fish is a smelly, slimy, grimy, chilly, monotonous, and exacting job. Many workers rapidly develop carpal tunnel syndrome. It can be a dangerous job, with machinery for cutting off fish heads and deboning knives everywhere frequently leading to amputated fingers. The risk of infections from cuts and the bloody water used to wash fish is also substantial. Over the past ten years, multiple exposés have revealed that both in the United States and abroad, workers in the fishing and seafood processing industries, often undocumented in other countries also, are subjected to forced labor conditions, and sometimes treated like slaves.\nWhile paying more than jobs she could obtain in Honduras, the fish cutting job was hard for 38–year–old Marta Escoto, profiled by Robin Shulman in a 2007 article in The Washington Post. But she put up with it for the sake of her two young children, one of them a four–year–old daughter who couldn’t walk and suffered from a gastrointestinal illness that prevented her from absorbing enough nutrition. Yet the fear of raids to which the Massachusetts fish–cutting industry was subjected a decade ago, in an earlier wave of anti–immigrant fervor, drove her to seek a job as a seamstress in a Massachusetts factory producing uniforms for U.S. soldiers. But misfortune struck there, too. Like the seafood processing plants, the New Bedford factory was raided by U.S. immigration officers; and although Marta had no criminal record, she was arrested and rapidly flown to a detention facility in Texas while her children were left alone in a day care center. Unlike many other immigrants swept up in those raids, Marta was ultimately lucky: She had a sister living in Massachusetts who could retrieve her children. And as a result of large political outcry in Massachusetts following those raids, with Senators John F. Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy strongly speaking out against them, Marta was released and could reunite with her two small children. But she remained without documents authorizing her to work and stay in the United States and would again be subject to deportation in the future.\nImmigrant workers are actually having a net positive effect on the economy. Because of a native–born population that is both declining in numbers and increasing in age, the U.S. needs its immigrant workers. The portion of foreign–born now accounts for about 16 percent of the labor force, with immigrants and their children accounting for the vast majority of current and future workforce growth in the United States, If the number of immigrants to the United States was reduced—by deportation or barriers to further immigration—so that foreign–born represented only about 10 percent of the population, the number of working–age Americans in the coming decades would remain essentially static at the current number of 175 million. If, however, the proportion of foreign–born remains at the current level, then the number of working–age residents in the U.S. will increase by about 30 million in the next 50 years. We need these workers not just to fill jobs but to increase productivity, which has diminished sharply. We also need them because the number of the elderly drawing expensive benefits like Medicare and Social Security—the costs of which are paid for by workers’ taxes—is growing substantially. Nearly 44 million people aged 65 or older currently draw Social Security; in 2050 that number is estimated to rise to 86 million. Even undocumented workers support Social Security: Since at least 1.8 million were working with fake Social Security cards in 2010 in order to get employment but were mostly unable to draw the benefits, they contributed $13 billion that year into the retirement trust fund, and took out only $1 billion.\nIf immigrants are not stealing U.S. jobs and suppressing wages to any significant extent, is NAFTA doing so? Sal Moceri, a 61–year–old Ford worker in Michigan, fervently believes so. He has not lost his job himself, but he saw his co–workers and neighbors lose jobs and sees new workers accepting lower wages for which he would not settle. Although he calls himself a “lifelong Democrat,” he voted for Trump in 2016 because of Trump’s promise to renegotiate or end NAFTA. In a CNNMoney interview with Heather Long, he blamed NAFTA for the job losses and decreases in wages around him, disbelieving the claims of economists that automation, not NAFTA, is the source of the job losses in U.S. manufacturing. He loves automation and hates NAFTA.\nBut contrary to Trump’s claim and Moceri’s passionate belief, NAFTA has not siphoned off a large number of U.S. jobs. It did force some U.S. workers to find other kinds of work, but the net number of jobs that was lost is relatively small, with estimates varying between 116,400 and 851,700, out of 146,135,000 jobs in the U.S. economy. Countering these losses is the fact that the bilateral trade fostered by NAFTA has had far–reaching positive effects on the economy.\nThe trade agreement eliminated tariffs on half of the industrial goods exported to Mexico from the United States (tariffs which before NAFTA averaged 10 percent), and eliminated other Mexican protectionist measures as well, allowing, for example, the export of corn from the United States to Mexico.\nNAFTA has enabled the development of joint production lines between the United States and Mexico and allows the U.S. to more cheaply import components used for manufacturing in the United States. Without this kind of co–operation, many jobs would be lost, including jobs provided by cars imported from Mexico. In 2016, for example, the United States imported 1.6 million cars from Mexico—but about 40 percent of the value of their components was produced in the United States. Leaving NAFTA could jeopardize 31,000 jobs in the automotive industry in the United States alone. But now that it is threatened with the collapse or renegotiation of NAFTA, Mexico has already begun actively exploring new trade partnerships with Europe and China.\nThe big picture: Mexico is the third largest U.S. trade partner after China and Canada, and the third–largest supplier of U.S. imports. Some 79 percent of Mexico’s total exports in 2013 went to the United States. Yes, the United States had a $64.3 billion deficit with Mexico in 2016, but trade with Mexico is a two–way street. The United States exports more to Mexico than to any other country except Canada, its other NAFTA partner. Moreover, the half trillion dollars in goods and services traded between Mexico and the United States each year since NAFTA was enacted over 23 years ago has resulted in millions of jobs for workers in both countries. According to a Woodrow Wilson Center study, nearly five million U.S. jobs now depend on trade with Mexico.\nTrade, investment, joint production, and travel across the U.S.–Mexico border remain a way of life for border communities, including those in the United States. Disrupting them will create substantial economic costs for both countries. And a significantly weakened Mexican economy will also exacerbate Mexico’s severe criminal violence and encourage violence–driven immigration to the United States.\nIf erected, Trump’s wall will not be the first significant barrier to be built on the border. That distinction goes to the 700–mile fence the U.S. began to put up—over protests from those on both sides of the border—some years ago.\nThese people include 26 federally–recognized Native American Nations in the U.S. and eight Indigenous Peoples in Mexico. The border on which the wall is to be built cuts through their tribal homelands and separates tribal members from their relatives and their sacred sites, while also sundering them from the natural environment which is crucial not just to their livelihoods but to their cultural and religious identity. In recognition of this problem, the U.S. Congress passed an act in 1983 allowing free travel across the borders within their homelands to one of the Native American Nations tribes. But when the fence was built, by waiving statutes like the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1994, Congress compromised that freedom of travel and made it hard for indigenous people to visit their family members and sacred sites.\nTrump’s wall will, of course, exacerbate the damage to these Native American communities, causing great pain and anger among the inhabitants. “If someone came into your house and built a wall in your living room, tell me, how would you feel about that?” asked Verlon Jose, vice chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation, in an interview by The New York Times’ Fernanda Santos in February 2017. Stretching out his arms to embrace the saguaro desert around him, he said, “This is our home.” Many in his tribe want to resist the construction of the wall. Others fear that if the border barrier is weaker on the tribal land, drug smuggling will be funneled there as happened before with the fence, harming and ensnarling the community.\nAs Native American communities, conservation biologists, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all have highlighted, the wall will also have significant environmental costs in areas that host some of the greatest biodiversity in North America. Deriving its name from the isolated mountain ranges whose 10,000–foot peaks thrust into the skies, the “Sky Islands” region spanning southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northwestern Mexico, for example, features a staggering array of flora and fauna. Its precious, but fragile, biodiversity is due to the unusual convergence of four major ecoregions: the southern terminus of the temperate Rocky Mountains; the eastern extent of the low–elevation Sonoran Desert; the northern edge of the subtropical Sierra Madre Occidental; and the western terminus of the higher–elevation Chihuahuan Desert. Among the endangered species that will be affected by the wall are the jaguar, Sonoran pronghorn, Chiricahua leopard frog, lesser long–nose bat, Cactus ferruginous pygmy–owl, Mexican gray wolf, black–tailed prairie dog, jaguarondi, ocelot, and American bison. Other negatively–affected species will include desert tortoise, black bear, desert mule deer, and a variety of snakes. Even species that can fly, such as Rufous hummingbirds and Swainson and Gray hawks could be harmed, and vital insect pollinators that migrate across the border could be burnt up by the lights necessary to illuminate the wall.\nAltogether, more than 100 species of animals that occur along the U.S.–Mexico border, in the Sky Islands area as well as in the Big Bend National Park in Texas and in the Rio Grande Valley, are endangered or threatened. But just as the DHS waived numerous cultural protection statutes to build the fence, it also overrode many crucial environmental laws—including the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, and the Clean Water Act of 1972. The Trump administration wants to bulldoze through any remaining environmental considerations.\nThe administration’s approach threatens years of binational environmental border cooperation that has protected not only many wild species, but also agriculture on both sides of the border. Take the boll weevil, a beetle that flies between Mexico and the United States and devastates cotton crops. In the late 1890s, the boll weevil nearly wiped out the U.S. cotton industry. Since then, the United States and Mexico have spent decades trying to eradicate the pest and almost succeeded. But the wall may so sour U.S.–Mexico environmental and security cooperation that Mexico may simply give up on eradication efforts. This will cause little damage to those in Mexico, since there is little cotton cultivation along that part of the Mexican border, but it will result in significant damage to U.S. farmers.\nA poisoned U.S.–Mexican relationship could also prevent the renegotiation of water sharing agreements that are critical to the environment as well as to water and food security, and to farming. For example, the 1970 Boundary Treaty between the United States and Mexico specifies that officials from both the U.S. and Mexico must agree if either side wants to build any structure that could affect the flow of the Rio Grande or its flood waters, water that is vital to livestock and agriculture along the border. The fence was built despite Mexico’s objections to it, and because its steel slats become clogged with debris during the rainy season, it has caused floods affecting cities and previously protected areas on both sides of the border, resulting in millions of dollars in damages.\nIt wasn’t just Mexico that didn’t want that fence. U.S. farmers and businessmen along the Texas border in the Rio Grande valley opposed it, too, since it blocks their access to the river water and also augments the severity of floods. Now the wall is to be brought to flood plain areas in Texas where water issues precisely like these had prevented the construction of the fence before.\nMeanwhile, manufacturing, agriculture, hydraulic fracking, energy production, and ecosystems on both sides of the border depend on equitable and effective water sharing from the Rio Grande and the Colorado River, with both sides vulnerable to water scarcities. Over the decades there have been many challenges to the joint agreements governing water usage, and both Mexico and the U.S. have at times considered themselves the aggrieved parties. But in general, U.S.–Mexico cooperation over both the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers has been exceptional by international standards and has been hugely beneficial to both partners to the various treaties. That kind of co–operation is now at risk.\nU.S.–Mexico cooperation over both the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers has been exceptional by international standards and has been hugely beneficial to both partners\nIf in retaliation for the Trump administration’s vitriolic, anti–Mexican language and policies, Mexico decided not live up to its side of the water bargain, U.S. farmers and others along the Rio Grande would be under severe threat of losing their livelihoods. One of them is Dale Murden in Monte Alto, who on his 20,000–acre farm cultivates sugarcane, grapefruit, cotton, citrus, and grain. Named in January 2017 the Citrus King of Texas, the former Texas Farm Bureau state director has dedicated his life to agriculture in southern Texas, relying on a Latino workforce. Yet he has memories of devastating water shortages in 2011 and 2013, when because of a severe drought Mexico could not send its allocation of the Rio Conches to the United States and 30 percent of his land became unproductive, with many crops dying. At that time he hoped that the U.S. State Department could persuade Mexico to release some water, even as Mexican farmers were also facing immense water shortages and devastation. U.S. diplomacy did work, no doubt helped by the rain that replenished Mexico’s tributaries of the Rio Grande. Without the rain, Mexico would not have been able to pay back its accumulated water debt. But without collaborative U.S.–Mexico diplomacy and an atmosphere of a closer–than–ever U.S.–Mexico cooperation, Mexico still could have failed to deliver the water despite the rain. That positive spirit of cooperation also produced one of the world’s most enlightened, environmentally–sensitive, and water–use–savvy version of a water treaty, the so–called Minute 319 of the 1944 Colorado River U.S.–Mexico water agreement. Unique in its recognition of the Colorado River delta as a water user, the update committed the United States to sending a so–called “pulse flow” to that ecosystem, thus helping to restore those unique wetlands. The United States also agreed to pay $18 million for water conservation in Mexico. In turn, Mexico delivered 124,000 acre–feet of Mexican water to Lake Mead. It was a win–win–win: for U.S. farmers, Mexican farmers, and ecosystems. But those were the good days of the U.S.–Mexico relationship, before the Trump administration. A new update to the treaty is under negotiation—once again a vital agreement and a lifeline for some 40 million people on both sides of the border that could fall prey to the Trump administration’s approach to Mexico.\nYet this is a moment when maintaining cooperation is crucial because climate–change–increased evaporation rates, invasive plant infestation, and greater demands for water around the border and deep into U.S. and Mexican territories will only put further pressure on water use and increase the likelihood of severe scarcity.\nRather than a line of separation, the border should be conceived of as a membrane, connecting the tissues of communities on both sides, enabling mutually beneficial trade, manufacturing, ecosystem improvements, and security, while enhancing inter–cultural exchanges.\nIn 1971, When First Lady Pat Nixon attended the inauguration of Friendship Park—that tragic place that allows separated families only the most limited amount of contact—she said, “I hope there won’t be a fence here too long.” She supported two–way positive exchanges between the United States and Mexico, not barriers. In fact, for her visit, she had the fence in Friendship Park torn down. Unfortunately, it’s still there, bigger, taller, and harder than when she visited, and with the wall about to get much worse yet.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        10 Questions about the Border Wall that Deserve Big, Beautiful Answers\nPresident Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has raised a lot of questions since he began talking about it at campaign rallies nearly two years ago – and this week, the American people will finally have a chance to get some answers. Here are ten questions that we’ll be watching for and that we would like to see answered:\nPresident Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has raised a lot of questions since he began talking about it at campaign rallies nearly two years ago – and this week, the American people will finally have a chance to get some answers.\nThis morning, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on “Fencing Along the Southwest Border.” The witnesses at this hearing are former – not current – officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. (Word is the administration wouldn’t send anyone to talk about the president’s signature policy.) In any event, Tuesday’s witnesses are in a great position to provide answers about previous efforts to secure the border – and the major, very expensive problems past projects have run into.\nOn Wednesday, the same committee will question the current Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, on the topic of “Improving Border Security and Public Safety.” This hearing is going to cover a broad range of topics, but given the emphasis that the White House has placed on building the wall – and the impending deadline for contractors to submit wall proposals for consideration – Secretary Kelly can and should be answering questions about the wall. Secretary Kelly’s willingness to answer questions will speak volumes about the administration’s commitment to transparency and oversight.\nPresident Trump has said that the wall will be built ahead of schedule and under budget. He has promised that it will be big and beautiful. He has pledged to get personally involved in the contracting process, and at various times, he has famously claimed that Mexico would pay the wall.\nIt’s not clear to what extent we are supposed to take the president literally in his statements, but it is painfully clear how much we still don’t know about this whole project. We do know that if the wall goes ahead as currently proposed, the project is likely to be wasteful, artificially constrained by a budget that seeks to cut corners, harmful to landowners, devastating to ecosystems from the Gulf of Mexico to California, and riddled with corruption – and that’s the best case scenario.\nAmerican Oversight launched Audit the Wall last month to conduct a full investigation into the border wall project, its impact, and the potential for fraud and conflicts of interest. We will be monitoring the Senate hearings this week, and you can follow along with us on Twitter at @WeAreOversight.\nHere are ten questions that we’ll be watching for and that we would like to see answered:\n- How much should we take President Trump at his word? Is he going to get personally involved in the contract negotiations, and if so, how will the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guard against favoritism and corruption in the procurement process? What steps is DHS taking to ensure that bidders with ties to the president or the administration do not have an unfair advantage?\n- What has the government learned from previous border fence efforts – including the failed SBInet project that was canceled after taxpayers spent $1 billion on 53 miles of virtual wall? How effective have previous fence projects been in reducing illegal immigration?\n- Where is the wall going to be located, and is it even going to be a wall? As Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke pointed out last month, there are many logistical obstacles to building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, including the fact that more than 1,200 miles of that border runs through the middle of the Rio Grande River. The president has insisted that there will be a wall – but how much of the border will actually be walled and how much will be protected using other methods such as surveillance?\n- What is the schedule for moving forward with the wall and how much is that schedule being driven by political influence? The deadline to submit proposals to build the wall has been pushed back repeatedly. Why has that deadline shifted, and has the current schedule for the wall project been determined based on political or practical considerations?\n- How many property owners are going to be affected by the wall construction? We know the government intends to seize private land through the use of eminent domain, but we don’t yet know how many landowners – or tenants – will be affected. And if some sections of the wall are built north of the actual border, will some Americans be living in a “no man’s land” on the Mexican side of the wall?\n- Will the wall bisect the Tohono O’odham Nation in spite of opposition from the tribe? The Tohono O’odham Nation is a Native American tribe whose land runs from Arizona south into Mexico. Has DHS or the White House been in contact with the tribe to discuss the wall proposal? And if the tribe objects, how does the administration plan to move ahead with the wall?\n- What is the wall actually going to cost? The White House suggests it will cost approximately $12 billion, a DHS report indicates it will cost over $20 billion, and a Senate report says it could cost over $66 billion.\n- How is the administration planning to fund the wall? If Congress does not appropriate funds for the wall in the government spending bill later this month, how will the next stage of the project be funded? Will general appropriations be diverted to build the wall? And what is the plan for securing funding long term?\n- Is the wall project legal under current law? The Executive Order instructing the Secretary of Homeland Security to begin construction on the wall cited the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Does that statute actually provide legal authority to build the border wall that President Trump has proposed?\n- What commitments to transparency is the administration willing to make? During the Recovery Act initiative in 2009, the Government Accountability Office essentially audited the projects in real time, and the administration created a website where the public could easily track spending. Will the administration make any commitments to releasing information about bidders, proposals, or other negotiations?\nTo date, the administration has provided no clear answers on funding, design, or schedule for the wall – only assurances that it is going to be built. In the absence of more information, we see a strong likelihood for corruption, misconduct, and waste. American Oversight is committed to getting answers, and we hope that the Senate hearings this week are a step forward for transparency and accountability.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

The $855 million request over two years would allow the state’s public universities to shed their ranking of 43rd of 50 states in public funding and reach the national median.\n“It’s time Wisconsin escapes the Bottom 10 in public funding and gets Up to the Middle,” said UWs President Jay Rothman. “This budget request will spur innovation in research and teaching, make a degree more affordable for our students most in need, develop talent by focusing on student success, preserve accessibility, and ensure quality.”\nRothman told Regents that under this proposal, he would not recommend tuition increases over the period covered by the biennial budget.\n“One thing seems very clear: An investment in the Universities of Wisconsin is an investment in Wisconsin,” Rothman said. “The Universities of Wisconsin will be serving the state for generations to come, and the investments we make now will carry through far into the future. The investments we fail to make will also have consequences that will be generational.”\n- See the 19 news release, “Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman introduces budget request to get Wisconsin ‘Up to the Middle’”\n- See the 2025-27 Biennial Budget Recommendations PowerPoint (PDF)\nAmong the key features of the proposed budget:\n- Emphasizes talent development through student success services.\n- Extends the Wisconsin Tuition Promise to students from families earning up to $71,000 in adjusted gross income.\n- Proposes 5 percent and 3 percent general wage increases for staff and faculty, and requests the state fully fund the increases while adding a merit and market pool.\n- Invests in innovation, including creation of a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hub.\n- Preserves accessibility while covering inflationary cost increases.\nIn presenting the budget proposal to the full Board, Regent Ashok Rai noted that the share of the UW budget funded by the state has dropped to 18%, forcing the universities to become more dependent on tuition revenue to fund operations.\nA key provision to address affordability is the renewed call for support of the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a targeted “last dollar” approach to help lower- and middle-income families access higher education by covering the remaining costs of tuition and fees after all other sources of aid have been first applied. “This is a strategy with proven results that increases enrollment and produces more graduates to the workforce,” Rai said.\nThe budget proposal also requests support for several initiatives that address student success, including mental health services, academic and career advising, and civil dialogue training. To ensure continued quality, Rai said the proposal calls for providing compensation for faculty and staff that keeps pace with inflation and prevents salaries and wages from falling further behind peers. The proposal targets general wage adjustments of 5% and 3% for the two years of the biennium.\nTo keep Wisconsin at the forefront in industries that are traditional strengths – like dairy and freshwater – Rai said the budget proposal includes a request for investments in innovation. “A major investment in artificial intelligence is designed to do what the Universities of Wisconsin do best – prepare our students and our citizens, and partner with our business community, for success in a changing world.”\n“This is a way forward for the state of Wisconsin,” Rai said. “I really do believe this is the appropriate time for this ask.”\nRegent Karen Walsh said she especially appreciates the alignment of the budget request with the strategic plan.\nThe now-approved budget will be submitted to the Department of Administration in September.\nCapital Budget request approved\nThe Regents also unanimously approved a proposed 2025-27 Capital Budget Request of $1,760,804,000. The proposed Capital Plan reflects the core values of the Universities of Wisconsin by ensuring that projects include measures such as innovation (by promoting flexibility and adapting to changing conditions), sustainability (ensuring fiscally prudent and environmentally friendly projects), and accountability (ensuring that universities implement projects in a timely fashion within established budgets).\n- See the 2025-31 Capital Plan Overview PowerPoint (PDF)\nKey strategic elements of the Capital Budget recommendations include:\n- Repairing Aging Facilities – The highest priority programs are designed to repair or renovate aging facilities and infrastructure, thereby reducing deferred maintenance backlogs. A recommended $260 million is proposed to address high priority needs in existing facilities ensuring their viability for the foreseeable future. These projects offset increasing operational costs due to the labor-intensive need to continually maintain the facilities to keep them functioning.\n- Replacing Obsolete Facilities – $467 million is requested to construct new facilities to replace existing ones that cannot be renovated cost-effectively to meet academic or program needs. Simultaneously, due to the enumeration of a Multi-Building Demolition project earlier this year, universities currently are on track to remove at least 12 facilities over the course of the next year.\n- Expanding STEM and Health Sciences Education – Requests for state funding focus on providing high-quality, up to date facilities that support workforce needs, attract, and retain Wisconsin students, and expand highly sought-after STEM and health sciences education.\nThe Department of Administration, Division of Facilities Development and Management receives budget requests from all state agencies and makes a single recommendation to the State of Wisconsin Building Commission. The Building Commission then makes a recommendation to the Legislature through the biennial budget process.\nRegent President’s Report\nIn her first meeting as President of the Board, Amy B. Bogost told Regents she appreciates the trust they invested in her, adding that collectively they all value education and understand it is the foundation on which the state is built.\n“My motivation is to ensure we as a board do everything within our power to support our fantastic leader, President Jay Rothman, and his strategic plan,” Bogost said, noting Regents’ shared commitment to the state and their fiduciary duty. “We also know the importance of working with the legislature in being accountable to the people of Wisconsin.”\nBogost said that she and her Regent colleagues have all witnessed the transformative power of higher education. She noted their commitment to work collaboratively and diligently with determination and purpose. She thanked her colleagues for their “trust and support and for being part of this incredible journey.”\nBogost then highlighted several significant accomplishments from around the Universities of Wisconsin. She told Regents that UW-Stout’s Co-op & Internship Program will be presented with the AASCU Excellence & Innovation 2024 Stewards of Place award. The award recognizes an institution that demonstrates how it is navigating important trends in postsecondary education including equity and upward mobility, resources and resiliency, regional prosperity, and civic health. The Co-op & Internship Program, which uses applied experiential learning to support students’ intentional career development, has grown from 8 students in 1982 to more than 1,000 currently, with more than 750 companies impacted. Chancellor Katherine Frank will accept the award at AASCU’s November meeting.\nBogost also told Regents that the Institute for Business & Entrepreneurship – a division of the Universities of Wisconsin – and its Center for Technology Commercialization hosted this year’s Wisconsin stop on the America’s Seed Fund 2024 Road Tour. The national tour connects entrepreneurs working on advanced technology to the country’s largest sources o early-stage funding. More than 250 Wisconsin-based innovators, scientists, and researchers attended. America’s Seed Fund provides over $4 billion in early-stage funding to small businesses each year in a wide variety of technology areas such as unmanned systems, advanced materials, health, cybersecurity, and defense. Decisions on whether funding will be coming Wisconsin’s way should be announced within the next 12-18 months.\nReport of the UWs President\nPresident Rothman opened his report with a brief video, featuring a sampling of interviews with new UWs parents. The “Welcome to Opportunity” project, which is visiting all 13 universities during either orientation days or move-in days, will be airing on the UWs’ social media reels in coming weeks.\n“It’s a reminder that going to college is something of great value to many, many people,” Rothman said, noting that the pride and excitement is palpable. He added that several recent reports – including studies by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce as well as the Wisconsin Policy Forum – provide compelling data showing the forecasted strong link between college degrees and higher-paying jobs in both Wisconsin and nationally in years ahead.\n“In the UWs, we’re not only preparing students to meet the workforce demands of today, but we’re preparing them to thrive in careers that do not yet exist,” Rothman said.\nIn a follow-up to an earlier update on FAFSA, Rothman told Regents that according to the most recent data from the National College Attainment Network FAFSA Tracker, Wisconsin FAFSA completions remain 9.7% lower compared to the last academic year. This is slightly better than the national trend of 9.9% lower compared to the prior year. He acknowledged and thanked UWs’ financial aid officers for their diligence and commitment under trying circumstances to extending flexibility and reaching out to students directly to offer help in finding solutions.\nTurning to Title IX, Rothman noted the UWs continue to monitor litigation involving new Title IX regulations nationally. Due to the federal injunction in Kansas v. United States Department of Education, the UWs have suspended permanent and emergency rulemaking regarding Title IX at this time – but remain ready to publish the rule and policies should the injunction be lifted.\nRothman then reported on his recent testimony before the Legislature’s Study Committee on the Future of the University of Wisconsin System. This was the second of several hearings the committee is expected to hold through the summer and early fall as it works toward developing recommendations that will be forwarded to the legislature. He reported that he discussed the UWs strategic plan as well as some of the challenges faced in the broader higher education landscape and some challenges unique to Wisconsin. He specifically called out the fact that Wisconsin is currently ranked 43rd out of 50 states in public funding support for its four-year universities.\nFinally, as part of regular updates on progress with the strategic plan, Rothman highlighted recent developments in the Direct Admit Wisconsin program, an important new initiative to help enroll more students in the Universities of Wisconsin. In Fall 2025, the first Direct Admit students will arrive at one of the 10 participating UW campuses. At this time, approximately 330 high schools are served by the program – about 53% of public high schools in the state, or 42% of high schools overall. Nearly 75% of all high school seniors attend these high schools and have the potential to be impacted by Direct Admit Wisconsin.\nRothman added that the first Direct Admit Wisconsin offers of admission started going out the week of July 29 and will continue to roll out through early October. As of earlier this week, more than 21,400 offers of admission have already been sent. “We are hopeful that Direct Admit Wisconsin helps more students recognize they are college material and there is a place for them at a UW university,” he said.\nHe also noted that the Direct Admit offers also included the news that students who come from families with an adjusted gross income of $55,000 or less will qualify for having their tuition and fees covered through the Wisconsin Tuition Promise (see the Aug. 2, 2024, news release). Rothman said the 2025 Wisconsin Tuition Promise is made possible by a donation by Ascendium Education Group, a Madison-based non-profit organization. He said the UWs’ biennial budget request asks the legislature to support and extend this initiative.\nNew and departing colleagues recognized\nThe Regents welcomed James Beeby, the 11th Chancellor of UW-La Crosse. Beeby started on July 1 and comes to the UWs from Keene State College in New Hampshire.\n“I am delighted to be working with all of you and advancing our mission, supporting our students, and creating knowledge,” Beeby said.\nThe Board also presented a resolution of appreciation to Regent Emeritus Dana Wachs, whose time on the Board ended in March 2024.\nCalling it an honor to have been a Regent, Wachs urged Board members to continue to “fight for this university.” Wachs, who previously represented the 91st Assembly District in the Wisconsin State Assembly, added: “We need to include people, not exclude. We need to love people, bring them in, educate them. Higher education is the great equalizer. We need to move the needle to fairness. We need to move the needle to justice, toward equity.”\nThe Regents then presented a resolution of appreciation to UW-River Falls Chancellor Maria Gallo, who is retiring.\nUnder Gallo’s leadership, the campus implemented its “Soaring to New Heights” strategic plan focusing on Success, Belonging, Sustainability, and Vitality – aligned with UW-River Falls’ mission, renewed mission, and newly adopted core values.\n“I’ve often thought, what would River Falls be without this university that has been here for 150 years, educating thousands of students and served by dedicated faculty and staff who are committed to giving students their best opportunity for success, not only in their studies but in life,” said Gallo, who’s been at UW-River Falls since 2021. “I am privileged to work with amazing people who share the same passion for higher ed as I do.”\nFinally, the board presented a resolution of appreciation to Sean Nelson, Vice President of Finance & Administration. Nelson is retiring after seven years with the Universities of Wisconsin.\nNelson saluted his colleagues, in UWs Administration, on campuses, and on the Board, for their unwavering commitment to students. “It really doesn’t matter your political persuasion; students are the focus,” he said.\nHe also noted pride in his team, who are always “competent, collegial, and collaborative … in service to the campuses.” And he thanked President Rothman for his leadership.\nBusiness & Finance Committee\nThe Business & Finance Committee received the Cost-Benefit Analysis of Foundations and Associated Affiliated Organizations Report for fiscal year 2022-23. The report notes that 77 foundations and affiliated organizations supported the missions of the Universities of Wisconsin during that period. The universities received a total of over $402 million from primary fundraising foundations – an increase of over $20 million from the previous year – while providing $11.3 million in administrative support to these organizations.\nIn other business, the Business & Finance Committee:\n- Approved the 2025-27 biennial operating budget request, which was then forwarded to the full Board for consideration;\n- Approved the Status Report on Large or High-Risk Information Technology Projects. The report includes nine major IT projects within the system, including two projects completed since the last report in February, and one new project at UW-Parkside. For other projects still in progress, the report offers updates on their schedule, scope, and budget. The total project portfolio is $246.5 million, a 5.2% decrease compared to the February report;\n- Approved an agreement with CDWG for the purchase of equipment related to the UW-Parkside IT project noted above. This Network Equipment Refresh project will replace the aging wired and wireless campus network to improve capacity and security. The project budget is $3.4 million and is expected to be fully completed in June 2026;\n- Approved UW-Milwaukee’s graduate application fee of $75. While this fee has been in place since 2018, UWM is asking the Board for its explicit approval to ensure their compliance with Regent policy. The $75 rate is consistent with the graduate application fee at UW-Madison and other Research 1 institutions;\n- Approved an extension of UW-Milwaukee’s agreement with Collegiate Licensing Company, a licensing agency with whom UWM has contracted since 2015. This agreement, which has generated over $970,000 in revenue to UWM, will be extended through June 2026;\n- Approved the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between UW System and the Building and Construction Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin. The parties negotiated for a 4.12% increase in base wages, effective June 30, 2024 through June 30, 2025, at a total annualized cost of $448,000. The terms of the contract are consistent with those between BTC and the Department of Administration. The Committee also approved the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between UW-Madison and the Trades Council, under the same terms;\n- Received the year-end Budget-to-Actuals Report, which reflects the status of the Universities of Wisconsin FY ‘24 budget by major area of activity in comparison to actual financial experience for that year. The report provides this information for each individual university, but in aggregate, revenues exceeded the budget by 6.9% due largely to charitable giving, research grants, and interest earnings, while expenses exceeded the budget by 4.1%, with the largest variance in the category of salaries and fringe benefits. Total revenues exceeded total expenses by over $200 million; and\n- Received a report on gifts, grants, and contracts awarded to the Universities of Wisconsin in fiscal year ’24. Total awards were approximately $2.2 billion, a 2.1% decrease from the previous year, when several large federal research awards were reported. As a result, federal awards were 11% less than in fiscal year ’23, while non-federal awards increased by $106 million (or 12.0%).\nEducation Committee\nThe Education Committee approved UW-Milwaukee’s proposal to discontinue a program, specifically the College of General Studies (CGS) and its three academic departments. This proposed program discontinuance, resulting from the closure of UWM’s Washington County and Waukesha locations, would result in faculty layoffs at the CGS and has been advanced per Regent Policy Document (RPD) 20-24, “Procedures Relating to Financial Emergency or Program Discontinuance Requiring Faculty Layoff or Termination.”\nIn planning for and implementing those closures, UWM determined that the declining enrollments and existing market demand cannot sustain the CGS and its academic departments. Among other supporting documents, a letter from Chancellor Mark Mone explains the proposal process and rationale for the decision in detail, including how UWM considered alternatives and provided opportunities for input and feedback. UWM has been working closely with the Higher Learning Commission, its accrediting body, on teach-out plans and other support for current CGS students.\nIn other business, the Education Committee:\n- Approved UW-Milwaukee’s request for a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science. Elevating a successful existing Computer Science concentration within the Ph.D. in Engineering, the program will increase visibility to prospective students and external stakeholders, reduce data collection burdens, and increase flexibility. Strong interest in the existing concentration, and a 23% projected job growth for occupations where a computer science doctoral degree is needed over the next 10 years demonstrate demand for a stand-alone Ph.D.;\n- Approved UW-Stout’s request for a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Game and Media Studies (BSGMS). The program will leverage UW-Stout’s existing strengths in game design and the digital humanities to prepare students for careers with intersections among communication, digital media, management, and user research, such as design project management specialists and quality assurance analysts;\n- Approved UW-Superior’s request for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). Joining the BSN@Home UW Collaborative program, it will be a 2-year program for Registered Nurses (RNs) who hold an associate degree in nursing and wish to advance their education to the bachelor’s level. The areas of focus (rural health, public health, and indigenous health) that UW-Superior will contribute to the Collaborative program reflect regional nursing needs as well as interest from nurses in other geographic areas in Wisconsin. Essentia Health projects a 5-year gap of over 1,000 registered nursing positions in the northern Wisconsin and Minnesota regions, of which over 50% are expected to require a B.S.N. degree or higher;\n- Approved UW Oshkosh’s academic unit realignment proposal with an official effective date of July 1, 2025. The realignment has financial benefits, with immediate savings from the consolidation of administrative work. The realignment does not affect the program array offered by UWO. The university will realign its four existing colleges into three new colleges and six new schools. The existing College of Business, College of Nursing, College of Education and Human Services, and College of Letters and Science will be reorganized into three colleges each containing two schools:\n- College of Business, Arts, and Communication comprised of the School of Business and the School of Media, Arts, and Communication;\n- College of Public Affairs and Education comprised of the School of Public Affairs and Global Engagement and the School of Education and Human Services; and,\n- College of Nursing, Health Professions, and STEM comprised of the School of Nursing and Health Professions and the School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics;\n- Approved amendments to Regent Policy Document 1-1, “Mission Statements,” which codifies the shared mission of the UW System and its universities, and the core missions of the doctoral cluster and the comprehensive university cluster of institutions within the system. The approved amendments, presented by UW-Stout Chancellor Katherine Frank and Provost Glendalí Rodríguez, create a new core mission statement for a third polytechnic university category, which would include UW-Stout as its only member. The revision helps stakeholders, including prospective students, to better understand the unique educational experience provided by UW-Stout; and\n- Heard an update on Direct Admit Wisconsin implementation. This is the first phase in implementing a direct admission initiative, which aims to increase access and simplify the admission process for Wisconsin high school students. This presentation shared the number of participating high schools, the process of notifying participating high school students of direct admission decisions, just-in-time direct admit data, engagement in national conversations about direct admission, as well as next steps.\nCapital Planning & Budget Committee\nThe Capital Planning & Budget Committee approved the 2025-27 Capital Budget recommendations, which align with the Universities of Wisconsin 2023-28 Strategic Plan through a commitment to stewardship of existing assets by addressing deferred maintenance; removing obsolete facilities; maintaining affordable, accessible, and high-quality educational environments for our students; and advancing Wisconsin’s workforce needs. The recommendation was then forwarded to the full Board for consideration.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee heard a presentation summarizing a risk treatment plan developed to assist the Universities of Wisconsin in mitigating high-level risks identified during Year 1 of the Risk, Compliance, and Audit (RCA) Pilot Program. The pilot was conducted during the FY 2023-24 academic year under which risk assessments were completed by five participating UW universities and the UWSA Risk and Compliance Council.\nOnce the high-level risks were identified the participating UW universities developed lists of existing treatments that were in place at the university-level to manage each risk. Universities also offered proposed treatments for the UW Administration to consider in managing the risks systemwide. The Risk and Compliance Council reviewed the list of proposed treatments and compared them with existing actions currently being undertaken at the system level. A final list was then drafted of treatments that are and/or could potentially mitigate each of the identified high-level risks to a reasonable level.\nIn other business, the Audit Committee:\n- Heard an Audit Plan Progress Report for Fiscal Year 2025; and\n- Heard a summary of results for audits recently issued.\nThe Board of Regents meeting will continue at 8 a.m., August 23, 2024, with a closed session at Van Hise Hall, Madison.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

Trump said he left to a \"standing ovation\" after speaking at the Family Leadership Council summit.\n\"When I left the room, it was a total standing ovation,\" said Trump. \"It was wonderful to see. Nobody was insulted.\"\nWhen speaking about McCain on Saturday, Trump said he likes \"people who weren't captured.\" He didn't back down when asked about the comment.\n\"People that fought hard and weren't captured and went through a lot, they get no credit,\" he said. \"Nobody even talks about them. They're like forgotten, and I think that's a shame, if you want to know the truth.\"\nBefore Trump's comments Saturday, McCain had said the real estate mogul was firing up \"crazies.\" Trump had already found himself embroiled in controversy over comments he made last month regarding Mexican immigrants.\nRaddatz asked Trump if McCain's capture in Vietnam -- where he spent five years as a prisoner of war and was beaten and tortured by the North Vietnamese -- described a war hero. He reiterated what his campaign said following his comments Saturday -- that he was disappointed in the Arizona senator because of how veterans are treated in the U.S.\n\"I'm very disappointed in John McCain because the vets are horribly treated in this country,\" said Trump. \"I'm fighting for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets.\"\nTrump said veterans were treated like \"third-class citizens,\" adding that McCain has \"done nothing to help the vets.\"\nTrump didn't serve in the Vietnam War after receiving four student deferments and an additional medical deferment after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 1968. He said he would have \"proudly served\" but wasn't drafted because of his high lottery number.\n\"If I would have gotten a low number, I would have been drafted. I would have proudly served,\" he said. \"But I got a number, I think it was 356. That’s right at the very end. And they didn't get -- I don’t believe -- past even 300, so I was -- I was not chosen because of the fact that I had a very high lottery number.\"\nAsked if he would continue his pattern of \"name-calling, using terms like 'dummy,' 'loser,' 'total losers' on Twitter and elsewhere\" when he's \"criticized or attacked\" if he was elected president, Trump told Raddatz he only gives it back to people who attack him.\n\"When people attack me, I let them have it back,\" he said. \"People are constantly attacking my hair. I don’t see you coming to my defense.\"\nTrump has come under criticism from numerous fellow 2016 candidates on both sides of aisle. Hillary Clinton called the attack on McCain \"shameful.\" Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the comments by Trump made him unfit to be president and said the reality TV star should withdraw from the race.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., went on the Senate floor last week to defend the University of Phoenix and excoriate the Defense Department for placing the country’s largest for-profit university on probation.\nIn his Oct. 28 floor speech, McCain singled out Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., for leading the charge against the university for its recruiting practices, disclosed by Reveal in June.\n“It’s being orchestrated and carried out by the senator from Illinois, who has a well-known record of not supporting the members of the men and women who are serving in the military,” McCain said.\nBut some veterans groups say McCain’s own record of supporting veterans is spotty, despite his national acclaim as a Vietnam War hero. McCain, a Navy fighter pilot, spent more than five years as a prisoner of war – a narrative that has propelled his long career in politics.\nIn 2008, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based group, gave McCain a “D” in its performance report card.\n“Now every American can find out who in Washington really supports Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and who is just full of hot air,” the group’s founder and CEO, Paul Rieckhoff, said at the time.\nMcCain’s grade reflected his votes – or lack of voting – on veterans issues, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the most comprehensive education benefit for veterans since World War II. It provides veterans who have served for at least three years since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks with free education at public colleges and universities for four years, as well as money for housing and books.\nMcCain was running for president at the time. He said he could not support the bill sponsored by Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., a fellow Vietnam veteran, because it was overly generous and would dissuade people from remaining in the military.\nHe and other Republicans offered their own version of the bill, which would have required longer military service before some key benefits could kick in.\nWebb’s bill passed 75-22, but McCain was a no-show for the Senate vote. Despite having his own reservations, President George W. Bush signed the legislation into law.\nMcCain’s office did not respond to questions about the 2008 GI Bill this week. Instead, a spokeswoman provided a long list of veterans groups that have honored and praised the senator.\n“Virtually every veterans organization in America has recognized and honored Senator McCain’s decades-long record of fighting for his fellow veterans, and it’s unfortunate that anyone would seek to disparage that extensive, clear record,” Julie Tarallo said in an email.\n“In the last year alone, Senator McCain has co-authored landmark legislation that made some of the most significant reforms to the VA in decades, and wrote an important bipartisan bill – now signed into law by President Obama – to reform and strengthen veterans suicide prevention programs at the Department of Defense and the VA.”\nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America issued McCain a “D” grade again in 2010, giving him low marks for his opposition to what has been dubbed GI Bill 2.0, which expanded the 2008 legislation to cover members of the National Guard and military reserves. It also expanded benefits to vocational and on-the-job training programs.\nDavid Lucier, president of the Arizona Veterans and Military Leadership Alliance, remembered being surprised by McCain’s lack of support for the two GI bills.\n“With him being a veteran and a POW – who’s been doing very, very well after his uniform service – he could have a little more empathy for other veterans,” said Lucier, a registered Democrat. “Everybody needs a good education and a good job so they can thrive.”\nHe characterized University of Phoenix recruiters as “hard-core car salesmen” who “were going to make a sale no matter what.”\nReveal’s investigation showed how the university paid the military for exclusive access to bases – violating the intent of an executive order by President Barack Obama – held recruitment events disguised as résumé workshops and handed out “challenge coins” engraved with military insignias, without the required permission.\nThis isn’t the first time McCain’s record on veterans has come under scrutiny. Amid the controversy over the GI Bill in 2008, PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking site run by the Tampa Bay Times, assessed the Arizona senator’s pronouncements that he had a “perfect voting record” from veterans service groups. PolitiFact rated his claim “false.”\nPolitiFact returned to McCain’s record in July after GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump asserted that McCain was not a war hero and later said that the senator had “done nothing to help the vets.” In that case, PolitiFact said Trump’s assertion was “false.”\n“While many veterans’ groups have had their differences with McCain over the years over specific legislation and his general approach to veterans’ issues, that’s not the same as saying he’s done ‘nothing’ for veterans,” the site reported.\nNevertheless, Christopher Neiweem, an Iraq War veteran and a former legislative associate for a veterans group, said the senator is doing a disservice to veterans now by defending the for-profit college.\nNeiweem said he once worked as a recruiter for DeVry University, another for-profit school, and was tasked with signing up fellow veterans.\n“Sen. McCain should be learning about for-profit issues from people who have worked in the industry, instead of defending the industry without doing substantive research into issues and problems that have been reported,” he said.\n“It concerns me that Sen. McCain has been ignoring the smoke signals that have been coming from this sector for years,” he said.\nJohn Murphy, one of the founders of the University of Phoenix, said that in the early years, the school encountered pushback from much of Arizona’s power elites, including McCain.\n“He would never meet with us. He wouldn’t have anything to do with us,” said Murphy, who handled government affairs and accreditation for the school.\n“McCain was hostile to the University of Phoenix for years, so I find it interesting now that he’s defending them,” he said. “I’m not sure where that came from. The politics has changed obviously. I don’t know at what point he changed his opinion and why.”\nMurphy left the university in 1997, he said, because of philosophical disagreements over the direction of the school, including its increased push for federal funds through recruiting veterans and military personnel. McCain’s spokeswoman declined to respond to Murphy’s recollections.\nIt’s not unusual, of course, for elected officials to aid businesses within their communities, particularly while wooing constituents in an election year. Currently McCain is campaigning for a sixth term in the U.S. Senate.\nAt least two fellow Republicans have launched bids to oust him, including state Sen. Kelli Ward and Tea Party member Alex Meluskey.\nWith a full year before the 2016 election, it’s unclear what role the University of Phoenix or its parent company, Apollo Education Group, will play in the contest.\nSo far, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff is the only Democrat to have announced a bid for his seat and has already won her party’s endorsement. In 2014, she received $7,700 from donors associated with the University of Phoenix, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\nOver the years, according to the center’s data, McCain has received $8,725 from Apollo and its employees, including $5,000 in 2004 and $2,000 in 2010 – both coinciding with McCain’s previous re-election campaigns.\nSince 1990, the college and its employees together have contributed nearly $270,000 to federal political campaigns. Apollo and associated individuals have donated more than $3.7 million during that same time period.\nWith its fortunes falling (Apollo’s stock prices have plunged drastically) and its business model of relying on federal education funds now under intense scrutiny, the company has ramped up its political activities and lobbying.\nAs scrutiny has intensified, so has the group’s advocacy for itself in the nation’s capital. So far this year, Apollo has spent more than $1 million on lobbying efforts in Washington. Since 1998, the company has spent more than $11.5 million to make its case in Washington.\nVeterans groups are countering with their own lobbying.\n“We want them to protect GI Bill benefits and protect veterans and members of the military against predatory schools,” said Matthew Miller, chief policy officer of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n“The issue itself is an important issue to discuss,” he said, “but we would hope it would be done in a bipartisan manner.”\nBecause McCain chairs the powerful Senate Committee on Armed Services, military officials and leaders of some veterans organizations are reluctant to openly criticize the Arizona senator.\nBut some veterans groups expressed disappointment over McCain’s outspoken defense of the University of Phoenix in the face of widespread concern about the millions of dollars the school receives each year from the Pentagon’s tuition assistance program and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ GI Bill.\nLast week’s exchange was part of an ongoing war of words between two Senate heavyweights over not just the University of Phoenix, but for-profit schools and how best to spend funds from the GI Bill and other federal education programs on behalf of military veterans and active duty personnel.\nA day after McCain’s personal swipe, Sen. Dick Durbin fired back with a floor speech of his own, defending the military’s action against the university and repeating his call for increased scrutiny of for-profit schools.\n“I hope that my friend and colleague from Arizona, who has made a record in the Senate speaking up, standing up to avoid those misuses of federal funds, will continue in that same vein when it comes to this issue,” Durbin said.\nThis story was edited by Amy Pyle and copy edited by Sheela Kamath.\nBobby Caina Calvan can be reached at bcalvan@gmail.com.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Leader of New York Veterans Group Defends Donald Trump\nVincent McGowan, a veteran, says Trump “has not been a bad guy to us.\"\n— -- With all the fire coming at Donald Trump since his comments this weekend against Sen. John McCain – one of the leaders of New York’s Vietnam Veterans Plaza tells ABC News Trump “has not been a bad guy to us.”\nVincent McGowan, who has been with the organization since its inception in 1983 and currently sits on its board, says that if it wasn’t for Trump, the project in lower Manhattan would have never happened.\nMcGowan says the property downtown was gifted to the veterans by the Koch administration but they had no money. Trump committed $1M in a matching fund and they “couldn’t have built it without him.”\nTrump Saturday suggested McCain, who was beaten and tortured as he was held captive as a POW in Vietnam for 5 ½ years, was only a war hero \"because he was captured.\"\n\"He's a war hero because he was captured,\" Trump said the Family Leadership Council summit in Iowa. \"I like people who weren’t captured.\"\nOn Sunday, Trump told ABC’s Martha Raddatz on This Week that he was not backing down nor would he apologize to McCain, who Trump says has done nothing for veterans.\n“I've been going around to the campaign trail. They're treated like third-class citizens. He's done nothing to help the vets,” Trump told Raddatz. “And I will tell you, they are living in hell.”\nIn a USA Today op-ed published Sunday evening, Trump said his “record of veteran support is well-documented. I served as co-chairman of the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission and was responsible, with a small group, for getting it built.”\nMcGowan confirmed his organization has turned to Trump several times over the years. In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII, the group asked for the Donald’s support for their parade. Trump gave the group $175,000 and allowed organizers to use his helicopter to get around the different parts of the city quickly. “He’s like a guy from the corner who made out well,” says McGowan who added the organization honored Trump in 2005 as their Friend of the Year.\nMcGowan recalled a particular experience a few years back, a staff sergeant had just retired after 10 years of service, wanted to see New York but was down on his luck. McGowan called Trump who gave the veteran a tour of Trump Tower, took him for lunch and then handed him a check for $10,000 to jump start his education.\n“When we need help, really at the bottom of the barrel, I don’t know where we would be without him,” said McGowan who still calls Trump whenever he needs him and looks forward to his annual Christmas card from the Donald. McGowan declined to say whether he was inclined to vote for Trump or whether he was supporting someone else at this time.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

Endorsed by 300 local, state, and national organizations and co-sponsored by more than half of the House Democratic Caucus including 14 committee chairs and key leadership Members, the landmark bill provides comprehensive benefits to all with no copays, private insurance premiums, deductibles, or other cost-sharing.\nThe Medicare for All Act of 2021 is being introduced in the House of Representatives one year to the day that the COVID-19 virus was first confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This devastating public health crisis, which has taken the lives of more than 540,000 Americans, has only underscored how the country’s current health care system leaves millions behind. As unemployment skyrocketed to historic levels during the pandemic, millions of additional families lost their health care and the country experienced the highest increase in the number of uninsured Americans ever recorded.\n“While this devastating pandemic is shining a bright light on our broken, for-profit health care system, we were already leaving nearly half of all adults under the age of 65 uninsured or underinsured before COVID-19 hit. And we were cruelly doing so while paying more per capita for health care than any other country in the world,” said Congresswoman Jayapal. “There is a solution to this health crisis — a popular one that guarantees health care to every person as a human right and finally puts people over profits and care over corporations. That solution is Medicare for All — everyone in, nobody out — and I am proud to introduce it today alongside a powerful movement across America.”\n“A system that prioritizes profits over patients and ties coverage to employment was no match for a global pandemic and will never meet the needs of our people,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “In the wealthiest nation on earth, patients should not be launching GoFundMe pages to afford lifesaving health care for themselves or their loved ones. Medicare For All will build an inclusive health care system that won’t just open the door to care for millions of our neighbors, but do it more efficiently and effectively than the one we have today. Now is not the time to shy away from these generational fights, it is the time for action.”\nThe Medicare for All Act builds upon and expands Medicare to provide comprehensive benefits to every person in the United States. This includes primary care, vision, dental, prescription drugs, mental health, substance abuse, long-term services and supports, reproductive health care, and more. The Medicare for All Act of 2021 also includes universal coverage of long-term care with no cost-sharing for older Americans and individuals with disabilities, and prioritizes home and community-based care over institutional care. Additionally, patients have the freedom to choose the doctors, hospitals, and other providers they wish to see without worrying about whether a provider is in-network. Importantly, the legislation streamlines the health care system to negotiate drug prices and reduce exorbitant administrative waste.\nThis growing movement for universal, single-payer health care has robust support inside and outside of Congress. The Medicare for All Act of 2021 has several new co-sponsors including the Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Representative Frank Pallone, Jr. who just committed to a hearing on Medicare for All. Last Congress, the legislation had four historic hearings — the first-ever on Medicare for All — in the House Committee on Rules, the House Committee on Ways and Means, the House Committee on the Budget, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Medicare for All is supported by 69 percent of registered voters including 87 percent of Democrats, the majority of Independents, and nearly half of Republicans. Additionally, over 50 cities and towns across America have passed resolutions endorsing Medicare for All.\nThe Medicare for All Act of 2021 is also endorsed by 300 local, state, and national organizations that represent nurses, doctors, business owners, unions, and racial justice organizations. This includes Physicians for a National Health Program, Public Citizen, National Nurses United, Center for Popular Democracy, People’s Action, Social Security Works, Labor Campaign for Single Payer, SEIU, and hundreds more.\nFor a full list of endorsing organizations, click here.\n“The pandemic has underscored the cruelty and irrationality of our current health care system – and the urgency of replacing it with Medicare for All. Amid the worst acute public health crisis in generations, millions lost their health insurance and health insurer profits soared,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen. “Medicare for All will ensure everyone has health care coverage, including when they need it most, and will eliminate the waste and profiteering that drives ever-escalating costs. Public Citizen thanks Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Debbie Dingell, as well as the other original co-sponsors of the Medicare for All Act, for their leadership and determination in delivering health justice.”\n“The pandemic has highlighted in deadly detail what nurses have known for decades: Our current health care system, based on private insurance tied to employment, is a colossal failure and leaves far too many of our patients to suffer and die unnecessarily,” said Bonnie Castillo, RN and executive director of National Nurses United. “We thank Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Rep. Debbie Dingell for their leadership in guaranteeing health care is a human right. While we mourn the more than 500,000 lives lost to Covid, we rededicate ourselves to the fight to ensure that everyone is provided with high-quality health care regardless of where they live, how much money they make, or their health, immigration, or employment status. Nurses will never rest until we get this done.”\n“Physicians have been saying it for years: We cannot give patients the care they need in a fractured and profit-driven system. For too long, doctors have watched helplessly as our patients delayed or skipped needed care — even walking out our hospital doors — because they could not afford to pay. While some are uninsured, many of these are patients enrolled in commercial insurance plans, but can’t afford the thousands of dollars they must pay upfront in deductibles and copays,” said Dr. Susan Rogers, President of Physicians for a National Health Program. “Medicare for All is the only plan that puts patients first: It guarantees health care for life, with free choice of hospital and provider, and no financial firewalls to stand in the way of care. It’s no surprise that a majority of physicians and other health providers now support single-payer Medicare for All.”\n“More than any other policy, Medicare for All, would help families impacted by COVID to recover and would move to address the extreme racial disparities in health care,” said Jennifer Flynn Walker, Senior Director of Advocacy and Mobilization at the Center for Popular Democracy Action. “Imagine going to the doctor without the fear of an enormous bill. Imagine losing your job, but still being able to access health care for your family. Medicare for All is a necessary policy for us to address the new normal. It is not radical. It is compassionate and sensible policy making.”\n“This pandemic has made it plain that our collective health and our economy depend on all of us staying healthy and safe,” said People’s Action Deputy Director Bree Carlson. “Our government can make this a reality by passing Medicare for All, ensuring that every one of us has access to free, high quality health care. We can and we must build a health care system strong enough to protect us all from the next health crisis.”\n“The costs of our current health care system remain unsustainable for too many working families, for seniors, and for employers. IFPTE applauds Rep. Jayapal, Rep. Dingell, and the cosponsors of the Medicare for All Act of 2021 for proposing a solution that will benefit all Americans by ensuring that all Americans are guaranteed high quality comprehensive health care as a right,” said Paul Shearon, President of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE). “Medicare for All would end the drag that rising health care costs have on our union members’ wages and benefits, while advancing health justice and equity for all workers.”\n“We need to reform our national health care system now more than ever after everything we’ve been through this past year in battling a world-wide pandemic,” said Eric Dickson, MD, President and CEO of UMass Memorial Health Care. “I believe a Medicare-for-All type of system could greatly improve health care equity in this country while ultimately reducing costs and physician burnout.”\nThe Medicare for All Act of 2021 is co-sponsored by 14 committee chairs and several key leadership Members.

FEMA to support Oregon vaccination efforts with resources and staff.\nLast Friday, Governor Kate Brown announced the prioritization for the next groups of Oregonians to be included in Oregon’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution schedule, including Oregonians with underlying health conditions and frontline workers. Additionally, the Governor announced that Oregon will be receiving vaccination support through new federal staff and resources from FEMA.\n\"By summer, provided supplies from the federal government continue as planned, any Oregonian who wants the vaccine will be eligible to receive it,\" said Governor Brown. \"And while that gives us all a reason to breathe a sigh of relief, it should also serve as a reminder that the finish line is in sight, and we cannot let up.\n\"New variants of this virus still threaten our communities. While infection rates continue to plummet here in Oregon and across the country, we’re not out of the woods just yet. We must continue to make smart choices around the safety measures we know work: keep wearing your masks, physical distancing and limiting social gatherings.\"\nPhase 1b, Phase 2 Vaccine Prioritization\nOregon’s Phase 1b prioritization schedule was based on the recommendations of the members of the Vaccine Advisory Committee, with the goal of ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines to those communities disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including Black, Indigenous, Latino, Latina, and Latinx, Pacific Islander, and Tribal communities. The VAC recommended prioritizing Oregonians with underlying conditions and frontline workers for vaccination.\nUntil March 29, Oregon will continue to vaccinate individuals only Oregon seniors, educators, adults in custody as required by a recent Oregon court decision, and any individuals eligible in Phase 1a still remaining.\nThe vaccination of Oregonians for the continuation of Phase 1b will proceed in two waves .\nBeginning March 29, the following groups of Oregonians will be eligible for vaccination:\n- Adults age 45 to 64 with underlying health conditions as defined by the CDC\n- Seasonally-impacted frontline workers, such as migrant seasonal farm workers, seafood and agricultural workers, and food processing workers\n- Currently displaced victims of the September 2020 wildfires\n- Wildland firefighters\n- People living in low-income and congregate senior housing\n- Individuals experiencing houselessness\nNo later than May 1, the following groups of Oregonians will be eligible:\n- All other frontline workers as defined by the CDC\n- Individuals age 16-45 with underlying health conditions\n- Multigenerational household members\nNo later than June 1, Phase 2 of vaccination will begin with all adults aged 45 to 64. And, no later than July 1, all Oregonians 16 and over will be eligible to receive a vaccine.\nNew FEMA Vaccination Support Begins Next Week\nGovernor Brown also announced today that Oregon has secured access to $220 million to reimburse hospitals, clinics, local public health partners, and other organizations for the costs of their vaccination efforts, from January 21 to April 21. In addition, FEMA staff will be supporting the Oregon Convention Center, Portland International Airport, and Hillsboro Stadium, starting with 20 staff next week. They will also be working with sites at the Deschutes and Salem fairgrounds. FEMA will be working with Oregon to develop long-term, sustainable solutions to support and relieve hospital staff and frontline health care workers.\nContinued Governor Brown: \"We are grateful for this assistance, and look forward to the next steps in our vaccine response. Each week, more supply comes online. More Oregonians get vaccinated. We make more progress with each and every day.\"\n- Materials from the Oregon Health Authority with more details, including the definitions of underlying health conditions and frontline workers, is available here.\n- A copy of the Governor's prepared remarks from Friday's press conference is available here.\n- A recording of Friday's live-streamed press conference is available here.\n- More information on vaccines is available at covidvaccine.oregon.gov.\nChanges to Scheduling Vaccine Appointments via the Vaccine Information Tool (Chatbot) Now in Effect\nFrom the Oregon Health Authority\nTo help alleviate the challenges people have faced attempting to schedule a vaccine appointment at the Oregon Convention Center, the Oregon Health Authority and the All4Oregon health system partners will change the process for appointments via the Vaccine Information Tool (chatbot), starting Monday, March 1, 2021.\nAs of Monday, adults who are 65 and older will become eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. But adults who are 65 and older, and most people who are eligible for vaccines in Phase 1A in the Portland metro area, will no longer be directed to the chatbot to schedule appointments at the Oregon Convention Center.\nThe change does not apply to people with mobility issues, who will continue to be able to access appointments at the Portland Airport Red Economy Parking Lot drive-thru clinic through the chatbot. Educators in the Portland metro area and people who live in Marion County also can continue to find appointments through the Vaccine Information Tool.\nThe change does not impact people who have already scheduled vaccine appointments at the Oregon Convention Center, the Portland Airport or the Legacy Woodburn Health Center.\nAll Oregonians, including senior adults age 65 and over, can sign up to be notified about vaccination events when they are eligible at the Get Vaccinated Oregon signup tool. The Get Vaccinated Oregon (GVO) signup tool can be found at covidvaccine.oregon.gov.\nThe new appointment scheduling process for eligible older adults who live in Clackamas, Columbia, Multnomah or Washington counties, will be based on names being pulled from the Get Vaccinated Oregon tool. On a weekly basis, OHA will use that GVO tool to electronically scramble the names of all eligible older adults in the metro area. OHA will then send a list of names to All4Oregon that matches the number of vaccination appointments available for scheduling. All4Oregon will contact individuals to schedule their appointment.\nDue to limited supply, not everyone who is eligible will be included on the weekly list. All eligible groups who want a vaccine will get a vaccine over the coming months.\nAll4Oregon is the joint effort of Kaiser Permanente, Legacy Health, OHSU and Providence to collaborate in operating the mass vaccination clinic at the Oregon Convention Center.\nAs more vaccines become available, vaccine distribution sites will expand to more locations, such as retail pharmacies, outpatient clinics and other sites linked to hospitals and health systems. The additional vaccine and additional sites will help address the challenges people are experiencing as high demand exceeds the limited supply.\nOlder adults and anyone who needs help better understanding the scheduling options are encouraged to call 211.\nSign up to receive future communications from the Oregon Health Authority here.\nAdditional COVID-19 Vaccine Resources\nFor additional COVID-19 Vaccine resources, these retail pharmacies are also participating in vaccine distribution:\nOregon Health Authority Updates\nAn Open Letter to Oregon — OHA Director Patrick Allen thanks Oregonians:\nFrom the Oregon Health Authority\nAs of yesterday (from 3/1/21), it’s been one year since the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Oregon. Twelve grim months later, nothing is the same. The pandemic has claimed more than half a million lives in the United States. More than 2,200 Oregonians have died with the coronavirus. All of us have felt their loss. All of us have seen our lives altered: a beloved grandparent’s lonely wave through the glass of a nursing home window. The empty storefront of a bedrock local business. Birthdays, graduations and anniversaries awkwardly celebrated on a screen instead of in-person. Frustration as parents struggle to help kids in school while trying to meet work demands.\nBut there’s another number Oregonians should bear in mind, especially as we confront the coming months of the pandemic: 4,000. That’s approximately the number of lives you’ve saved by wearing a mask, limiting in-person gatherings and maintaining social distance. Oregon was one of the first states in the nation to report a case of COVID-19, but a year later our state has the fourth lowest coronavirus case rate in the nation, the fourth lowest death rate and the fourth lowest COVID-19 death rate among seniors. If Oregon’s death rate matched the nation’s, three times as many Oregonians would have lost their lives. You made the difference. Month after month, deep into the pandemic, about 8 in 10 Oregonians continue to observe lifesaving pandemic precautions. While we know who’s died from COVID-19 – in ages ranging from under 1 to more than 100 years old – we’ll never know for sure whom you’ve saved. Maybe it’s an esteemed elder who’s alive to lead a virtual devotional group for his faith community. A middle-age mother who’s here to help her daughter apply for college. A thirtysomething who agrees to be best man at his friend’s wedding, once the pandemic is over. Maybe it’s someone reading this message. Maybe it’s you.\nState and local public health actions saved lives too. Governor Kate Brown issued early stay at home orders. Our state was the first in the nation to protect the most vulnerable nursing home residents by limiting visitation. Oregon put limits on bars, restaurants, gyms and other types of businesses that could fuel the virus’ spread. Those limits figured as vital factors in Oregon’s life-saving calculus – but they came with undeniable costs to workers and business owners. Still, and unlike other states, Oregon kept manufacturing and construction going, blunting the worst-case economic fallout on working families.\nHere’s another number: 986,816. That’s the number of COVID-19 vaccine first and second doses Oregon nurses and other vaccinators have administered so far, as of today. It’s true Oregon’s vaccine rollout has been as bumpy as it has been elsewhere. Yet Oregon has fully vaccinated about 1 in 12 adults, putting us ahead of most other states (Oregon ranks 16th in the percent of people fully vaccinated).\nBut the pandemic isn’t over. More contagious and more dangerous variants of the virus are taking hold. We are in a race to vaccinate as many people as possible, as soon as we can. It’s been a hard year. On top of the pandemic, we’ve endured historic wildfires that also claimed lives, displaced thousands and obliterated the homes and businesses that comprised entire communities. We’ve awakened to an overdue reckoning with racial injustice – including unacceptable health inequities. Winter storms compounded our discomfort and disruption.\nWe’re tired. But we can’t give up.\nWith gratitude, and respect for all the lifesaving sacrifices you’ve made so far, I ask Oregonians to:\n- Keep wearing masks, limiting your social get-togethers and maintaining your physical distance. Until we know more, we need to keep our guard up.\n- Choose to get vaccinated when you are eligible, as soon as an appointment is available to you.\nOn Friday, Governor Brown told Oregonians we are speeding up our timelines to vaccinate Oregonians. Over the next month we expect to vaccinate more than 3 in 4 seniors. People with underlying health conditions will be eligible on March 29. Frontline workers will be eligible no later than May 1. And we’ll open vaccinations to the first healthy members of the general public no later than June 1.\nI know many people have questions about COVID-19 vaccines. I know the experience of racism and memories of historical trauma and medical experimentation are alive in many communities. Other people are wary of government.\nYet once again, we depend on each other to save lives. The COVID-19 vaccine is the safest and most effective way to protect yourself and your loved ones and return to more of our normal life. We need enough Oregonians to get immunized, so all of us are protected. Thank you for the lives you’ve saved so far and the lives we can all save in the months to come.\nCOVID-19 and Grief: Live Q & A\nFrom the Oregon Health Authority\nWe want to acknowledge the immense loss and grief that COVID-19 has brought to Oregonians.\nJoin us today, March 3 at 12:30 p.m. for a live Q & A when our experts will answer your questions about coping with grief.\nSmall Business Updates\nCommercial Rent Relief Program\nFrom Business Oregon\nThe Oregon Legislative Emergency Board on January 8, 2021, allocated $100 million to fund a new Commercial Rent Relief Program to provide financial assistance to small businesses and landlords adversely affected by economic conditions as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe program will open for applications on March 8, 2021\nThe program targets landlords with tenant businesses with 100 or fewer employees who are behind on lease payments or any forgiven base rent amounts that have been negotiated due to COVID-19. The program will require both business tenant and property owner participation. The program includes additional protections for tenants, such as non-eviction clauses, and a waiver of penalties and interest.\nVisit here for more information.\nLegislative Updates\nHouse District 30 - 2021 Legislative Session Concepts\nIn order to provide information and updates on the policies that I am working on for the 2021 Session, this is a continuation of that series.\nTomorrow, Thursday March 4, 2021, I will be discussing one of my bills this session at a public hearing in the Joint Committee on Transportation during the 8am hour. HB 2498 will allow members of our deaf and hard of hearing community (DHH) to choose to indicate on their vehicle’s registration, driver’s license and state issued ID card their inclusion in that community. During something like a routine traffic stop, it will be clear to an officer in their Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS) that the driver may require additional communication assistance. I’ve created a YouTube video to explain the bill. If you’d like to submit written or verbal testimony in person, you can follow these links:\nRedistricting Committee-\"Virtual Road Meetings\"\nThere will be two upcoming meetings held (virtually) on Congressional District 1, (of which House District 30 is a part of) that you can participate in.\nThe meeting dates are as follows (with links to the agendas below):\nThese hearings are required to be scheduled prior to the preparation of draft legislative and congressional redistricting maps. There are also plans for additional “virtual roadshow” meetings after proposed maps have been completed.\nVisit the Oregon State Legislature’s redistricting webpage, or click the graphic below, for more information.\nInsurance Updates\nMedicare Open Enrollment Ends March 31st\nFrom OregonHealthcare.gov\nThe Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period continues until March 31. If you take advantage of this open enrollment period, you will have coverage that starts the first day of the month after you enroll. You must have an existing Medicare Advantage plan on Jan. 1 to use this enrollment period.\nDuring this time, if you already have a Medicare Advantage plan, you can:\n- Change to a different Medicare Advantage plan, either with or without drug coverage\n- Enroll in a stand-alone Part D (prescription drug) plan, which returns the beneficiary to Original Medicare\nNOTE: Signing up for Part D prescription drug coverage is not guaranteed unless you were already in a Medicare Advantage plan on Jan. 1. You can make only one change during this enrollment period and can not change from one stand-alone Part D prescription drug plan to another stand-alone Part D prescription drug plan.\nIf you need to switch Medicare Advantage plans you can get help by calling 800-722-4134 (toll-free) or find local help using the locator tool at dcbspage.org/SHIBALOCAL.

Si aprovecha este periodo de inscripción abierta, tendrá una cobertura que comenzará el primer día del mes siguiente a su inscripción. Necesita tener un plan Medicare Advantage existente el 1 de enero para poder utilizar este periodo de inscripción.\nDurante de este periodo, si usted ya tiene un plan de Medicare Advantage, puede:\n- Cambiar a un plan de Medicare Advantage diferente, con o sin cobertura de drogas\n- Inscribirse en un plan independiente de Parte D (de medicamentos recetados), que devuelve el beneficiario a Medicare Original\nNOTA: Inscribirse en un plan de Parte D para los medicamentos recetados no está garantizado a menos que ya esté inscrito en un plan Medicare Advantage el 1 de enero. Sólo puede hacer un cambio durante este periodo de inscripción y no puede cambiar de un plan independiente de medicamentos recetados de la Parte D a otro plan independiente de medicamentos recetados de la Parte D.\nSi necesita cambiar su plan de Medicare Advantage, puede obtener ayuda llamando al 800-722-4134 (sin cargo) o encontrar ayuda local usando nuestra herramienta de localización en dcbspage.org/SHIBALOCAL.

Send us pictures of your rescue pets for a future pet slideshow. We want to show them off! I am a Chief Co-Sponsor of HCR 9, a bill that would designate rescue shelter dogs and cats as official state pets.\nMy rescue pets-Annie and Kado\nAccording to the CDC and Newport Academy, there are many health benefits to having a pet. These include:\n- Decreased blood pressure\n- Decreased cholesterol levels\n- Decreased triglyceride levels\n- Decreased feelings of loneliness\n- Increased opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities\n- Increased opportunities for socialization\nStudies around pets and mental health show that petting and playing with animals reduces stress-related hormones; these benefits can occur after just five minutes of interacting with a pet. Playing with dog or cat raises levels of serotonin and dopamine; hormones that calm and relax the nervous system. Moreover, interacting with a friendly dog reduces levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. It also increases the release of oxytocin, another chemical in the body that reduces stress naturally. Pets reduce depression and loneliness and the responsibility of owning pet can help maintain a daily routine.\nHouse District 30 Virtual Office Hours\n|\n|\nThis Friday, March 5, from 11:00am-12:00pm, I will be holding HD 30 Virtual Office Hours.

Each of these hazards presents unique challenges, but one of the biggest challenges for earthquake preparedness is unpredictability. Earthquakes strike without warning, causing widespread damage in a matter of seconds.\nFortunately, there is a preparedness tool, ShakeAlert® Earthquake Early Warning, coming to Oregon on March 11. ShakeAlert does not predict earthquakes. Rather, it uses a network of sensors to detect an earthquake that has just begun. Data from the sensors are used by ShakeAlert processing centers to calculate the estimated quake magnitude and intensity. Alert distribution providers (e.g. operators of purpose-built apps) create an alert which can be delivered to wireless devices – in a matter of seconds – potentially reaching device users before the shaking does. In the seconds between receiving an alert and feeling shaking, people can protect themselves by dropping, covering and holding on.\nShakeAlert is an easy-to-use tool. Beginning March 11, 2021, mobile devices in Oregon will be able to receive ShakeAlert-powered alerts via Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA), just like a severe weather or AMBER alert. All WEA alerts, regardless of type, behave the same. The device makes a distinctive notification sound and the alert pops up in a text window on the screen. Some devices with text-to-voice capability may read out the message text.\nIn the case of an earthquake alert, the WEA text will read: “Earthquake Detected! Drop, Cover, Hold On. Protect Yourself. -USGS ShakeAlert.” This message is available in Spanish for phones set to receive alerts in that language.\nShakeAlert-powered alerts can also be delivered through purpose-built apps; newer Android phones have ShakeAlert capacity built into the operating system, offering a third alert delivery route.\nFind more information here.\nAdditional Resources\nHouse District 30 Links\nFederal Delegation Links\nEducation Links\nUtilities Assistance\nFood and Housing Assistance\nHSF Executive Director, Aron Carleson. Hillsboro School District Superintendent Mike Scott and Auctioneer Graham Crow\nCongratulations to the Hillsboro Schools Foundation!

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

Section 113 of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 provided that employers can offer their employees de minimis financial incentives to make elective deferrals. These incentives may not exceed $250 in value, and, in general, are includible in employees’ income.\nPaycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness. Gross income doesn’t include any amount arising from the forgiveness of a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, effective for taxable years ending after March 27, 2020. (See P.L. 116-136.) Likewise, gross income does not include any amount arising from the forgiveness of Second Draw PPP loans, effective December 27, 2020. (See P.L. 116-260.) When a taxpayer who does not factually satisfy the conditions for a qualifying forgiveness causes its lender to forgive the PPP loan by inaccurately representing that the taxpayer satisfies them, the taxpayer may not exclude the amount of the forgiven loan from gross income under 15 U.S.C. section 636m(i) or section 276(b)(1) of the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020.

If you're a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you must report income from sources outside the United States (foreign income) on your tax return unless it’s exempt by U.S. law. This is true whether you reside inside or outside the United States and whether or not you receive a Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or Form 1099 from the foreign payer. This applies to earned income (such as wages and tips) as well as unearned income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, pensions, rents, and royalties). If you reside outside the United States, you may be able to exclude part or all of your foreign source earned income. For details, see Pub. 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad.\nOlympic and Paralympic medals and United States Olympic Committee (USOC) prize money. If you receive Olympic and Paralympic medals and USOC prize money, the value of the medals and the amount of the prize money may be nontaxable. See the instructions for Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8m, at IRS.gov/Form1040 for more information.\nPublic safety officers.

A TIN is your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN).\nTerrorist attacks. You can exclude from income certain disaster assistance, disability, and death payments received as a result of a terrorist or military action. For more information, see Sickness and Injury Benefits, later; Pub. 3920, Tax Relief for Victims of Terrorist Attacks; and Pub. 907, Tax Highlights for Persons With Disabilities.\nPhotographs of missing children. The Internal Revenue Service is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.\nIntroduction\nYou can receive income in the form of money, property, or services. This publication discusses many kinds of income and explains whether they are taxable or nontaxable. It includes discussions on employee wages and fringe benefits, and income from bartering, partnerships, S corporations, and royalties. It also includes information on disability pensions, life insurance proceeds, and welfare and other public assistance benefits. Check the index for the location of a specific subject.\nIn most cases, an amount included in your income is taxable unless it is specifically exempted by law. Income that is taxable must be reported on your return and is subject to tax. Income that is nontaxable may have to be shown on your tax return but isn’t taxable.\nConstructively received income.\nIf you’re a cash method taxpayer, you’re generally taxed on income that is available to you, regardless of whether it is actually in your possession.\nA valid check that you received or that was made available to you before the end of the tax year is considered income constructively received in that year, even if you don’t cash the check or deposit it to your account until the next year. For example, if the postal service tries to deliver a check to you on the last day of the tax year but you aren’t at home to receive it, you must include the amount in your income for that tax year. If the check was mailed so that it couldn’t possibly reach you until after the end of the tax year, and you otherwise couldn’t get the funds before the end of the year, you include the amount in your income for the next tax year.\nAssignment of income.\nIncome received by an agent for you is income you constructively received in the year the agent received it. If you agree by contract that a third party is to receive income for you, you must include the amount in your income when the third party receives it.\nExample 1.\nYou and your employer agree that part of your salary is to be paid directly to one of your creditors. You must include that amount in your income when your creditor receives it.\nAdvance payments.\nGenerally, you report an advance payment for goods, services, or other items as income in the year you receive the payment. However, if you use an accrual method of accounting and are otherwise eligible, you can elect to postpone including the advance payment in income until the next year. See Pub. 538 for more information.\nComments and suggestions.\nWe welcome your comments about this publication and suggestions for future editions.\nYou can send us comments through IRS.gov/FormComments.

In addition to wages, salaries, commissions, fees, and tips, this includes other forms of compensation such as fringe benefits and stock options.\nYou should receive a Form W-2 from your employer or former employer showing the pay you received for your services. Include all your pay on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, even if you don’t receive Form W-2, or you receive a Form W-2 that doesn’t include all pay that should be included on the Form W-2.\nIf you performed services, other than as an independent contractor, and your employer didn’t withhold social security and Medicare taxes from your pay, you must file Form 8919 with your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. These wages must be included on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1g. See Form 8919 for more information.\nFair market value (FMV).\nThe FMV of an item of property is the price at which the item would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being required to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.\nChildcare providers.\nIf you provide childcare, either in the child's home or in your home or other place of business, the pay you receive must be included in your income. If you're not an employee, you're probably self-employed and must include payments for your services on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business. You generally aren’t an employee unless you're subject to the will and control of the person who employs you as to what you're to do, and how you're to do it.\nBabysitting.\nIf you babysit for relatives or neighborhood children, whether on a regular basis or only periodically, the rules for childcare providers apply to you.\nSelf-employment tax.\nWhether you're an employee or self-employed person, your income could be subject to self-employment tax. See the Instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040) and the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040) if you're self-employed. Also see Pub. 926 for more information.\nBankruptcy.\nIf you filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, you must allocate your wages and withheld income tax. Your Form W-2 will show your total wages and withheld income tax for the year. On your tax return, you report the wages and withheld income tax for the period before you filed for bankruptcy. Your bankruptcy estate reports the wages and withheld income tax for the period after you filed for bankruptcy. If you receive other information returns (such as Form 1099-DIV or Form 1099-INT) that report gross income to you, rather than to the bankruptcy estate, you must allocate that income.\nThe only exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax if you're self-employed. For that purpose, you must take into account all your self-employment income for the year from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case.\nYou must file a statement with your income tax return stating you filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy case. The statement must show the allocation and describe the method used to make the allocation. For a sample of this statement and other information, see Notice 2006-83, 2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at IRS.gov/irb/2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83.\nMiscellaneous Compensation\nThis section discusses many types of employee compensation. The subjects are arranged in alphabetical order.\nAdvance commissions and other earnings.\nIf you receive advance commissions or other amounts for services to be performed in the future and you're a cash-method taxpayer, you must include these amounts in your income in the year you receive them.\nIf you repay unearned commissions or other amounts in the same year you receive them, reduce the amount of unearned commissions included in your income by the repayment. If you repay them in a later tax year, you can deduct the repayment as an itemized deduction on your Schedule A (Form 1040), Other Itemized Deductions, line 16, or you may be able to take a credit for that year. See Repayments, later.\nAllowances and reimbursements.\nIf you receive travel, transportation, or other business expense allowances or reimbursements from your employer, see Pub. 463.\nBack pay awards.\nInclude in income amounts you're awarded in a settlement or judgment for back pay. These include payments made to you for damages, unpaid life insurance premiums, and unpaid health insurance premiums. They should be reported to you by your employer on Form W-2.\nBonuses and awards.\nBonuses or awards you receive for outstanding work are included in your income and should be shown on your Form W-2. These include prizes such as vacation trips for meeting sales goals. If the prize or award you receive is goods or services, you must include the FMV of the goods or services in your income. However, if your employer merely promises to pay you a bonus or award at some future time, it isn’t taxable until you receive it or it’s made available to you.\nEmployee achievement award.\nIf you receive tangible personal property (other than cash, a gift certificate, or an equivalent item) as an award for length of service or safety achievement, you must generally exclude its value from your income. However, the amount you can exclude is limited to your employer's cost and can’t be more than $1,600 ($400 for awards that aren’t qualified plan awards) for all such awards you receive during the year. Your employer can tell you whether your award is a qualified plan award. Your employer must make the award as part of a meaningful presentation, under conditions and circumstances that don’t create a significant likelihood of it being disguised pay.\nHowever, the exclusion doesn’t apply to the following awards.\n-\nA length-of-service award if you received it for less than 5 years of service or if you received another length-of-service award during the year or the previous 4 years.\n-\nA safety achievement award if you're a manager, administrator, clerical employee, or other professional employee or if more than 10% of eligible employees previously received safety achievement awards during the year.\nExample 2.\nYou received three employee achievement awards during the year: a nonqualified plan award of a watch valued at $250, and two qualified plan awards of a stereo valued at $1,000 and a set of golf clubs valued at $500. Assuming that the requirements for qualified plan awards are otherwise satisfied, each award by itself would be excluded from income. However, because the $1,750 total value of the awards is more than $1,600, you must include $150 ($1,750 − $1,600) in your income.\nDifferential wage payments.\nThis is any payment made by an employer to an individual for any period during which the individual is, for a period of more than 30 days, an active duty member of the uniformed services and represents all or a portion of the wages the individual would have received from the employer for that period. These payments are treated as wages and are subject to income tax withholding, but not Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) or Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes. The payments are reported as wages on Form W-2.\nGovernment cost-of-living allowances.\nMost payments received by U.S. Government civilian employees for working abroad are taxable. However, certain cost-of-living allowances are tax free. Pub. 516 explains the tax treatment of allowances, differentials, and other special pay you receive for employment abroad.\nNonqualified deferred compensation plans.\nYour employer will report to you the total amount of deferrals for the year under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. This amount is shown in Form W-2, box 12, using code Y. This amount isn’t included in your income.\nHowever, if at any time during the tax year, the plan fails to meet certain requirements, or isn’t operated under those requirements, all amounts deferred under the plan for the tax year and all preceding tax years are included in your income for the current year. This amount is included in your wages shown in Form W-2, box 1. It’s also shown in Form W-2, box 12, using code Z.\nNonqualified deferred compensation plans of nonqualified entities.\nIn most cases, any compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan of a nonqualified entity is included in gross income when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such compensation. For this purpose, a nonqualified entity is one of the following.\n-\nA foreign corporation, unless substantially all of its income is:\n-\nEffectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or\n-\nSubject to a comprehensive foreign income tax.\n-\n-\nA partnership, unless substantially all of its income is allocated to persons other than:\n-\nForeign persons for whom the income isn’t subject to a comprehensive foreign income tax, and\n-\nTax-exempt organizations.\n-\nNote received for services.\nIf your employer gives you a secured note as payment for your services, you must include the FMV (usually the discount value) of the note in your income for the year you receive it. When you later receive payments on the note, a proportionate part of each payment is the recovery of the FMV that you previously included in your income. Don’t include that part again in your income. Include the rest of the payment in your income in the year of payment.\nIf your employer gives you a nonnegotiable unsecured note as payment for your services, payments on the note that are credited toward the principal amount of the note are compensation income when you receive them.\nSeverance pay.\nYou must include in income amounts you receive as severance pay and any payment for the cancellation of your employment contract.\nSeverance payments are subject to social security and Medicare taxes, income tax withholding, and FUTA tax.\nSeverance payments are wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes. As noted in section 15 of Pub. 15, Special Rules for Various Types of Services and Payments, severance payments are also subject to income tax withholding and FUTA tax.\nAccrued leave payment.\nIf you're a federal employee and receive a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave when you retire or resign, this amount will be included as wages on your Form W-2.\nIf you resign from one agency and are reemployed by another agency, you may have to repay part of your lump-sum annual leave payment to the second agency. You can reduce gross wages by the amount you repaid in the same tax year in which you received it. Attach to your tax return a copy of the receipt or statement given to you by the agency you repaid to explain the difference between the wages on your return and the wages on your Forms W-2.\nOutplacement services.\nIf you choose to accept a reduced amount of severance pay so that you can receive outplacement services (such as training in résumé writing and interview techniques), you must include the unreduced amount of the severance pay in income.\nSick pay.\nPay you receive from your employer while you're sick or injured is part of your salary or wages. In addition, you must include in your income sick pay benefits received from any of the following payers.\n-\nA welfare fund.\n-\nA state sickness or disability fund.\n-\nAn association of employers or employees.\n-\nAn insurance company, if your employer paid for the plan.\nSocial security and Medicare taxes paid by employer.\nIf you and your employer have an agreement that your employer pays your social security and Medicare taxes without deducting them from your gross wages, you must report the amount of tax paid for you as taxable wages on your tax return. The payment is also treated as wages for figuring your social security and Medicare taxes and your social security and Medicare benefits. However, these payments aren’t treated as social security and Medicare wages if you're a household worker or a farm worker.\nStock appreciation rights.\nDon’t include a stock appreciation right granted by your employer in income until you exercise (use) the right. When you use the right, you're entitled to a cash payment equal to the FMV of the corporation's stock on the date of use minus the FMV on the date the right was granted. You include the cash payment in income in the year you use the right.\nDigital assets.\nIf your employer gives you digital assets (such as Bitcoin) as payment for your services, you must include the FMV of the digital assets as of the date(s) of receipt in your income. The FMV of digital assets paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, FICA tax, and FUTA tax and must be reported on Form W-2. Notice 2014-21, 2014-16 I.R.B. 938, describes how digital assets are treated for federal tax purposes and is available at IRS.gov/irb/2014-16_IRB#NOT-2014-21. For further information, see IRS.gov/DigitalAssets.\nFringe Benefits\nFringe benefits received in connection with the performance of your services are included in your income as compensation unless you pay FMV for them or they’re specifically excluded by law. Refraining from the performance of services (for example, under a covenant not to compete) is treated as the performance of services for purposes of these rules.\nSee Valuation of Fringe Benefits, later in this discussion, for information on how to determine the amount to include in income.\nRecipient of fringe benefit.\nYou're the recipient of a fringe benefit if you perform the services for which the fringe benefit is provided. You're considered to be the recipient even if it’s given to another person, such as a member of your family. An example is a car your employer gives to your spouse for services you perform. The car is considered to have been provided to you and not to your spouse.\nYou don’t have to be an employee of the provider to be a recipient of a fringe benefit. If you're a partner, a director, or an independent contractor, you can also be the recipient of a fringe benefit.\nProvider of benefit.\nYour employer or another person for whom you perform services is the provider of a fringe benefit regardless of whether that person actually provides the fringe benefit to you. The provider can be a client or customer of an independent contractor.\nAccounting period.\nYou must use the same accounting period your employer uses to report your taxable noncash fringe benefits. Your employer has the option to report taxable noncash fringe benefits by using either of the following rules.\n-\nThe general rule: benefits are reported for a full calendar year (January 1–December 31).\n-\nThe special accounting period rule: benefits provided during the last 2 months of the calendar year (or any shorter period) are treated as paid during the following calendar year. For example, each year your employer reports the value of benefits provided during the last 2 months of the prior year and the first 10 months of the current year.\nYou must use the same accounting period that you use to report the benefit to claim an employee business deduction (for example, use of a car).\nForm W-2.\nYour employer must include all taxable fringe benefits in Form W-2, box 1, as wages, tips, and other compensation, and, if applicable, in boxes 3 and 5 as social security and Medicare wages. Although not required, your employer may include the total value of fringe benefits in box 14 (or on a separate statement). However, if your employer provided you with a vehicle and included 100% of its annual lease value in your income, the employer must separately report this value to you in box 14 (or on a separate statement).\nIn most cases, the value of accident or health plan coverage provided to you by your employer isn’t included in your income. Benefits you receive from the plan may be taxable, as explained under Sickness and Injury Benefits, later.\nFor information on the items covered in this section, other than Long-term care coverage, see Pub. 969.\nLong-term care coverage.\nContributions by your employer to provide coverage for long-term care services generally aren’t included in your income. However, contributions made through a flexible spending or similar arrangement (such as a cafeteria plan) must be included in your income. This amount will be reported as wages in Form W-2, box 1.\nArcher MSA contributions.\nContributions by your employer to your Archer MSA generally aren’t included in your income. Their total will be reported in Form W-2, box 12, with code R. You must report this amount on Form 8853, Archer MSAs and Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts. File the form with your return.\nHealth flexible spending arrangement (health FSA).\nIf your employer provides a health FSA that qualifies as an accident or health plan, the amount of your salary reduction, and reimbursements of your medical care expenses, in most cases aren’t included in your income.\nFor 2024, health FSAs are subject to a $3,200 limit on salary reduction contributions.\nHealth reimbursement arrangement (HRA).\nIf your employer offers an HRA that qualifies as an accident or health plan, your coverage under the HRA and reimbursements of your medical care expenses from the HRA generally aren’t included in your income.\nHealth savings account (HSA).\nIf you’re an eligible individual, you and any other person, including your employer or a family member, can make contributions to your HSA. Contributions, other than employer contributions, are deductible on your return whether or not you itemize deductions. Contributions made by your employer aren’t included in your income. Distributions from your HSA that are used to pay qualified medical expenses aren’t included in your income. Distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are included in your income. See Pub. 969 for the requirements of an HSA.\nContributions by a partnership to a bona fide partner's HSA aren’t contributions by an employer. The contributions are treated as a distribution of money and aren’t included in the partner's gross income. Contributions by a partnership to a partner's HSA for services rendered are treated as guaranteed payments that are includible in the partner's gross income. In both situations, the partner can deduct the contribution made to the partner's HSA.\nContributions by an S corporation to a 2%-shareholder-employee's HSA for services rendered are treated as guaranteed payments and are includible in the shareholder-employee's gross income. The shareholder-employee can deduct the contribution made to the shareholder-employee's HSA.\nQualified HSA funding distribution.\nYou can make a one-time distribution from your individual retirement arrangement (IRA) to an HSA and you generally won’t include any of the distribution in your income. See Pub. 590-B for the requirements for these qualified HSA funding distributions.\nYou may be able to exclude from your income amounts paid or expenses incurred by your employer for qualified adoption expenses in connection with your adoption of an eligible child. See the Instructions for Form 8839 for more information.\nAdoption benefits are reported by your employer in Form W-2, box 12, with code T. They are also included as social security and Medicare wages in boxes 3 and 5. However, they aren’t included as wages in box 1. To determine the taxable and nontaxable amounts, you must complete Part III of Form 8839. File the form with your return.\nIf your employer provides you with the free or low-cost use of an employer-operated gym or other athletic club on your employer's premises, the value isn’t included in your compensation. The gym must be used primarily by employees, their spouses, and their dependent children.\nIf your employer pays for a fitness program provided to you at an off-site resort hotel or athletic club, the value of the program is included in your compensation.\nIf your employer provides you with a product or service and the cost of it is so small that it would be unreasonable for the employer to account for it, the value isn’t included in your income. In most cases, the value of benefits such as discounts at company cafeterias, cab fares home when working overtime, occasional personal use of an employer’s copying machine (where at least 85% of the use of the machine is for business), and company picnics aren’t included in your income. Also, see Employee Discounts, later.\nHoliday gifts.\nIf your employer gives you a turkey, ham, or other item of nominal value at Christmas or other holidays, don’t include the value of the gift in your income. However, if your employer gives you cash, a gift certificate, or a similar item that you can easily exchange for cash, you include the value of that gift as extra salary or wages regardless of the amount involved.\nIf your employer provides dependent care benefits under a dependent care assistance plan, you may be able to exclude these benefits from your income. Dependent care benefits include:\n-\nAmounts your employer pays directly to either you or your care provider for the care of your qualifying person while you work,\n-\nThe FMV of care in a daycare facility provided or sponsored by your employer, and\n-\nPre-tax contributions you made under a dependent care FSA.\nThe amount you can exclude is limited to the lesser of:\n-\nThe total amount of dependent care benefits you received during the year,\n-\nThe total amount of qualified expenses you incurred during the year,\n-\nYour earned income,\n-\nYour spouse's earned income, or\n-\n$5,000 ($2,500 if married filing separately).\nYour employer must show the total amount of dependent care benefits provided to you during the year under a dependent care assistance plan in Form W-2, box 10. Any amount over your employer’s plan limit is also included in box 1. See Form 2441.\nTo claim the exclusion, you must complete Part III of Form 2441. See the Instructions for Form 2441 for more information.\nYou can exclude from your income up to $5,250 of qualified employer-provided educational assistance. For more information, see Pub. 970.\nIf your employer sells you property or services at a discount, you may be able to exclude the amount of the discount from your income. The exclusion applies to discounts on property or services offered to customers in the ordinary course of the line of business in which you work. However, it doesn’t apply to discounts on real property or property commonly held for investment (such as stocks or bonds).\nThe exclusion is limited to the price charged nonemployee customers multiplied by the following percentage.\n-\nFor a discount on property, your employer's gross profit percentage (gross profit divided by gross sales) on all property sold during the employer's previous tax year. (Ask your employer for this percentage.)\n-\nFor a discount on services, 20% (0.20).\nFinancial counseling fees paid for you by your employer are included in your income and must be reported as part of wages. Fees for tax or investment counseling are miscellaneous itemized deductions and are no longer deductible.\nQualified retirement planning services paid for you by your employer may be excluded from your income. For more information, see Retirement Planning Services, later.\nIn most cases, the cost of up to $50,000 of group-term life insurance coverage provided to you by your employer (or former employer) isn’t included in your income. However, you must include in income the cost of employer-provided insurance that is more than the cost of $50,000 of coverage reduced by any amount you pay toward the purchase of the insurance.\nFor exceptions to this rule, see Entire cost excluded and Entire cost taxed, later.\nIf your employer provided more than $50,000 of coverage, the amount included in your income is reported as part of your wages in Form W-2, box 1. Also, it's shown separately in box 12 with code C.\nGroup-term life insurance.\nThis insurance is term life insurance protection (insurance for a fixed period of time) that:\n-\nProvides a general death benefit,\n-\nIs provided to a group of employees,\n-\nIs provided under a policy carried by the employer, and\n-\nProvides an amount of insurance to each employee based on a formula that prevents individual selection.\nPermanent benefits.\nIf your group-term life insurance policy includes permanent benefits, such as a paid-up or cash surrender value, you must include in your income, as wages, the cost of the permanent benefits minus the amount you pay for them. Your employer should be able to tell you the amount to include in your income.\nAccidental death benefits.\nInsurance that provides accidental or other death benefits but doesn't provide general death benefits (for example, travel insurance) isn’t group-term life insurance.\nFormer employer.\nIf your former employer provided more than $50,000 of group-term life insurance coverage during the year, the amount included in your income is reported as wages in Form W-2, box 1. Also, it's shown separately in box 12 with code C. Box 12 will also show the amount of uncollected social security and Medicare taxes on the excess coverage, with codes M and N. You must pay these taxes with your income tax return. Include them on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 13. For more information, see the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR.\nTwo or more employers.\nYour exclusion for employer-provided group-term life insurance coverage can’t exceed the cost of $50,000 of coverage, whether the insurance is provided by a single employer or multiple employers. If two or more employers provide insurance coverage that totals more than $50,000, the amounts reported as wages on your Forms W-2 won’t be correct. You must figure how much to include in your income. Reduce the amount you figure by any amount reported in Form W-2, box 12, with code C, add the result to the wages reported in box 1, and report the total on your return.\nFiguring the taxable cost.\nUse the following worksheet to figure the amount to include in your income.\nIf you pay any part of the cost of the insurance, your entire payment reduces, dollar for dollar, the amount you would otherwise include in your income. However, you can’t reduce the amount to include in your income by:\n-\nPayments for coverage in a different tax year;\n-\nPayments for coverage through a cafeteria plan, unless the payments are after-tax contributions; or\n-\nPayments for coverage not taxed to you because of the exceptions discussed later under Entire cost excluded.\nWorksheet 1.

Both employers provide group-term life insurance coverage for you for the entire year. Your coverage is $35,000 with employer A and $45,000 with employer B. You pay premiums of $4.15 a month under the employer B group plan. You figure the amount to include in your income as follows.\nWorksheet 1.

Include this amount in your income as wages | 12. | 33.00 |\nThe total amount to include in income for the cost of excess group-term life insurance is $33. Neither employer provided over $50,000 insurance coverage, so the wages shown on your Forms W-2 don't include any part of that $33. You must add it to the wages shown on your Forms W-2 and include the total on your return.\nEntire cost excluded.\nYou aren't taxed on the cost of group-term life insurance if any of the following circumstances apply.\n-\nYou’re permanently and totally disabled and have ended your employment.\n-\nYour employer is the beneficiary of the policy for the entire period the insurance is in force during the tax year.\n-\nA charitable organization to which contributions are deductible is the only beneficiary of the policy for the entire period the insurance is in force during the tax year. (You aren’t entitled to a deduction for a charitable contribution for naming a charitable organization as the beneficiary of your policy.)\n-\nThe plan existed on January 1, 1984, and:\n-\nYou retired before January 2, 1984, and were covered by the plan when you retired; or\n-\nYou reached age 55 before January 2, 1984, and were employed by the employer or its predecessor in 1983.\n-\nEntire cost taxed.\nYou’re taxed on the entire cost of group-term life insurance if either of the following circumstances applies.\n-\nThe insurance is provided by your employer through a qualified employees' trust, such as a pension trust or a qualified annuity plan.\n-\nYou’re a key employee and your employer's plan discriminates in favor of key employees.\nYou don't include in your income the value of meals and lodging provided to you and your family by your employer at no charge if the following conditions are met.\n-\nThe meals are:\n-\nFurnished on the business premises of your employer, and\n-\nFurnished for the convenience of your employer.\n-\n-\nThe lodging is:\n-\nFurnished on the business premises of your employer,\n-\nFurnished for the convenience of your employer, and\n-\nA condition of your employment. (You must accept it in order to be able to properly perform your duties.)\n-\nYou also don't include in your income the value of meals or meal money that qualifies as a minimal fringe benefit. See De Minimis (Minimal) Benefits, earlier.\nFaculty lodging.\nIf you're an employee of an educational institution or an academic health center and you're provided with lodging that doesn't meet the three conditions given earlier, you may still not have to include the value of the lodging in income. However, the lodging must be qualified campus lodging, and you must pay an adequate rent.\nAcademic health center.\nThis is an organization that meets the following conditions.\n-\nIts principal purpose or function is to provide medical or hospital care or medical education or research.\n-\nIt receives payments for graduate medical education under the Social Security Act.\n-\nOne of its principal purposes or functions is to provide and teach basic and clinical medical science and research using its own faculty.\nQualified campus lodging.\nQualified campus lodging is lodging furnished to you, your spouse, or any of your dependents by, or on behalf of, the institution or center for use as a home. The lodging must be located on or near a campus of the educational institution or academic health center.\nAdequate rent.\nThe amount of rent you pay for the year for qualified campus lodging is considered adequate if it's at least equal to the lesser of:\n-\n5% of the appraised value of the lodging, or\n-\nThe average of rentals paid by individuals (other than employees or students) for comparable lodging held for rent by the educational institution.\nThe lodging must be appraised by an independent appraiser and the appraisal must be reviewed on an annual basis.\nExample 4.\nYou’re a sociology professor for State University and rent a home from the university that is qualified campus lodging. The house is appraised at $200,000. The average rent paid for comparable university lodging by persons other than employees or students is $14,000 a year. You pay an annual rent of $11,000. You don’t include in your income any rental value because the rent you pay equals at least 5% of the appraised value of the house (5% × $200,000 = $10,000). If you paid annual rent of only $8,000, you would have to include $2,000 in your income ($10,000 − $8,000).\nFor tax years 2018 through 2025, reimbursements for certain moving expenses are no longer excluded from the gross income of nonmilitary taxpayers.\nThe value of services you receive from your employer for free, at cost, or for a reduced price isn't included in your income if your employer:\n-\nOffers the same service for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the line of business in which you work, and\n-\nDoesn’t have a substantial additional cost (including any sales income given up) to provide you with the service (regardless of what you paid for the service).\nIn most cases, no-additional-cost services are excess capacity services, such as airline, bus, or train tickets; hotel rooms; and telephone services.\nExample 5.\nYou're employed as a flight attendant for a company that owns both an airline and a hotel chain. Your employer allows you to take personal flights (if there is an unoccupied seat) and stay in any one of their hotels (if there is an unoccupied room) at no cost to you. The value of the personal flight isn't included in your income. However, the value of the hotel room is included in your income because you don't work in the hotel business.\nIf your employer has a qualified retirement plan, qualified retirement planning services provided to you (and your spouse) by your employer aren't included in your income. Qualified services include retirement planning advice, information about your employer's retirement plan, and information about how the plan may fit into your overall individual retirement income plan. You can't exclude the value of any tax preparation, accounting, legal, or brokerage services provided by your employer. Also, see Financial Counseling Fees, earlier.\nIf your employer provides you with a qualified transportation fringe benefit, it can be excluded from your income, up to certain limits. A qualified transportation fringe benefit is:\nCash reimbursement by your employer for these expenses under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement is also excludable. However, cash reimbursement for a transit pass is excludable only if a voucher or similar item that can be exchanged only for a transit pass isn't readily available for direct distribution to you.\nExclusion limit.\nThe exclusion for commuter vehicle transportation and transit pass fringe benefits can't be more than $315 a month.\nThe exclusion for the qualified parking fringe benefit can't be more than $315 a month.\nIf the benefits have a value that is more than these limits, the excess must be included in your income.\nCommuter highway vehicle.\nThis is a highway vehicle that seats at least six adults (not including the driver). At least 80% of the vehicle's mileage must reasonably be expected to be:\n-\nFor transporting employees between their homes and workplace, and\n-\nOn trips during which employees occupy at least half of the vehicle's adult seating capacity (not including the driver).\nTransit pass.\nThis is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item entitling a person to ride mass transit (whether public or private) free or at a reduced rate or to ride in a commuter highway vehicle operated by a person in the business of transporting persons for compensation.\nQualified parking.\nThis is parking provided to an employee at or near the employer's place of business. It also includes parking provided on or near a location from which the employee commutes to work by mass transit, in a commuter highway vehicle, or by car pool. It doesn't include parking at or near the employee's home.\nYou can exclude a qualified tuition reduction from your income. This is the amount of a reduction in tuition:\n-\nFor education (below graduate level) furnished by an educational institution to an employee, former employee who retired or became disabled, or their spouse and dependent children;\n-\nFor education furnished to a graduate student at an educational institution if the graduate student is engaged in teaching or research activities for that institution; or\n-\nRepresenting payment for teaching, research, or other services if you receive the amount under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program or the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance program.\nIf your employer provides you with a product or service and the cost of it would have been allowable as a business or depreciation deduction if you paid for it yourself, the cost isn't included in your income.\nExample 6.\nYou work as an engineer and your employer provides you with a subscription to an engineering trade magazine. The cost of the subscription isn't included in your income because the cost would have been allowable to you as a business deduction if you had paid for the subscription yourself.\nIf a fringe benefit is included in your income, the amount included is generally its value determined under the general valuation rule or under the special valuation rules. For an exception, see Employer-Provided Group-Term Life Insurance, earlier.\nGeneral valuation rule.\nYou must include in your income the amount by which the FMV of the fringe benefit is more than the sum of:\n-\nThe amount, if any, you paid for the benefit, plus\n-\nThe amount, if any, specifically excluded from your income by law.\nFringe benefit FMV.\nThe FMV of a fringe benefit is determined by all the facts and circumstances. It’s the amount you would have to pay a third party to buy or lease the benefit. This is determined without regard to:\n-\nYour perceived value of the benefit, or\n-\nThe amount your employer paid for the benefit.\nEmployer-provided vehicles.\nIf your employer provides a car (or other highway motor vehicle) to you, your personal use of the car is usually a taxable noncash fringe benefit.\nUnder the General valuation rule, the value of an employer-provided vehicle is the amount you would have to pay a third party to lease the same or a similar vehicle on the same or comparable terms in the same geographic area where you use the vehicle. An example of a comparable lease term is the amount of time the vehicle is available for your use, such as a 1-year period. The value can't be determined by multiplying a cents-per-mile rate times the number of miles driven unless you prove the vehicle could have been leased on a cents-per-mile basis. See Notice 2021-7 for more information on temporary relief for employers and employees using the automobile lease valuation rule to determine the value of an employer-provided vehicle in 2020 or 2021. The special valuation rule used for 2021 under the Notice must continue to be used by the employer and the employee for all subsequent years, except to the extent the employer uses the commuting valuation rule. See Special valuation rules below.\nFlights on employer-provided aircraft.\nUnder the general valuation rules, if your flight on an employer-provided piloted aircraft is primarily personal and you control the use of the aircraft for the flight, the value is the amount it would cost to charter the flight from a third party.\nIf there is more than one employee on the flight, the cost to charter the aircraft must be divided among those employees. The division must be based on all the facts, including which employee or employees control the use of the aircraft.\nSpecial valuation rules.\nGenerally, you can use a special valuation rule for a fringe benefit only if your employer uses the rule. If your employer uses a special valuation rule, you can't use a different special rule to value that benefit. You can always use the General valuation rule discussed earlier, based on facts and circumstances, even if your employer uses a special rule.\nIf you and your employer use a special valuation rule, you must include in your income the amount your employer determines under the special rule minus the sum of:\n-\nAny amount you repaid your employer, plus\n-\nAny amount specifically excluded from income by law.\nFor more information on these rules, see Pub. 15-B.\nFor information on the noncommercial flight and commercial flight valuation rules, see sections 1.61-21(g) and 1.61-21(h) of the regulations.\nRetirement Plan Contributions\nExcept for Roth contributions, your employer's contributions to a qualified retirement plan for you aren’t included in income at the time contributed. (Your employer can tell you whether your retirement plan is qualified.) However, the cost of life insurance coverage included in the plan may have to be included.\nIf your employer pays into a nonqualified plan for you, you must generally include the contributions in your income as wages for the tax year in which the contributions are made. However, if your interest in the plan isn't transferable or is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (you have a good chance of losing it) at the time of the contribution, you don't have to include the value of your interest in your income until it's transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.\n.For information on distributions from retirement plans, see Pub. 575 (or Pub. 721 if you’re a federal employee or retiree)..\nIf you’re covered by certain kinds of retirement plans, you can choose to have part of your compensation contributed by your employer to a retirement fund, rather than have it paid to you. The amount you set aside (called an “elective deferral”) is treated as an employer contribution to a qualified plan. An elective deferral, other than a designated Roth contribution (discussed later), isn't included in wages subject to income tax at the time contributed. However, it’s included in wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes.\nElective deferrals include elective contributions to the following retirement plans.\n-\nCash or deferred arrangements (section 401(k) plans).\n-\nThe TSP for federal employees.\n-\nSalary reduction simplified employee pension plans (SARSEP plans).\n-\nSavings incentive match plans for employees (SIMPLE plans).\n-\nTax-sheltered annuity plans (section 403(b) plans).\n-\nSection 501(c)(18)(D) plans. (But see Reporting by employer, later.)\n-\nSection 457 plans.\nQualified automatic contribution arrangements.\nUnder a qualified automatic contribution arrangement, your employer can treat you as having elected to have a part of your compensation contributed to a section 401(k) plan. You’re to receive written notice of your rights and obligations under the qualified automatic contribution arrangement. The notice must explain:\n-\nYour rights to elect not to have elective contributions made, or to have contributions made at a different percentage; and\n-\nHow contributions made will be invested in the absence of any investment decision by you.\nYou must be given a reasonable period of time after receipt of the notice and before the first elective contribution is made to make an election with respect to the contributions.\nOverall limit on deferrals.\nFor 2024, you shouldn't have deferred more than a total of $23,000 of contributions to the plans listed in (1) through (3), earlier, unless you are 50 or older. The specific plan limits for the plans listed in (4) through (7), earlier, are discussed later. Amounts deferred under specific plan limits are part of the overall limit on deferrals.\nYour employer or plan administrator should apply the proper annual limit when figuring your plan contributions. However, you’re responsible for monitoring the total you defer to ensure that the deferrals aren't more than the overall limit.\nCatch-up contributions.\nYou may be allowed catch-up contributions (additional elective deferrals) if you're age 50 or older by the end of your tax year. For 2024, the catch-up limit for section 401(k) and 403(b) plans, the TSP, SARSEP plans, and governmental section 457 plans is $7,500. For SIMPLE plans, it’s generally $3,500.\nA higher catch-up limit may apply to participants in certain SIMPLE plans. You should contact your plan administrator for more information.\nFor more information about catch-up contributions to:\n-\nSection 401(k) plans, see Elective Deferrals in chapter 4 of Pub. 560;\n-\nSARSEPs, see Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pensions in chapter 2 of Pub. 560;\n-\nSIMPLE plans, see SIMPLE Plans in chapter 3 of Pub. 560; and\n-\nSection 457 plans, see Limit for deferrals under section 457 plans, later.\nLimit for deferrals under SIMPLE plans.\nIf you're a participant in a SIMPLE plan, you generally shouldn't have deferred more than $16,000 in 2024. Amounts you defer under a SIMPLE plan count toward the overall limit ($23,000 for 2024) and may affect the amount you can defer under other elective deferral plans.\nA higher limit may apply to participants in certain SIMPLE plans. You should contact your plan administrator for more information.\nLimit for tax-sheltered annuities.\nIf you're a participant in a tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan), the limit on elective deferrals for 2024 is generally $23,000. However, if you have at least 15 years of service with a public school system, a hospital, a home health service agency, a health and welfare service agency, a church, or a convention or association of churches (or associated organization), the limit on elective deferrals is increased by the least of the following amounts.\n-\n$3,000.\n-\n$15,000, reduced by the sum of:\n-\nThe additional pre-tax elective deferrals made in earlier years because of this rule, plus\n-\nThe aggregate amount of designated Roth contributions permitted for prior tax years because of this rule.\n-\n-\n$5,000 times the number of your years of service for the organization, minus the total elective deferrals made by your employer on your behalf for earlier years.\nIf you qualify for the 15-year rule, your elective deferrals under this limit can be as high as $26,000 for 2024.\nFor more information, see Pub. 571.\nLimit for deferral under section 501(c)(18) plans.\nIf you're a participant in a section 501(c)(18) plan (a trust created before June 25, 1959, funded only by employee contributions), you should have deferred no more than the lesser of $7,000 or 25% of your compensation. Amounts you defer under a section 501(c)(18) plan count toward the overall limit ($23,000 in 2024) and may affect the amount you can defer under other elective deferral plans.\nLimit for deferrals under section 457 plans.\nIf you're a participant in a section 457 plan (a deferred compensation plan for employees of state or local governments or tax-exempt organizations), you should have deferred no more than the lesser of your includible compensation or $23,000 in 2024. However, if you're within 3 years of normal retirement age, you may be allowed an increased limit if the plan allows it. See Increased limit, later.\nIncludible compensation.\nGenerally, this is your Form W-2 wages plus elective deferrals. In most cases, it includes all the following payments.\n-\nWages and salaries.\n-\nFees for professional services.\n-\nThe value of any employer-provided qualified transportation fringe benefit (defined under Transportation, earlier) that isn't included in your income.\n-\nOther amounts received (cash or noncash) for personal services you performed, including, but not limited to, the following items.\n-\nCommissions and tips.\n-\nFringe benefits.\n-\nBonuses.\n-\nDe minimis financial incentives to make elective deferrals to a qualified cash or deferred arrangement.\n-\n-\nEmployer contributions (elective deferrals) to the following.\n-\nThe section 457 plan.\n-\nSection 401(k) plans that aren't included in your income.\n-\nA SARSEP plan.\n-\nA tax-sheltered annuity (section 403(b) plan).\n-\nA SIMPLE plan.\n-\nA section 125 cafeteria plan.\n-\nInstead of using the amounts listed earlier to determine your includible compensation, your employer can use any of the following amounts.\n-\nYour wages as defined for income tax withholding purposes.\n-\nYour wages as reported in Form W-2, box 1.\n-\nYour wages that are subject to social security withholding (including elective deferrals).\nIncreased limit.\nDuring any, or all, of the last 3 years ending before you reach normal retirement age under the plan, your plan may provide that your limit is the lesser of:\n-\nTwice the annual limit ($46,000 for 2024), or\n-\nThe basic annual limit plus the amount of the basic limit not used in prior years (only allowed if not using age 50-or-over catch-up contributions).\nCatch-up contributions.\nYou can generally have additional elective deferrals made to your governmental section 457 plan if:\n-\nYou reached age 50 by the end of the year, and\n-\nNo other elective deferrals can be made for you to the plan for the year because of limits or restrictions.\nDesignated Roth contributions.\nEmployers with section 401(k) plans, section 403(b) plans, and governmental section 457 plans can create qualified Roth contribution programs so that you may elect to have part or all of your elective deferrals to the plan designated as after-tax Roth contributions. Designated Roth contributions are treated as elective deferrals, except that they're included in income. Your retirement plan must maintain separate accounts and recordkeeping for the designated Roth contributions. In addition, your retirement plan may allow you to designate certain nonelective contributions or matching contributions as Roth contributions. These Roth contributions are also included in income.\nQualified distributions from a Roth account aren't included in income. A distribution made before the end of the 5-tax-year period beginning with the first tax year for which a Roth contribution was made to the account isn't a qualified distribution.\nReporting by employer.\nYour employer generally shouldn't include elective deferrals in your wages in Form W-2, box 1. Instead, your employer should mark the Retirement plan checkbox in box 13 and show the total amount deferred in box 12.\nSection 501(c)(18)(D) contributions.\nWages shown in Form W-2, box 1, shouldn't have been reduced for contributions you made to a section 501(c)(18)(D) plan. The amount you contributed should be identified with code H in box 12. You may deduct the amount deferred subject to the limits that apply. Include your deduction in the total on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24f.\nDesignated Roth contributions.\nThese contributions are elective deferrals but are included in your wages in Form W-2, box 1. Designated Roth contributions to a section 401(k) plan are reported using code AA in box 12, or, for section 403(b) plans, code BB in box 12. Designated Roth contributions to a governmental section 457 plan are reported using code EE in box 12.\nDesignated Roth nonelective contributions and designated Roth matching contributions.\nThese contributions are reported on Form 1099-R for the year in which the contributions are allocated to your account. The total amount of designated Roth nonelective contributions and designated Roth matching contributions that are allocated to your account in the year is reported in box 1 and in box 2a. These contributions are reported using code G in box 7.\nExcess deferrals.\nIf your deferrals exceed the limit, you must notify your plan by the date required by the plan. If the plan permits, the excess amount will be distributed to you. If you participate in more than one plan, you can have the excess paid out of any of the plans that permit these distributions. You must notify each plan by the date required by that plan of the amount to be paid from that particular plan. The plan must then pay you the amount of the excess, along with any income earned on that amount, by April 15 of the following year.\nYou must include the excess deferral in your income for the year of the deferral. File Form 1040 or 1040-SR to add the excess deferral amount to earned income on line 1h.\nExcess not distributed.\nIf you don't take out the excess amount, you can't include it in the cost of the contract even though you included it in your income. Therefore, you're taxed twice on the excess deferral left in the plan—once when you contribute it, and again when you receive it as a distribution (unless the excess deferral was a designated Roth contribution).\nExcess distributed to you.\nIf you take out the excess after the year of the deferral and you receive the corrective distribution by April 15 of the following year, don't include it in income again in the year you receive it. If you receive it later, you must include it in income in both the year of the deferral and the year you receive it (unless the excess deferral was a designated Roth contribution). Any income on the excess deferral taken out is taxable in the tax year in which you take it out. If you take out part of the excess deferral and the income on it, allocate the distribution proportionately between the excess deferral and the income.\nYou should receive a Form 1099-R for the year in which the excess deferral is distributed to you. Use the following rules to report a corrective distribution shown on Form 1099-R for 2024.\n-\nIf the distribution was for a 2024 excess deferral, your Form 1099-R should have code 8 in box 7. Add the excess deferral amount to your wages on your 2024 tax return.\n-\nIf the distribution was for a 2024 excess deferral to a designated Roth account, your Form 1099-R should have codes B and 8 in box 7. Don’t add this amount to your wages on your 2024 return.\n-\nIf the distribution was for a 2023 excess deferral, your Form 1099-R should have code P in box 7. If you didn't add the excess deferral amount to your wages on your 2023 tax return, you must file an amended return on Form 1040-X. If you didn't receive the distribution by April 15, 2024, you must also add it to your wages on your 2024 tax return.\n-\nIf the distribution was for the income earned on an excess deferral, your Form 1099-R should have code 8 in box 7. Add the income amount to your wages on your 2024 income tax return, regardless of when the excess deferral was made.\n.Even though a corrective distribution of excess deferrals is reported on Form 1099-R, it isn't otherwise treated as a distribution from the plan. It can't be rolled over into another plan, and it isn't subject to the additional tax on early distributions. .\nIf you're a highly compensated employee, the total of your elective deferrals made for you for any year under a section 401(k) plan or SARSEP plan may be limited by the average deferrals, as a percentage of pay, made by all eligible non-highly compensated employees.\nIf you contributed more to the plan than allowed, the excess contributions may be distributed to you. You must include the distribution in your income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1h.\nIf you receive a corrective distribution of excess contributions (and allocable income), it's included in your income in the year of the distribution. The allocable income is the amount of gain or loss through the end of the plan year for which the contribution was made that is allocable to the excess contributions. You should receive a Form 1099-R for the year the excess contributions are distributed to you. Add the distribution to your wages for that year.\n.Even though a corrective distribution of excess contributions is reported on Form 1099-R, it isn't otherwise treated as a distribution from the plan. It can't be rolled over into another plan, and it isn't subject to the additional tax on early distributions. .\nThe amount contributed in 2024 to a defined contribution plan is generally limited to the lesser of 100% of your compensation or $69,000. Under certain circumstances, contributions that exceed these limits (excess annual additions) may be corrected by a distribution of your elective deferrals or a return of your after-tax contributions and earnings from these contributions.\nA corrective payment of excess annual additions consisting of elective deferrals or earnings from your after-tax contributions is fully taxable in the year paid. A corrective payment consisting of your after-tax contributions isn't taxable.\nIf you received a corrective payment of excess annual additions, you should receive a separate Form 1099-R for the year of the payment with code E in box 7. Report the total payment shown in Form 1099-R, box 1, on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 5a. Report the taxable amount shown in Form 1099-R, box 2a, on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 5b.\n. Even though a corrective distribution of excess annual additions is reported on Form 1099-R, it isn't otherwise treated as a distribution from the plan. It can't be rolled over into another plan, and it isn't subject to the additional tax on early distributions. .\nStock Options\nEmployee stock options aren’t subject to Railroad Retirement Tax.\nIn Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2067, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that “money remuneration” is “currency issued by a recognized authority as a medium of exchange,” and that employee stock options aren’t “money remuneration” subject to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA). Tier 1 and Tier 2 taxes aren’t withheld when employees covered by the RRTA exercise stock options. Federal income tax must still be withheld on taxable compensation from railroad employees exercising their options. If you receive an option to buy or sell stock or other property as payment for your services, you may have income when you receive the option (the grant), when you exercise the option (use it to buy or sell the stock or other property), or when you sell or otherwise dispose of the option or property acquired through exercise of the option. The timing, type, and amount of income inclusion depend on whether you receive a nonstatutory stock option or a statutory stock option. Your employer can tell you which kind of option you hold.\nGrant of option.\nIf you're granted a nonstatutory stock option, you may have income when you receive the option. The amount of income to include and the time to include it depend on whether the FMV of the option can be readily determined. The FMV of an option can be readily determined if it’s actively traded on an established market.\nThe FMV of an option that isn't traded on an established market can be readily determined only if all of the following conditions exist.\n-\nYou can transfer the option.\n-\nYou can exercise the option immediately in full.\n-\nThe option or the property subject to the option isn't subject to any condition or restriction (other than a condition to secure payment of the purchase price) that has a significant effect on the FMV of the option.\n-\nThe FMV of the option privilege can be readily determined.\n.If you or a member of your family is an officer, director, or more-than-10% owner of an expatriated corporation, you may owe an excise tax on the value of nonstatutory options and other stock-based compensation from that corporation. For more information on the excise tax, see section 4985..\nOption with readily determinable value.\nIf you receive a nonstatutory stock option that has a readily determinable FMV at the time it's granted to you, the option is treated like other property received as compensation. See Restricted Property, later, for rules on how much income to include and when to include it. However, the rule described in that discussion for choosing to include the value of property in your income for the year of the transfer doesn't apply to a nonstatutory option.\nOption without readily determinable value.\nIf the FMV of the option isn't readily determinable at the time it's granted to you (even if it's determined later), you don't have income until you exercise or transfer the option.\nExercise or transfer of option.\nWhen you exercise a nonstatutory stock option, the amount to include in your income depends on whether the option had a readily determinable value.\nOption with readily determinable value.\nWhen you exercise a nonstatutory stock option that had a readily determinable value at the time the option was granted, you don't have to include any amount in income.\nOption without readily determinable value.\nWhen you exercise a nonstatutory stock option that didn't have a readily determinable value at the time the option was granted, the restricted property rules apply to the property received. The amount to include in your income is the difference between the amount you pay for the property and its FMV when it becomes substantially vested. If it isn't substantially vested at the time you exercise this nonstatutory stock option (so that you may have to give the stock back), you don't have to include any amount in income. You include the difference in income when the option becomes substantially vested. For more information on restricted property, see Restricted Property, later.\nTransfer in arm's-length transaction.\nIf you transfer a nonstatutory stock option without a readily determinable value in an arm's-length transaction to an unrelated person, you must include in your income the money or other property you received for the transfer as if you had exercised the option.\nTransfer in non-arm's-length transaction.\nIf you transfer a nonstatutory stock option without a readily determinable value in a non-arm's-length transaction (for example, a gift), the option isn't treated as exercised or closed at that time. You must include in your income, as compensation, any money or property received. When the transferee exercises the option, you must include in your income, as compensation, the excess of the FMV of the stock acquired by the transferee over the sum of the exercise price paid and any amount you included in income at the time you transferred the option. At the time of the exercise, the transferee recognizes no income and has a basis in the stock acquired equal to the FMV of the stock.\nAny transfer of this kind of option to a related person is treated as a non-arm's-length transaction. See Regulations section 1.83-7 for the definition of a related person.\nRecourse note in satisfaction of the exercise price of an option.\nIf you're an employee, and you issue a recourse note to your employer in satisfaction of the exercise price of an option to acquire your employer's stock, and your employer and you subsequently agree to reduce the stated principal amount of the note, you generally recognize compensation income at the time and in the amount of the reduction.\nTax form.\nIf you have income from the exercise of nonstatutory stock options, your employer should report the amount to you in Form W-2, box 12, with code V. The employer should show the spread (that is, the FMV of stock over the exercise price of options granted to you for that stock) from your exercise of the nonstatutory stock options. Your employer should include this amount in boxes 1, 3 (up to the social security wage base), and 5. Your employer should include this amount in box 14 if it's a railroad employer.\nIf you're a nonemployee spouse and you exercise nonstatutory stock options you received incident to a divorce, the income is reported to you in box 3 of Form 1099-MISC.\nSale of the stock.\nThere are no special income rules for the sale of stock acquired through the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option. Report the sale as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040) for the year of the sale. You may receive a Form 1099-B reporting the sales proceeds.\nYour basis in the property you acquire under the option is the amount you pay for it plus any amount you included in income upon grant or exercise of the option.\nYour holding period begins as of the date you acquired the option, if it had a readily determinable value, or as of the date you exercised or transferred the option if it had no readily determinable value.\nFor options granted on or after January 1, 2014, the basis information reported to you on Form 1099-B won't reflect any amount you included in income upon grant or exercise of the option. For options granted before January 1, 2014, any basis information reported to you on Form 1099-B may or may not reflect any amount you included in income upon grant or exercise; therefore, the basis may need to be adjusted.\n.It’s your responsibility to make any appropriate adjustments to the basis information reported on Form 1099-B by completing Form 8949..\nThere are two kinds of statutory stock options.\n-\nIncentive stock options (ISOs).\n-\nOptions granted under employee stock purchase plans.\nFor either kind of option, you must be an employee of the company granting the option, or a related company, at all times during the period beginning on the date the option is granted and ending 3 months before the date you exercise the option (for an ISO, 1 year before if you're disabled). Also, the option must be nontransferable except at death.\nIf you don't meet the employment requirements, or you receive a transferable option, your option is a nonstatutory stock option.\nGrant of option.\nIf you receive a statutory stock option, don't include any amount in your income when the option is granted.\nExercise of option.\nIf you exercise a statutory stock option, don't include any amount in income when you exercise the option.\nAlternative minimum tax (AMT).\nFor the AMT, you must treat stock acquired through the exercise of an ISO as if no special treatment applied. This means that, when your rights in the stock are transferable or no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, you must include as an adjustment in figuring alternative minimum taxable income the amount by which the FMV of the stock exceeds the option price. Enter this adjustment on Form 6251, line 2i. Increase your AMT basis in any stock you acquire by exercising the ISO by the amount of the adjustment. However, no adjustment is required if you dispose of the stock in the same year you exercise the option.\nSee Restricted Property, later, for more information.\n.Your AMT basis in stock acquired through an ISO is likely to differ from your regular tax basis. Therefore, keep adequate records for both the AMT and regular tax so that you can figure your adjusted gain or loss. .\nExample 7.\nYour employer, Elm Company, granted you an ISO on April 8, 2023, to buy 100 shares of Elm Company at $9 a share, its FMV at the time. You exercised the option on January 7, 2024, when the stock was selling on the open market for $14 a share. On January 27, 2024, when the stock was selling on the open market for $16 a share, your rights to the stock first became transferable. You include $700 ($1,600 value when your rights first became transferable minus $900 option price) as an adjustment on Form 6251, line 2i.\n. If you exercise an ISO during 2024, you should receive Form 3921, or a statement, from the corporation for each transfer made during 2024. The corporation must send or provide you with the form by January 31, 2025. Keep this information for your records. .\nSale of the stock.\nYou have taxable income or a deductible loss when you sell the stock that you bought by exercising the option. Your income or loss is the difference between the amount you paid for the stock (the option price) and the amount you receive when you sell it. You generally treat this amount as capital gain or loss and report it as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040) for the year of the sale.\nHowever, you may have ordinary income for the year that you sell or otherwise dispose of the stock in either of the following situations.\n-\nYou don't satisfy the holding period requirement.\n-\nYou satisfy the conditions described under Option granted at a discount under Employee stock purchase plan, later.\nFor options granted on or after January 1, 2014, the basis information reported to you on Form 1099-B won't reflect any amount you included in income upon grant or exercise of the option. For options granted before January 1, 2014, any basis information reported to you on Form 1099-B may or may not reflect any amount you included in income upon grant or exercise; therefore, the basis may need to be adjusted.\n.It’s your responsibility to make any appropriate adjustments to the basis information reported on Form 1099-B by completing Form 8949..\nHolding period requirement.\nYou satisfy the holding period requirement if you don't sell the stock until the end of the later of the 1-year period after the stock was transferred to you or the 2-year period after the option was granted. However, you're considered to satisfy the holding period requirement if you sold the stock to comply with conflict-of-interest requirements.\nYour holding period for the property you acquire when you exercise an option begins on the day after you exercise the option.\nISOs.\nIf you sell stock acquired by exercising an ISO, you need to determine if you satisfied the holding period requirement.\nHolding period requirement satisfied.\nIf you sell stock acquired by exercising an ISO and satisfy the holding period requirement, your gain or loss from the sale is capital gain or loss. Report the sale as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). The basis of your stock is the amount you paid for the stock.\nHolding period requirement not satisfied.\nIf you sell stock acquired by exercising an ISO, don't satisfy the holding period requirement, and have a gain from the sale, the gain is ordinary income up to the amount by which the stock's FMV when you exercised the option exceeded the option price. Any excess gain is capital gain. If you have a loss from the sale, it's a capital loss and you don't have any ordinary income.\nYour employer or former employer should report the ordinary income to you as wages in Form W-2, box 1, and you must report this ordinary income amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a. If your employer or former employer doesn't provide you with a Form W-2, or if the Form W-2 doesn't include the ordinary income in box 1, you must report the ordinary income as wages on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8k, for the year of the sale or other disposition of the stock. Report the capital gain or loss as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). In determining capital gain or loss, your basis is the amount you paid when you exercised the option plus the amount reported as wages.\nExample 8.\nYour employer, Oak Corporation, granted you an ISO on March 12, 2022, to buy 100 shares of Oak Corporation stock at $10 a share, its FMV at the time. You exercised the option on January 7, 2023, when the stock was selling on the open market for $12 a share. On January 27, 2024, you sold the stock for $15 a share. Although you held the stock for more than a year, less than 2 years had passed from the time you were granted the option. In 2024, you must report the difference between the option price ($10) and the value of the stock when you exercised the option ($12) as wages. The rest of your gain is capital gain, figured as follows.\n| Selling price ($15 × 100 shares) | $ 1,500 |\n| Purchase price ($10 × 100 shares) | − 1,000 |\n| Gain | $ 500 |\n| Amount reported as wages | |\n| [($12 × 100 shares) − $1,000] | − 200 |\n| Amount reported as capital gain | $ 300 |\nEmployee stock purchase plan.\nIf you sold stock acquired by exercising an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan, you need to determine if you satisfied the holding period requirement.\nHolding period requirement satisfied.\nIf you sold stock acquired by exercising an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan, and you satisfy the holding period requirement, determine your ordinary income as follows.\nYour basis is equal to the option price at the time you exercised your option and acquired the stock. The timing and amount of pay period deductions don't affect your basis.\nExample 9.\nPine Company has an employee stock purchase plan. The option price is the lower of the stock price at the time the option is granted or at the time the option is exercised. The value of the stock when the option was granted was $25. Pine Company deducts $5 from Adrian's pay every week for 48 weeks (total = $240 ($5 × 48)). The value of the stock when the option is exercised is $20. Adrian receives 12 shares of Pine Company’s stock ($240 ÷ $20). Adrian's holding period for all 12 shares begins the day after the option is exercised, even though the money used to purchase the shares was deducted from Adrian's pay on 48 separate days. Adrian's basis in each share is $20.\nOption granted at a discount.\nIf, at the time the option was granted, the option price per share was less than 100% (but not less than 85%) of the FMV of the share, and you dispose of the share after meeting the holding period requirement, or you die while owning the share, you must include in your income as compensation the lesser of:\n-\nThe excess of the FMV of the share at the time the option was granted over the option price, or\n-\nThe excess of the FMV of the share at the time of the disposition or death over the amount paid for the share under the option.\nAny excess gain is capital gain. If you have a loss from the sale, it's a capital loss, and you don't have any ordinary income.\nExample 10.\nYour employer, Willow Corporation, granted you an option under its employee stock purchase plan to buy 100 shares of stock of Willow Corporation for $20 a share at a time when the stock had a value of $22 a share. Eighteen months later, when the value of the stock was $23 a share, you exercised the option, and 14 months after that you sold your stock for $30 a share. In the year of sale, you must report as wages the difference between the option price ($20) and the value at the time the option was granted ($22). The rest of your gain ($8 per share) is capital gain, figured as follows.\n| Selling price ($30 × 100 shares) | $ 3,000 |\n| Purchase price (option price) | |\n| ($20 × 100 shares) | − 2,000 |\n| Gain | $ 1,000 |\n| Amount reported as wages | |\n| [($22 × 100 shares) − $2,000] | − 200 |\n| Amount reported as capital gain | $ 800 |\nHolding period requirement not satisfied.\nIf you don't satisfy the holding period requirement, your ordinary income is the amount by which the stock's FMV when you exercised the option exceeded the option price. This ordinary income isn't limited to your gain from the sale of the stock. Increase your basis in the stock by the amount of this ordinary income. The difference between your increased basis and the selling price of the stock is a capital gain or loss.\nExample 11.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 10, except that you sold the stock only 6 months after you exercised the option. You didn't satisfy the holding period requirement, so you must report $300 as wages and $700 as capital gain, figured as follows.\n| Selling price ($30 × 100 shares) | $3,000 |\n| Purchase price (option price) | |\n| ($20 × 100 shares) | − 2,000 |\n| Gain | $1,000 |\n| Amount reported as wages | |\n| [($23 × 100 shares) − $2,000] | − 300 |\n| Amount reported as capital gain | |\n| [$3,000 – ($2,000 + $300)] | $700 |\n.If you sold stock in 2024 that you acquired by exercising an option granted at a discount under an employee stock purchase plan, you should receive Form 3922 from the corporation. The corporation must send or provide you with the form by January 31, 2025. Keep this information for your records. .\nQualified Equity Grants\nP.L. 115-97 made a change in the law that allows a new election for “qualified employees” of private corporations to elect to defer income taxation for up to 5 years from the date of vesting on “qualified stock” granted in connection with broad-based compensatory stock option and restricted stock unit (RSU) programs. This election is available for stock attributable to options exercised or RSUs settled after 2017. The corporation must have a written plan providing an RSU or option to at least 80% of U.S. employees. The recipients must have the same rights and privileges under an RSU or option plan.\nThe term “qualified employee” doesn’t include:\n-\n1% owner of corporation (current or any point during the prior 10 calendar years),\n-\nCurrent or former CEO or CFO (current or any point previously),\n-\nFamily of previously mentioned individuals, or\n-\nOne of the four highest compensated officers (current or any point during the prior 10 calendar years).\nThe term “qualified stock” means any stock in a corporation that is the employer of the employee if:\n-\nStock is received relating to the exercise of an option, or\n-\nStock is received in settlement of an RSU, and\n-\nAn option or RSU was granted by the corporation.\nThe term “qualified stock” can’t include stock from stock-settled stock appreciation rights or restricted stock awards (restricted property). It won’t include any stock if the employee may receive cash instead of stock. The election is made in a manner similar to the election described under Choosing to include in income for year of transfer, later, under Restricted Property, even though the “qualified stock” isn't restricted property. The election must be made no later than 30 days after the first date the rights of the employee in such stock are transferable or aren’t subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. See Restricted Property, later, for how to make the choice.\nIf an employee elects to defer income inclusion under the provision, the income must be included in the employee's income for the year that includes the earliest of (1) the first date the qualified stock becomes transferable, (2) the date the employee first becomes an excluded employee (as excluded from “qualified employee”), (3) the first date on which any stock of the employer becomes readily tradable on an established securities market, (4) the date 5 years after the first date the employee's right to the stock becomes substantially vested, or (5) the date on which the employee revokes their inclusion deferral election.\nThe employer corporation is required to provide notification of rights to employees covered under a qualified program or face penalties. There will be withholding at the highest marginal rate.\nRestricted Property\nIn most cases, if you receive property for your services, you must include its FMV in your income in the year you receive the property. However, if you receive stock or other property that has certain restrictions that affect its value, you don't include the value of the property in your income until it has been substantially vested. (You can choose to include the value of the property in your income in the year it's transferred to you, as discussed later, rather than the year it's substantially vested.)\nUntil the property becomes substantially vested, it's owned by the person who makes the transfer to you, usually your employer. However, any income from the property, or the right to use the property, is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property.\nWhen the property becomes substantially vested, you must include its FMV, minus any amount you paid for it, in your income for that year. Your holding period for this property begins when the property becomes substantially vested.\nExample 12.\nYour employer, the Holly Corporation, sells you 100 shares of its stock at $10 a share. At the time of the sale, the FMV of the stock is $100 a share. Under the terms of the sale, the stock is under a substantial risk of forfeiture (you have a good chance of losing it) for a 5-year period. Your stock isn't substantially vested when it's transferred, so you don't include any amount in your income in the year you buy it. At the end of the 5-year period, the FMV of the stock is $200 a share. You must include $19,000 in your income [100 shares × ($200 FMV − $10 you paid)]. Dividends paid by the Holly Corporation on your 100 shares of stock are taxable to you as additional compensation during the period the stock can be forfeited.\nSubstantially vested.\nProperty is substantially vested when:\n-\nIt’s transferable, or\n-\nIt isn't subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (you don't have a good chance of losing it).\nTransferable property.\nProperty is transferable if you can sell, assign, or pledge your interest in the property to any person (other than the transferor), and if the person receiving your interest in the property isn't required to give up the property, or its value, if the substantial risk of forfeiture occurs.\nSubstantial risk of forfeiture.\nGenerally, a substantial risk of forfeiture exists only if rights in property that are transferred are conditioned, directly or indirectly, on the future performance (or refraining from performance) of substantial services by any person, or on the occurrence of a condition related to a purpose of the transfer if the possibility of forfeiture is substantial.\nExample 13.\nThe Redwood Corporation transfers to you as compensation for services 100 shares of its corporate stock for $100 a share. Under the terms of the transfer, you must resell the stock to the corporation at $100 a share if you leave your job for any reason within 3 years from the date of transfer. You must perform substantial services over a period of time, and you must resell the stock to the corporation at $100 a share (regardless of its value) if you don't perform the services; so, your rights to the stock are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.\nChoosing to include in income for year of transfer.\nYou can choose to include the value of restricted property at the time of transfer (minus any amount you paid for the property) in your income for the year it's transferred. If you make this choice, the substantial vesting rules don't apply and, generally, any later appreciation in value isn't included in your compensation when the property becomes substantially vested. Your basis for figuring gain or loss when you sell the property is the amount you paid for it plus the amount you included in income as compensation.\n.If you make this choice, you can't revoke it without the consent of the IRS. Consent will be given only if you were under a mistake of fact as to the underlying transaction. .\nIf you forfeit the property after you have included its value in income, your loss is the amount you paid for the property minus any amount you realized on the forfeiture.\n.You can't make this choice for a nonstatutory stock option..\nHow to make the choice.\nYou make the choice by filing a written statement with the Internal Revenue Service Center where you file your return. You must file this statement no later than 30 days after the date the property was transferred. Mail your statement to the address listed for your state under “Are requesting a refund or aren’t enclosing a check or money order...” given in Where Do You File in the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR. You must give a copy of this statement to the person for whom you performed the services and, if someone other than you received the property, to that person.\nYou must sign the statement and indicate on it that you're making the choice under section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The statement must contain all of the following information.\n-\nYour name, address, and TIN.\n-\nA description of each property for which you're making the choice.\n-\nThe date or dates on which the property was transferred and the tax year for which you're making the choice.\n-\nThe nature of any restrictions on the property.\n-\nThe FMV at the time of transfer (ignoring restrictions except those that will never lapse) of each property for which you're making the choice.\n-\nAny amount that you paid for the property.\n-\nA statement that you have provided copies to the appropriate persons.\n.You can't make this choice for a nonstatutory stock option. .\nDividends received on restricted stock.\nDividends you receive on restricted stock are treated as compensation and not as dividend income. Your employer should include these payments on your Form W-2. If they are also reported on a Form 1099-DIV, you should list them on Schedule B (Form 1040), with a statement that you have included them as wages. Don’t include them in the total dividends received.\nStock you chose to include in your income.\nDividends you receive on restricted stock you chose to include in your income in the year transferred are treated the same as any other dividends. You should receive a Form 1099-DIV showing these dividends. Don’t include the dividends in your wages on your return. Report them as dividends.\nSale of property not substantially vested.\nThese rules apply to the sale or other disposition of property that you didn't choose to include in your income in the year transferred and that isn't substantially vested.\nIf you sell or otherwise dispose of the property in an arm's-length transaction, include in your income as compensation for the year of sale the amount realized minus the amount you paid for the property. If you exchange the property in an arm's-length transaction for other property that isn't substantially vested, treat the new property as if it were substituted for the exchanged property.\nThe sale or other disposition of a nonstatutory stock option to a related person isn't considered an arm's-length transaction. See Regulations section 1.83-7 for the definition of a “related person.”\nIf you sell the property in a transaction that isn't at arm's length, include in your income as compensation for the year of sale the total of any money you received and the FMV of any substantially vested property you received on the sale. In addition, you'll have to report income when the original property becomes substantially vested, as if you still held it. Report as compensation its FMV minus the total of the amount you paid for the property and the amount included in your income from the earlier sale.\nExample 14.\nIn 2021, you paid your employer $50 for a share of stock that had an FMV of $100 and was subject to forfeiture until 2024. In 2023, you sold the stock to your spouse for $10 in a transaction not at arm's length. You had compensation of $10 from this transaction. In 2024, when the stock had an FMV of $120, it became substantially vested. For 2023, you must report additional compensation of $60, figured as follows.\n| FMV of stock at time of substantial vesting | $120 | |\n| Minus: Amount paid for stock | $50 | |\n| Minus: Compensation previously included in income from sale to spouse | 10 | − 60 |\n| Additional income | $60 |\nInherited property not substantially vested.\nIf you inherit property not substantially vested at the time of the decedent's death, any income you receive from the property is considered income in respect of a decedent and is taxed according to the rules for restricted property received for services. For information about income in respect of a decedent, see Pub. 559.\nSpecial Rules for Certain Employees\nThis part of the publication deals with special rules for people in certain types of employment: members of the clergy, members of religious orders, people working for foreign employers, military personnel, and volunteers.\nClergy\nIf you’re a member of the clergy, you must include in your income offerings and fees you receive for marriages, baptisms, funerals, masses, etc., in addition to your salary. If the offering is made to the religious institution, it isn't taxable to you.\nIf you’re a member of a religious organization and you give your outside earnings to the organization, you must still include the earnings in your income. However, you may be entitled to a charitable contribution deduction for the amount paid to the organization. See Pub. 526. Also, see Members of Religious Orders, later.\nPension.\nA pension or retirement pay for a member of the clergy is usually treated as any other pension or annuity. It must be reported on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\nSpecial rules for housing apply to members of the clergy. Under these rules, you don't include in your income the fair rental value of a home (including utilities) or a designated housing allowance provided to you as part of your pay. However, the exclusion can't be more than the reasonable pay for your service. If you pay for the utilities, you can exclude any allowance designated for utility cost, up to your actual cost. The home or allowance must be provided as compensation for your services as an ordained, licensed, or commissioned minister. However, you must include the fair rental value of the home or the housing allowance as earnings from self-employment on Schedule SE (Form 1040) if you’re subject to the self-employment tax. For more information, see Pub. 517.\nMembers of Religious Orders\nIf you're a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty, how you treat earnings that you renounce and turn over to the order depends on whether your services are performed for the order.\nServices performed for the order.\nIf you're performing the services as an agent of the order in the exercise of duties required by the order, don't include in your income the amounts turned over to the order.\nIf your order directs you to perform services for another agency of the supervising church or an associated institution, you're considered to be performing the services as an agent of the order. Any wages you earn as an agent of an order that you turn over to the order aren't included in your income.\nExample 15.\nYou're a member of a church order and have taken a vow of poverty. You renounce any claims to your earnings and turn over to the order any salaries or wages you earn. You're a registered nurse, so your order assigns you to work in a hospital that is an associated institution of the church. However, you remain under the general direction and control of the order. You're considered to be an agent of the order and any wages you earn at the hospital that you turn over to your order aren't included in your income.\nServices performed outside the order.\nIf you're directed to work outside the order, your services aren't an exercise of duties required by the order unless they meet both of the following requirements.\n-\nThey're the kind of services that are ordinarily the duties of members of the order.\n-\nThey're part of the duties that you must exercise for, or on behalf of, the religious order as its agent.\nExample 16.\nYou’re a member of a religious order and have taken a vow of poverty. You renounce all claims to your earnings and turn over your earnings to the order.\nYou’re a schoolteacher. You were instructed by the superiors of the order to get a job with a private tax-exempt school. You became an employee of the school, and, at your request, the school made the salary payments directly to the order.\nBecause you’re an employee of the school, you’re performing services for the school rather than as an agent of the order. The wages you earn working for the school are included in your income.\nExample 17.\nYou're a member of a religious order who, as a condition of membership, have taken vows of poverty and obedience. All claims to your earnings are renounced. You received permission from the order to establish a private practice as a psychologist and counsel members of religious orders as well as nonmembers. Although the order reviews your budget annually, you control not only the details of your practice but also the means by which your work as a psychologist is accomplished.\nYour private practice as a psychologist doesn't make you an agent of the religious order. The psychological services you provide aren't the type of services that are provided by the order. The income you earn as a psychologist is earned in your individual capacity. You must include in your income the earnings from your private practice.\nForeign Employer\nSpecial rules apply if you work for a foreign employer.\nU.S. citizen.\nIf you're a U.S. citizen who works in the United States for a foreign government, an international organization, a foreign embassy, or any foreign employer, you must include your salary in your income.\nSocial security and Medicare taxes.\nYou're exempt from social security and Medicare employee taxes if you're employed in the United States by an international organization or a foreign government. However, you must pay self-employment tax on your earnings from services performed in the United States, even though you aren't self-employed. This rule also applies if you're an employee of a qualifying wholly owned instrumentality of a foreign government.\nEmployees of international organizations or foreign governments.\nYour compensation for official services to an international organization is exempt from federal income tax if you aren't a citizen of the United States or you're a citizen of the Philippines (whether or not you're a citizen of the United States).\nYour compensation for official services to a foreign government is exempt from federal income tax if all of the following are true.\n-\nYou aren't a citizen of the United States or you're a citizen of the Philippines (whether or not you're a citizen of the United States).\n-\nYour work is like the work done by employees of the United States in foreign countries.\n-\nThe foreign government gives an equal exemption to employees of the United States in its country.\nWaiver of alien status.\nIf you're an alien who works for a foreign government or international organization and you file a waiver under section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to keep your immigrant status, any salary you receive after the date you file the waiver isn't exempt under this rule. However, it may be exempt under a treaty or agreement. See Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for more information about treaties.\nNonwage income.\nThis exemption applies only to employees' wages, salaries, and fees. Pensions and other income, such as investment income, don't qualify for this exemption.\nMilitary\nPayments you receive as a member of a military service are generally taxed as wages except for retirement pay, which is taxed as a pension. Allowances generally aren't taxed. For more information on the tax treatment of military allowances and benefits, see Pub. 3.\nDifferential wage payments.\nAny payments made to you by an employer during the time you're performing service in the uniformed services are treated as compensation. These wages are subject to income tax withholding and are reported on Form W-2. See the discussion under Miscellaneous Compensation, earlier.\nMilitary retirement pay.\nIf your retirement pay is based on age or length of service, it’s taxable and must be included in your income as a pension on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Don’t include in your income the amount of any reduction in retirement or retainer pay to provide a survivor annuity for your spouse or children under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan or the Survivor Benefit Plan.\nFor a more detailed discussion of survivor annuities, see Pub. 575.\nDisability.\nIf you're retired on disability, see Military and Government Disability Pensions under Sickness and Injury Benefits, later.\nQualified reservist distribution (QRD).\nIf you received a QRD of all or part of the balance in your health FSA because you're a reservist and you have been ordered or called to active duty for a period of 180 days or more, the QRD is treated as wages and is reportable on Form W-2.\nVeterans' benefits.\nDon’t include in your income any veterans' benefits paid under any law, regulation, or administrative practice administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The following amounts paid to veterans or their families aren't taxable.\n-\nEducation, training, and subsistence allowances.\n-\nDisability compensation and pension payments for disabilities paid either to veterans or their families.\n-\nGrants for homes designed for wheelchair living.\n-\nGrants for motor vehicles for veterans who lost their sight or the use of their limbs.\n-\nVeterans' insurance proceeds and dividends paid either to veterans or their beneficiaries, including the proceeds of a veteran's endowment policy paid before death.\n-\nInterest on insurance dividends left on deposit with the VA.\n-\nBenefits under a dependent-care assistance program.\n-\nThe death gratuity paid to a survivor of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces who died after September 10, 2001.\n-\nPayments made under the compensated work therapy program.\n-\nAny bonus payment by a state or political subdivision because of service in a combat zone.\nNote.\nIf, in a previous year, you received a bonus payment by a state or political subdivision because of service in a combat zone that you included in your income, you can file a claim for refund of the taxes on that income. Use Form 1040-X to file the claim. File a separate form for each tax year involved. In most cases, you must file your claim within 3 years after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. See the Instructions for Form 1040-X for information on filing that form.\nVolunteers\nThe tax treatment of amounts you receive as a volunteer is covered in the following discussions.\nPeace Corps.\nLiving allowances you receive as a Peace Corps volunteer or volunteer leader for housing, utilities, household supplies, food, and clothing are exempt from tax.\nTaxable allowances.\nThe following allowances must be included in your income and reported as wages.\n-\nAllowances paid to your spouse and minor children while you're a volunteer leader training in the United States.\n-\nLiving allowances designated by the Director of the Peace Corps as basic compensation. These are allowances for personal items such as domestic help, laundry and clothing maintenance, entertainment and recreation, transportation, and other miscellaneous expenses.\n-\nLeave allowances.\n-\nReadjustment allowances or termination payments. These are considered received by you when credited to your account.\nExample 18.\nYou’re a Peace Corps volunteer and get $175 a month as a readjustment allowance during your period of service, to be paid to you in a lump sum at the end of your tour of duty. Although the allowance isn't available to you until the end of your service, you must include it in your income on a monthly basis as it’s credited to your account.\nVolunteers in Service to America (VISTA).\nIf you're a VISTA volunteer, you must include meal and lodging allowances paid to you in your income as wages.\nNational Senior Service Corps programs.\nDon’t include in your income amounts you receive for supportive services or reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses from the following programs.\nService Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE).\nIf you receive amounts for supportive services or reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses from SCORE, don't include these amounts in gross income.\nVolunteer tax counseling.\nDon’t include in your income any reimbursements you receive for transportation, meals, and other expenses you have in training for, or actually providing, volunteer federal income tax counseling for the elderly (TCE).\nYou can deduct as a charitable contribution your unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses in taking part in the volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) program.\nVolunteer firefighters and emergency medical responders.\nIf you’re a volunteer firefighter or emergency medical responder, do not include in your income the following benefits you receive from a state or local government.\n-\nRebates or reductions of property or income taxes you receive because of services you performed as a volunteer firefighter or emergency medical responder.\n-\nPayments you receive because of services you performed as a volunteer firefighter or emergency medical responder, up to $50 for each month you provided services.\nThe excluded income reduces any related tax or contribution deduction.\nBusiness and Investment Income\nThis section provides information on the treatment of income from certain rents and royalties, and from interests in partnerships and S corporations.\nNote.\nYou may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). The NIIT is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of net investment income or the excess of your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over a threshold amount. For details, see Form 8960 and its instructions.\n.Income from sales at auctions, including online auctions, may be business income. For more information, see Pub. 334..\nRents From Personal Property\nIf you rent out personal property, such as equipment or vehicles, how you report your income and expenses is in most cases determined by:\n-\nWhether or not the rental activity is a business, and\n-\nWhether or not the rental activity is conducted for profit.\nReporting business income and expenses.\nIf you're in the business of renting personal property, report your income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040). The form instructions have information on how to complete them.\nReporting nonbusiness income.\nIf you aren't in the business of renting personal property, report your rental income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8l.\nReporting nonbusiness expenses.\nIf you rent personal property for profit, include your rental expenses in the total amount you enter on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24b.\nIf you don't rent personal property for profit, your deductions are limited and you can't report a loss to offset other income. See Activity not for profit under Other Income, later.\nRoyalties\nRoyalties from copyrights; patents; and oil, gas, and mineral properties are taxable as ordinary income.\nIn most cases, you report royalties on Schedule E (Form 1040). However, if you hold an operating oil, gas, or mineral interest or are in business as a self-employed writer, inventor, artist, etc., report your income and expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040).\nCopyrights and patents.\nRoyalties from copyrights on literary, musical, or artistic works, and similar property, or from patents on inventions, are amounts paid to you for the right to use your work over a specified period of time. Royalties are generally based on the number of units sold, such as the number of books, tickets to a performance, or machines sold.\nName, Image, Likeness (NIL).\nNIL is a term that describes the means through which student-athletes are allowed to receive financial compensation. NIL refers to the use of a student-athlete's name, image, or likeness for commercial purposes through marketing and promotional endeavors. This can include such things as autograph signings, product endorsements, licensing and merchandising agreements, participating in advertising campaigns, social media posts, teaching camps or lessons, and more.\nOil, gas, and minerals.\nRoyalty income from oil, gas, and mineral properties is the amount you receive when natural resources are extracted from your property. The royalties are generally based on production or revenue and are paid to you by a person or company who leases the property from you.\nDepletion.\nIf you're the owner of an economic interest in mineral deposits or oil and gas wells, you can recover your investment through the depletion allowance.\nCoal and iron ore.\nUnder certain circumstances, you can treat amounts you receive from the disposal of coal and iron ore as payments from the sale of a capital asset, rather than as royalty income. For information about gain or loss from the sale of coal and iron ore, see chapter 2 of Pub. 544.\nSale of property interest.\nIf you sell your complete interest in oil, gas, or mineral rights, the amount you receive is considered payment for the sale of section 1231 property, not royalty income. Under certain circumstances, the sale is subject to capital gain or loss treatment as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). For more information on selling section 1231 property, see chapter 3 of Pub. 544.\nIf you retain a royalty, an overriding royalty, or a net profit interest in a mineral property for the life of the property, you have made a lease or a sublease, and any cash you receive for the assignment of other interests in the property is ordinary income subject to a depletion allowance.\nPart of future production sold (carved out production payment).\nIf you own mineral property but sell part of the future production, in most cases you treat the money you receive from the buyer at the time of the sale as a loan from the buyer. Don’t include it in your income or take depletion based on it.\nWhen production begins, you include all the proceeds in your income, deduct all the production expenses, and deduct depletion from that amount to arrive at your taxable income from the property.\nPartnership Income\nA partnership generally isn't a taxable entity. The income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits of a partnership are passed through to the partners based on each partner's distributive share of these items. For more information, see Pub. 541.\nPartner's distributive share.\nYour distributive share of partnership income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits is generally based on the partnership agreement. You must report your distributive share of these items on your return whether or not they are actually distributed to you. However, your distributive share of the partnership losses is limited to the adjusted basis of your partnership interest at the end of the partnership year in which the losses took place.\nPartnership agreement.\nThe partnership agreement usually covers the distribution of profits, losses, and other items. However, if the agreement doesn't state how a specific item of gain or loss will be shared, or the allocation stated in the agreement doesn't have substantial economic effect, your distributive share is figured according to your interest in the partnership.\nPartnership return.\nAlthough a partnership generally pays no tax, it must file an information return on Form 1065. This shows the result of the partnership's operations for its tax year and the items that must be passed through to the partners.\nSchedule K-1 (Form 1065).\nYou should receive from each partnership in which you're a member a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) showing your share of income, deductions, credits, and tax preference items of the partnership for the tax year. Keep Schedule K-1 for your records. Don’t attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR, unless you're specifically required to do so.\nPartner's return.\nYou must generally report partnership items on your individual return the same way as they're reported on the partnership return. That is, if the partnership had a capital gain, you report your share as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). You report your share of partnership ordinary income on Schedule E (Form 1040).\n. In many cases, Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) will tell you where to report an item of income on your individual return..\nQualified joint venture.\nIf you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a qualified joint venture instead of a partnership. To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. For further information on how to make the election and which schedule(s) to file, see the instructions for your individual tax return.\nS Corporation Income\nIn most cases, an S corporation doesn't pay tax on its income. Instead, the income, losses, deductions, and credits of the corporation are passed through to the shareholders based on each shareholder's pro rata share. You must report your share of these items on your return. In most cases, the items passed through to you will increase or decrease the basis of your S corporation stock as appropriate.\nS corporation return.\nAn S corporation must file a return on Form 1120-S. This shows the results of the corporation's operations for its tax year and the items of income, losses, deductions, or credits that affect the shareholders' individual income tax returns.\nSchedule K-1 (Form 1120-S).\nYou should receive a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) from any S corporation in which you're a shareholder. Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) shows your share of income, losses, deductions, and credits for the tax year. Keep Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) for your records. Don’t attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR, unless you're specifically required to do so.\nShareholder's return.\nYour distributive share of the items of income, losses, deductions, or credits of the S corporation must be shown separately on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. The character of these items is generally the same as if you had realized or incurred them personally.\n.In many cases, Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) will tell you where to report an item of income on your individual return..\nDistributions.\nIn most cases, S corporation distributions are a nontaxable return of your basis in the corporation stock. However, in certain cases, part of the distributions may be taxable as a dividend, or as a long-term or short-term capital gain, or as both. The corporation's distributions may be in the form of cash or property.\nSickness and Injury Benefits\nIn most cases, you must report as income any amount you receive for personal injury or sickness through an accident or health plan that is paid for by your employer. If both you and your employer pay for the plan, only the amount you receive that is due to your employer's payments is reported as income. However, certain payments may not be taxable to you. For information on nontaxable payments, see Military and Government Disability Pensions and Other Sickness and Injury Benefits, later in this discussion.\n.Don’t report as income any amounts paid to reimburse you for medical expenses you incurred after the plan was established..\nCost paid by you.\nIf you pay the entire cost of an accident or health plan, don't include any amounts you receive from the plan for personal injury or sickness as income on your tax return. If your plan reimbursed you for medical expenses you deducted in an earlier year, you may have to include some, or all, of the reimbursement in your income. See Recoveries under Miscellaneous Income, later.\nCafeteria plans.\nIn most cases, if you're covered by an accident or health insurance plan through a cafeteria plan, and the amount of the insurance premiums wasn't included in your income, you aren't considered to have paid the premiums and you must include any benefits you receive in your income. If the amount of the premiums was included in your income, you're considered to have paid the premiums and any benefits you receive aren't taxable.\nDisability Pensions\nIf you retired on disability, you must include in income any disability pension you receive under a plan that is paid for by your employer. You must report your taxable disability payments on line 1h of Form 1040 or 1040-SR until you reach minimum retirement age. Minimum retirement age is generally the age at which you can first receive a pension or annuity if you aren't disabled.\n.You may be entitled to a tax credit if you were permanently and totally disabled when you retired. For information on this credit, see Pub. 524..\nBeginning on the day after you reach minimum retirement age, payments you receive are taxable as a pension or annuity. Report the payments on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more information on pensions and annuities, see Pub. 575.\nTerrorist attacks or military action.\nDon’t include in your income disability payments you receive for injuries incurred as a direct result of terrorist attacks or military action directed against the United States (or its allies), whether outside or within the United States. In the case of the September 11 attacks, injuries eligible for coverage by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund are treated as incurred as a direct result of the attack. However, you must include in your income any amounts that you received that you would have received in retirement had you not become disabled as a result of a terrorist attack or military action. Accordingly, you must include in your income any payments you receive from a 401(k), pension, or other retirement plan to the extent that you would have received the amount at the same or later time regardless of whether you had become disabled. See Pub. 907.\nA terrorist action is one that is directed against the United States or any of its allies (including a multinational force in which the United States is participating). A military action is one that involves the U.S. Armed Forces and is a result of actual or threatened violence or aggression against the United States or any of its allies, but doesn't include training exercises.\n.Contact the company or agency making these payments if it incorrectly reports your payments as taxable income to the IRS on Form W-2, or on Form 1099-R, to request that it reissue the form to report some or all of these payments as nontaxable income in box 12 (under code J) of Form W-2 or in box 1 but not in box 2a of Form 1099-R. If income taxes are being incorrectly withheld from these payments, you may also submit Form W-4 to the company or agency to stop the withholding of income taxes from payments reported on Form W-2 or you may submit Form W-4P to stop the withholding of income taxes from payments reported on Form 1099-R..\nDisability payments you receive for injuries not incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack or military action or for illnesses or diseases not resulting from an injury incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack or military action can't be excluded from your income under this provision but may be excludable for other reasons. See Pub. 907.\nRetirement and profit-sharing plans.\nIf you receive payments from a retirement or profit-sharing plan that doesn't provide for disability retirement, don't treat the payments as a disability pension. The payments must be reported as a pension or annuity.\nAccrued leave payment.\nIf you retire on disability, any lump-sum payment you receive for accrued annual leave is a salary payment. The payment isn't a disability payment. Include it in your income in the tax year you receive it.\nCertain military and government disability pensions aren't taxable.\nService-connected disability.\nYou may be able to exclude from income amounts you receive as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance for personal injury or sickness resulting from active service in one of the following government services.\nConditions for exclusion.\nDon’t include the disability payments in your income if any of the following conditions apply.\n-\nYou were entitled to receive a disability payment before September 25, 1975.\n-\nYou were a member of a listed government service or its reserve component, or were under a binding written commitment to become a member, on September 24, 1975.\n-\nYou receive the disability payments for a combat-related injury. This is a personal injury or sickness that:\n-\nResults directly from armed conflict;\n-\nTakes place while you're engaged in extra-hazardous service;\n-\nTakes place under conditions simulating war, including training exercises such as maneuvers; or\n-\nIs caused by an instrumentality of war.\n-\n-\nYou would be entitled to receive disability compensation from the VA if you filed an application for it. Your exclusion under this condition is equal to the amount you would be entitled to receive from the VA.\nPension based on years of service.\nIf you receive a disability pension based on years of service, in most cases, you must include it in your income. However, if the pension qualifies for the exclusion for a service-connected disability (discussed earlier), don't include in income the part of your pension that you would have received if the pension had been based on a percentage of disability. You must include the rest of your pension in your income.\nRetroactive VA determination.\nIf you retire from the U.S. Armed Forces based on years of service and are later given a retroactive service-connected disability rating by the VA, your retirement pay for the retroactive period is excluded from income up to the amount of VA disability benefits you would have been entitled to receive. You can claim a refund of any tax paid on the excludable amount (subject to the statute of limitations) by filing an amended return on Form 1040-X for each previous year during the retroactive period. You must include with each Form 1040-X a copy of the official VA determination letter granting the retroactive benefit. The letter must show the amount withheld and the effective date of the benefit.\nGenerally, the VA determination letter will contain a table with five headings. The table on the letter must cover the same dates for the tax year reported on the Form 1040-X. To calculate the correct tax reduction, multiply the Effective Months by the Amount Withheld for the tax year. For example, Form 1040-X was filed for tax year 2021. The table shows the Amount Withheld effective December 2020 is $320.00. To calculate the amount for the tax reduction, multiply the 2021 Effective Months by the Amount Withheld. In this case, January–December (2021) is 12 months x $320.00 (Amount Withheld) = $3,840.00; this amount should be the amount claimed as a reduction on Line 1 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), Column B, of the 2021 Form 1040-X.\nIf you receive a lump-sum disability severance payment and are later awarded VA disability benefits, exclude 100% of the severance benefit from your income. However, you must include in your income any lump-sum readjustment or other nondisability severance payment you received on release from active duty, even if you're later given a retroactive disability rating by the VA.\nSpecial statute of limitations.\nIn most cases, under the statute of limitations a claim for credit or refund must be filed within 3 years from the time a return was filed. However, if you receive a retroactive service-connected disability rating determination, the statute of limitations is extended by a 1-year period beginning on the date of the determination. This 1-year extended period applies to claims for credit or refund filed after June 17, 2008, and doesn't apply to any tax year that began more than 5 years before the date of the determination.\nExample 19.\nYou retired in 2018 and receive a pension based on your years of service. On August 3, 2024, you receive a determination of service-connected disability retroactive to 2018. Generally, you could claim a refund for the taxes paid on your pension for 2021, 2022, and 2023. However, under the special limitation period, you can also file a claim for 2020 as long as you file the claim by August 3, 2025. You can't file a claim for 2018 and 2019 because those tax years began more than 5 years before the determination.\nCombat-related special compensation.\nCombat-related special compensation, as described under 10 U.S.C. section 1413a, is a specific entitlement only payable to retirees of the Uniformed Services. If you’re in receipt of combat-related special compensation, you may exclude the amount of your combat-related special compensation from your income. Other portions of your military or disability retirement pay may still be included in your income.\nTerrorist attack or military action.\nDon’t include in your income disability payments you receive for injuries resulting directly from a terrorist or military action. In the case of the September 11 attacks, injuries eligible for coverage by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund are treated as incurred as a direct result of the attack. However, you must include in your income any amounts that you received that you would have received in retirement had you not become disabled as a result of a terrorist or military action. Accordingly, you must include in your income any payments you receive from a 401(k), pension, or other retirement plan to the extent that you would have received the amount at the same or later time regardless of whether you had become disabled. Disability payments you receive for injuries not incurred as a direct result of a terrorist or military action or for illnesses or diseases not resulting from an injury incurred as a direct result of a terrorist or military action may be excludable from income for other reasons. See Pub. 907.\nA terrorist action is one that is directed against the United States or any of its allies (including a multinational force in which the United States is participating). A military action is one that involves the U.S. Armed Forces and is a result of actual or threatened violence or aggression against the United States or any of its allies, but doesn't include training exercises.\nLong-Term Care Insurance Contracts\nIn most cases, long-term care insurance contracts are treated as accident and health insurance contracts. Amounts you receive from them (other than policyholder dividends or premium refunds) are excludable in most cases from income as amounts received for personal injury or sickness. To claim an exclusion for payments made on a per diem or other periodic basis under a long-term care insurance contract, you must file Form 8853 with your return.\nA long-term care insurance contract is an insurance contract that only provides coverage for qualified long-term care services. The contract must:\n-\nBe guaranteed renewable;\n-\nNot provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged, or borrowed;\n-\nProvide that refunds, other than refunds on the death of the insured or complete surrender or cancellation of the contract, and dividends under the contract may be used only to reduce future premiums or increase future benefits; and\n-\nIn most cases, not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items that would be reimbursed under Medicare, except where Medicare is a secondary payer or the contract makes per diem or other periodic payments without regard to expenses.\nQualified long-term care services.\nQualified long-term care services are:\n-\nNecessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitative services, and maintenance and personal care services; and\n-\nRequired by a chronically ill individual and provided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner.\nChronically ill individual.\nA chronically ill individual is one who has been certified by a licensed health care practitioner within the previous 12 months as one of the following.\n-\nAn individual who, for at least 90 days, is unable to perform at least two activities of daily living without substantial assistance due to a loss of functional capacity. Activities of daily living are eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence.\n-\nAn individual who requires substantial supervision to be protected from threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive impairment.\nLimit on exclusion.\nThe exclusion for payments made on a per diem or other periodic basis under a long-term care insurance contract is subject to a limit. The limit applies to the total of these payments and any accelerated death benefits made on a per diem or other periodic basis under a life insurance contract because the insured is chronically ill. (For more information on accelerated death benefits, see Life Insurance Proceeds under Miscellaneous Income, later.)\nUnder this limit, the excludable amount for any period is figured by subtracting any reimbursement received (through insurance or otherwise) for the cost of qualified long-term care services during the period from the larger of the following amounts.\n-\nThe cost of qualified long-term care services during the period.\n-\nThe dollar amount for the period ($410 per day for any period in 2024).\nWorkers' Compensation\nAmounts you receive as workers' compensation for an occupational sickness or injury are fully exempt from tax if they're paid under a workers' compensation act or a statute in the nature of a workers' compensation act. The exemption also applies to your survivors. The exemption, however, doesn't apply to retirement plan benefits you receive based on your age, length of service, or prior contributions to the plan, even if you retired because of an occupational sickness or injury.\n.If part of your workers' compensation reduces your social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits received, that part is considered social security (or equivalent railroad retirement) benefits and may be taxable. See Pub. 554 and Pub. 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits, for more information..\nReturn to work.\nIf you return to work after qualifying for workers' compensation, salary payments you receive for performing light duties are taxable as wages.\nDisability pension.\nIf your disability pension is paid under a statute that provides benefits only to employees with service-connected disabilities, part of it may be workers' compensation. That part is exempt from tax. The rest of your pension, based on years of service, is taxable as pension or annuity income. If you die, the part of your survivors' benefit that is a continuation of the workers' compensation is exempt from tax.\nOther Sickness and Injury Benefits\nIn addition to disability pensions and annuities, you may receive other payments for sickness or injury.\nRailroad sick pay.\nPayments you receive as sick pay under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act are taxable and you must include them in your income. However, don't include them in your income if they're for an on-the-job injury.\nBlack lung benefit payments.\nThese payments are similar to workers' compensation and aren't taxable in most cases.\nFederal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA).\nPayments received under FECA for personal injury or sickness, including payments to beneficiaries in case of death, aren't taxable. However, you're taxed on amounts you receive under FECA as continuation of pay for up to 45 days while a claim is being decided. Report this income on line 1a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Also, pay for sick leave while a claim is being processed is taxable and must be included in your income as wages.\n.If part of the payments you receive under FECA reduces your social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits received, that part is considered social security (or equivalent railroad retirement) benefits and may be taxable. See Pub. 554 for more information. .\nQualified Indian health care benefit.\nFor benefits and coverage provided after March 23, 2010, the value of any qualified Indian health care benefit isn't taxable. These benefits include any health service or benefits provided by the Indian Health Service, amounts to reimburse medical care expenses provided by an Indian tribe, coverage under accident or health insurance, and any other medical care provided by an Indian tribe.\nOther compensation.\nMany other amounts you receive as compensation for sickness or injury aren't taxable. These include the following amounts.\n-\nCompensatory damages you receive for physical injury or physical sickness, whether paid in a lump sum or in periodic payments. See Court awards and damages under Other Income, later.\n-\nBenefits you receive under an accident or health insurance policy on which either you paid the premiums or your employer paid the premiums but you had to include them in your income.\n-\nDisability benefits you receive for loss of income or earning capacity as a result of injuries under a no-fault car insurance policy.\n-\nCompensation you receive for permanent loss or loss of use of a part or function of your body, or for your permanent disfigurement. This compensation must be based only on the injury and not on the period of your absence from work. These benefits aren't taxable even if your employer pays for the accident and health plan that provides these benefits.\nReimbursement for medical care.\nA reimbursement for medical care is generally not taxable. However, it may reduce your medical expense deduction. If you receive reimbursement for an expense you deducted in an earlier year, see Recoveries, later.\nIf you receive an advance reimbursement or loan for future medical expenses from your employer without regard to whether you suffered a personal injury or sickness or incurred medical expenses, that amount is included in your income, whether or not you incur uninsured medical expenses during the year.\nReimbursements received under your employer's plan for expenses incurred before the plan was established are included in income.\nAmounts you receive under a reimbursement plan that provides for the payment of unused reimbursement amounts in cash or other benefits are included in your income. For details, see Pub. 969.\nMiscellaneous Income\nThis section discusses various types of income. You may have taxable income from certain transactions even if no money changes hands. For example, you may have taxable income if you lend money at a below-market interest rate or have a debt you owe canceled.\nBartering\nBartering is an exchange of property or services. You must include in your income, at the time received, the FMV of property or services you receive in bartering. If you exchange services with another person and you both have agreed ahead of time on the value of the services, that value will be accepted as FMV unless the value can be shown to be otherwise.\nGenerally, you report this income on Schedule C (Form 1040). However, if the barter involves an exchange of something other than services, such as in Example 23, later, you may have to use another form or schedule instead.\nExample 20.\nYou're a self-employed attorney who performs legal services for a client, a small corporation. The corporation gives you shares of its stock as payment for your services. You must include the FMV of the shares in your income on Schedule C (Form 1040) in the year you receive them.\nExample 21.\nYou're a self-employed accountant. You and a house painter are members of a barter club. Members contact each other directly and bargain for the value of the services to be performed. In return for accounting services you provided, the house painter painted your home. You must report as your income on Schedule C (Form 1040) the FMV of the house painting services you received. The house painter must include in income the FMV of the accounting services you provided.\nExample 22.\nYou're self-employed and a member of a barter club. The club uses credit units as a means of exchange. It adds credit units to your account for goods or services you provide to members, which you can use to purchase goods or services offered by other members of the barter club. The club subtracts credit units from your account when you receive goods or services from other members. You must include in your income the value of the credit units that are added to your account, even though you may not actually receive goods or services from other members until a later tax year.\nExample 23.\nYou own a small apartment building. In return for 6 months rent-free use of an apartment, an artist gives you a work of art she created. You must report as rental income on Schedule E (Form 1040) the FMV of the artwork, and the artist must report as income on Schedule C (Form 1040) the fair rental value of the apartment.\nForm 1099-B from barter exchange.\nIf you exchanged property or services through a barter exchange, Form 1099-B or a similar statement from the barter exchange should be sent to you by February 15, 2025. It should show the value of cash, property, services, credits, or scrip you received from exchanges during 2024. The IRS will also receive a copy of Form 1099-B.\nBackup withholding.\nIn most cases, the income you receive from bartering isn't subject to regular income tax withholding. However, backup withholding will apply in certain circumstances to ensure that income tax is collected on this income.\nUnder backup withholding, the barter exchange must withhold, as income tax, 24% of the income if:\n. If tax is withheld from your barter income, the barter exchange will report the amount of tax withheld on Form 1099-B or similar statement. .\nCanceled Debts\nIn most cases, if a debt you owe is canceled or forgiven, other than as a gift or bequest, you must include the canceled amount in your income. You have no income from the canceled debt if it's intended as a gift to you. A debt includes any indebtedness for which you're liable or which attaches to property you hold.\nIf the debt is a nonbusiness debt, report the canceled amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8c. If it's a business debt, report the amount on Schedule C (Form 1040) or on Schedule F (Form 1040) if the debt is farm debt and you're a farmer.\nStarting in 2014, you must include the income you elected to defer in 2009 or 2010 from a cancellation, reacquisition, or modification of a business debt. For information on this election, see Revenue Procedure 2009-37, available at IRS.gov/irb/2009-36_IRB#RP-2009-37.\nForm 1099-C.\nIf a federal government agency, financial institution, or credit union cancels or forgives a debt you owe of $600 or more, you may receive a Form 1099-C. Form 1099-C, box 2, shows the amount of debt either actually or deemed discharged. If you don't agree with the amount reported in box 2, contact your creditor.\nInterest included in canceled debt.\nIf any interest is forgiven and included in the amount of canceled debt in box 2, the amount of interest will also be shown in box 3. Whether or not you must include the interest portion of the canceled debt in your income depends on whether the interest would be deductible if you paid it. See Deductible debt under Exceptions, later.\nIf the interest would not be deductible (such as interest on a personal loan), include in your income the amount from box 2 of Form 1099-C. If the interest would be deductible (such as on a business loan), include in your income the net amount of the canceled debt (the amount shown in box 2 less the interest amount shown in box 3).\nDiscounted mortgage loan.\nIf your financial institution offers a discount for the early payment of your mortgage loan, the amount of the discount is canceled debt. You must include the canceled amount in your income.\nMortgage relief upon sale or other disposition.\nIf you're personally liable for a mortgage (recourse debt), and you're relieved of the mortgage when you dispose of the property, you may realize gain or loss up to the FMV of the property. To the extent the mortgage discharge exceeds the FMV of the property, it's income from discharge of indebtedness unless it qualifies for exclusion under Excluded debt, later. Report any income from discharge of indebtedness on nonbusiness debt that doesn't qualify for exclusion as other income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8c.\n.You may be able to exclude part of the mortgage relief on your principal residence. See Excluded debt, later..\nIf you aren't personally liable for a mortgage (nonrecourse debt), and you're relieved of the mortgage when you dispose of the property (such as through foreclosure), that relief is included in the amount you realize. You may have a taxable gain if the amount you realize exceeds your adjusted basis in the property. Report any gain on nonbusiness property as a capital gain.\nSee Pub. 4681 for more information.\nStockholder debt.\nIf you're a stockholder in a corporation and the corporation cancels or forgives your debt to it, the canceled debt is a constructive distribution that is generally dividend income to you. For more information, see Pub. 542.\nIf you're a stockholder in a corporation and you cancel a debt owed to you by the corporation, you generally don't realize income. This is because the canceled debt is considered as a contribution to the capital of the corporation equal to the amount of debt principal that you canceled.\nRepayment of canceled debt.\nIf you included a canceled amount in your income and later pay the debt, you may be able to file a claim for refund for the year the amount was included in income. You can file a claim on Form 1040-X if the statute of limitations for filing a claim is still open. The statute of limitations generally doesn't end until 3 years after the due date of your original return.\nThere are several exceptions to the inclusion of canceled debt in income. These are explained next.\nStudent loans.\nGenerally, if you’re responsible for making loan payments, and the loan is canceled or repaid by someone else, you must include the amount that was canceled or paid on your behalf in your gross income for tax purposes. However, in certain circumstances, you may be able to exclude amounts from gross income as a result of the cancellation or repayment of certain student loans. These exclusions are for:\n-\nStudent loan cancellation due to meeting certain work requirements;\n-\nCancellation of certain loans after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2026 (see Special rule for student loan discharges for 2021 through 2025); or\n-\nCertain student loan repayment assistance programs.\nExclusion for student loan cancellation due to meeting certain work requirements.\nIf your student loan is canceled in part or in whole in 2024 due to meeting certain work requirements, you may not have to include the canceled debt in your income. To qualify for this work-related exclusion, your loan must have been made by a qualified lender to assist you in attending an eligible educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). In addition, the cancellation must be pursuant to a provision in the student loan that all or part of the debt will be canceled if you work:\n-\nFor a certain period of time,\n-\nIn certain professions, and\n-\nFor any of a broad class of employers.\n.The cancellation of your loan won’t qualify for tax-free treatment if it was made by an educational organization or tax-exempt section 501(c)(3) organization and was canceled because of the services you performed for either organization. See Exception, later..\nEducational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii).\nThis is an educational organization that maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at the place where it carries on its educational activities.\nQualified lenders.\nThese include the following.\n-\nThe United States, or an instrumentality or agency thereof.\n-\nA state or territory of the United States; or the District of Columbia; or any political subdivision thereof.\n-\nA public benefit corporation that is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3); and that has assumed control of a state, county, or municipal hospital; and whose employees are considered public employees under state law.\n-\nAn educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii), if the loan is made:\n-\nAs part of an agreement with an entity described in (1), (2), or (3) under which the funds to make the loan were provided to the educational organization; or\n-\nUnder a program of the educational organization that is designed to encourage its students to serve in occupations with unmet needs or in areas with unmet needs where services provided by the students (or former students) are for or under the direction of a governmental unit or a tax-exempt section 501(c)(3) organization.\n-\nSpecial rule for student loan discharges for 2021 through 2025.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 modified the treatment of student loan forgiveness for discharges in 2021 through 2025. Generally, if you’re responsible for making loan payments, and the loan is canceled or repaid by someone else, you must include the amount that was canceled or paid on your behalf in your gross income for tax purposes. However, in certain circumstances you may be able to exclude this amount from gross income if the loan was one of the following.\n-\nA loan for postsecondary educational expenses.\n-\nA private education loan.\n-\nA loan from an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n-\nA loan from an organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) to refinance a student loan.\nLoan for postsecondary educational expenses.\nThis is any loan provided expressly for postsecondary education, regardless of whether provided through the educational organization or directly to the borrower, if such loan was made, insured, or guaranteed by one of the following.\n-\nThe United States, or an instrumentality or agency thereof.\n-\nA state or territory of the United States; or the District of Columbia; or any political subdivision thereof.\n-\nAn eligible educational organization.\nEligible educational organization.\nAn eligible educational organization is generally any accredited public, nonprofit, or proprietary (privately owned profit-making) college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary educational organization. Also, the organization must be eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.\nAn eligible educational organization also includes certain educational organizations located outside the United States that are eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.\n. The educational organization should be able to tell you if it is an eligible educational organization. .\nPrivate education loan.\nA private education loan is a loan provided by a private educational lender that:\n-\nIs not made, insured, or guaranteed under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965; and\n-\nIs issued expressly for postsecondary educational expenses to a borrower, regardless of whether the loan is provided through the educational organization that the student attends or directly to the borrower from the private educational lender. A private education loan does not include an extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, a reverse mortgage transaction, a residential mortgage transaction, or any other loan that is secured by real property or a dwelling.\nPrivate educational lender.\nA private educational lender is one of the following.\n-\nA financial institution that solicits, makes, or extends private education loans.\n-\nA federal credit union that solicits, makes, or extends private education loans.\n-\nAny other person engaged in the business of soliciting, making, or extending private education loans.\n.The cancellation of your loan won’t qualify for tax-free treatment if it is canceled because of services you performed for the private educational lender that made the loan or other organization that provided the funds..\nLoan from an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii).\nThis is any loan made by the organization if the loan is made:\n-\nAs part of an agreement with an entity described earlier under which the funds to make the loan were provided to the educational organization; or\n-\nUnder a program of the educational organization that is designed to encourage its students to serve in occupations with unmet needs or in areas with unmet needs where the services provided by the students (or former students) are for or under the direction of a governmental unit or a tax-exempt section 501(c)(3) organization.\nEducational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii).\nThis is an educational organization that maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at the place where it carries on its educational activities.\n.The cancellation of your loan won’t qualify for tax-free treatment if it was made by an educational organization, a tax-exempt section 501(c)(3) organization, or a private education lender (as defined in section 140(a)(7) of the Truth in Lending Act) and was canceled because of the services you performed for either such organization or private education lender. See Exception, later..\nSection 501(c)(3) organization.\nThis is any corporation, community chest, fund, or foundation organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the following purposes.\n-\nCharitable.\n-\nReligious.\n-\nEducational.\n-\nScientific.\n-\nLiterary.\n-\nTesting for public safety.\n-\nFostering national or international amateur sports competition (but only if none of its activities involve providing athletic facilities or equipment).\n-\nThe prevention of cruelty to children or animals.\nException.\nIn most cases, the cancellation of a student loan made by an educational organization because of services you performed for that organization or another organization that provided the funds for the loan must be included in gross income on your tax return.\nRefinanced loan.\nIf you refinanced a student loan with another loan from an eligible educational organization or a tax-exempt organization, that loan may also be considered as made by a qualified lender. The refinanced loan is considered made by a qualified lender if it’s made under a program of the refinancing organization that is designed to encourage students to serve in occupations with unmet needs or in areas with unmet needs where the services required of the students are for or under the direction of a governmental unit or a tax-exempt section 501(c)(3) organization.\nStudent loan repayment assistance.\nStudent loan repayments made to you are tax free if you received them for any of the following.\n-\nThe National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program.\n-\nA state education loan repayment program eligible for funds under the Public Health Service Act.\n-\nAny other state loan repayment or loan forgiveness program that is intended to provide for the increased availability of health services in underserved or health professional shortage areas (as determined by such state).\n.You can’t deduct the interest you paid on a student loan to the extent payments were made through your participation in any of the above programs..\nDeductible debt.\nYou don't have income from the cancellation of a debt if your payment of the debt would be deductible. This exception applies only if you use the cash method of accounting. For more information, see chapter 5 of Pub. 334.\nPrice reduced after purchase.\nIn most cases, if the seller reduces the amount of debt you owe for property you purchased, you don't have income from the reduction. The reduction of the debt is treated as a purchase price adjustment and reduces your basis in the property.\nExcluded debt.\nDon’t include a canceled debt in your gross income in the following situations.\n-\nThe debt is canceled in a bankruptcy case under title 11 of the U.S. Code. See Pub. 908.\n-\nThe debt is canceled when you're insolvent. However, you can't exclude any amount of canceled debt that is more than the amount by which you're insolvent. See Pub. 908.\n-\nThe debt is qualified farm debt and is canceled by a qualified person. See chapter 3 of Pub. 225.\n-\nThe debt is qualified real property business debt. See chapter 5 of Pub. 334.\n-\nThe cancellation is intended as a gift.\n-\nThe debt is qualified principal residence indebtedness, discussed next.\nQualified principal residence indebtedness (QPRI).\nThis is debt secured by your principal residence that you took out to buy, build, or substantially improve your principal residence. QPRI can't be more than the cost of your principal residence plus improvements.\nYou must reduce the basis of your principal residence by the amount excluded from gross income. To claim the exclusion, you must file Form 982 with your tax return.\nPrincipal residence.\nYour principal residence is the home where you ordinarily live most of the time. You can have only one principal residence at any one time.\nAmount eligible for exclusion.\nThe exclusion applies only to debt discharged after 2006 and in most cases before 2026. The maximum amount you can treat as QPRI is $750,000 ($375,000 if married filing separately). You can't exclude debt canceled because of services performed for the lender or on account of any other factor not directly related to a decline in the value of your residence or to your financial condition.\nLimitation.\nIf only part of a loan is QPRI, the exclusion applies only to the extent the canceled amount is more than the amount of the loan immediately before the cancellation that isn't QPRI.\nExample 24.\nYou file a joint return. Your principal residence is secured by a debt of $900,000, of which $700,000 is QPRI. Your residence is sold for $600,000 and $300,000 of debt is canceled. Only $100,000 of the canceled debt may be excluded from income (the $300,000 that was discharged minus the $200,000 of nonqualified debt).\nForgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.\nThe forgiveness of a PPP loan creates tax-exempt income, so although you don't need to report the income from the forgiveness of your PPP loan on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, you do need to report certain information related to your PPP loan.\nRevenue Procedure 2021-48, 2021-49 I.R.B. 835, permits taxpayers to treat tax-exempt income resulting from the forgiveness of a PPP loan as received or accrued (1) as, and to the extent that, eligible expenses are paid or incurred; (2) when you apply for forgiveness of the PPP loan; or (3) when forgiveness of the PPP loan is granted. If you have tax-exempt income resulting from the forgiveness of a PPP loan, attach a statement to your return reporting each taxable year for which you’re applying Revenue Procedure 2021-48, and which section of Revenue Procedure 2021-48 you’re applying—either section 3.01(1), (2), or (3). Any statement should include the following information for each PPP loan.\n-\nYour name, address, and ITIN or SSN;\n-\nA statement that you’re applying or applied section 3.01(1), (2), or (3) of Revenue Procedure 2021-48, and for what taxable year;\n-\nThe amount of tax-exempt income from forgiveness of the PPP loan that you’re treating as received or accrued and for what taxable year; and\n-\nWhether forgiveness of the PPP loan has been granted as of the date you file your return.\nWrite “RP 2021-48” at the top of your attached statement.\nHost\nIf you host a party or event at which sales are made, any gift or gratuity you receive for giving the event is a payment for helping a direct seller make sales. You must report this item as income at its FMV.\nYour out-of-pocket party expenses are subject to the 50% limit for meal expenses. For tax years beginning after 2017, no deduction is allowed for any expenses related to activities generally considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation. Taxpayers may continue to deduct 50% of the cost of business meals if the taxpayer (or an employee of the taxpayer) is present and the food or beverages aren’t considered lavish or extravagant. The meals may be provided to a current or potential business customer, client, consultant, or similar business contact. Food and beverages that are provided during entertainment events won’t be considered entertainment if purchased separately from the event.\nFor more information about the limit for meal expenses, see 50% Limit in Pub. 463.\nLife Insurance Proceeds\nLife insurance proceeds paid to you because of the death of the insured person aren't taxable unless the policy was turned over to you for a price. This is true even if the proceeds were paid under an accident or health insurance policy or an endowment contract issued on or before December 31, 1984. However, interest income received as a result of life insurance proceeds may be taxable.\nProceeds not received in installments.\nIf death benefits are paid to you in a lump sum or other than at regular intervals, include in your income only the benefits that are more than the amount payable to you at the time of the insured person's death. If the benefit payable at death isn't specified, you include in your income the benefit payments that are more than the present value of the payments at the time of death.\nProceeds received in installments.\nIf you receive life insurance proceeds in installments, you can exclude part of each installment from your income.\nTo determine the excluded part, divide the amount held by the insurance company (generally, the total lump sum payable at the death of the insured person) by the number of installments to be paid. Include anything over this excluded part in your income as interest.\nExample 25.\nThe face amount of the policy is $75,000 and, as beneficiary, you choose to receive 120 monthly installments of $1,000 each. The excluded part of each installment is $625 ($75,000 ÷ 120), or $7,500 for an entire year. The rest of each payment, $375 a month (or $4,500 for an entire year), is interest income to you.\nInstallments for life.\nIf, as the beneficiary under an insurance contract, you're entitled to receive the proceeds in installments for the rest of your life without a refund or period-certain guarantee, you figure the excluded part of each installment by dividing the amount held by the insurance company by your life expectancy. If there is a refund or period-certain guarantee, the amount held by the insurance company for this purpose is reduced by the actuarial value of the guarantee.\nSurviving spouse.\nIf your spouse died before October 23, 1986, and insurance proceeds paid to you because of the death of your spouse are received in installments, you can exclude up to $1,000 a year of the interest included in the installments. If you remarry, you can continue to take the exclusion.\nEmployer-owned life insurance contract.\nIf you're the policyholder of an employer-owned life insurance contract, you must include in income any life insurance proceeds received that are more than the premiums and any other amounts you paid on the policy. You're subject to this rule if you have a trade or business, you own a life insurance contract on the life of your employee, and you (or a related person) are a beneficiary under the contract.\nHowever, you may exclude the full amount of the life insurance proceeds if the following apply.\n-\nBefore the policy is issued, you provide written notice about the insurance to the employee and the employee provides written consent to be insured.\n-\nEither:\n-\nThe employee was your employee within the 12-month period before death, or, at the time the contract was issued, was a director or highly compensated employee; or\n-\nThe amount is paid to the family or designated beneficiary of the employee.\n-\nInterest option on insurance.\nIf an insurance company pays you interest only on proceeds from life insurance left on deposit, the interest you're paid is taxable.\nIf your spouse died before October 23, 1986, and you chose to receive only the interest from your insurance proceeds, the $1,000 interest exclusion for a surviving spouse doesn't apply. If you later decide to receive the proceeds from the policy in installments, you can take the interest exclusion from the time you begin to receive the installments.\nSurrender of policy for cash.\nIf you surrender a life insurance policy for cash, you must include in income any proceeds that are more than the cost of the life insurance policy. In most cases, your cost (or investment in the contract) is the total of premiums that you paid for the life insurance policy, less any refunded premiums, rebates, dividends, or unrepaid loans that weren’t included in your income.\nYou should receive a Form 1099-R showing the total proceeds and the taxable part. Report these amounts on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\n.For information on when the proceeds are excluded from income, see Accelerated Death Benefits, later..\nSplit-dollar life insurance.\nIn most cases, a split-dollar life insurance arrangement is an arrangement between an owner and a nonowner of a life insurance contract under which either party to the arrangement pays all or part of the premiums, and one of the parties paying the premiums is entitled to recover all or part of those premiums from the proceeds of the contract. There are two mutually exclusive rules to tax split-dollar life insurance arrangements.\n-\nUnder the economic benefit rule, the owner of the life insurance contract is treated as providing current life insurance protection and other taxable economic benefits to the nonowner of the contract.\n-\nUnder the loan rule, the nonowner of the life insurance contract is treated as loaning premium payments to the owner of the contract.\nAn endowment contract is a policy under which you're paid a specified amount of money on a certain date unless you die before that date, in which case the money is paid to your designated beneficiary. Endowment proceeds paid in a lump sum to you at maturity are taxable only if the proceeds are more than the cost (investment in the contract) of the policy. To determine your cost, subtract any amount that you previously received under the contract and excluded from your income from the total premiums (or other consideration) paid for the contract. Include the part of the lump payment that is more than your cost in your income.\nEndowment proceeds that you choose to receive in installments instead of a lump sum payment at the maturity of the policy are taxed as an annuity. This is explained in Pub. 575. For this treatment to apply, you must choose to receive the proceeds in installments before receiving any part of the lump sum. This election must be made within 60 days after the lump-sum payment first becomes payable to you.\nCertain amounts paid as accelerated death benefits under a life insurance contract or viatical settlement before the insured's death are excluded from income if the insured is terminally or chronically ill.\nViatical settlement.\nThis is the sale or assignment of any part of the death benefit under a life insurance contract to a viatical settlement provider. A viatical settlement provider is a person who regularly engages in the business of buying or taking assignment of life insurance contracts on the lives of insured individuals who are terminally or chronically ill and who meets the requirements of section 101(g)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nExclusion for terminal illness.\nAccelerated death benefits are fully excludable if the insured is a terminally ill individual. This is a person who has been certified by a physician as having an illness or physical condition that can reasonably be expected to result in death within 24 months from the date of the certification.\nExclusion for chronic illness.\nIf the insured is a chronically ill individual who isn't terminally ill, accelerated death benefits paid on the basis of costs incurred for qualified long-term care services are fully excludable. Accelerated death benefits paid on a per diem or other periodic basis are excludable up to a limit. For 2024, this limit is $410. It applies to the total of the accelerated death benefits and any periodic payments received from long-term care insurance contracts. For information on the limit and the definitions of chronically ill individual, qualified long-term care services, and long-term care insurance contracts, see Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts under Sickness and Injury Benefits, earlier.\nException.\nThe exclusion doesn't apply to any amount paid to a person (other than the insured) who has an insurable interest in the life of the insured because the insured:\n-\nIs a director, officer, or employee of the person; or\n-\nHas a financial interest in the person's business.\nRecoveries\nA recovery is a return of an amount you deducted or took a credit for in an earlier year. The most common recoveries are refunds, reimbursements, and rebates of itemized deductions. You may also have recoveries of nonitemized deductions (such as payments on previously deducted bad debts) and recoveries of items for which you previously claimed a tax credit.\nTax benefit rule.\nYou must include a recovery in your income in the year you receive it up to the amount by which the deduction or credit you took for the recovered amount reduced your tax in the earlier year. For this purpose, any increase to an amount carried over to the current year that resulted from the deduction or credit is considered to have reduced your tax in the earlier year.\nFederal income tax refund.\nRefunds of federal income taxes aren't included in your income because they're never allowed as a deduction from income.\nState tax refund.\nIf you received a state or local income tax refund (or credit or offset) in 2024, you must generally include it in income if you deducted the tax in an earlier year. The payer should send Form 1099-G to you by January 31, 2025. The IRS will also receive a copy of the Form 1099-G. If you file Form 1040 or 1040-SR, use the worksheet in the 2024 Instructions for Schedule 1 (Form 1040) to figure the amount (if any) to include in your income. See Itemized Deduction Recoveries, later, for when you must use Worksheet 2, later in this publication.\nIf you could choose to deduct for a tax year either:\n-\nState and local income taxes, or\n-\nState and local general sales taxes, then\nExample 26.\nFor 2023, you can choose a $10,000 state income tax deduction or a $9,000 state general sales tax deduction. You choose to deduct the state income tax. In 2024, you receive a $2,500 state income tax refund. The maximum refund that you may have to include in income is $1,000, because you could have deducted $9,000 in state general sales tax.\nExample 27.\nFor 2023, you can choose a $9,500 state general sales tax deduction based on actual expenses or a $9,200 state income tax deduction. You choose to deduct the general sales tax deduction. In 2024, you return an item you had purchased and receive a $500 sales tax refund. In 2024, you also receive a $1,500 state income tax refund. The maximum refund that you may have to include in income is $500, because it's less than the excess of the tax deducted ($9,500) over the tax you didn't choose to deduct ($9,200 − $1,500 = $7,700). Because you didn't choose to deduct the state income tax, you don't include the state income tax refund in income.\nMortgage interest refund.\nIf you received a refund or credit in 2024 of mortgage interest paid in an earlier year, the amount should be shown in Form 1098, box 4. Don’t subtract the refund amount from the interest you paid in 2024. You may have to include it in your income under the rules explained in the following discussions.\nInterest on recovery.\nIf you receive interest on any of the amounts you recover, this interest must be reported as interest income in the year received. For example, report any interest you received on state or local income tax refunds on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 2b.\nRecovery and expense in same year.\nIf the refund or other recovery and the expense occur in the same year, the recovery reduces the deduction or credit and isn't reported as income.\nRecovery for 2 or more years.\nIf you receive a refund or other recovery that is for amounts you paid in 2 or more separate years, you must allocate, on a pro rata basis, the recovered amount between the years in which you paid it. This allocation is necessary to determine the amount of recovery from any earlier years and to determine the amount, if any, of your allowable deduction for this item for the current year.\nExample 28.\nYou paid 2023 estimated state income tax of $4,000 in four equal payments. You made your fourth payment in January 2024. You had no state income tax withheld during 2023. In 2024, you received a $400 tax refund based on your 2023 state income tax return. You claimed itemized deductions each year on Schedule A (Form 1040).\nYou must allocate the $400 refund between 2023 and 2024, the years in which you paid the tax on which the refund is based. You paid 75% ($3,000 ÷ $4,000) of the estimated tax in 2023, so 75% of the $400 refund, or $300, is for amounts you paid in 2023 and is a recovery item. If all of the $300 is a taxable recovery item, you'll include $300 on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 1, for 2024, and attach a copy of your calculation showing why that amount is less than the amount shown on the Form 1099-G you received from the state.\nThe balance ($100) of the $400 refund is for your January 2024 estimated tax payment. When you figure your deduction for state and local income taxes paid during 2024, you'll reduce the $1,000 paid in January by $100. Your deduction for state and local income taxes paid during 2024 will include the January net amount of $900 ($1,000 − $100), plus any estimated state income taxes paid in 2024 for 2024, and any state income tax withheld during 2024.\nJoint state or local income tax return.\nIf you filed a joint state or local income tax return in an earlier year and you aren't filing a joint Form 1040 or 1040-SR with the same person for 2024, any refund of a deduction claimed on that state or local income tax return must be allocated to the person that paid the expense. If both persons paid a portion of the expense, allocate the refund based on your individual portion. For example, if you paid 25% of the expense, then you would use 25% of the refund to figure if you must include any portion of the refund in your income.\nRegistered domestic partners (RDPs) domiciled in community property states.\nFor the rules that apply to RDPs who are domiciled in community property states, see Pub. 555 and Form 8958.\nDeductions not itemized.\nIf you didn't itemize deductions for the year for which you received the recovery of an expense that was deductible only if you itemized, don't include any of the recovery amount in your income.\nExample 29.\nYou claimed the standard deduction on your 2023 federal income tax return. In 2024, you received a refund of your 2023 state income tax. Don’t report any of the refund as income because you didn't itemize deductions for 2023.\nThe following discussion explains how to determine the amount to include in your income from a recovery of an amount deducted in an earlier year as an itemized deduction. However, you generally don't need to use this discussion if you file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and the recovery is for state or local income taxes paid in 2023. Instead, use the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet—Schedule 1, Line 1, in the 2024 Instructions for Schedule 1 (Form 1040) for line 1 to figure the amount (if any) to include in your income. See the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR.\nYou can't use the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet—Schedule 1, Line 1, and must use this discussion if you're a nonresident alien (discussed later) or any of the following statements are true.\n-\nYou received a refund in 2024 that is for a tax year other than 2023.\n-\nYou received a refund other than an income tax refund, such as a general sales tax or real property tax refund, in 2024 of an amount deducted or credit claimed in an earlier year.\n-\nThe amount on your 2023 Form 1040, line 13, was more than the amount on your 2023 Form 1040, line 11 minus line 12.\n-\nYou had taxable income on your 2023 Form 1040, line 15, but no tax on your Form 1040, line 16, because of the 0% tax rate on net capital gains and qualified dividends in certain situations. See Capital gains, later.\n-\nYour 2023 state and local income tax refund is more than your 2023 state and local income tax deduction minus the amount you could have deducted as your 2023 state and local general sales taxes.\n-\nYou made your last payment of 2023 estimated state or local income tax in 2024.\n-\nYou owed AMT in 2023.\n-\nYou couldn't use the full amount of credits you were entitled to in 2023 because the total credits were more than the amount shown on your 2023 Form 1040, line 18.\n-\nYou could be claimed as a dependent by someone else in 2023.\n-\nYou received a refund because of a jointly filed state or local income tax return, but you aren't filing a joint 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR with the same person.\n.If you also recovered an amount deducted as a nonitemized deduction, figure the amount of that recovery to include in your income and add it to your adjusted gross income (AGI) before applying the rules explained here. See Nonitemized Deduction Recoveries, later..\nNonresident aliens.\nIf you're a nonresident alien and file Form 1040-NR, you can't claim the standard deduction. If you recover an itemized deduction that you claimed in an earlier year, you must generally include the full amount of the recovery in your income in the year you receive it. However, if you had no taxable income in that earlier year (see Negative taxable income, later), you should complete Worksheet 2 to determine the amount you must include in income. If any other statement under Total recovery included in income, later, isn't true, see the discussion referenced in the applicable statement to determine the amount to include in income.\nCapital gains.\nIf you determined your tax in the earlier year by using the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, or the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, and you receive a refund in 2024 of a deduction claimed in that year, you'll have to refigure your tax for the earlier year to determine if the recovery must be included in your income. If inclusion of the recovery doesn't change your total tax, you don't include the recovery in income. However, if your total tax increases by any amount, you must include the recovery in your income up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the earlier year.\nTotal recovery included in income.\nIf you recover any itemized deduction that you claimed in an earlier year, you must generally include the full amount of the recovery in your income in the year you receive it. This rule applies if, for the earlier year, all of the following statements are true.\n-\nYour itemized deductions exceeded the standard deduction by at least the amount of the recovery. (If your itemized deductions didn't exceed the standard deduction by at least the amount of the recovery, see Standard deduction limit, later.)\n-\nYou had taxable income. (If you had no taxable income, see Negative taxable income, later.)\n-\nYour deduction for the item recovered equals or exceeds the amount recovered. (If your deduction was less than the amount recovered, see Recovery limited to deduction, later.)\n-\nYou had no unused tax credits. (If you had unused tax credits, see Unused tax credits, later.)\n-\nYou weren’t subject to AMT. (If you were subject to AMT, see Subject to AMT, later.)\nIf any of the earlier statements aren’t true, see Total recovery not included in income, later.\nState tax refund.\nIn addition to the previous five items, you must include in your income the full amount of a refund of state or local income tax or general sales tax if the excess of the tax you deducted over the tax you didn't deduct is more than the refund of the tax deducted.\nIf the refund is more than the excess, see Total recovery not included in income, later.\nWhere to report.\nEnter your state or local income tax refund on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 1, and the total of all other recoveries as other income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nExample 30.\nFor 2023, you filed a joint return on Form 1040. Your taxable income was $60,000 and you weren’t entitled to any tax credits. Your standard deduction was $27,700, and you had itemized deductions of $29,200. In 2024, you received the following recoveries for amounts deducted on your 2023 return.\n| Medical expenses | $200 |\n| State and local income tax refund | 400 |\n| Refund of mortgage interest | 325 |\n| Total recoveries | $925 |\nNone of the recoveries were more than the deductions taken for 2023. The difference between the state and local income tax you deducted and your local general sales tax you could have deducted was more than $400.\nYour total recoveries are less than the amount by which your itemized deductions exceeded the standard deduction ($29,200 − $27,700 = $1,500), so you must include your total recoveries in your income for 2024. Report the state and local income tax refund of $400 on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 1, and the balance of your recoveries, $525, on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nTotal recovery not included in income.\nIf one or more of the five statements listed earlier under Total recovery included in income isn't true, you may be able to exclude at least part of the recovery from your income. See the discussion referenced in the applicable statement. You may be able to use Worksheet 2 to determine the part of your recovery to include in your income. You can also use Worksheet 2 to determine the part of a state tax refund (discussed earlier) to include in income.\nAllocating the included part.\nIf you aren't required to include all of your recoveries in your income, and you have both a state income tax refund and other itemized deduction recoveries, you must allocate the taxable recoveries between the state income tax refund you report on Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-NR), line 1, and the amount you report as other income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-NR), line 8z. If you don't use Worksheet 2, make the allocation as follows.\n-\nDivide your state income tax refund by the total of all your itemized deduction recoveries.\n-\nMultiply the amount of taxable recoveries by the percentage in (1). This is the amount you report as a state income tax refund.\n-\nSubtract the result in (2) above from the amount of taxable recoveries. This is the amount you report as other income.\nExample 31.\nIn 2024, you recovered $2,500 of your 2023 itemized deductions claimed on Schedule A (Form 1040), but the recoveries you must include in your 2024 income are only $1,500. Of the $2,500 you recovered, $500 was due to your state income tax refund. Your state income tax was more than your state general sales tax by $600. The amount you report as a state tax refund on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 1, is $300 [($500 ÷ $2,500) × $1,500]. The balance of the taxable recoveries, $1,200, is reported as other income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nStandard deduction limit.\nYou’re generally allowed to claim the standard deduction if you don't itemize your deductions. Only your itemized deductions that are more than your standard deduction are subject to the recovery rule (unless you're required to itemize your deductions). If your total deductions on the earlier year return weren’t more than your income for that year, include in your income this year the lesser of:\n-\nYour recoveries, or\n-\nThe amount by which your itemized deductions exceeded the standard deduction.\nStandard deduction for earlier years.\nTo determine if amounts recovered in the current year must be included in your income, you must know the standard deduction for your filing status for the year the deduction was claimed. Look in the instructions for your tax return from prior years to locate the standard deduction for the filing status for that prior year. If you filed Form 1040-NR, you couldn't claim the standard deduction except for certain nonresident aliens from India (see Pub. 519).\nExample 32.\nYou filed a joint return on Form 1040 for 2023 with taxable income of $45,000. Your itemized deductions were $27,950. The standard deduction that you could have claimed was $27,700. In 2024, you recovered $2,100 of your 2023 itemized deductions. None of the recoveries were more than the actual deductions for 2023. Include $250 of the recoveries in your 2024 income. This is the smaller of your recoveries ($2,100) or the amount by which your itemized deductions were more than the standard deduction ($27,950 − $27,700 = $250).\nNegative taxable income.\nIf your taxable income for the prior year (Worksheet 2, line 10) was a negative amount, the recovery you must include in income is reduced by that amount. You have a negative taxable income for 2023 if your:\n-\nForm 1040, the sum of lines 12 and 13, was more than line 11; or\n-\nForm 1040-NR, line 14, was more than line 11.\nExample 33.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 32, except line 14 was $200 more than line 11 on your 2023 Form 1040, giving you a negative taxable income of $200. You must include $50 in your 2024 income, rather than $250.\nRecovery limited to deduction.\nYou don't include in your income any amount of your recovery that is more than the amount you deducted in the earlier year. The amount you include in your income is limited to the smaller of:\n-\nThe amount deducted, or\n-\nThe amount recovered.\nExample 34.\nFor 2023, you paid $1,700 for medical expenses. Because of the limit on deducting medical expenses, you deducted only $200 as an itemized deduction. In 2024, you received a $500 reimbursement from your medical insurance for your 2023 expenses. The only amount of the $500 reimbursement that must be included in your income for 2024 is $200, the amount actually deducted.\nOverall limitation on itemized deductions no longer applies.\nFor tax years beginning after 2017, there is no limitation on itemized deductions based on your AGI.\nTo determine the part of the recovery you must include in income, follow the two steps below.\n-\nFigure the greater of:\n-\nThe standard deduction for the earlier year, or\n-\nThe amount of itemized deductions you would have been allowed for the earlier year if you had figured them using only the net amount of the recovery item. The net amount is the amount you actually paid reduced by the recovery amount.\nNote. If you were required to itemize your deductions in the earlier year, use step 1b and not step 1a.\n-\n-\nSubtract the amount in step 1 from the amount of itemized deductions actually allowed in the earlier year after applying the limit on itemized deductions.\nIf you had unused tax credits in the earlier year, see Unused tax credits, later.\nFor more information on this calculation, see Revenue Ruling 93-75. This ruling is in Cumulative Bulletin 1993-2.\nWorksheet 2a.

Recoveries of Itemized Deductions\n| To determine whether you should complete this worksheet to figure the part of a recovery amount to include in income on your 2024 tax return, see Itemized Deduction Recoveries. You generally don't need to use this worksheet if you file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and the recovery is for state or local income taxes paid for the immediately preceding tax year. If you recovered amounts from more than 1 year, such as a state income tax refund from 2023 and a casualty loss reimbursement from 2022, complete a separate worksheet for each year. Use information from your tax return for the year the expense was deducted. | ||||||\n| A recovery is included in income only to the extent of the deduction amount that reduced your tax in the prior year (year of the deduction). If you were subject to the AMT or your tax credits reduced your tax to zero, see Unused tax credits and Subject to AMT under Itemized Deduction Recoveries. If your recovery was for an itemized deduction that was limited, you should read Itemized deductions limited under Itemized Deduction Recoveries. | ||||||\n| NOTE: Before completing lines 1a and 1b, see Worksheet 2a, Computations for Worksheet 2, lines 1a and 1b. | ||||||\n| 1a. | State/local income tax refund or credit1a | 1a. | _____ | |||\n| 1b. | State/local real estate and personal property taxes1a | 1b. | _____ | |||\n| 2. | Enter the total of all other Schedule A refunds or reimbursements (excluding the amounts you entered on lines 1a and 1b)2 | 2. | _____ | |||\n| 3. | Add lines 1a, 1b, and 2 | 3. | _____ | |||\n| 4. | Itemized deductions for the prior year.

To do this, add the amount of the recovery to your earlier year's taxable income and refigure the tax and the credits on the refigured amount. If the refigured tax, after application of the credits, is more than the actual tax in the earlier year, include the recovery in your income up to the amount of the deduction that reduced the tax in the earlier year. For this purpose, any increase to a credit carried over to the current year that resulted from deducting the recovered amount in the earlier year is considered to have reduced your tax in the earlier year. If the recovery is for an itemized deduction claimed in a year in which the deductions were limited, see Itemized deductions limited, earlier.\nIf your tax, after application of the credits, doesn't change, you didn't have a tax benefit from the deduction. Don’t include the recovery in your income.\nExample 35.\nIn 2023, you filed as head of household and itemized your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). Your taxable income was $5,260 and your tax was $528. You claimed a child care credit of $1,200. The credit reduced your tax to zero, and you had an unused tax credit of $672 ($1,200 − $528). In 2024, you recovered $1,000 of your itemized deductions. You reduce your 2023 itemized deductions by $1,000 and refigure that year's tax on taxable income of $6,260. However, the child care credit exceeds the refigured tax of $628. Your tax liability for 2023 isn't changed by reducing your deductions by the recovery. You didn't have a tax benefit from the recovered deduction and don’t include any of the recovery in your income for 2024.\nSubject to AMT.\nIf you were subject to the AMT in the year of the deduction, you'll have to refigure your tax for the earlier year to determine if the recovery must be included in your income. This will require a refiguring of your regular tax, as shown in Example 35, and a refiguring of your AMT. If inclusion of the recovery doesn't change your total tax, you don't include the recovery in your income. However, if your total tax increases by any amount, you received a tax benefit from the deduction and you must include the recovery in your income up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the earlier year.\nThis section discusses recovery of deductions other than itemized deductions.\nTotal recovery included in income.\nIf you recover an amount that you deducted in an earlier year when you were figuring your AGI, you must generally include the full amount of the recovery in your income in the year received.\nTotal recovery not included in income.\nIf any part of the deduction you took for the recovered amount didn't reduce your tax, you may be able to exclude at least part of the recovery from your income. You must include the recovery in your income only up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the year of the deduction. (See Tax benefit rule, earlier.)\nNegative taxable income.\nIf your taxable income for the prior year was a negative amount, the recovery you must include in income is reduced by that amount. You have a negative taxable income for 2023 if your:\n-\nForm 1040, the sum of lines 12 and 13, was more than line 11; or\n-\nForm 1040-NR, line 14, was more than line 11.\nUnused tax credits.\nIf you recover an item deducted in an earlier year in which you had unused tax credits, you must refigure the earlier year's tax to determine if you must include the recovery in your income. To do this, add the amount of the recovery to your earlier year's taxable income and refigure the tax and the credits on the refigured amount. If the refigured tax, after application of the credits, is more than the actual tax in the earlier year, include the recovery in your income up to the amount of the deduction that reduced the tax in the earlier year. For this purpose, any increase to a credit carried over to the current year that resulted from deducting the recovered amount in the earlier year is considered to have reduced your tax in the earlier year.\nIf your tax, after application of the credits, doesn't change, you didn't have a tax benefit from the deduction. Don’t include the recovery in your income.\nCapital gains.\nIf you determined your tax in the earlier year by using the Schedule D Tax Worksheet, or the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, and you receive a refund in 2024 of a deduction claimed in that year, you'll have to refigure your tax for the earlier year to determine if the recovery must be included in your income. If inclusion of the recovery doesn't change your total tax, you don't include the recovery in income. However, if your total tax increases by any amount, you must include the recovery in your income up to the amount of the deduction that reduced your tax in the earlier year.\nIf you received a recovery in 2024 for an item for which you claimed a tax credit in an earlier year, you must increase your 2023 tax by the amount of the recovery, up to the amount by which the credit reduced your tax in the earlier year. You had a recovery if there was a downward price adjustment or similar adjustment on the item for which you claimed a credit.\nThis rule doesn't apply to the investment credit or the foreign tax credit. Recoveries of these credits are covered by other provisions of the law. See Pub. 514 or Form 4255 for details.\nA sharing economy is one in which assets are shared between individuals for a fee, usually through the internet. For example, you rent out your car when you don’t need it, or you share your wi-fi account for a fee.\nA gig economy is one in which a short-term contract or freelance work is the norm, as opposed to a permanent job. For example, you drive for a ride-sharing service, or work as a fitness trainer, babysitter, or tutor.\nGenerally, if you have income from sharing economy transactions, or you did gig work, you must include all income received whether you received a Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, or not. See the Instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040) and the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040).\nChanges to reporting requirements on Form 1099-K.\nFor calendar years after 2023, lower reporting thresholds will lead to more people receiving a Form 1099-K. For calendar year 2024, taxpayers who accept payments from a third party settlement organization will receive a Form 1099-K if the aggregate amount they receive for the provision of goods and services exceeds $5,000 during the calendar year. Use amounts reported on the Form 1099-K with your other tax records to compute your taxable income. Taxpayers who received payments as gross receipts in a trade or business should report their gross receipts on Schedule C (Form 1040). Taxpayers who received payments for the sale of a capital asset at a gain should report the sale on Form 8949 and Schedule D (Form 1040). Taxpayers who received payments for the sale of an asset used in a trade or business or held for the production of income, on which depreciation was or should have been claimed, report the sale on Form 4797. Taxpayers who received payments from the sale of a personal item sold at a gain treat the sale as a sale of a capital asset as discussed above. If the personal item was sold at a loss, the loss is generally not deductible. Report the sales amount as income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, and the same amount as a deduction on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24z. If the loss was a result of a casualty in a federally declared disaster, see the instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040), line 15. If the Form 1099-K erroneously reports reimbursements for personal expenses, report the amount on both Schedule 1 (Form 1040), lines 8z and 24z. For more information about Form 1099-K, see the Instructions for Payee included on that form and frequently asked questions and other information at IRS.gov/1099K.\nSurvivor Benefits\nIn most cases, payments made by or for an employer because of an employee's death must be included in income. The following discussions explain the tax treatment of certain payments made to survivors. For additional information, see Pub. 559.\nLump-sum payments.\nLump-sum payments you receive from a decedent's employer as the surviving spouse or beneficiary may be accrued salary payments; distributions from employee profit-sharing, pension, annuity, or stock bonus plans; or other items that should be treated separately for tax purposes. The tax treatment of these lump-sum payments depends on the type of payment.\nSalary or wages.\nSalary or wages received after the death of the employee are usually ordinary income to you.\nQualified employee retirement plans.\nLump-sum distributions from qualified employee retirement plans are subject to special tax treatment. For information on these distributions, see Pub. 575 (or Pub. 721 if you're the survivor of a federal employee or retiree).\nPublic safety officer killed in the line of duty.\nIf you're a survivor of a public safety officer who was killed in the line of duty, you can exclude from income any amount received as a survivor annuity on account of the death of a public safety officer killed in the line of duty.\nFor this purpose, the term “public safety officer” includes law enforcement officers, firefighters, chaplains, and rescue squad and ambulance crew members. For more information, see Pub. 559.\nUnemployment Benefits\nThe tax treatment of unemployment benefits you receive depends on the type of program paying the benefits.\nUnemployment compensation.\nGenerally, you must include in income all unemployment compensation you receive. You should receive a Form 1099-G showing in box 1 the total unemployment compensation paid to you. In most cases, you enter unemployment compensation on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 7.\n.If you received unemployment compensation but didn't receive Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, through the mail, you may need to access your information through your state’s website to get your electronic Form 1099-G..\nTypes of unemployment compensation.\nUnemployment compensation generally includes any amount received under an unemployment compensation law of the United States or of a state. It includes the following benefits.\n-\nBenefits paid by a state or the District of Columbia from the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund.\n-\nState unemployment insurance benefits.\n-\nRailroad unemployment compensation benefits.\n-\nDisability payments from a government program paid as a substitute for unemployment compensation. (Amounts received as workers' compensation for injuries or illness aren't unemployment compensation. See Workers' Compensation under Sickness and Injury Benefits, earlier.)\n-\nTrade readjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974.\n-\nUnemployment assistance under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1974.\n-\nUnemployment assistance under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 Program.\nGovernmental program.\nIf you contribute to a governmental unemployment compensation program and your contributions aren't deductible, amounts you receive under the program aren't included as unemployment compensation until you recover your contributions. If you deducted all of your contributions to the program, the entire amount you receive under the program is included in your income.\nRepayment of unemployment compensation.\nIf you repaid in 2024 unemployment compensation you received in 2024, subtract the amount you repaid from the total amount you received and enter the difference on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 7. On the dotted line next to your entry, enter “Repaid” and the amount you repaid. If you repaid unemployment compensation in 2024 that you included in your income in an earlier year and the amount is more than $3,000, you can deduct the amount repaid on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, if you itemize deductions or you can take a credit against your tax on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 13b. See Repayments, later.\nTax withholding.\nYou can choose to have federal income tax withheld from your unemployment compensation. To make this choice, complete Form W-4V and give it to the paying office. Tax will be withheld at 10% of your payment.\n. If you don't choose to have tax withheld from your unemployment compensation, you may be liable for estimated tax. If you don't pay enough tax, either through withholding or estimated tax, or a combination of both, you may have to pay a penalty. For more information, see Pub. 505..\nSupplemental unemployment benefits.\nBenefits received from an employer-financed fund (to which the employees didn't contribute) aren't unemployment compensation. They're taxable as wages and are subject to withholding for income tax. They may be subject to social security and Medicare taxes. For more information, see Supplemental Unemployment Compensation Benefits in section 5 of Pub. 15-A. Report these payments on line 1a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\nRepayment of benefits.\nYou may have to repay some of your supplemental unemployment benefits to qualify for trade readjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974. If you repay supplemental unemployment benefits in the same year you receive them, reduce the total benefits by the amount you repay. If you repay the benefits in a later year, you must include the full amount of the benefits in your income for the year you received them.\nDeduct the repayment in the later year as an adjustment to gross income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Include the repayment on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24e. If the amount you repay in a later year is more than $3,000, you may be able to take a credit against your tax for the later year instead of deducting the amount repaid. For information on this, see Repayments, later.\nPrivate unemployment fund.\nUnemployment benefit payments from a private (nonunion) fund to which you voluntarily contribute are taxable only if the amounts you receive are more than your total payments into the fund. Report the taxable amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nPayments by a union.\nBenefits paid to you as an unemployed member of a union from regular union dues are included in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. However, if you contribute to a special union fund and your payments to the fund aren't deductible, the unemployment benefits you receive from the fund are includible in your income only to the extent they're more than your contributions.\nGuaranteed annual wage.\nPayments you receive from your employer during periods of unemployment, under a union agreement that guarantees you full pay during the year, are taxable as wages. Include them on line 1a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\nState employees.\nPayments similar to a state's unemployment compensation may be made by the state to its employees who aren't covered by the state's unemployment compensation law. Although the payments are fully taxable, don't report them as unemployment compensation. Report these payments on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nWelfare and Other Public Assistance Benefits\nDon’t include in your income governmental benefit payments from a public welfare fund based upon need, such as payments due to blindness. Payments from a state fund for the victims of crime shouldn't be included in the victims' incomes if they're in the nature of welfare payments. Don’t deduct medical expenses that are reimbursed by such a fund. You must include in your income any welfare payments that are compensation for services or that are obtained fraudulently.\nWork-training program.\nPayments you receive from a state welfare agency for taking part in a work-training program aren't included in your income, as long as the payments (exclusive of extra allowances for transportation or other costs) don't total more than the public welfare benefits you would have received otherwise. If the payments are more than the welfare benefits you would have received, the entire amount must be included in your income as wages.\nReemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) payments.\nPayments you receive from a state agency under the RTAA must be included in your income. The state must send you Form 1099-G to advise you of the amount you should include in income. The amount should be reported on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nPersons with disabilities.\nIf you have a disability, you must include in income compensation you receive for services you perform unless the compensation is otherwise excluded. However, you don't include in income the value of goods, services, and cash that you receive, not in return for your services, but for your training and rehabilitation because you have a disability. Excludable amounts include payments for transportation and attendant care, such as interpreter services for the deaf, reader services for the blind, and services to help individuals with an intellectual disability do their work.\nDisaster relief grants.\nDon’t include post-disaster grants received under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act in your income if the grant payments are made to help you meet necessary expenses or serious needs for medical, dental, housing, personal property, transportation, or funeral expenses. Don’t deduct casualty losses or medical expenses that are specifically reimbursed by these disaster relief grants. If you have deducted a casualty loss for the loss of your personal residence and you later receive a disaster relief grant for the loss of the same residence, you may have to include part or all of the grant in your taxable income. See Recoveries, earlier. Unemployment assistance payments under the Act are taxable unemployment compensation. See Unemployment compensation under Unemployment Benefits, earlier.\nDisaster relief payments.\nYou can exclude from income any amount you receive that is a qualified disaster relief payment. A qualified disaster relief payment is an amount paid to you:\n-\nTo reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses that result from a qualified disaster;\n-\nTo reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for the repair or rehabilitation of your home or repair or replacement of its contents to the extent it’s due to a qualified disaster;\n-\nBy a person engaged in the furnishing or sale of transportation as a common carrier because of the death or personal physical injuries incurred as a result of a qualified disaster; or\n-\nBy a federal, state, or local government; or agency or instrumentality in connection with a qualified disaster in order to promote the general welfare.\nA qualified disaster is:\n-\nA disaster that results from a terrorist or military action;\n-\nA federally declared disaster; or\n-\nA disaster that results from an accident involving a common carrier, or from any other event, which is determined to be catastrophic by the Secretary of the Treasury or their delegate.\nFor amounts paid under item 4, a disaster is qualified if it's determined by an applicable federal, state, or local authority to warrant assistance from the federal, state, or local government, agency, or instrumentality.\nDisaster mitigation payments.\nYou can also exclude from income any amount you receive that is a qualified disaster mitigation payment. Qualified disaster mitigation payments are commonly paid to you in the period immediately following damage to property as a result of a natural disaster. However, disaster mitigation payments are used to mitigate (reduce the severity of) potential damage from future natural disasters. They're paid to you through state and local governments based on the provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or the National Flood Insurance Act.\nYou can't increase the basis or adjusted basis of your property for improvements made with nontaxable disaster mitigation payments.\nDisaster relief payments from wildfires.\nYou may be able to exclude from income any amount received as a qualified wildfire relief payment. Qualified wildfire relief payments are amounts received by or on behalf of an individual as compensation for expenses or losses incurred as a result of a qualified wildfire disaster. A qualified wildfire disaster is any federally declared disaster declared, after December 31, 2014, as a result of any forest or range fire. See Pub. 547 for more information.\nDisaster relief payments from the East Palestine train derailment.\nYou may be able to exclude from income any amount received as a result of the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment that occurred on February 3, 2023, that qualifies as an “East Palestine train derailment payment.” The payment may be made by a government agency, Norfolk Southern Railway, or its subsidiary, insurer, agent, or a related person. For more information, and to find out what qualifies as an “East Palestine train derailment payment,” see Pub. 547.\nHome Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).\nIf you benefit from Pay-for-Performance Success Payments under HAMP, the payments aren't taxable.\nHardest Hit Fund and Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program.\nIf you receive or benefit from payments made under:\n-\nA State Housing Finance Agency (State HFA) Hardest Hit Fund program in which program payments can be used to pay mortgage interest, or\n-\nAn Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program (EHLP) administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or a state,\n-\nThe Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) program in which program payments are used to provide financial assistance to eligible homeowners for purposes of paying certain expenses related to their principal residence to prevent mortgage delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, loss of utilities or home energy services, and also displacements of homeowners experiencing financial hardship after January 21, 2020,\nFor more details about the HAF program, go to Home.Treasury.gov/Policy-Issues/Coronavirus/Assistance-for-State-Local-and-Tribal-Governments/Homeowner-Assistance-Fund.\nIf you’re a tribal member and wish more details about the HAF program, go to IRS.gov/Newsroom/FAQs-for-Payments-by-Indian-Tribal-Governments-and-Alaska-Native-Corporations-to-Individuals-Under-Covid-Relief-Legislation.\nMortgage assistance payments under section 235 of the National Housing Act.\nPayments made under section 235 of the National Housing Act for mortgage assistance aren't included in the homeowner's income. Interest paid for the homeowner under the mortgage assistance program can't be deducted.\nReplacement housing payments.\nReplacement housing payments made under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act for Federal and Federally Assisted Programs aren't includible in gross income, but are includible in the basis of the newly acquired property.\nRelocation payments and home rehabilitation grants.\nA relocation payment under section 105(a)(11) of the Housing and Community Development Act made by a local jurisdiction to a displaced individual moving from a flood-damaged residence to another residence isn't includible in gross income. Home rehabilitation grants received by low-income homeowners in a defined area under the same Act are also not includible in gross income.\nIndian financing grants.\nNonreimbursable grants under title IV of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 to Indians to expand profit-making Indian-owned economic enterprises on or near reservations aren't includible in gross income.\nIndian general welfare benefit.\nGross income doesn't include the value of any Indian general welfare benefit. “Indian general welfare benefit” includes any payment made or services provided to or on behalf of a member (or any spouse or dependent of that member) of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native Corporation under an Indian tribal government program, but only if:\n-\nThe program is administered under specified guidelines and doesn't discriminate in favor of members of the governing body of the Indian tribe or Alaska Native Corporation; and\n-\nThe benefits provided under the program (a) are available to any tribal member who meets guidelines, (b) are for the promotion of general welfare, (c) aren't lavish or extravagant, and (d) aren't compensation for services.\nGenerally, any items of cultural significance, reimbursement of costs, or cash honorarium for participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of tribal culture aren't treated as compensation for services.\nNote.\nThe above exclusion was enacted by the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014, September 26, 2014. The exclusion applies to tax years for which the period of limitation on refund or credit under section 6511 has not expired (generally, within 3 years from the time the return was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever expires later). Additionally, a claim for the above exclusion will be allowed if made within 1 year of the enactment of the exclusion.\nNote.\nThe enactment of the above exclusion generally codifies the exclusion afforded under Revenue Procedure 2014-35, June 4, 2014. See Revenue Procedure 2014-35 for more details.\nMedicare.\nMedicare benefits received under title XVIII of the Social Security Act aren't includible in the gross income of the individuals for whom they're paid. This includes basic (Part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged)) and supplementary (Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged)).\nSocial security benefits (including lump-sum payments attributable to prior years), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, and lump-sum death benefits.\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) provides benefits such as old-age benefits, benefits to disabled workers, and benefits to spouses and dependents. These benefits may be subject to federal income tax depending on your filing status and other income. See Pub. 915 for more information. An individual originally denied benefits, but later approved, may receive a lump-sum payment for the period when benefits were denied (which may be prior years). See Pub. 915 for information on how to make a lump-sum election, which may reduce your tax liability. There are also other types of benefits paid by the SSA. However, SSI benefits and lump-sum death benefits (one-time payment to spouse and children of deceased) aren't subject to federal income tax. For more information on these benefits, go to SSA.gov.\nForm SSA-1099.\nIf you received social security benefits during the year, you'll receive Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement. An IRS Notice 703 will be enclosed with your Form SSA-1099. This notice includes a worksheet you can use to figure whether any of your benefits are taxable.\nFor an explanation of the information found on your Form SSA-1099, see Pub. 915.\nForm RRB-1099.\nIf you received equivalent railroad retirement or special guaranty benefits during the year, you'll receive Form RRB-1099, Payments by the Railroad Retirement Board.\nFor an explanation of the information found on your Form RRB-1099, see Pub. 915.\nJoint return.\nIf you're married and file a joint return, you and your spouse must combine your incomes and your social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits when figuring whether any of your combined benefits are taxable. Even if your spouse didn't receive any benefits, you must add your spouse's income to yours when figuring if any of your benefits are taxable.\nTaxable amount.\nUse the worksheet in the Forms 1040 and 1040-SR instruction package to determine the amount of your benefits to include in your income. Pub. 915 also has worksheets you can use. However, you must use the worksheets in Pub. 915 if any of the following situations apply.\n-\nYou received a lump-sum benefit payment during the year that is for one or more earlier years.\n-\nYou exclude employer-provided adoption benefits or interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds.\n-\nYou take the foreign earned income exclusion, the foreign housing exclusion or deduction, the exclusion of income from American Samoa, or the exclusion of income from Puerto Rico by bona fide residents of Puerto Rico.\nBenefits may affect your IRA deduction.\nYou must use the special worksheets in Appendix B of Pub. 590-A to figure your taxable benefits and your IRA deduction if all of the following conditions apply.\n-\nYou receive social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits.\n-\nYou have taxable compensation.\n-\nYou contribute to your IRA.\n-\nYou or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work.\nHow to report.\nIf any of your benefits are taxable, you must use Form 1040 or 1040-SR to report the taxable part. Report your net benefits (as shown on your Forms SSA-1099 and RRB-1099) on line 6a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Report the taxable part on line 6b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you elect to use the lump-sum election method, check the box on line 6c of Form 1040 or 1040-SR and see the instructions.\nOther Income\nThe following brief discussions are arranged in alphabetical order. Other income items briefly discussed below are referenced to publications that provide more information.\nActivity not for profit.\nYou must include on your return income from an activity, even if you don't expect to make a profit from that activity. An example of this type of activity is a hobby or a farm you operate mostly for recreation and pleasure. Enter this income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8j. Deductions for expenses related to the activity are limited. They can't total more than the income you report from the activity and can be taken only if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).\nAlaska Permanent Fund dividend.\nIf you received a payment from Alaska's mineral income fund (Alaska Permanent Fund dividend), report it as income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8g. The 2024 Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payment included an energy relief payment as part of the total dividend payment. Do not reduce the amount on line 8g by the energy relief payment portion of the 2024 Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payment; the entire $1,702 Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payment for 2024 is taxable for federal income tax purposes. The state of Alaska sends each recipient a document that shows the amount of the payment with the check. The amount is also reported to the IRS.\nAlimony.\nInclude in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 2a, any taxable alimony payments you receive. Amounts you receive for child support aren't income to you. For complete information, see Pub. 504 and the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR.\n.Don’t include alimony payments you receive under a divorce or separation instrument (1) executed after 2018, or (2) executed before 2019 but modified after 2018, if the modification expressly states the alimony isn’t deductible to the payer or includible in your income. .\nBelow-market loans.\nA below-market loan is a loan on which no interest is charged or on which the interest is charged at a rate below the applicable federal rate. If you make a below-market gift or demand loan, you must include the forgone interest (at the federal rate) as interest income on your return. These loans are considered a transaction in which you, the lender, are treated as having made:\n-\nA loan to the borrower in exchange for a note that requires the payment of interest at the applicable federal rate; and\n-\nAn additional payment to the borrower, which the borrower transfers back to you as interest.\n-\nGift,\n-\nDividend,\n-\nContribution to capital,\n-\nPayment of compensation, or\n-\nAnother type of payment.\nFor more information on below-market loans, see chapter 1 of Pub. 550.\nCampaign contributions.\nThese contributions aren't income to a candidate unless they're diverted to the candidate’s personal use. To be exempt from tax, the contributions must be spent for campaign purposes or kept in a fund for use in future campaigns. However, interest earned on bank deposits, dividends received on contributed securities, and net gains realized on sales of contributed securities are taxable and must be reported on Form 1120-POL. Excess campaign funds transferred to an office account must be included in the officeholder's income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, in the year transferred.\nCanceled sales contract.\nIf you sell property (such as land or a residence) under a contract, but the contract is canceled and you return the buyer's money in the same tax year as the original sale, you have no income from the sale. If the contract is canceled and you return the buyer's money in a later tax year, you must include your gain in your income for the year of the sale. When you return the money and take back the property in the later year, you treat the transaction as a purchase that gives you a new basis in the property equal to the funds you return to the buyer.\nSpecial rules apply to the reacquisition of real property where a secured indebtedness (mortgage) to the original seller is involved. For further information, see Repossession in Pub. 537.\nCarpools.\nDon’t include in your income amounts you receive from the passengers for driving a car in a carpool to and from work. These amounts are considered reimbursement for your expenses. However, this rule doesn't apply if you have developed carpool arrangements into a profit-making business of transporting workers for hire.\nCash rebates.\nA cash rebate you receive from a dealer or manufacturer of an item you buy isn't income, but you must reduce your basis by the amount of the rebate.\nExample 36.\nYou buy a new car for $24,000 cash and receive a $2,000 rebate check from the manufacturer. The $2,000 isn't income to you. Your basis in the car is $22,000. This is the basis on which you figure gain or loss if you sell the car, and figure depreciation if you use it for business.\nCasualty insurance and other reimbursements.\nYou generally shouldn't report these reimbursements on your return unless you're figuring gain or loss from the casualty or theft. See Pub. 547.\nCharitable gift annuities.\nIf you're the beneficiary of a charitable gift annuity, you must include the yearly annuity or fixed percentage payment in your income.\nThe payer will report the types of income you received on Form 1099-R. Report the gross distribution from box 1 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 5a, and the part taxed as ordinary income (box 2a minus box 3) on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 5b. Report the portion taxed as capital gain as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).\nChild support payments.\nYou shouldn't report these payments on your return. See Pub. 504 for more information.\nCourt awards and damages.\nTo determine if settlement amounts you receive by compromise or judgment must be included in your income, you must consider the item that the settlement replaces. The character of the income as ordinary income or capital gain depends on the nature of the underlying claim. Include the following as ordinary income.\n-\nInterest on any award.\n-\nCompensation for lost wages or lost profits in most cases.\n-\nPunitive damages in most cases. It doesn't matter if they relate to a physical injury or physical sickness.\n-\nAmounts received in settlement of pension rights (if you didn't contribute to the plan).\n-\nDamages for:\n-\nBack pay and damages for emotional distress received to satisfy a claim under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n-\nAttorney fees and costs (including contingent fees) where the underlying recovery is included in gross income.\n-\nAttorney fees and costs relating to whistleblower awards where the underlying recovery is included in gross income.\nDon’t include in your income compensatory damages for personal physical injury or physical sickness (whether received in a lump sum or installments).\nEmotional distress.\nEmotional distress itself isn't a physical injury or physical sickness, but damages you receive for emotional distress due to a physical injury or sickness are treated as received for the physical injury or sickness. Don’t include them in your income.\nIf the emotional distress is due to a personal injury that isn't due to a physical injury or sickness (for example, unlawful discrimination or injury to reputation), you must include the damages in your income, except for any damages you receive for medical care due to that emotional distress. Emotional distress includes physical symptoms that result from emotional distress, such as headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders.\nDeduction for costs involved in unlawful discrimination suits.\nYou may be able to deduct attorney fees and court costs paid to recover a judgment or settlement for a claim of unlawful discrimination under various provisions of federal, state, and local law listed in section 62(e), a claim against the U.S. Government, or a claim under section 1862(b)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act. You can claim this deduction as an adjustment to income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24h. The following rules apply.\n-\nThe attorney fees and court costs may be paid by you or on your behalf in connection with the claim for unlawful discrimination, the claim against the U.S. Government, or the claim under section 1862(b)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act.\n-\nThe deduction you're claiming can't be more than the amount of the judgment or settlement you're including in income for the tax year.\n-\nThe judgment or settlement to which your attorney fees and court costs apply must occur after October 22, 2004.\nPre-existing agreement.\nIf you receive damages under a written binding agreement, court decree, or mediation award that was in effect (or issued on or before) September 13, 1995, don't include in income any of those damages received on account of personal injuries or sickness.\nCredit card insurance.\nIn most cases, if you receive benefits under a credit card disability or unemployment insurance plan, the benefits are taxable to you. These plans make the minimum monthly payment on your credit card account if you can't make the payment due to injury, illness, disability, or unemployment. Report on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, the amount of benefits you received during the year that is more than the amount of the premiums you paid during the year.\nDown payment assistance.\nIf you purchase a home and receive assistance from a nonprofit corporation to make the down payment, that assistance isn't included in your income. If the corporation qualifies as a tax-exempt charitable organization, the assistance is treated as a gift and is included in your basis of the house. If the corporation doesn't qualify, the assistance is treated as a rebate or reduction of the purchase price and isn't included in your basis.\nEmployment agency fees.\nIf you get a job through an employment agency, and the fee is paid by your employer, the fee isn't includible in your income if you aren't liable for it. However, if you pay it and your employer reimburses you for it, it’s includible in your income.\nEnergy conservation subsidies.\nYou can exclude from gross income any subsidy provided, either directly or indirectly, by public utilities for the purchase or installation of an energy conservation measure for a dwelling unit.\nEnergy conservation measure.\nThis includes installations or modifications that are primarily designed to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas, or improve the management of energy demand.\nDwelling unit.\nThis includes a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, or similar property. If a building or structure contains both dwelling and other units, any subsidy must be properly allocated.\nEstate and trust income.\nAn estate or trust, unlike a partnership, may have to pay federal income tax. If you're a beneficiary of an estate or trust, you may be taxed on your share of its income distributed or required to be distributed to you. However, there is never a double tax. Estates and trusts file their returns on Form 1041, and your share of the income is reported to you on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).\nCurrent income required to be distributed.\nIf you're the beneficiary of an estate or trust that must distribute all of its current income, you must report your share of the distributable net income, whether or not you actually received it.\nCurrent income not required to be distributed.\nIf you're the beneficiary of an estate or trust and the fiduciary has the choice of whether to distribute all or part of the current income, you must report all income that is required to be distributed to you, whether or not it's actually distributed, plus all other amounts actually paid or credited to you, up to the amount of your share of distributable net income.\nHow to report.\nTreat each item of income the same way that the estate or trust would treat it. For example, if a trust's dividend income is distributed to you, you report the distribution as dividend income on your return. The same rule applies to distributions of tax-exempt interest and capital gains.\nThe fiduciary of the estate or trust must tell you the type of items making up your share of the estate or trust income and any credits you're allowed on your individual income tax return.\nLosses.\nLosses of estates and trusts generally aren't deductible by the beneficiaries.\nGrantor trust.\nIncome earned by a grantor trust is taxable to the grantor, not the beneficiary, if the grantor keeps certain control over the trust. (The grantor is the one who transferred property to the trust.) This rule applies if the property (or income from the property) put into the trust will or may revert (be returned) to the grantor or the grantor's spouse.\nGenerally, a trust is a grantor trust if the grantor has a reversionary interest valued (at the date of transfer) at more than 5% of the value of the transferred property, or has certain other powers.\nExpenses paid by another.\nIf your personal expenses are paid for by another person, such as a corporation, the payment may be taxable to you depending upon your relationship with that person and the nature of the payment. But if the payment makes up for a loss caused by that person, and only restores you to the position you were in before the loss, the payment isn't includible in your income.\nFees for services.\nInclude all fees for your services in your income. Examples of these fees are amounts you receive for services you perform as:\n-\nA corporate director;\n-\nAn executor, administrator, or personal representative of an estate;\n-\nA manager of a trade or business you operated before declaring chapter 11 bankruptcy;\n-\nA notary public; or\n-\nAn election precinct official.\n. If you aren't an employee and the fees for your services from a single payer in the course of the payer's trade or business total $600 or more for the year, the payer should send you Form 1099-MISC. .\nCorporate director.\nCorporate director fees are self-employment income. Report these payments on Schedule C (Form 1040).\nPersonal representatives.\nAll personal representatives must include in their gross income fees paid to them from an estate. If you aren't in the trade or business of being an executor (for instance, you're the executor of a friend's or relative's estate), report these fees on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. If you're in the trade or business of being an executor, report these fees as self-employment income on Schedule C (Form 1040). The fee isn't includible in income if it's waived.\nManager of trade or business for bankruptcy estate.\nInclude in your income all payments received from your bankruptcy estate for managing or operating a trade or business that you operated before you filed for bankruptcy. Report this income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\nNotary public.\nReport payments for these services on Schedule C (Form 1040). These payments aren't subject to self-employment tax. See the separate Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040) for details.\nElection precinct official.\nYou should receive a Form W-2 showing payments for services performed as an election official or election worker. Report these payments on line 1a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\nFood program payments to daycare providers.\nIf you operate a daycare service and receive payments under the Child and Adult Care Food Program administered by the Department of Agriculture that aren't for your services, the payments aren't included in your income in most cases. However, you must include in your income any part of the payments you don't use to provide food to individuals eligible for help under the program.\nForeign currency transactions.\nIf you have a gain on a personal foreign currency transaction because of changes in exchange rates, you don't have to include that gain in your income unless it's more than $200. If the gain is more than $200, report it as a capital gain.\nFoster care providers.\nGenerally, payment you receive from a state, political subdivision, or a qualified foster care placement agency for caring for a qualified foster individual in your home is excluded from your income. However, you must include in your income payment to the extent it's received for the care of more than five qualified foster individuals age 19 years or older.\nA qualified foster individual is a person who:\n-\nIs living in a foster family home; and\n-\nWas placed there by:\n-\nAn agency of a state or one of its political subdivisions, or\n-\nA qualified foster care placement agency.\n-\nDifficulty-of-care payments.\nThese are payments that are designated by the payer as compensation for providing the additional care that is required for physically, mentally, or emotionally handicapped qualified foster individuals. A state must determine that the additional compensation is needed, and the care for which the payments are made must be provided in the foster care provider's home in which the qualified foster individual was placed.\nCertain Medicaid waiver payments are treated as difficulty-of-care payments when received by an individual care provider for caring for an eligible individual (whether related or unrelated) living in the provider's home. See Notice 2014-7, available at IRS.gov/irb/2014-4_IRB#NOT-2014-7, and related questions and answers, available at IRS.gov/Individuals/Certain-Medicaid-Waiver-Payments-May-Be-Excludable-From-Income, for more information.\nYou must include in your income difficulty-of-care payments to the extent they're received for more than:\n-\nTen qualified foster individuals under age 19, or\n-\nFive qualified foster individuals age 19 or older.\nMaintaining space in home.\nIf you're paid to maintain space in your home for emergency foster care, you must include the payment in your income.\nReporting taxable payments.\nIf you receive payments that you must include in your income and you're in business as a foster care provider, report the payments on Schedule C (Form 1040). See Pub. 587 to help you determine the amount you can deduct for the use of your home.\nFound property.\nIf you find and keep property that doesn't belong to you that has been lost or abandoned (treasure trove), it's taxable to you at its FMV in the first year it's your undisputed possession.\nFree tour.\nIf you received a free tour from a travel agency for organizing a group of tourists, you must include its value in your income. Report the FMV of the tour on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, if you aren't in the trade or business of organizing tours. You can't deduct your expenses in serving as the voluntary leader of the group at the group's request. If you organize tours as a trade or business, report the tour's value on Schedule C (Form 1040).\nGambling winnings.\nYou must include your gambling winnings in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8b. Winnings from fantasy sports leagues are gambling winnings. If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), you can deduct gambling losses you had during the year, but only up to the amount of your winnings. If you're in the trade or business of gambling, use Schedule C (Form 1040). For tax years 2018 through 2025, professional gambling losses and expenses are limited to the amount of your winnings.\nLotteries and raffles.\nWinnings from lotteries and raffles are gambling winnings. In addition to cash winnings, you must include in your income the FMV of bonds, cars, houses, and other noncash prizes. However, the difference between the FMV and the cost of an oil and gas lease obtained from the government through a lottery isn't includible in income.\nInstallment payments.\nGenerally, if you win a state lottery prize payable in installments, you must include in your gross income the annual payments and any amounts you receive designated as interest on the unpaid installments. If you sell future lottery payments for a lump sum, you must report the amount you receive from the sale as ordinary income (on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8b) in the year you receive it.\nForm W-2G.\nYou may have received a Form W-2G showing the amount of your gambling winnings and any tax taken out of them. Include the amount from box 1 on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8b. Include the amount shown in box 4 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 25c, as federal income tax withheld.\nGifts and inheritances.\nIn most cases, property you receive as a gift, bequest, or inheritance isn't included in your income. However, if property you receive this way later produces income such as interest, dividends, or rents, that income is taxable to you. If property is given to a trust and the income from it is paid, credited, or distributed to you, that income is also taxable to you. If the gift, bequest, or inheritance is the income from the property, that income is taxable to you.\nInherited pension or IRA.\nIf you inherited a pension or an IRA, you may have to include part of the inherited amount in your income. See Survivors and Beneficiaries in Pub. 575 if you inherited a pension.

If the damage was due to an involuntary conversion, you may defer the tax on the gain if you purchase qualified replacement property. See Pub. 544.\nIf the payments (including insurance proceeds) you received, or expect to receive, are less than your adjusted basis, you may be able to claim a casualty deduction. See Pub. 547.\nPhysical injury.\nPayments you received for personal physical injuries or physical sickness aren't taxable.

A hobby is an activity from which you don't expect to make a profit. See Activity not for profit, earlier, under Other Income.\n.If you collect stamps, coins, or other items as a hobby for recreation and pleasure, and you sell any of the items, your gain is taxable as a capital gain. However, if you sell items from your collection at a loss, you can't deduct the loss. .\nHolocaust victims restitution.\nRestitution payments you receive as a Holocaust victim (or the heir of a Holocaust victim) and interest earned on the payments aren't taxable. Excludable interest is earned by escrow accounts or settlement funds established for holding funds prior to the settlement. You also don't include the restitution payments and interest the funds earned prior to disbursement in any calculation in which you ordinarily would add excludable income to your AGI, such as the calculation to determine the taxable part of social security benefits. If the payments are made in property, your basis in the property is its FMV when you receive it.\nExcludable restitution payments are payments or distributions made by any country or any other entity because of persecution of an individual on the basis of race, religion, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation by Nazi Germany, any other Axis regime, or any other Nazi-controlled or Nazi-allied country, whether the payments are made under a law or as a result of a legal action.

This amount won't be used to figure AGI or MAGI in applying any Internal Revenue Code provision that takes into account excludable income.\nInterest on frozen deposits.\nIn general, you exclude from your income the amount of interest earned on a frozen deposit. A deposit is frozen if, at the end of the calendar year, you can't withdraw any part of the deposit because:\n-\nThe financial institution is bankrupt or insolvent, or\n-\nThe state where the institution is located has placed limits on withdrawals because other financial institutions in the state are bankrupt or insolvent.\nExcludable amount.\nThe amount of interest you exclude from income for the year is the interest that was credited on the frozen deposit for that tax year minus the sum of:\n-\nThe net amount withdrawn from the deposit during that year, and\n-\nThe amount that could have been withdrawn at the end of that tax year (not reduced by any penalty for premature withdrawals of a time deposit).\nInterest on qualified savings bonds.\nYou may be able to exclude from income the interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds you redeem if you pay qualified higher education expenses in the same year.

See Bonuses and awards under Miscellaneous Compensation, earlier.\nPrize points.\nIf you're a salesperson and receive prize points redeemable for merchandise that are awarded by a distributor or manufacturer to employees of dealers, you must include their FMV in your income. The prize points are taxable in the year they're paid or made available to you, rather than in the year you redeem them for merchandise.\nPulitzer, Nobel, and similar prizes.\nIf you were awarded a prize in recognition of accomplishments in religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, educational, literary, or civic fields, you must generally include the value of the prize in your income. However, you don't include this prize in your income if you meet all of the following requirements.\n-\nYou were selected without any action on your part to enter the contest or proceeding.\n-\nYou aren't required to perform substantial future services as a condition for receiving the prize or award.\n-\nThe prize or award is transferred by the payer directly to a governmental unit or tax-exempt charitable organization as designated by you.

See Scholarships and fellowships, later.\nQualified opportunity fund (QOF).\nEffective December 22, 2017, section 1400Z-2 provides a temporary deferral of inclusion in gross income for eligible gains invested in QOFs, and a stepped-up basis to fair market value of the investment in the QOF at time of sale or exchange, if the investment is held for at least 10 years. See the Form 8949 instructions on how to report your election to defer eligible gains invested in a QOF.

You bought the painting for $20 at a garage sale years ago. Report your $80 gain as a capital gain as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).\nScholarships and fellowships.\nA candidate for a degree can exclude amounts received as a qualified scholarship or fellowship. A qualified scholarship or fellowship is any amount you receive that is for:\n-\nTuition and fees required to enroll at or attend an eligible educational institution; or\n-\nCourse-related expenses, such as fees, books, and equipment that are required for courses at the eligible educational institution. These items must be required of all students in your course of instruction.\nPayment for services.\nGenerally, you can't exclude from your gross income the part of any scholarship or fellowship that represents payment for teaching, research, or other services required as a condition for receiving the scholarship. This applies even if all candidates for a degree must perform the services to receive the degree.\nExceptions.\nYou don't have to include in income the part of any scholarship or fellowship that represents payment for teaching, research, or other services if you receive the amount under:\n-\nThe National Health Services Corps Scholarship Program,\n-\nThe Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program, or\n-\nA comprehensive student work-learning-service program (as defined in section 448(e) of the Higher Education Act of 1965) operated by a work college (as defined in that section).\nFor information about the rules that apply to a tax-free qualified tuition reduction provided to employees and their families by an educational institution, see Pub. 970.\nVA payments.\nAllowances paid by the VA for education, training, or subsistence under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, aren't included in your income. These allowances aren't considered scholarship or fellowship grants.\nPrizes.\nScholarship prizes won in a contest aren't scholarships or fellowships if you don't have to use the prizes for educational purposes. You must include these amounts in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8i, whether or not you use the amounts for educational purposes.\nSmallpox vaccine injuries.\nIf you're an eligible individual who receives benefits under the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 for a covered injury resulting from a covered countermeasure, you can exclude the payment from your income (to the extent it isn't allowed as a medical and dental expense deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040)). Eligible individuals include health care workers, emergency personnel, and first responders in a smallpox emergency who have received a smallpox vaccination.\nState tax payments.\nDo not include payments on your tax return made by states under legislatively provided social benefit programs for the promotion of the general welfare. To qualify for the general welfare exclusion, state payments must be paid from a governmental fund, be for the promotion of general welfare (that is, based on the need of the individual or family receiving such payments), and not represent compensation for services.\nStolen property.\nIf you steal property, you must report its FMV in your income in the year you steal it, unless in the same year you return it to its rightful owner.\nTransporting school children.\nDon’t include in your income a school board mileage allowance for taking children to and from school if you aren't in the business of taking children to school. You can't deduct expenses for providing this transportation.\nUnion benefits and dues.\nAmounts deducted from your pay for union dues, assessments, contributions, or other payments to a union can't be excluded from your income.\nFor tax years beginning after 2017, you can no longer deduct job-related expenses or other miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income floor.\nStrike and lockout benefits.\nBenefits paid to you by a union as strike or lockout benefits, including both cash and the FMV of other property, are usually included in your income as compensation. You can exclude these benefits from your income only when the facts clearly show that the union intended them as gifts to you.\nReimbursed union convention expenses.\nIf you're a delegate of your local union chapter and you attend the annual convention of the international union, don't include in your income amounts you receive from the international union to reimburse you for expenses of traveling away from home to attend the convention. You can't deduct the reimbursed expenses, even if you're reimbursed in a later year. If you're reimbursed for lost salary, you must include that reimbursement in your income.\nUtility rebates.\nIf you're a customer of an electric utility company and you participate in the utility's energy conservation program, you may receive on your monthly electric bill either:\n-\nA reduction in the purchase price of electricity furnished to you (rate reduction), or\n-\nA nonrefundable credit against the purchase price of the electricity.\nWhistleblower's award.\nIf you receive a whistleblower's award from the IRS, you must include it in your income. Any deduction allowed for attorney fees and court costs paid by you, or on your behalf, in connection with the award are deducted as an adjustment to income, but can't be more than the amount included in income for the tax year.\nRepayments\nIf you had to repay an amount that you included in your income in an earlier year, you may be able to deduct the amount repaid from your income for the year in which you repaid it. Or, if the amount you repaid is more than $3,000, you may be able to take a credit against your tax for the year in which you repaid it. In most cases, you can claim a deduction or credit only if the repayment qualifies as an expense or loss incurred in your trade or business or in a for-profit transaction.\nType of deduction.\nThe type of deduction you're allowed in the year of repayment depends on the type of income you included in the earlier year. In most cases, you deduct the repayment on the same form or schedule on which you previously reported it as income. For example, if you reported it as self-employment income, deduct it as a business expense on Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule F (Form 1040). If you reported it as a capital gain, deduct it as a capital loss as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). If you reported it as wages, unemployment compensation, or other nonbusiness income, you may be able to deduct it as an other itemized deduction if the amount repaid is over $3,000.\n.For tax years beginning after 2017, you can no longer claim any miscellaneous itemized deductions; so, if the amount repaid was $3,000 or less, you aren’t able to deduct it from your income in the year you repaid it..\nRepaid social security benefits.\nIf you repaid social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits, see Pub. 915.\nRepayment over $3,000.\nIf the amount you repaid was more than $3,000, you can deduct the repayment as an other itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, if you included the income under a claim of right. This means that at the time you included the income, it appeared that you had an unrestricted right to it. However, you can choose to take a credit for the year of repayment. Figure your tax under both methods and compare the results. Use the method (deduction or credit) that results in less tax.\n.When determining whether the amount you repaid was less than $3,000, consider the total amount being repaid on the return. Each instance of repayment isn't considered separately..\nMethod 1.\nFigure your tax for the year of repayment claiming a deduction for the repaid amount.\nMethod 2.\nFigure your tax for the year of repayment claiming a credit for the repaid amount. Follow these steps.\n-\nFigure your tax for the year of repayment without deducting the repaid amount.\n-\nRefigure your tax from the earlier year without including in income the amount you repaid in the year of repayment.\n-\nSubtract the tax in (2) from the tax shown on your return for the earlier year. This is the credit.\n-\nSubtract the answer in (3) from the tax for the year of repayment figured without the deduction (step 1).\nIf method 1 results in less tax, deduct the amount repaid. If method 2 results in less tax, claim the credit figured in (3) above on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. (If the year of repayment is 2023, and you're taking the credit, enter the credit on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 13b, and see the instructions for it.)\nExample 40.\nFor 2023, you filed a return and reported your income on the cash method. In 2024, you repaid $5,000 included in your 2023 income under a claim of right. Your filing status in 2024 and 2023 is single. Your income and tax for both years are as follows.\n| 2023 | ||||\n| With Income | Without Income | |||\n| Taxable Income | $15,000 | $10,000 | ||\n| Tax | $1,571 | $1,003 | ||\n| 2024 | ||||\n| Without Deduction | With Deduction | |||\n| Taxable Income | $49,950 | $44,950 | ||\n| Tax | $6,048 | $5,165 |\nYour tax under method 1 is $5,165. Your tax under method 2 is $6,048, figured as follows.\n| Tax previously determined for 2023 | $1,571 | |\n| Less: Tax as refigured | − 1,003 | |\n| Decrease in 2023 tax | $ 568 | |\n| Regular tax liability for 2024 | $6,048 | |\n| Less: Decrease in 2023 tax | − 568 | |\n| Refigured tax for 2024 | $5,480 |\nRepaid wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes.\nIf you had to repay an amount that you included in your wages or compensation in an earlier year on which social security, Medicare, or tier 1 RRTA taxes were paid, ask your employer to refund the excess amount to you. If the employer refuses to refund the taxes, ask for a statement indicating the amount of the overcollection to support your claim. File a claim for refund using Form 843.\nRepaid wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax.\nEmployers can't make an adjustment or file a claim for refund for Additional Medicare Tax withholding when there is a repayment of wages received by an employee in a prior year because the employee determines liability for Additional Medicare Tax on the employee's income tax return for the prior year. If you had to repay an amount that you included in your wages or compensation in an earlier year, and on which Additional Medicare Tax was paid, you may be able to recover the Additional Medicare Tax paid on the amount. To recover Additional Medicare Tax on the repaid wages or compensation, you must file Form 1040-X for the prior year in which the wages or compensation were originally received. See the Instructions for Form 1040-X.\nRepayment rules don’t apply.\nThis discussion doesn't apply to:\n-\nDeductions for bad debts;\n-\nDeductions for theft losses due to criminal fraud or embezzlement in a transaction entered into for profit;\n-\nDeductions from sales to customers, such as returns and allowances, and similar items; or\n-\nDeductions for legal and other expenses of contesting the repayment.\nYear of deduction (or credit).\nIf you use the cash method, you can take the deduction (or credit, if applicable) for the tax year in which you actually make the repayment. If you use any other accounting method, you can deduct the repayment or claim a credit for it only for the tax year in which it’s a proper deduction under your accounting method. For example, if you use an accrual method, you're entitled to the deduction or credit in the tax year in which the obligation for the repayment accrues.\nHow To Get Tax Help\nIf you have questions about a tax issue; need help preparing your tax return; or want to download free publications, forms, or instructions, go to IRS.gov to find resources that can help you right away.\nPreparing and filing your tax return.\nAfter receiving all your wage and earnings statements (Forms W-2, W-2G, 1099-R, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, etc.); unemployment compensation statements (by mail or in a digital format) or other government payment statements (Form 1099-G); and interest, dividend, and retirement statements from banks and investment firms (Forms 1099), you have several options to choose from to prepare and file your tax return.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim.

No significant facts have been changed or added.\nDonald Trump’s administration initiated a sustained, years-long effort to erase protections for LGBTQ people. This included an effort to “define ‘transgender’ out of existence,” erode protections for transgender students and workers, and weaken access to gender-affirming health care that most transgender people already struggled to access.\nWhile President Joe Biden’s administration reversed much of the Trump-era abuses, just last month on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to dismantle a new Biden administration policy that will offer protections for transgender students under Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.\nThe ACLU is prepared to defend the LGBTQ community, including transgender individuals, from a second Trump administration’s anticipated attempts to weaponize federal law against them. Learn more in our breakdown:\nTrump on LGBTQ Rights\nThe Facts: Trump has promised that, if reelected, his administration will rescind federal policies that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and will assert that federal civil rights laws don’t cover anti-LGBTQ discrimination. In addition to rolling back existing protections, a second Trump administration will proactively mandate discrimination by the federal government wherever it can. Lastly, and perhaps most ominously, if Trump returns to the White House, we expect his administration to use federal law – including laws meant to safeguard civil rights – as a cudgel to override critical state-level protections for transgender students and to force state and local governments, as well as private organizations, to allow or even perpetuate discrimination\nWhy It Matters: A second Trump administration would strip LGBTQ people of protections against discrimination in many contexts, including employment, housing, education, health care, and a range of federal government programs. The Trump administration’s proposed policies would ban transgender people from serving openly in the armed forces and block gender-affirming medical care for transgender people enrolled in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare. The effects of these cruel – and unconstitutional – discrimination efforts would be devastating, as thousands of transgender people would immediately lose access to needed medical care and the right to live freely without fear. In essence, a potential second Trump administration would seek to erase transgender people from public life entirely by using federal laws – including obscenity laws – to criminalize gender nonconformity.\nTrump on LGBTQ Rights\nIn the second installment of the ACLU’s election 2024 memo series, our experts detail the threats a potential second Trump administration poses to the\nSource: American Civil Liberties Union\nHow We Got Here: The Trump administration was openly hostile toward the LGBTQ community and vehemently opposed the Equality Act, which would have ensured that existing civil rights protections cover sexual orientation and gender identity in the way that they already do for race, disability, veteran status, and more. The Trump administration also blocked basic job protections for LGBTQ people, insisting that employers should be free to fire workers for their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration also eliminated nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people established under the Affordable Care Act.\nCritically, the Trump administration had an enormous impact on the courts, including the Supreme Court. Getting courts to understand the experience of transgender people and the impact of discriminatory policies on their lives was difficult even before Trump reshaped the judiciary. It is that much harder today because of the viewpoints of the judges and justices Trump appointed to the federal courts and Supreme Court.\nOur Roadmap: Should a second Trump administration take office, the ACLU will use the courts to affirm that LGBTQ people are protected from discrimination under federal law, to invalidate policies mandating discrimination across the federal government, and to shut down Trump’s expected efforts to weaponize the Constitution and federal laws to require discrimination against LGBTQ people by state and local governments and private entities.\nLitigation is not our only pathway to push back against anti-LGBTQ policies. Congress can, and must, use the power of the purse and its oversight and investigative authorities to constrain a second Trump administration’s extreme anti-LGBTQ agenda. The ACLU will aggressively lobby members of Congress who support the transgender community to use the appropriations process, in particular, to hinder Trump’s ability to mandate anti-trans discrimination and weaponize federal law against LGBTQ rights.\nThe ACLU also has a comprehensive state-level plan of attack. We will advocate for states and school boards to protect LGBTQ students by enacting guidance regarding updating student names and pronouns, and by creating inclusive rules on gender-based activities, best practices for school records, and ways to support transgender students living under a federal government that discriminates against them. We’ll also urge states to support policies that prevent their governments from being complicit in a second Trump administration’s efforts to attack the legitimacy of transgender people in our world. Lastly, we will mobilize public support on behalf of vulnerable children and youth to deter further draconian policies and help reshape the political narrative around transgender justice.\nWhat Our Experts Say: “We have seen the disastrous consequences of a hateful campaign targeting LGBTQ people and their families with discriminatory laws, forcing many from their home states and denying many more the freedom to get the health care they need to live their lives openly, and even to decide what name to go by. We are determined to use every tool at our disposal to oppose any attempt to deny LGBTQ people the freedom to live and love freely and openly.” – Mike Zamore, national director for policy & government affairs\n“For four years, President Trump and his administration left no stone unturned in their effort to attack the right of LGBTQ people to live and work as who we are. We fully expect a second Trump administration to go further, weaponizing federal law to override state level protections and mandate discrimination by schools and health care providers nationwide. Regardless of the election’s outcome, we stand ready to fight to uphold the fundamental freedom we are guaranteed by the Constitution to live our lives as we choose.” – James Esseks, director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project.\nWhat You Can Do Today: As wave after wave of extreme measures to criminalize and strip trans people of rights and safety continue, the time to act is now. Tell your members of Congress to protect trans people from discrimination today.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        By — Laura Barrón-López Laura Barrón-López By — Shrai Popat Shrai Popat Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-a-second-trump-presidency-could-impact-the-lgbtq-community Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Transcript Audio On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has been outlining what he plans to do if elected in November.

White House Correspondent Laura Barrón-López reports. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. William Brangham: On the campaign trail, Trump has been talking about what he plans to do if elected in November, and that includes rolling back the rights of millions of LGBTQ people.It's part of a wider playbook to undo many modern civil rights advances for minority groups.White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez has been following this, and she joins us now.Hi. Laura Barron-Lopez: Hi. William Brangham: So, on LGBTQ rights, what has Trump said he wants to do? Laura Barron-Lopez: Since launching his campaign, former President Donald Trump has targeted LGBTQ people, transgender people. He's attacked gender-affirming care for minors, as well as their ability to play in sports.And he says that he plans quick action if elected.Donald Trump , Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate: On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.(Cheering and applause) Laura Barron-Lopez: That promise you just heard, William, has become a staple of former President Donald Trump 's campaign rallies. William Brangham: How much of that, though, is just campaign rally rhetoric? I mean, we know that kind of language excites a certain slice of his base. How much of that is just him talking versus what he actually plans to do? Laura Barron-Lopez: Well, it's not just campaign rhetoric.And his allies have drafted a sweeping document titled Project 2025. It's led by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, and it details a blueprint for a second term for Trump.Specifically on restricting LGBTQ rights, what that details is reinstating a transgender military ban, limiting LGBTQ workplace discrimination protections. Currently, under the law, sexual orientation, and gender identity are protected. It would rescind health care protections for transgender people and urge Congress to define gender as male and female, fixed at birth.Trump has repeatedly said, also, William, that he would ban gender-affirming care for minors. And this playbook makes pretty clear that his plan — this plan also is trying to stop any and all acknowledgement of an acceptance of gender identity and LGBTQ people, period.And so, throughout this blueprint, there's some pretty striking language where government — saying that government officials should only recognize marriages between a man and a woman and that a man and a woman are the ideal natural family structure.Also, in addition to that, William, Trump has outlined a number of policies that essentially help minority groups and that they would be on the chopping block. So, when it comes to Project 2025 cuts to diversity, what the plan would do is delete diversity, equity and inclusion from every piece of legislation, remove diversity, equity, inclusion offices from federal agencies, curtail the teaching of race and racism, and urge Congress to ban federal funds for Critical Race Theory training.Essentially, William, Trump has vowed on the campaign trail to terminate all DEI programs. William Brangham: Are all of those things that you listed, are those within the purview of the president? Can he legally just go ahead and do those things? Laura Barron-Lopez: So, technically, this relies on Trump, if he is reelected, enacting a legal concept known as the unitary executive theory, and that's outlined in Project 2025.And it essentially suggests that Trump could basically just work around or ignore congressional oversight. And we spoke to Kim Wehle — she's the professor — a law professor at the University of Baltimore — about Trump's ability to carry out Project 2025. Kimberly Wehle, Former U.S. Associate Independent Counsel: With Donald Trump , the question isn't so much what the law authorizes. It's that if he has an army of employees that are willing to be loyal to whatever he wants and they implement what he directs, then the question is, is there going to be pushback through Congress, through the courts, through the voters?If there's no accountability and pushback, then the answer to your question is, yes, then these things can happen, because there's nothing to stop him. Laura Barron-Lopez: As you heard Professor Wehle say there, this plan really relies on loyalists being installed across the board in government for him to be able to carry this out. William Brangham: I mean, as you and others have reported, I mean, this — these LGBTQ changes, proposed changes, are pretty sweeping.But Project 2025 has a lot of other things. Who is it — you mentioned it's Heritage, but who else is behind this project? Laura Barron-Lopez: So this draft blueprint playbook was created by roughly 100 right-wing organizations led by the Heritage Foundation.And a number of these authors are actually people that worked in Trump's administration when he was president, including Peter Navarro, a former White House official, Roger Severino of the Health and Human Services department, and Ken Cuccinelli at the Homeland Security Department. They have all contributed to drafting this.They're contenders for a future Cabinet if Trump were to win reelection. This is a 180-day manual of sorts, William, that outlines the ability for former President Trump to consolidate power under the presidency.And I spoke to Professor Thomas Zimmer at Georgetown, who studies authoritarian regimes, and he explained that Trump wasn't necessarily able to institute this in 2017, when he first took office, because he didn't have the amount of loyalists that he plans on having across the board.And with these new loyalists, Zimmer said, he can advance a white Christian evangelical ideal of American society. Thomas Zimmer, Georgetown University: This is not going to beat Trump presidency part two, just more of the same. This is qualitatively something very, very different. It is opposed to egalitarian democracy because it fundamentally does not agree that all people are equal or deserve to be treated as equal citizens.Only those who belong to the — quote, unquote — \"true people,\" to real America, deserve that. And so everyone else needs to either be purged from the nation or, at the very least, accept their sort of lesser place in society. Laura Barron-Lopez: Professor Zimmer added that that type of purging he's talking about takes roots in the McCarthyism of the early 1950s, where they essentially tried to sweep away anyone across American society that would deviate from perceived norms. William Brangham: Laura Barron-Lopez, such important reporting. Thank you very much. Laura Barron-Lopez: Thank you.

It’s not even close.”\nHe added: “I know that not everyone benefits from this act, but everyone should support what is good for kids, and growing up with one’s mother and father is, in the vast majority of cases, the most important factor in a child’s wellbeing.”\nIn response to Deevers’s bill, the Tulsa-based pastor Randy Lewis of the All Souls Unitarian church told News Channel 8: “I have a non-traditional family – my partner’s kids are not mine, so it would be one of those situations. My kids aren’t biologically my partner’s. We’d be one of those situations [where] we’re eliminated from the grant process.”\nAnother Republican Oklahoma state senator, David Bullard, introduced a similar bill that would offer a $2,000 child tax credit per child only for married couples with biological children from the marriage.\nExplaining the bill to Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Trump, Bullard said it was introduced to challenge the supreme court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v Hodges that declared same-sex marriages as legal across the US.\n“Really what we want to do is challenge that concept and see if we can get to Obergefell,” Bullard said. “And I think that’s kind of what we’re pushing at all the way around the board with a bill like this, is to actually go straight at Obergefell and say: ‘No, the constitution protects my right, my freedom of speech, my freedom of expression, my freedom of religion to disagree with same-sex marriage.’”\n“The reality is we have to push back on Obergefell,” Bullard added.\nIn response to the introduction of such bills, Sean Meloy, vice-president of political programs at LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, said: “These attacks on fundamental rights for LGBTQ+ Americans, including marriage equality – which was already decided by the highest court and codified into federal law – are hateful distractions from the core issues that Americans want their government to resolve.”\n“Stripping away marriage rights for LGBTQ+ couples will not lower food prices, stop corruption or increase economic opportunities,” Meloy continued.\nIn Idaho, Republican state lawmakers passed a legislative petition last month in which they called on the supreme court to reverse its same-sex marriage ruling. Voting 46-24, the Idaho house passed House Joint Memorial 1, asking the supreme court to “restore the natural definition of marriage, a union of one man and one woman”.\nDuring her floor debate, the bill’s sponsor, the Republican representative Heather Scott, said: “I would ask you to substitute any other issue and ask yourself: ‘Do I want the federal government creating rights for us, for Idahoans,’” adding: “Christians across the nation are being targeted,” the Idaho Capital Sun reports.\nIn response to Scott, the Idaho House minority leader, Ilana Rubel, said: “It’s deeply upsetting to some of those folks and it makes them not want to live here … These are good, law-abiding people who are feeling like their legislature doesn’t want them here and doesn’t want them to be able to live the full rights that everybody else can.”\nRebecca De León, the communications director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, said: “Far-right extremists know that Idaho is their playground for stripping away people’s rights because resistance isn’t strong here. Let us be clear: the rights of same-sex couples to marry is settled legal precedent that continues to be affirmed by courts across the country. This unnecessary and bigoted memorial is a glaring example of how the Idaho legislature is set on eroding civil liberties.”\nIn Michigan, the Republican state lawmaker Josh Schriver prompted widespread backlash when he introduced a resolution to “condemn” the supreme court’s 2015 landmark decision. The resolution states: “Marriage … has been defined through time by people of varying cultures and faiths as a union between one man and one woman. Obergefell arbitrarily and unjustly rejected this historical definition of marriage.”\n“This is a biological necessity to preserve and grow our human race,” Schriver said about the resolution, BridgeMichigan reports.\nIn response to Schriver’s resolution, the Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, who is the first out LGBTQ+ person elected to state office in Michigan, took to Instagram and wrote: “Come and get it.”\nCondemning the resolution as part of a “long line of strategy of certain politicians who would like to erase the existence of LGBTQ+ people”, Jay Kaplan, the LGBTQ+ project attorney of the ACLU of Michigan, said: “It is a distraction from their apparent inability to introduce legislation or policies that address real issues that people are facing … I think we need to call it out for the stunt that it is. It’s an empty stunt.”\nKaplan added: “Let’s look at the reality with the marriage equality decision. No church, temple or mosque has to perform any religious marriage ceremony. We have a thing called separation of church and state … They are not obligated to perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples if they choose not to do so. So that’s not happening, despite what these politicians might be trying to say.\n“But, when you decide that you can open a business and you can keep it open to the public, you have to serve the public, and that’s a choice you make … you have to comply with a lot of things, including civil rights laws,” Kaplan said.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

It’s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president. At least 85 of 154 people from private interests who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton while she led the State Department donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs, according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to The Associated Press. Combined, the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million. At least 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and 20 gave more than $1 million. READ MORE: Bill Clinton to reduce foundation role if Hillary Clinton wins election Donors who were granted time with Clinton included an internationally known economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought Clinton’s help with a visa problem and Estee Lauder executives who were listed as meeting with Clinton while her department worked with the firm’s corporate charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa. The meetings between the Democratic presidential nominee and foundation donors do not appear to violate legal agreements Clinton and former president Bill Clinton signed before she joined the State Department in 2009. But the frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton. Her calendars and emails released as recently as this week describe scores of contacts she and her top aides had with foundation donors. The AP’s findings represent the first systematic effort to calculate the scope of the intersecting interests of Clinton foundation donors and people who met personally with Clinton or spoke to her by phone about their needs. The 154 did not include U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Clinton met with representatives of at least 16 foreign governments that donated as much as $170 million to the Clinton charity, but they were not included in AP’s calculations because such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties. Last week, the Clinton Foundation moved to head off ethics concerns about future donations by announcing changes planned if Clinton is elected. On Monday, Bill Clinton said in a statement that if his wife were to win, he would step down from the foundation’s board and stop all fundraising for it. The foundation would also accept donations only from U.S. citizens and what it described as independent philanthropies, while no longer taking gifts from foreign groups, U.S. companies or corporate charities. Clinton said the foundation would no longer hold annual meetings of its international aid program, the Clinton Global Initiative, and it would spin off its foreign-based programs to other charities. Those planned changes would not affect more than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2 billion in funding since its creation in 2000. “There’s a lot of potential conflicts and a lot of potential problems,” said Douglas White, an expert on nonprofits who previously directed Columbia University’s graduate fundraising management program. “The point is, she can’t just walk away from these 6,000 donors.” Former senior White House ethics officials said a Clinton administration would have to take careful steps to ensure that past foundation donors would not have the same access as she allowed at the State Department. “If Secretary Clinton puts the right people in and she’s tough about it and has the right procedures in place and sends a message consistent with a strong commitment to ethics, it can be done,” said Norman L. Eisen, who was President Barack Obama’s top ethics counsel and later worked for Clinton as ambassador to the Czech Republic. Eisen, now a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that at a minimum, Clinton should retain the Obama administration’s current ethics commitments and oversight, which include lobbying restrictions and other rules. Richard Painter, a former ethics adviser to President George W. Bush and currently a University of Minnesota law school professor, said Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton should remove themselves completely from foundation leadership roles, but he added that potential conflicts would shadow any policy decision affecting past donors. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon did not respond to the AP’s questions about Clinton transition plans regarding ethics, but said in a statement Tuesday the standard set by the Clinton Foundation’s ethics restrictions was “unprecedented, even if it may never satisfy some critics.” Some of Clinton’s most influential visitors donated millions to the Clinton Foundation and to her and her husband’s political coffers. They are among scores of Clinton visitors and phone contacts in her official calendar turned over by the State Department to AP last year and in more-detailed planning schedules that so far have covered about half her four-year tenure. The AP sought Clinton’s calendar and schedules three years ago, but delays led the AP to sue the State Department last year in federal court for those materials and other records. S. Daniel Abraham, whose name also was included in emails released by the State Department as part of another lawsuit, is a Clinton fundraising bundler who was listed in Clinton’s planners for eight meetings with her at various times. A billionaire behind the Slim-Fast diet and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace, Abraham told the AP last year his talks with Clinton concerned Mideast issues. Big Clinton Foundation donors with no history of political giving to the Clintons also met or talked by phone with Hillary Clinton and top aides, AP’s review showed. Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest “microcredit” for poor business owners, met with Clinton three times and talked with her by phone during a period when Bangladeshi government authorities investigated his oversight of a nonprofit bank and ultimately pressured him to resign from the bank’s board. Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, and she ordered aides to find ways to assist him. American affiliates of his nonprofit Grameen Bank had been working with the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Global Initiative programs as early as 2005, pledging millions of dollars in microloans for the poor. Grameen America, the bank’s nonprofit U.S. flagship, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation — a figure that bank spokeswoman Becky Asch said reflects the institution’s annual fees to attend CGI meetings. Another Grameen arm chaired by Yunus, Grameen Research, has donated between $25,000 and $50,000. As a U.S. senator from New York, Clinton, as well as then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and two other senators in 2007 sponsored a bill to award a congressional gold medal to Yunus. He got one but not until 2010, a year after Obama awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Yunus first met with Clinton in Washington in April 2009. That was followed six months later by an announcement by USAID, the State Department’s foreign aid arm, that it was partnering with the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit charity run by Yunus, in a $162 million commitment to extend its microfinance concept abroad. USAID also began providing loans and grants to the Grameen Foundation, totaling $2.2 million over Clinton’s tenure. By September 2009, Yunus began complaining to Clinton’s top aides about what he perceived as poor treatment by Bangladesh’s government. His bank was accused of financial mismanagement of Norwegian government aid money — a charge that Norway later dismissed as baseless. But Yunus told Melanne Verveer, a long-time Clinton aide who was an ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, that Bangladesh officials refused to meet with him and asked the State Department for help in pressing his case. “Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a friendly way,” he asked Verveer. Yunus sent “regards to H” and cited an upcoming Clinton Global Initiative event he planned to attend. Clinton ordered an aide: “Give to EAP rep,” referring the problem to the agency’s top east Asia expert. Yunus continued writing to Verveer as pressure mounted on his bank. In December 2010, responding to a news report that Bangladesh’s prime minister was urging an investigation of Grameen Bank, Clinton told Verveer that she wanted to discuss the matter with her East Asia expert “ASAP.” Clinton called Yunus in March 2011 after the Bangladesh government opened an inquiry into his oversight of Grameen Bank. Yunus had told Verveer by email that “the situation does not allow me to leave the country.” By mid-May, the Bangladesh government had forced Yunus to step down from the bank’s board. Yunus sent Clinton a copy of his resignation letter. In a separate note to Verveer, Clinton wrote: “Sad indeed.” Clinton met with Yunus a second time in Washington in August 2011 and again in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka in May 2012. Clinton’s arrival in Bangladesh came after Bangladesh authorities moved to seize control of Grameen Bank’s effort to find new leaders. Speaking to a town hall audience, Clinton warned the Bangladesh government that “we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank.” Grameen America’s Asch referred other questions about Yunus to his office, but he had not responded by Tuesday. Earlier this month, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau acknowledged that agency officials are “regularly in touch with a range of outside individuals and organizations, including nonprofits, NGOs, think tanks and others.” But Trudeau said the State Department was not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation. In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman as one of the attendees. Schwarzman’s firm is a major Clinton Foundation donor, but he personally donates heavily to GOP candidates and causes. One day after the breakfast, according to Clinton emails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman’s request. In December that same year, Schwarzman’s wife, Christine, sat at Clinton’s table during the Kennedy Center Honors. Clinton also introduced Schwarzman, then chairman of the Kennedy Center, before he spoke. Blackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000 to the foundation. And Blackstone’s charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global aid projects ranging from the U.S. to the Mideast. Blackstone officials did not make Schwarzman available for comment. Clinton also met in June 2011 with Nancy Mahon of the MAC AIDS, the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics, which is owned by Estee Lauder. The meeting occurred before an announcement about a State Department partnership to raise money to finance AIDS education and prevention. The public-private partnership was formed to fight gender-based violence in South Africa, the State Department said at the time. The MAC AIDS fund donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. In 2008, Mahon and the MAC AIDS fund made a three-year unspecified commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative. That same year, the fund partnered with two other organizations to beef up a USAID program in Malawi and Ghana. And in 2011, the fund was one of eight organizations to pledge a total of $2 million over a three-year period to help girls in southern Africa. The fund has not made a commitment to CGI since 2011. Estee Lauder executive Fabrizio Freda also met with Clinton at the same Wall Street event attended by Schwarzman. Later that month, Freda was on a list of attendees for a meeting between Clinton and a U.S.-China trade group. Estee Lauder has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The company made a commitment to CGI in 2013 with four other organizations to help survivors of sexual slavery in Cambodia. MAC AIDs officials did not make Mahon available to AP for comment. When Clinton appeared before the U.S. Senate in early 2009 for her confirmation hearing as secretary of state, then- Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, questioned her at length about the foundation and potential conflicts of interest. His concerns were focused on foreign government donations, mostly to CGI. Lugar wanted more transparency than was ultimately agreed upon between the foundation and Obama’s transition team. Now, Lugar hopes Hillary and Bill Clinton make a clean break from the foundation. “The Clintons, as they approach the presidency, if they are successful, will have to work with their attorneys to make certain that rules of the road are drawn up to give confidence to them and the American public that there will not be favoritism,” Lugar said.

Either way, it has become a growing source of discomfort for a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign that would much rather have voters and the media focus on Donald Trump and his finances.\nSo what is the Clinton Foundation, anyway?\nThe Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is an international charitable organisation founded in 1997, originally to establish the Bill Clinton presidential library.\nUnlike personally endowed \"private foundations\" that serve as a pass-through for donations to other groups that do the on-the-ground work, the Clinton Foundation is an \"operating foundation\" - which means it primarily conducts its own charitable activities.\nThe organisation's goal, as stated on its website, external, is decidedly grand: \"We build partnerships between businesses, NGOs, governments, and individuals everywhere to work faster, leaner and better; to find solutions that last; and to transform lives and communities from what they are today to what they can be, tomorrow.\"\nThe foundation has 11 major programmes focusing on agriculture in Africa, combating childhood obesity, economic development in South America, earthquake relief in Haiti, reducing the cost of Aids drugs and mitigating climate change.\nIt also operates the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual gathering of political leaders, business executives, non-profit officials and celebrities that discuss solutions to international problems.\nThe foundation reports that it has raised $2bn (£1.5bn), employs more than 2,000 workers and maintains an annual budget of more than $223m (£170m).\nThe rating group Charity Watch, external gives the Clinton Foundation an \"A\" and reports that 88% of the money the foundation brings in goes to its programmes, with the rest spent on overheads - surpassing the benchmark for reputable charity groups.\nIn an extensive profile, external, the Washington Post details the rather unorthodox way the foundation evolved into its current sprawling, multibillion-dollar form.\n\"It was not designed as a master plan but rather has grown, one brainstorm at a time, in accordance with the ambitious, loyal, restless and often scattered nature of its primary namesake,\" the Post reporters write. \"Many programs were sparked by chance encounters in Bill Clinton's life.\"\nThey describe Mr Clinton as a \"convener who wrangles rich people's money for poor people's problems\".\nWho are these \"rich people\" donors?\nThe Clinton Foundation's list of donors who have given more than a million dollars is a hodgepodge of international aid organisations, national governments, corporations and wealthy international elites.\nThere's the usual collection of prominent charitable groups, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Children's Investment Fund, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pritzker Family Foundation.\nThe contributor roll also includes some heavy-hitting FOBs (friends of Bill, as they're often called) with a decided entertainment-industry tilt, such as American media mogul Fred Eychaner, Ukrainian steel executive Victor Pinchuk, Irish communications billionaire Denis O'Brien and Egyptian-born investor Haim Saban.\nCanadian mining entrepreneur and film-producer Frank Giustra has contributed more than $100m to the foundation's various enterprises and is on its board of directors.\nThe governments of the Netherlands, Kuwait, Norway, Australia and Saudi Arabia also are big-money donors, as are the companies ExxonMobil, Cisco, Booz Allen Hamilton, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Barclays bank and TracFone Wireless.\nAll in all, more than half of the million-dollar-plus contributors are from outside the US.\nWhy has the foundation been controversial?\nAn organisation that brings in billions of dollars in donations from around the world and is operated by an ex-president and a possible future president who served at a high level in another presidency creates all sorts of possible conflicts of interest.\nIt's something the Obama White House was keenly aware of when it vetted Mrs Clinton for the secretary of state job in 2009. Before she was offered the Cabinet-level position White House adviser Valerie Jarrett negotiated an ethics agreement with Bruce Linsey, then the head of the Clinton Foundation, that set out a separation between the charity organisation and the State Department.\nMrs Clinton signed a document, external in which she promised to remove herself from participation in any matter that could have a \"direct and predictable effect\" on the foundation unless she had a written waiver from the administration.\nDespite these paper pledges, Clinton critics assert that the foundation created the possibility that donors could unduly influence Mrs Clinton's official actions and provide individuals with special access to her.\nWhat kind of actions or access are we talking about?\nThe 2015 book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer laid out numerous examples of Clinton Foundation donations that were followed by State Department actions that were favourable to the donor.\nThe New York Times, in an April 2015 article, took a detailed look at one such instance.\nIn 2010 the State Department approved a move by the Russian state-owned company Rosatom to purchase a Canadian mining company with uranium mineral rights on US soil after a bank with ties to the Russian company paid Mr Clinton $500,000 for a speaking engagement in Moscow. The Canadian company in question was founded by million-dollar foundation donor Frank Giustra.\nThe Clinton campaign has been quick to point out that the State Department wasn't the only US government agency that had to sign off on the deal and that there was no evidence that Mrs Clinton did anything improper.\nThere have been no clear quid-pro-quo connections found in any of Schweizer's list of alleged transgressions.\nQuestions about special access for donors surfaced in August 2016, when emails on the private server Mrs Clinton maintained while secretary of state revealed that the firewall between the foundation and State Department wasn't always impregnable.\nFor instance, foundation executive Doug Band contacted top Clinton State Department official Huma Abedin - who also was also paid as an independent contractor by the foundation - about arranging special government meetings for donors such as Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, weight-loss drink executive S Daniel Abraham and Lebanese-Nigerian Gilbert Chagoury.\n\"We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon,\" Band wrote to Abedin and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in one email. \"As you know, he's a key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp[ortant].\"\nClinton campaign officials have said that many of the meetings never happened and, in any event, Mrs Clinton never took actions based on contributions to the foundation.\nThat hasn't stopped another round of questions about the foundation, however.\n\"The Clintons' cosy relationship with their foundation's global patrons was a problem when Hillary was secretary of state and it is a problem now that she's running for president,\" writes, external Slate's Josh Vorhees.\nKevin Drum of the liberal Mother Jones magazine is unimpressed, external, however, saying Mrs Clinton ran the department with \"a surprisingly high level of integrity\".\n\"Lots of people talked to Huma Abedin to try to set up meetings with Hillary Clinton,\" he writes. \"Generally speaking, Abedin treated them politely but told them to get lost. That's about it.\"\nOn 23 August, the Associated Press reported, external that during the first two years of Mrs Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, more than half the non-governmental, non-foreign individuals Mrs Clinton had official meetings or phone calls with were donors to the Clinton Foundation.\n\"The frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton,\" Stephen Braun and Eileen Sullivan write.\nThe Clinton campaign called the AP report \"outrageous\" and that Mrs Clinton had around 1,700 meetings in her first two years in office, of which only 85 were with foundation donors - some of whom were Nobel Prize laureates and leaders of major charity groups, like Melinda Gates.\nThere have been enough doubts raised about the nature of the ties between the foundation and the State Department, however, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation considered opening a public corruption investigation into the matter.\nWhy didn't the FBI investigate the foundation?\nAccording to press reports, external, earlier in 2016 three FBI field offices recommended launching a formal probe into the possibility of criminal conflict of interest between the foundation and the State Department after a bank informed the bureau of \"suspicious activity\" by an unnamed foreigner who gave money to the foundation.\nThe Justice Department, which had conducted its own review of allegations made in Schweizer's Clinton Cash book, reportedly told the FBI that it concluded there were no grounds for a formal investigation.\nAccording to conservative writer Noah Rothman of Commentary magazine, it is \"almost impossible to divorce the Obama Justice Department's transparently political handling of the Clinton email saga with its transparently political handling of the Clinton Foundation woes\".\nThere are some reports, external in conservative media that the federal attorneys are conducting a separate investigation into the Clinton foundation, although there has been no confirmation from any of the parties involved.\nClinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon has called, external these stories \"baseless\".\nThe Clinton campaign isn't concerned?\nEven as the Clinton team denies the various allegations and rumours swirling around the Clinton Foundation, it has taken some concrete steps to try to defuse the situation.\nOn 18 August, Mr Clinton announced that the foundation would no longer accept foreign or corporate donations if Mrs Clinton were to be elected president. In addition he said he would stop giving paid speeches for the duration of the campaign, end the annual Clinton Global Initiative meetings and step down from the organisation's board of directors during his wife's time in the White House.\nThe move doesn't apply to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which works to lower the cost of Aids drugs in developing nations. It has a separate board of directors and will consider a similar move at a later date.\nMr Clinton's announced steps may not be enough to assuage concerns about the possibility of conflicts of interest, however.\nEarlier in the week the Boston Globe's editorial board urged, external the foundation to stop accepting donations of any kind for the remainder of the campaign and shut down entirely if Mrs Clinton is elected president.\n\"If the foundation's donors are truly motivated by altruism, and not by the lure of access to the Clintons, then surely they can find other ways to support the foundation's goals,\" the editors write. \"And in four or eight years, the Clinton family could always form a new foundation and re-establish their charitable efforts.\"\nNew York magazine's Jonathan Chait echoed this call, external, writing that the foundation is \"hardly a large or unique source of corruption\", but is \"a source of grubby, low-level access headaches\".\nFormer Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who served as chair of the Democratic National Committee during the last year of Mr Clinton's presidency, said, external it would be \"impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem\".\nIn June Mr Clinton said, external that the foundation would make \"some changes\" if his wife were elected president, but \"we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it\".\nGiven the level of uproar, however, the bridge may be underfoot.\nSo what does Donald Trump have to say about all this?\nUnsurprisingly, the Republican nominee isn't holding back when it comes to lobbing charges of criminality against his Democratic opponent. He has repeatedly called the Clinton Foundation a \"pay to play\" scheme that allowed Mrs Clinton to influence-peddle while at the State Department.\nAt a rally on 22 August Mr Trump called for, external a special prosecutor to investigate the Clinton Foundation, adding that the Justice Department and the FBI can't be trusted to \"quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton's new crimes\".\nEarlier that day, the campaign released a statement, external calling for the foundation to be shut down immediately.\n\"It is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history,\" Mr Trump said in the release. \"What they were doing during crooked Hillary's time as secretary of state was wrong then, and it is wrong now.\"\nThe swirls of controversy around the Clinton Foundation have given Mr Trump and his campaign surrogates the opportunity to go on the attack against Mrs Clinton after weeks of unforced errors and sinking poll numbers.\nMrs Clinton already suffers from negative ratings for her honesty and integrity in opinion surveys, so many Americans may be predisposed to believe the allegations of improper behaviour while secretary of state are valid.\nMr Trump has serious favourability issues of his own, of course, but it seems like the strategy for the duration of the campaign will be to try to drag Mrs Clinton down as low as possible - and his campaign seems convinced the foundation is a key point of weakness.\nClarification 26 August 2016: We have been asked to make clear that the Crown Prince of Bahrain is not a donor to the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton Global Initiative and that requests for a meeting were also made through official channels.\n- Published6 November 2016\n- Published22 June 2016\n- Published10 August 2016\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

Here's what that means for the election\nGeorgia saw record-high early voting numbers. Here's what that means for the election\nNPR's Scott Simon talks with University of Florida Professor Michael McDonald about the high turnout in early voting this election cycle.\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\nOver 10 million ballots have already been cast in the 2024 election, two and a half weeks before what we still call Election Day. Early voting is underway in many states, and in one of the biggest swing states, the rush to the polls has been big.\nSIMON: (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nDAVID MUIR: A record-breaking first day of voting in the battleground of Georgia today.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST: More than 305,000 people cast their ballot Tuesday, more than two times the number in the past two election cycles.\nSIMON: Michael McDonald joins us. He's a professor of political science at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections. He joins us from Gainesville. Thanks so much for being with us.\nMICHAEL MCDONALD: Wonderful to be with you.\nSIMON: Has there been a growth in early voting?\nMCDONALD: Oh, yeah. I mean, over a million people have already voted in Georgia. We're seeing big numbers elsewhere as well. They're not as big as they were in 2020 because the pandemic was a very unusual election, and we had record numbers of people who were casting mail ballots. But if we look at the longer trend line, yes, these are numbers that look increasingly over from election to election, setting aside that 2020 election.\nSIMON: And what do you think we can learn or infer from this turnout?\nMCDONALD: Well, from the vote-by-mail states, we're going to know something about the turnout overall in the country. In 2020, I could see that we were surpassing the total vote cast in 2016 in the early vote alone the week before the election. And indeed, in 2020, the turnout rate was the highest that we had seen since 1900. So we're looking fairly robust right now in terms of participation. At the moment, I'm shading our turnout more towards the 2020 record turnout than, say, the 2016, which was still very high.\nSIMON: What do you caution people we shouldn't infer or assume from all the early voting?\nMCDONALD: Well, we're already seeing, as we normally see, that the Democrats are voting early. We expect that to happen because Democrats prefer to vote early. And the Democrats have to build up a seawall. And then, on Election Day, we see that red wave come in. And then the question is, will that seawall that the Democrats have built, is that going to be enough to withstand the red wave that's going to happen on Election Day? So just because the Democrats are leading at this moment, that's not to say that Harris is going to win the presidency. We still have a long ways to go, and, of course, we need to see Election Day.\nSIMON: Why the assumption that it's the Democrats who are voting early?\nMCDONALD: I've followed this since 2008, and every year, we see more Democrats vote early than Republicans. In fact, I mean, if you're in a state and you don't see that pattern, it's almost a sure indication that the Republicans are going to win whatever state offices there are for that election cycle. Why is it? It's a good question. In more recent years, of course, we've had President Trump disparage early voting in its various forms, and his supporters have listened to him. This time around, he has softened his language on early voting. And it - actually, it looks like it's happening in the data. We can see more Republicans than we have in typical past elections voting early. You know, maybe this advantage that the Democrats have had since 2008, maybe it won't be as significant as - this year as we've seen in the past. But again, we still have a long ways to go.\nSIMON: What are you watching for at this point in the election as we get reports about mail-in voting?\nMCDONALD: Again, we expect the Democrats to do well and pile up early votes. So that's what's happening. That's the expected thing. What I'm seeing at the moment is that not only are there more Democrats voting; they're also returning those mail ballots at a higher rate than the Republicans who have requested those mail ballots. So it looks like there's some level of enthusiasm that's lurking inside these numbers. Republicans tend, at least in the past, to have voted later in the cycle, so we'll have to see if this persists. But right now, that's the most interesting thing to me of what's going on.\nSIMON: I have to ask, Professor McDonald, do you ever tell people, well, why don't we wait until we count the ballots?\nMCDONALD: I do say that. I mean, I've been trying to say that. I mean, we know that the Democrats are going to build up a lead in the early vote if typical past patterns occur, and then we're going to see what happens on Election Day. So, yes, I firmly believe that we need to wait till everyone has voted to actually know what the outcome's going to be.\nSIMON: Michael McDonald is a political science professor at the University of Florida.

It's, like, very fun.\nSTEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Throw popcorn...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nFOWLER: ...And other things like that.\nLOPEZ: So fun. Hey, there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Ashley Lopez. I cover voting.\nPARKS: I'm Miles Parks. I also cover voting.\nFOWLER: And I'm Stephen Fowler. I cover the campaign.\nLOPEZ: And today on the show, we're going to talk about voting. In-person voting started throughout much of the country last week, which means we can actually start seeing some voting trends start to form. We are, of course, expecting this year to be different than four years ago. I don't have to remind everyone that 2020 was a super-weird year. This year, things are very different, so naturally, voting patterns have changed.\nMiles, why don't you start off by telling us what looks different so far this year compared to four years ago?\nPARKS: Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting, because 2020 more and more is feeling like an...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nPARKS: ...Outlier in every sense of the word, right? And we kind of knew that as it was happening, but it is becoming more and more clear as we look at kind of early voting numbers. More than 49 million early votes have now been cast across the country in this election. And I think it's been interesting over the last couple of weeks. I don't know about you guys, I've been seeing headlines, like, every day about, like, record-shattering...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nPARKS: ...Early vote in XYZ place. And it's been a little confusing for me to take in, because when you actually compare the numbers to 2020, we're actually way down across the country in terms of early voting. In 2020, at this point in the cycle, according to the AP, there were more than 60 million votes cast.\nBasically, what's been happening is in a lot of these places, more people are returning to in-person voting as opposed to that mail voting. And so we are seeing record-breaking early in-person turnout in a number of states. But just to put a ribbon on it, I think it's important to take even a bigger-picture look and just note the fact that the country is voting early more broadly...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nPARKS: ...Than they were 10 or 20 years ago. We are already, at this point in the 2024 cycle, with a week left of voting, that we have more early votes cast in the 2024 election than in all of 2016 in terms of early voting. And so there is this - a general trend line towards more early voting. It's just not at the same level as we were in the heart of the pandemic.\nLOPEZ: Yeah. What I think I was seeing was, like, the first few days of early voting there was record turnout, and then it sort of tapered off into looking like more, like, normal rates of early voting. Which I guess just says to me that a lot of voters who probably voted by mail in 2020 were people who had made their decision, probably months ago, about who they were going to vote for. They just voted in person this time, right?\nPARKS: Yeah, it does seem like that. I was e-mailing with Charles Stewart, who's, like, kind of election data wizard over at MIT. And I asked him, like, what do you make of all these headlines and stuff? And his response was, yikes. I think way too much is being made of this.\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nPARKS: Basically, because exactly of what you're saying. He just said it seems like these high-propensity voters who, you know, would vote any method you give them, are just choosing to vote early...\nLOPEZ: Right.\nPARKS: ...In person, which is generating these headlines, but it's very, very unclear that it actually is going to mean, you know, an overall turnout bump in 2024.\nFOWLER: It is also a good time to point out that different states have different voting rules, different access to early voting, and have changed things since 2020. So, for example, in Georgia, we actually have a slightly larger overall turnout at this point than we did in 2020, but that's driven by in-person early voting instead of voting by mail. The mail numbers are way down from 2020. In-person early voting numbers are way up.\nAnd it's also important to remind people that, you know, what's happening in these states where the election is going to be very close is driving a little bit more of those headlines than what's happening in, say...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nFOWLER: ...States that aren't close and that maybe always vote by mail or always have in person. So it's a little bit \"your mileage may vary\" when it comes to early voting, but it is clear that there's going to be a little bit of a different picture, once all is said and done, come next week.\nLOPEZ: Yeah. I do want to take a moment to talk, Miles, about what this means for election workers, because we both talk to people in the election space who always say, like, early voting, if people can vote in high numbers in early voting, that makes our jobs easier. I wonder if you've heard yet about what these high early voting numbers, especially in the first bit of early voting, means for people who run elections.\nPARKS: Yeah. There is this general sense of optimism that there are these big numbers for the early in-person vote the first few days of early in-person voting in a lot of these states. I was talking recently with the Republican Secretary of State of Kentucky, Michael Adams, who has been spending a lot of time this year trying to get Republicans OK with early voting. As we know, Donald Trump spent a lot of time in 2020 demonizing mail voting and early voting. But there's been a real shift among the Trump campaign and many other notable Republicans, who have just kind of given a little bit more of a green light to Republicans to vote early, and it seems like at this point that they're doing that. Here's what Adams said.\nMICHAEL ADAMS: My biggest focus is encouraging the use of early voting, which I brought to Kentucky my first year. And I primarily want people to use it so we can avoid crowds and chaos on Tuesday, Election Day. Every day of voting is Election Day. It's all the same. So pick a day that's better for you. It's not just going to lead to a shorter wait time for you, it also is going to make it much easier on the poll workers and the process.\nPARKS: So I feel like that's going to be the natural next step here, is watching what this means for Tuesday. Hopefully, for election workers and for voters, the more early voting there is, there will be less lines on Tuesday, but we'll have to see if that bears out.\nLOPEZ: Yeah. Well, and Stephen, we already mentioned, like, this is not - like, this early voting data is not tea leaves. You're not going to glean any sort of, like, information about how this is all going to shake out from what we're seeing. But there are some trend lines, especially in some of these battleground states like Georgia, that, like, does illustrate how things are changing. And so can you walk us through some of the things you're seeing in Georgia?\nFOWLER: Yeah. So there has been a lot of discussion online of people trying to divine meaning from microscopic changes in numbers at the county level or the precinct level in multiple states, Georgia included. That's not necessarily a healthy way to spend your time between...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nPARKS: (Laughter).\nFOWLER: ...Now and polls closing on Tuesday.\nLOPEZ: Take a walk.\nFOWLER: But, when you look under the hood of things in Georgia, for example, you can look at the voter history file, which tells you when people voted in previous elections. And by mashing all of that data together in the first couple days of early voting in Georgia, there was a spike in participation among primarily white rural men and white rural women that voted in Republican primaries and live in majority Republican areas that showed up and voted early in person earlier than they normally do vote early in person. And some people that normally voted on Election Day have now voted earlier. And so that message of show up, swamp the vote, bank your vote, you know, get it done and get it out of the way really has resonated with Republicans showing up to vote.\nNow, because this isn't 2020, there were a lot of people that voted by mail, especially Democrats and Black voters and young voters that haven't voted yet because, you know, they can't mail it in or put it in a drop box or return it like that, that we are starting to see those numbers pick up of people voting later in 2024 than they did in 2020. Now, looking at the first couple of days, it made it seem like, ah, there's this groundswell of Republican voting and Democrats aren't voting. And shocker, now that we are getting into the final days and people are procrastinating and finally getting that ballot in, there's a lot more parity.\nBut what this means in Georgia and in other battleground states is that we're not necessarily going to be able to tell as much about who voted more and who needs to have more people show up on Election Day until everything is finalized and cast and counted. So put the tea leaves down, put the calculator down, put the Excel spreadsheet down because everything is a lot different, and people have shifted things in the last four years.\nLOPEZ: All right. Let's take a quick break. More in a moment.\nAnd we're back. And, Stephen, I wonder what you make of the fact that so many Republicans voted early this time, considering that there has been some sort of, like, interesting counter-messaging through the past few years about voting early, particularly mail-in voting, which is part of the early voting, like, mix. And, you know, I know Republicans, particularly the Republican National Committee, spent money on things like bank your vote and swamp your vote to sort of undo that messaging from the Trump campaign. What do you make of all this? I mean, can we say that those campaigns worked?\nFOWLER: I mean, I think it is the power of messaging. I mean, Trump and Republicans have demonized early voting by mail so much that we're not really seeing that. We've seen laws change and access change, but the concept of showing up and showing up early where there's fewer lines and kind of banking your vote...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nFOWLER: ...As sort of a firewall against Democratic voting later is something that's broken through. And case in point, look at Western North Carolina, that was devastated by a hurricane. You know, they're still having people show up and vote, and their voter participation isn't as low as it could have been after the hurricane went through in part because the RNC has been messaging, hey, let us help you with recovery, let us make sure you're OK. And also, here's how you can early vote to make sure that you still have access to the ballot.\nPARKS: I think there's also one more kind of optimistic point for election officials on some of this stuff, Ashley, that, you know, when we talk about election denial more broadly, I think there's a lot of fears when you look at polling numbers, that find that majority of Republican voters don't trust the election system, for instance, right? But I think the fact that Trump basically said in 2020, don't vote early and don't vote by mail, the voters followed him. And then once he kind of gave the green light to start doing it, that it seems like a number of Republicans have been OK with that. I think also sheds broader light on this idea what Trump says about the elections more broadly is going to really dictate how people feel about them as opposed to some deep core belief that can't...\nLOPEZ: Yeah.\nPARKS: ...Be changed. And so I think there is this kind of malleability about many of these voters when it comes to elections that I think should actually give election workers a lot of hope that these people are not people who you can't bring back into the kind of the trust fold.\nLOPEZ: And Miles, I mean, one of the things that we've historically told folks to be mindful of, especially on election night, is that Republican votes have historically tallied up quickly because they live mostly in less dense areas, and they can tally, like, the election officials there can tally and submit totals more quickly than bigger cities. Many have maybe heard this called the red mirage. I mean, are we expecting to see the same sort of thing this year?\nPARKS: Election officials that I've talked to are trying to project that as a possibility. I think there is some cautious optimism that because it seems like there's going to be a lot less voting by mail this time around than in 2020, that results in some of these states still could come faster than in 2020. Also, election officials have spent the last four years - right? - preparing for this presidential election, and we are not in the middle of a pandemic.\nBut I do think the two states that I'm going to be watching really closely when it comes to this kind of shift over election night and into the couple of days after are going to be Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, specifically because these are two states where election officials still cannot pre-process absentee ballots. This is doing the work like signature verification and things like flattening ballots to get them prepared to go into scanners. They cannot do that work until on Election Day.\nIn almost every other state, election officials can do a lot of that nitty-gritty preparation work so that way mail ballots can be counted really quickly. In those two states, they can't. And so what we may see because, as we know, Democrats are using mail voting more frequently still than Republicans, you still could see those mail ballots in those two swing states take a little bit longer. So you could see a situation where Republicans look like they're ahead, and then the Democratic votes come either later into the night or in the days following.\nFOWLER: And as an interesting counterpoint in Georgia because of the changes to election law, we should actually see more of the results quicker in Georgia. One, fewer people will be voting by mail, so even though they can be processed earlier, there are just going to be fewer of those votes to be counted. But two, with more people voting early in person, those numbers will be reported first. So if there's more Republicans early voting and more Democrats early voting, those will be the first numbers to come in. Georgia also has a law where the counties have to report the denominator of the total votes cast on Election Day by 10 p.m.\nSo we should know before going to bed on election night - no matter how late that may be - roughly how many total votes there are in Georgia, even though those won't be counted yet. So this perception of, oh, X candidate was ahead when I went to sleep, and I woke up, and things changed should be tamped down on because things will be able to be counted faster and communicated faster. And in Georgia, at least, the fuller picture should come a lot sooner than in 2020 or years past.\nPARKS: I do think it's important to note, though, on election night, you can expect many Republicans across the country to point the fingers at Pennsylvania and say they really need to be counting their ballots faster. When in reality, it was Republicans in the state legislature in Pennsylvania who declined over the last four years to take up legislation to fix this problem. Everyone always points at Florida and says, Florida counts their ballots so quickly. They have election results on election night every single time. A big, huge part of that is the fact that they allow pre-processing of absentee ballots four weeks leading up to election day. And so the fact that the Pennsylvania legislature was not able to change those rules leading up to this election is going to be why we see some of those delays potentially.\nLOPEZ: All right. Let's leave it there for today. I'm Ashley Lopez. I cover voting.\nPARKS: I'm Miles Parks. I also cover voting.\nFOWLER: And I'm Stephen Fowler. I cover the campaign.\nLOPEZ: And thank you for listening to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE BIGTOP ORCHESTRA'S \"TEETER BOARD: FOLIES BERGERE (MARCH AND TWO-STEP)\")\nCopyright © 2024 NPR.

Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen, of pushing “sex changes for kids.” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also unveiled Tuesday his campaign’s biggest ad buy yet for two ads accusing challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, D-Dallas, of supporting legislation that allows men to use women’s restrooms and not knowing “the difference between boys and girls.”\nDemocrats and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized the attacks as peddling dangerous and false narratives about transgender youth. Gonzalez and Allred also said the ads were a mischaracterization of their stances.\n“The rhetoric is truly alarming, and trans Texans have dealt with a lot. They don’t need their lives politicized,” said Johnathan Gooch, communications director at Equality Texas, an LGBTQ+ political rights group. “I think most Texans care about their grocery bill more than they care about anything else.”\nDemocrats question the strategy of focusing so heavily on the issue as opposed to others that have repeatedly come up in polling and focus groups as at the top of voters’ minds, such as the economy and the border.\n“Voters won’t fall for baseless and desperate lies about Vicente Gonzalez’s record,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Lauryn Fanguen said in a statement. “While Mayra Flores voted against lowering health care and drug costs and would jeopardize Social Security and Medicare, Vicente Gonzalez is working every day to lower costs for Valley families.”\nThe scale of the ad buys indicates that Republicans view the message as a major pillar of their electoral strategy. The Cruz campaign said the two ads are part of a $6.7 million ad buy in coordination with the Republican Party of Texas — the biggest ad buy by the campaign so far. For comparison, Cruz announced a $4.4 million investment in Hispanic outreach in July, which featured broadcast advertising, digital outreach, billboards, text messaging and phone banking.\nThe NRCC’s ad against Gonzalez is the group’s first ad in the state this cycle. Republicans hope to flip the seat, which is among its highest priorities this fall. Former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores is challenging Gonzalez for the South Texas seat. Their ad is part of an $800,000 ad reservation in the Harlingen market and will be broadcast in both English and Spanish.\nRepublicans have also poured large amounts of money into attacking Democrats in the state on the border and economy. Both emerged as the biggest issues in the state during the primaries and continue to resonate with voters. But the NRCC found in polling and focus groups that messages linking Gonzalez to access to gender transition surgeries for minors and without parental consent was the top performing to convert support for Flores, the group confirmed.\nPolling by the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs showed that a majority of Texans responded unfavorably toward allowing transgender people to choose which bathroom to use, participate in women’s sports and receive gender affirming care under 18. But a large majority of Texans — over 70% — support general protections for LGBTQ+ people from discrimination, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.\nThe strategy is not limited to Texas. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley released an ad this week featuring Riley Gaines, a competitive swimmer who has advocated against trans women participating in women’s sports.\nThe NRCC ad features a man accusing Gonzalez of spending his time advocating for youth gender transition instead of on economic issues.\n“How is that supposed to help our economy? He says, ‘Vicente con la gente.’ He’s not,” the ad says.\nGonzalez, a moderate Democrat who has voted with Republicans in the past, said in a statement to The Texas Tribune that he “never supported tax dollars paying for gender transition surgeries and never will.”\n“If [Flores] wants to talk about things that actually hurt South Texans’ wallets, she should mention how she’s opposed lowering drug costs and healthcare prices — how she supports defunding Social Security and Medicare. Let’s let the record speak for itself,” Gonzalez said.\nThe ad cites Gonzalez’s support for the Equality Act, which bars gender discrimination in public places, including based on if a person is transgender. The bill passed the House in 2021 with all Democrats voting yes but has stalled in the Senate.\nChild gender transition surgery is exceedingly rare, according to a July study by Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Gender affirming care for minors usually manifests in allowing children to dress how they want, changing pronouns and using hormone blockers to delay puberty. The Texas Legislature passed a ban on hormone blockers for minors during last year’s session.\nCruz’s ad also cited Allred’s support for the Equality Act and his vote against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023. That bill would cut off federal funds for athletic programs that allow men, “based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth,” to compete in women’s or girls’ sports. The bill passed the House in 2023 with all Republicans supporting and all Democrats against. It also stalled in the Senate.\n“Now our girls are being left in the dust, robbed of their right to compete freely. And Colin Allred voted in Congress to oppose Texas state law that protects women’s sports,” the ad said. “Colin Allred voted to allow boys in girls’ bathrooms, boys in girls’ locker rooms, boys in girls’ sports.”\nAllred’s campaign blasted the ads as a “disgusting, false attack, and another example of how Ted Cruz only wants to divide Texans.”\nCruz will “say anything to distract from his dangerous abortion ban that is putting women’s lives at risk, trying to raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare and fleeing to Cancun during a deadly winter storm,” Josh Stewart, an Allred spokesperson, said in a statement.\nAllred has been a vocal supporter for LGBTQ+ rights in Congress. He was a co-sponsor of a resolution to create a “Transgender Bill of Rights to protect and codify the rights of transgender and nonbinary people under the law and ensure their access to medical care, shelter, safety, and economic security.”\nDisclosure: Equality Texas and University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

McKinley to Denali, the native Alaskan name.\nSoon after, a meme began circulating on social media claiming Denali as the Kenyan word for “black power.” The meme’s false but viral assertion earned it PolitiFact’s most notorious rating of “Pants on Fire.” And, aside from being completely false, the website pointed out that Kenyan isn’t even a language.\nIt’s examples such as this that provide a compendium of what it’s like to be surrounded by misinformation in an ever-increasing digital environment.\n“A lot of times we tend to share and believe messages that already affirm our held beliefs because that makes us feel good,” said Julie Smith, who joined “St. Louis on the Air” host Don Marsh.\nSmith is a media literacy educator and the author of “Master the Media: How Teaching Media Literacy Can Save Our Plugged-in World.”\nBut what exactly is media literacy?\n“It’s the ability to critically analyze and evaluate the media we consume daily,” Smith said.\nAnd, while Smith acknowledged that it’s a lofty goal for media literacy to “save” the world, she explained that media literate evaluation would make people smarter consumers, voters and less likely to be sheep.\nThe first step toward media literacy, Smith said, is to increase awareness about what it means to be media literate. “There are all of these studies about how we use the media, but there’s no work about how the media uses us,” she said.\nSmith added that promoting education about media literacy in schools is also a key step.\nSt. Louis on the Air discusses issues and concerns facing the St. Louis area.

McKinley, named for President William McKinley, after its traditional Athabaskan name, “Denali.”\nMost of the criticism consisted of the usual accusations — Obama overstepping his power in the executive branch, ignoring the U.S. Congress (where a similar discussion has been ongoing for years), and a litany of other supposedly impeachable offenses.\nHowever, perhaps the most volatile — yet otherwise unsurprising — bit of flack came in the form of a rather misinformed meme. The meme claims that “Denali” is a Kenyan word for “black power”:\nAs the fact checkers over at Snopes were quick to point out, however, this is not the case for a variety of easily discernible reasons.\nCitizens of Kenya do not speak “Kenyan” because such a language does not exist. Instead, they either speak English or Swahili — the country’s two official languages. As for Kenya’s other 66 languages, one is dead, five are linguistic imports brought in by immigrants, and the rest mostly consist of east African tribal languages and pidgin dialects. None of these are called “Kenyan.”\nThe word “Denali” has no phonetic or semantic equivalent in any of these languages. Rather, it originates from North America, specifically the indigenous Athabaskan language of the region. The most common English translation is “the great one,” though the word famously has no hard-and-fast English referent. Even so, Alaskans have been calling Mt. McKinley by its older, traditional name for quite some time.\n“This name change recognizes the sacred status of Denali to many Alaska Natives,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement. “The name Denali has been official for use by the State of Alaska since 1975, but even more importantly, the mountain has been known as Denali for generations. With our own sense of reverence for this place, we are officially renaming the mountain Denali in recognition of the traditions of Alaska Natives and the strong support of the people of Alaska.”\nAnd perhaps that’s one of the more important glossed-over aspects of this whole silly debacle. For while conservative and social media commentators took great pleasure in blaming Obama directly for the official name change, it was actually Jewell’s doing. Secretarial Order No. 3337 was created, drafted and approved by Jewell’s office — it merely received the White House’s blessing.\nOr if you want to think about it linguistically, Jewell’s order was blessed by President Barack (Hebrew/Arabic roots meaning “blessed”) Obama.\n[h/t Eric Geller, Snopes]\n[Images via Shutterstock.com, Snopes]\n— —\n>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter\nThis is an opinion piece. The views expressed in this article are those of just the author.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        President Obama’s decision that the federal government will now call what was formerly Mount McKinley, the continent’s highest peak, by its older, First Nations name of Denali, which means “The High One,” caused some hysteria this week, though mostly among the predictably hysterical. Part of it may have come from stripping away the prefatory article: from now on it’s not even Mount Denali, just Denali, causing in some the shock your parents felt when you explained that the band was not called “The Cream” but “Cream,” for God’s sake. Denali, to be sure, though itself an excellent rock-band name, has more of a seventies feeling—one expects a band called Denali to have a lead singer with a shaky falsetto, chirping songs of natural mysticism like, well, like the band called America.\nThe hysteria seems to have been the result of a suspicion that the new, or rather original, name was preferred because it was more “politically correct.” They’re just practicing identity politics at twenty thousand feet! the cry went up, amid accusations of kowtowing to the Yupik or Inuit or choosing a new name just because it’s the kind of thing people like that do. Let Obama rename a mountain, and the next thing you know he might do something really pernicious, like avoiding unnecessary wars or expanding health care for the helpless. And then there was the Internet rumor that “Denali” was the “Kenyan” word for black power (it isn’t), not to mention an anagram for “Denial,” presumably of our glorious imperial past. Rather tellingly silent throughout has been the half-termer herself, former Governor Sarah Palin, perhaps for the simple reason that she, too, appears to be part of this new plot against America, having called the mountain Denali, as Alaskans often do, even in her resignation speech.\nWeirdly, no one has mentioned the earlier occasion when the name of a liberal President was pushed off an entire peninsula and no one complained. In 1963, the Kennedy family apparently made the modest suggestion that a fitting tribute to the murdered President might be the Florida space center that he had done so much to bring into existence. L.B.J., with his usual Texan appetite for overcharge, caused the entire peninsula of Cape Canaveral to be renamed in J.F.K.’s honor, as Cape Kennedy. The earlier name was a popular one, though, and a mere decade later the state of Florida turned it back into Cape Canaveral. The federal authorities acquiesced, and the Kennedy family, and liberals generally, were properly quiet.\nThe truth is that the obsession with word magic and names is a primitive one, inherently irrational. Names are notional. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet—or as rancid, depending; a mountain by its older name is just as tall. Yet the desire to remedy the wrongs of the past by righting our nomenclature is a deep one, and it burns on. Word magic it may be, and no more than that, but we believe in magic, and we think in words. During and after the French Revolution, a flurry of renaming turned the Place Louis XV into the bloody Place de la Révolution and finally into the conciliatory Place de la Concorde, and the Place Royale into the mundane Place des Vosges (the Vosges being the department of France that most speedily paid Napoleon’s taxes). Big things have names that change as the people who own them change, too. The mountain we call Everest was named, in the nineteenth century, after a Welshman, though the Tibetan people had called it Chomolungma, “Mother Of The Universe.” (Weirdly, if the Welshman’s name were properly pronounced, it would be known as Eve-Rest, evoking the final resting place of the mother of us all, rather than the superlative form of “ever.”) In more recent decades, the Nepalese government, in what was in some measure an expression of nationalism, took up the Sanskrit name of Sagarmatha for the peak.\nSome new names never catch on, while old names stick irrevocably, no matter what Presidents say or do. A sixteen-year-old girl who had passed most of her life in New York asked her father the other day to please explain why there were insignia medallions of Cuba and Canada on lower Sixth Avenue. From his own musty memories, he explained that the avenue was once named—was actually still named, though never called—the Avenue of the Americas, due to a bit of showy postwar politicking with Fiorello La Guardia (and Nelson Rockefeller leaning in) at the controls. (The dad was actually disappointed to learn that most of the medallions, once a bit of ornamental excess whose point was to be treated disdainfully, have vanished; they ought to be restored.)\nMost of the renamings of the past to suit the present are harmless, or silly, but some have an edgy and quarrelsome side. Andrew Jackson, Indian killer and hardened racist, gives his name and his face to the twenty-dollar bill. Should we obliterate his image from our money, as we have obliterated McKinley from the mountain? Should we rename every street, rededicate every monument, repurpose every President, to conform to our enlightenment?\nIt’s obvious—or it should be so—that we cannot rename and reorder all the remnants of the past according to the present’s pieties, for the simple reason that the present’s pieties will not be the pieties of the future. One of the many evils of ISIS and the Taliban is their desire to remake the past entirely in their own image; changing old names too casually is a more harmless form of blowing up Buddhas. Pluralism makes retrospective, historical demands as well as immediate ones. New York should not again become New Amsterdam, no matter how passionately any revanchist Dutch may feel about it.\nBut we can distinguish, simply enough, between the stubbornly recalcitrant parts of the past and those easily remedied—an Alaskan mountain with a fine and ancient native name has no need to bear that of an Ohio politician who was never anywhere near it. We are not insulting William McKinley, the former President, when we change it; we are honoring the mountain, and the first people who saw it often enough to love it.\nThere is, in general, an easy resolution to this problem of when we should adjust the past to the present, one neither “relativist” nor unduly pietist. We need ask merely, What was the most humane view being widely urged at the time, and does the name or people we honor celebrate that? Slavery is a good instance—there was absolutely no shortage of articulate and eloquent people for whom slavery was an absolute evil. Already in the mid-eighteenth century, long before the classic period of American abolitionism began, Samuel Johnson, the greatest conservative poet in the English language, was outspoken about the evils of slavery; he thought, with uncomfortable persuasiveness, that the American Revolution was stained beyond redemption by its hypocrisy on the subject. Those who stood and made the case for slavery, then and later, were not simply people of their time and temper. They were wrong, and were called so by the good people of the same time. When we honor them—say, on the side of a mountain in Georgia—we honor what everyone knew was wrong, or could have known.\nSo let us remove the wrong people’s names and pictures from our bills and byways, while remembering that we are, or will be, regarded as the wrong people ourselves in some way we cannot yet fully conceive—as we will be seen as better people than we know in some way that we do not yet fully recognize. (We now cherish the diets of nineteenth-century farm dwellers, though they merely mostly endured them.) Nothing depends on names. The rock will not get an inch taller or shorter or changed in nature depending on what we call it. If Ohioans want to keep calling it Mount McKinley, let them, and let them take a place of pride along with those who are fighting to keep Pluto called a planet. We are not slaves of our tongues. But we are citizens of our languages. Choosing names is a way of expressing emotions. The things of this world can exist with as many names as we choose to give them, and the biggest among them can take on many identities without getting any smaller.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

In 2020, the total federal budget ran much higher, at $7 trillion, because of all of the steps the government took to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBecause few of us have any idea what a trillion really is, here’s one example: 1 trillion seconds is about 31,000 years. The extinction of Ice Age animals like the wooly mammoth and saber-toothed tiger was only about 13,000 years ago, or less than half a trillion seconds.\nSo where does all that money go?\nThe U.S. Treasury divides all federal spending into three groups: mandatory spending, discretionary spending and interest on debt. Together, mandatory and discretionary spending account for more than ninety percent of all federal spending, and pay for all of the government services and programs on which we rely. Interest payments on the national debt account for a much smaller amount than the other two categories. The pie chart shows federal spending in 2020 broken into these three categories.\nDiscretionary spending refers to the portion of the budget that is decided by Congress each year through the appropriations process.\nIn 2020, Congress budgeted $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending.\nBy far, the biggest category of discretionary spending is spending on the Pentagon and military. In most years, this accounts for more than half of the discretionary budget. In 2020, because some discretionary spending passed through supplemental appropriations went to pandemic programs, the share of the discretionary budget that went to the military was smaller – even though the amount that went to the military was just as high as in previous years.\nOther examples of discretionary spending include the early childhood education program Head Start (included in Housing & Community), public housing and homeless programs (Housing & Community), federal aid for public K-12 education (Education), Pell grants for low-income college students (Education), food assistance for Women, Infants and Children (or WIC, in Food and Agriculture), job training and placement for unemployed people (in Social Security, Unemployment and Labor), and scientific research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF), among many others.\nMandatory spending is also legislated by Congress, often for multiple years at a time. It is dominated by the Social Security and Medicare programs, which provide income security and health insurance for retirees and some Americans with disabilities, and sometimes their families.\nIt also includes Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income adults and children, and widely used safety net programs like food stamps (SNAP), welfare (TANF), and highway construction and maintenance, and other things.\nWhen Congress decides to create a program like Social Security, rather than setting aside a certain amount of money, it sets rules for who can receive benefits from the program, and what those benefits will be. People who are eligible can get help, and the government covers the costs. Medicare and other programs work similarly.\nOne advantage of this kind of spending compared to discretionary spending (which is limited by the amounts Congress sets) is that it can more readily respond to unexpected circumstances like a recession, or a pandemic. During the COVID-19 crisis, for example, anyone who qualified for stimulus checks could get them. Unlike discretionary programs, the money didn’t run out and shut some people out.\nMandatory spending makes up roughly two-thirds of the total federal budget in most years, and more in some years.\nIn 2020, most pandemic relief fell under mandatory spending programs. This led to mandatory spending of $5.2 trillion, much higher than in previous years. The ability to quickly ramp up spending enabled the government to help people who lost jobs, those who got sick, and many others.\nThis chart shows where $5.2 trillion in mandatory spending went in 2020.\nFinally, putting together discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and interest on the debt, you can see how the total federal budget is divided into different categories of spending. This pie chart shows the breakdown of $7 trillion in combined discretionary, mandatory, and interest spending budgeted by Congress in fiscal year 2020. This year looks different from previous years, thanks to spending on the COVID-19 response.\nWhen the federal government spends money on mandatory and discretionary programs, the U.S. Treasury writes a check to pay the program costs. But there is another type of federal spending that operates a little differently. Lawmakers have written hundreds of tax breaks into the federal tax code - for instance, special low tax rates on capital gains (certain kinds of investments), a deduction for home mortgage interest, and many others.\nIn fact, tax breaks function as a type of government spending, and they are officially called \"tax expenditures\" by the Treasury Department. Tax breaks cost the federal government more than $1.3 trillion in 2020 – nearly as much as all discretionary spending in the same year.\nUnlike discretionary spending, which must be approved by lawmakers each year during the appropriations process, tax breaks do not require annual approval. That means that once they are written into the tax code, they remain on the books until lawmakers change them.\nOn average, these tax breaks tend to benefit corporations and the wealthy more than the average person. There are many proposals out there for more fair taxation for the wealthy and corporations.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

Mar. 10, 2000\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Residency Requirements for Public Sector Workers\nOccasionally, we hear debates concerning residency requirements for public sector workers. Many argue public employees should reside within the community to be effective. There are potential pros and cons to residency requirements which must be considered in these debates.\nThe Pros of Residency Requirements\nThere are three fundamental arguments favoring residency requirements. There is the belief employees will be more loyal, committed and effective in their performance if they are fully invested within the community by living there. There is the argument communities make better use of their tax dollars by requiring employee residency within the community. The presumption is tax monies will be redirected back into the community by employees residing there spending their salaries within the community. Lastly, there is a desire to reduce unemployment within the community, which might be addressed by either limiting applications for employment to current residents of the community or to those promising to move into the community within a specified time after being hired. These arguments tend to be untested and aspirational rather than being founded upon data, but they are often persuasive to decision makers and factions within the community.\nThe Cons of Residency Requirements\nProfessionalism: One argument against residency requirements is based on the professionalism of public sector employees. Research and experience have shown those with a dedication to their profession are committed to performing at high levels. Professional pride prevents any other outcome, though performance quantity and quality might easily be affected by factors such as poor management, ineffective leadership, resource limitations or generally poor working conditions.\nLimitations on the Hiring Pool: To achieve excellence, public sector agencies seek to employ the most talented workforce available. Limiting applications to those already residing in the community, or to those promising residency within a set time, limits the potential hiring pool. While this might not be an issue in a major city or populated, urbanized county, it might be a serious concern in suburban and rural areas. It would be imprudent to insist upon residency if needed talent would be available save for this specific requirement. It is prudent to insist potential employees will relocate or live within a reasonable commuting distance to ensure they can and will be at work on time, but this does not necessarily require they reside in a specified location.\nEmployee Retention: Those entering public service do so for myriad reasons. Over time their personal needs, expectations and motivations evolve. This suggests that even if an employee finds one community to be their “perfect” choice at one stage in their journey of life, this might not always be the case. Over time, they may wish to relocate, still close enough to easily commute, but not necessarily within the community which employs them. Residency requirements might contribute to employee demotivation, affecting work performance, or a situation where talent leaves the agency to find a similar job with similar benefits, but fewer restrictions on their personal lives.\nCommunity versus Jurisdiction: Another weakness of the residency requirement presumes the community ends at jurisdictional lines. It presumes no interaction, with each jurisdiction being a closed system. The reality is formal jurisdictional lines on a map do not mirror community lines. Community is more complex. The landscape between the District and Columbia and Baltimore includes 5 counties and over 200 cities, towns and census-designated communities. The Los Angeles region is comprised of 5 counties and over 1,600 local governments. The lives of individuals do not end on political lines. Their lives are a complex fabric of social, personal and economic activities interwoven with the lives of others in their region. In a very real sense, what is better for one community is likely to be better for all communities. Restricting employment to only those within a specific political jurisdiction might be a short-sighted decision.\nLegal Challenges: Mandating residency requirements for current employees will be challenged in the courts. Attempting to mandate relocation for current employees will likely lead to federal court challenges on the constitutional rights of due process (14th amendment) and possibly the rights of association (1st amendment). Current employees will raise personal concerns related to the impact on themselves and their families being forced to relocate. Because of this, many communities enacting a residency requirement exempt current employees, but make future residency a pre-condition of employment. As this would be an agreement freely entered into by the employee candidate, it would be enforceable. However, this creates two distinct classes of employees, which might contribute to tensions within the agency between those with differing levels of personal freedom outside the workplace.\nConclusions\nIn the end, there is no clear right or wrong. Each community must have such a debate on their own. Communities may succeed with or without a residency requirement, but they might also fail. There are many factors at play. Public administrators engaged in such a debate must find a workable solution for their community, but they must consider the pros and cons of each approach.\nAuthor: Thomas E.

These papers examine more than two decades of data on the employment outcomes of recent college graduates across the United States, and contain more details and historical perspective.\nThis web feature makes some of the data featured in these papers available on a timely and updated basis. New unemployment and underemployment data for recent college graduates post on a quarterly basis (typically in February, May, August, and November), and wages and outcome data for college graduates are released on an annual basis (typically in February). Data extend from 1990 to the present. Periodic analyses of these data are published on the Liberty Street Economics blog.\nThe definition of underemployment is based on the kinds of jobs held by college graduates. A college graduate working in a job that typically does not require a college degree is considered underemployed. This analysis uses survey data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network (O*NET) Education and Training Questionnaire to help determine whether a bachelor’s degree is required to perform a job. The articles cited above describe the approach in detail.\nSome additional research that utilizes these data include “Working as a Barista After College Is Not as Common as You Might Think” (Liberty Street Economics).\nThe underemployment figures are calculated as a percentage holding a bachelor’s degree or higher, so they do include those with graduate and professional degrees. See the notes below the x-axis on the Underemployment chart for more detail.\nThe “Share with Graduate Degree” column in the table represents, for each college major, the percentage of workers with a bachelor’s degree that also possesses a graduate degree of any kind. For example, 50.2 percent of those with a bachelor’s degree in history also possess some kind of graduate degree, based on February 2022 data.\nAll data presented here are national measures.\nNo. Data span from 1990 to the present.\nNo, the “outcomes by major” data encompass only the most recent year period available to utilize from the American Community Survey, which serves as the source for this analysis.\nThere is no data by gender available in this web feature, but “Underemployment in the Early Careers of College Graduates following the Great Recession” includes some gender analysis.\nUnfortunately, at this time, this analysis only pertains to those with at least a bachelor’s degree.\nNo. Through 2023:Q2, this analysis examined the types of jobs held by those who are underemployed, categorizing jobs broadly by skill level and pay to generate time series data for the percentages of graduates holding “good non-college jobs” and “low-wage jobs.” Starting with the 2023:Q3 update, the web feature will no longer include the data series for \"underemployed job types,\" although historical data remain available for download.\nEarly career graduates are those aged 22 to 27, and mid-career graduates are those aged 35 to 45.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

The VA needs to adopt Zoom or Microsoft “Teams” so we can talk with a REAL PERSON without incurring high expenses. You also need to direct your people to provide a NAME and their TITLE.

They are in charge of approving our benefits.\nIt’s sad that there are so many misinformed or ignorant postings on this site against President Trump. The government is going to run out of money and no one is going to get any benefits if the US goes bankrupt and the currency is devalued and we lose the dollar as a reserve currency. Most government offices, need to be reformed, but accurately reformed.. the number of NGO’s ripping off the taxpayer is phenomenal.\nEat shit, moron. Trump supporters are traitors and fascists.\nI don’t trust them yet.\nDon’t trust trump loyalists ever.\nThis person was on a network espousing how they cut only those who need cutting. Acknowledging he states lawyer first in his bio, where does he get his healthcare? Have gotten nothing but excellent service at the VA as did my father. Thank you Veterans.\nMore talk—–Wants you to think ,he talks the talk, to make things happen—-I can not see the end of my claim and it’s on it’s 13th month —-no communication anywhere in this Circus, travel on your time and gas and then wait for ages to even get reimbursed ——this is a like real life scene from FBI last Monday——-that was the truth.- check the reruns on Paramont that is what 100’s of our Vets are going thru.\ngreat now find those files and pay them been ready since 2023 oct was to pay may 2024 o ou are the only one per admirals etc who is at that pay level to okd and pass to payables then after 286 pd they are the oldest wating then take pf the next bunch it is not hard sit down and get this done about 3 hrs of your time also cant communicate stil waiting for pass code so where is that email. next is there no funds to take care this tell the yrue factsor jd is over this dept need help i will drive there and read each file you neglecting for some reason retirement is noexcuse so sPitit out i am older than you. so man show some guts if this postion is beyond your norm then step aside\n.DO YOU HAVE REQUIRED MANAGEMENT AND GET THESE THINGS DONE SKILLS. PROVE YOURSELF\nI’m wondering what happened to Mike Nachinek over the department of Veterans affairs? I couldn’t even get a case number through my father’s illness John Paul Brewer retired US Navy. My cases are at oscn.net Mayes county in appeal . I sent complaints today online to HHS and I would like prosecution due to a letter from Donald J Trump President to stop false hospice.\nVery unliley that anything gets better, when so many people (incluyding a ton of VETS) are getting fired. Sounds like more fo that “Just Believe me” stuff. Would love an IG that is a retired VET put in place and the VA leadership actually woirks with him to cut waste but employ imprvement prgrams WITH Measurable metrics.\nOne of the problems I have experienced is when I ask for a referral for community care outside of the VA. Sometimes it takes several months. Case in point, it took me from September last until March 11 this year 2025. I found out it was sent to VA several times. It was found to be on head dentist in Tuskegee since Jan 18 of this year. Had to get another’s Doctor to override last week. This happens quite often with my primary doctor at the Podeshef Clinic in Columbus Ga.\nThank you\nBilly Cumbie\nDear Honorable secretary of Veterans affairs. Please contact the President to force prosecution around a Sept 17 2019 VA case filed in the Mayes county courts with inspector general HHS complaints made today. I will have to go back and submit Medicare and Medicaid information. Please study cases at http://www.oscn.net for international false profiling around healthcare that led to inveigling,elder abuse,medical restraints through false hospice under Sheriff Mike Reed Pryor Ok\nYou will not get a meaningful response from these incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans.\nThese community care are kids fresh out of college. Community Care really SUCKS!!!!!!!\nDo,you really expect Vets to believe this pack of lies? Trump just cut 37,000 VA jibs!!!!\nWell, you’ll be happy to know that a federal judge just ruled that no employees at the VA will be terminated. Those who have must be reinstated immediately. VA secretary Collins has lost all credibility with the veterans and really should step down.\nOn behalf of veterans everywhere, go fuck yourself.\nThe harm against Veterans has been going on since 1979, not just ten years!!! Will a female disabled Veteran be harmed, treated badly, and attempted lethal harm if she goes to the VA now? West Virginia VA treated me very well and cared about my health. But in other VA hospitals, there was way too much violent, destructive, intentional harm!!! Acting above the law like we don’t matter only certain ones. Never corrected, or those attacking Veterans never held accountable!!! Can we female Veterans, whistleblower Veterans, and Veterans that people don’t like to get to go to the VA without being harmed in any way? I hope so without people toying with our lives!!! Than you for being there for us!!!\nDear Sec Collins, Here is an email I sent out earlier today CONGRATULATING one of your employees but offering CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS/SUGGESTIONS to improve the services being provided by the VA FMP office to those of us who live/work outside the USA.\nDear Ms. Grace, (and Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311)),\nMore great news!!! I received notification yesterday that the VA had been SUCCESSFUL in transferring my first payment from the VA ELECTRONICALLY. So, thank you once again, Ms. Grace, for making this happen so promptly!!! I hope that Sec Collins’ office has commended you on your outstanding CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\nHOWEVER, consistent with the promises that Sec Collins made on 5 Feb 2025: https://news.va.gov/press-room/secretary-collins-message-to-veterans-and-va-employees/ still leaves me with more questions.\nWe’re going to deliver timely access to care and benefits for every eligible Veteran, family member, caregiver and survivor.\nWe’re going to put Veterans at the center of everything VA does, focusing relentlessly on customer service and convenience.\nWe’re going to challenge the status quo in order to find new and better ways of helping VA beneficiaries.\nWe’re going to celebrate the vast majority of VA employees who do a great job every day and hold employees accountable when they fall short of the mission.\nWe’re going to provide Veterans with the health care choices they have earned while maintaining and improving VA’s direct health care capabilities.\nIn the context of these promises, and given I am still holding Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) accountable for all these SNAFUS, given the original amount the VA transferred was $8,278.18 but the actual money credited to our account was only $8,139.08, I want to know WHY was I PENALIZED $139.10 (1.68%) when you were told originally that my preference was to use a dollar-dominated account? Does this meet the letter or intent of what Sec Collins has promised us? Is this what any Vet deserves for his/her service?\nimage.png\nSo here are the questions I am raising with the expectations that the yet-to-be-identified Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311), will not only provide ANSWERS but will be PROACTIVE in making or facilitating the appropriate changes to bring the EXISTING policy and procedures in line to REFLECT the LETTER and INTENT of the COMMITMENTS Sec. Collins promised.\nQUESTIONS NEEDING ANSWERS AND CORRECTIVE/REMEDIAL ACTIONS from Mr/Ms. No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) to meet the letter and intent of Sec. Collins promises:\n1) I originally provided a local USD dollar account with my local bank, but the VA informed me that they cannot/will not transfer to the dollar account, only to an Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) dominated account. Why should I, having provided my services to our country and now as a CUSTOMER of the VA, be expected to incur the risk of exchange rate fluctuations? Why have I been penalized $139.10 because the VA cannot/did not follow my original instructions?\n2) Why isn’t the VA ITEMIZING the payments? The VA paid $8,278.18, but how much of that was against the DISABILITY ($471.23 X 13 months = $5,482.49), and how much of that was REIMBURSEMENT of VA APPROVED payments for out-of-pocket medical expenses? ($29,775.06 through 23 Jan 2025) Without a detailed itemization showing what the VA FMP has paid and what you have not yet paid, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for either you or us to manage the cash flows.\nAs noted, this email with attachments is being submitted on Sec Collin’s message page. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/#comment-827171\nThank you again!!\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDr. Paul D. Giammalvo, CDT, CCE, MScPM, MRICS\nSenior Technical Advisor, PT Mitrata Citragraha\nYou will not get a response from those incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans. Don’t believe their lies.\nYou are a liar.\nQuit lying and eat shit, trumpie.\nFuck you and fuck doge and fuck trump you fuckers. You have alienated queer veterans and you are fucking liars. Rot in hell where you belong. I hope this administration crashes and burns and takes all you supporters with it. Fucking traitors all of you. Piss off.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted? That just proves that the basic intent of the current VA administration is to manage what we hear and say in this forum because the administration is about to screw us out of our disability and benefits, While they swear they aren’t going to eliminate them. 80,000 firings will surely devastate veterans care and services.\nNo mention of a national day of rallies IN SUPPORT OF VETERANS… in state capitols.\nMarch 15, noon, GO to your state capitol please.\nOk chief I’m a 60% DV served in the Air Force so you say there is no cuts at the VA. So all the Veterans that they laid off is made up that’s why no one believes in the government anymore its just hurry up and wait BS. if you served you know what that means. How can anyone work for a person that has dodged service and made fun of veterans all the time. This fool lost my respect when he talked shit about Sen. John McClain and now he has a Nazi doing something about waste ok, where is the money that he has saved its are money tax payer money not the governments. God save the USA from these idiots.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted? That just proves that the basic intent of the VA is to manage what we hear and say in this forum because the administration is about to screw us out of our disability and benefits, While they swear they aren’t going to eliminate them.\nWhoever came up with your new log in system to my health vet, should be fired. It took me over an hour just to figure out how to sign in. Do you think a guy at my age could do this? Having to take numerous pictures of my driver’s license is just over the top. I had to take several pictures to get an approval. I am really upset with this nonsense. I am not a computer expert. What do you mean having to put in a website? Most people do not know their website.\nThat is what I would like to know. I haven’t been able to log in since December becuase of it.\nOk so it isn’t just me having this issue. Since late mid December I haven’t been able to log in. No matter what site I am sent to in order to correct the issue it fails.\nThank you for that information, my husband is 100% Vietnam vet,he also have PTSD,and agent orange disability.Glad to know he will be taking care of.We both are disable.I used to work for VA Hospital in the 1990’s and they were not good at all,a lot of messy people who was really mean, even before Trump was president,I had a hard time getting help from VA, and the hospital was awful, we had a hard time getting him approved for disibility.Still have a problem getting appointments and things he need,I hope things get better with Present Trump.\nI am so pleased that the Agent Orange claims. Will not end.\nI was exposed in the 1960s and now suffer from CLL leukemia.\nMy claim was opened in September of 2024. And I am in the process of submitting evidence of exposure.\nEdward N Peters\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet. I have removed it from your comment.]\nHe lied in Congress and he is still doing it. He is just another lying puppet MAGA MAGGOT!\nHe is a veteran\nDoesn’t matter; still a fascist traitor.\nBeing a veteran doesn’t automatically make you a good person. I’ve known many great people during my time in the service but also plenty of not so great people. I bet this new puppet is just as greedy and gluttonous as his master regardless of years of service. Stock up and get ready vets, I don’t see this ending without bloodshed on US soil.\nMy husband, Wayne A Pfuhl, was a US Army veteran and a retired police officer. His ashes were interred at the Ft Snelling National Cemetery in Minnesota on December 23, 2024. I placed a request for the Presidential Memorial Certificate for my husband to be signed by Donald J Trump. Can you advise if or when this request will be honored?\nGlad to hear this. but not convincing enough about Dodge. Dodge is BREAKING every law in its path, and he had not one word to say about that. He must be another Trump suck up.\nIf you are associated with Trump Administration, I don’t believe you.\nThat’s why you’ll always be a sheep.\nI hear Putin unzippig his fly. Line up to service him like a good tRumper. ?\nLick that boot, bow-n-scrap like a good tRumptard.\nSheep are the ones who don’t blindly follow something?\nAll this is confusing. I was trying to check my husband’s appointments on My Healthevet and got into this website. So many changes – they just changed the login procedures and now not sure what is happening. My husband uses Community Care for many appointments as getting appointments at the VA clinic was impossible or took months. Hopefully, the new Fredericksburg clinic will change that. It is very nice, but empty. As the speciality clinics are moved in I’m sure it will fill up. Most of the staff members are pleasant and do a good job. Mostly, the procedures for getting care could use some changes.\nWoundering why the VA clinic In Athens ohio will not put our president’s picture up .They had know problem putting Biden picture on the wall !!!\nI can’t stand looking at Trump, he is a criminal grifter.\nMR. Collins keep up the great work. I for one have had nothing but good experiences with the VA. There is a lot of hateful comments in this thread must be the Air Force. Keep up the good work, people need to relax and trust the process.\nwell, don’t expect those good experiences to continue as these cuts will result in fewer personnel to help with paperwork, doctors to find and treat illnesses, and facility maintenance personel.\nNext they will be requiring all disabled vets to be “re-assessed” under requirements that will push them out of care and into the streets. Trump doesn’t like losers that get captured or injured.\nfellas… fellas Much emotion discharged in all this commentary. BUT I FEEL YOU ALL! This battle for benefits is real for many a soldier who deserves what’s his… But for all the others who never proved themselves during their time of service, then shame on you for taking what’s not yours!\nAs for our new secretary, Doug Collins (and regardless of political orientation), we deserve to give this man the benefit of doubt but keep him in the “cross hairs” by measuring every word he says…. Verifying every promise he makes… Monitoring his deeds! And if he fails, let’s expose him then…. BUT if he performs and “does what he says he is going to do when he says he is going to do it”..then he deserves our praise and support.\nThat’s right fellas, lets grant this man the opportunity to prove himself battle ready.\nTime will ALWAYS either prove you or expose you!\nWhat the hell are you talking about. Does everyone who served have to receive a Purple Heart. I am USN and went to Nam and was washed over the side of my ship off the coast at 2 in the AM. We were pulling plane guard for the Midway. I served 3 tours, so bite ne. KMAMF.\nWhy would anyone trust him when he’s straight up lying to us?\nI am outraged that, as the purported leader of the VA, you are not doing everything you possibly can to disrupt and thwart this clear authoritarian plan to cut federal jobs, VA healthcare, and every other society-improving program that actually does good in this country. You should be ashamed of yourself, but it appears no one up there in the exec branch even has the ability to feel shame. So I am ashamed for you, and all those like you, who talk out of both sides of your mouth when trying to justify your actions. It’s reprehensible, and if you are not willing to lie down in front of the DOGE bulldozer for your constituency then you should just resign for principle and let someone more qualified and dedicated take the reins. Get out while you still have some semblance of a soul. Not that you ever did, by the looks of it.\ntrump hired him. Of course he’s a loyalist.\nI am completely shocked at the betrayal of this administration to its veterans. From mass firings across the federal government not based off performance of duties which affect numerous veterans to now cutting all their benefits and forcing the veterans around our nation who paid in blood t o have the bean counters turn their back on our veterans and have them suffer medically and possibly face homelessness is very disturbing and shameful. These actions will come full circle when all the veterans get a chance to vote this next go round and based off the above this administration is going to have to own this when the chips fall on them. So disgusting and shameful. May god have no mercy for these actions. I pray that we have no veterans die due to these actions.\nMr. Collins needs to crawl back into the hole he crawled out of. This is a privatization scheme. This is capitalism run amok. This is corruption in broad daylight. Someone’s going to have fat contracts and it won’t help the veteran. Traitors, all of you.\nDoug you are blue falcon , and a coward!! I bet you are receiving full benefits, while veterans are getting their taken away. Everyone sees through your lying Ass!\nWhy did you make a video to lie.? The cuts are posted on the Congressional Budget site. What is your problem? Can you read? I’m not sure you can because i am not sure you are qualified to hold the position.\nAs a service connected veteran I will be looking for a more streamlined VA system with better care. Staff that actually care about us the veterans.\nVa Secretary. Please stop acting incompetent. You have not been in office long enough to know what is or not good for the VA. Certainly letting Thousands go to any other means than Retirement is not being responsible or competent. Veterans signed a contract: Service Time and in return, life time treatment by VA. Not even you can or should try to do anything to derail such.\nYou took an oath of office. That Oath was not to a Man, King, Queen, Lunatic, or wannabe Dictator. The VA cannot afford to let anyone go without cause. Stop listening to Trump or anyone else.\nLiar.\nReduced service levels are just the first steps towards privatizing the VA.\nYou create a problem by cutting funding and service levels, and then say the solution is to privatize the system so the rich can get richer.\nComplete BS from this guy, he accepted slashing jobs in the VA. Then when people actually working at the VA say hey this is hurting us and hurting vets he goes on air and denies that lost jobs are causing issues. A total scumbag who will throw us all under the bus and rip away our benefits just to benefit himself and his masters.\nDoug Collins is the definition of a Bravo Foxtrot.\nRespectfully – This sounds like you’ve never called the public phone number for the VA. How is cutting your workforce going to make a vital and already understaffed department better able to help our Vets&their families? A huge percentage of VA workers are vets themselves, including disabled vets. Isn’t one of the goals to get Americans working? In past administrations when specific Fed jobs were deemed redundant the workers were retrained and given the opportunity for more efficient, needed jobs at equal if not higher pay. How is kicking these hard working Americans into the unemployment line pro-America? It seems like the ‘cuts ledger’ has only 1 side; these people (who’ve never served in the military, some of these kids are barely old enough to enlist) who are taking a slegehammer to the workforce seem to be (purposely?) neglectful of the future losses these cuts will cause. It can already take months for vets to be seen for therapy, medical care, job training etc. The faster our vets can get the benefits they need, to stay healthy and back to joining their families and communities, the better off for all of us. There are reports the VA Suicide Hotline is going to stop training because .. heaven forbid.. there are mentions of ‘LGBTQ’ in the training materials. While individuals are free to fear whoever they want the fact is LGBTQ people exist, there have always been LGBTQ Americans who have served our country. Shame on anyone trying to blame them for these ridiculous cuts -Turning your back not only on them, but on every other service member who is at the point of considering suicide is unconscionable. Please show what the US Military is supposed to stand for: protect our fellow Americans. Countries are not ‘businesses’ working to make profits for a handful of shareholders. The measure of ‘greatness’ isn’t a high profit margin. Stop selling out our veterans for a handful of businessmen who’ve never served and see those who did as ‘suckers’.\nI live in a rural area. We do not have local VA health care. This requires us to travel sometimes hours to get health care. I’m the last month travel pay has been turned over to a new agency that will not allow any contact from veterans and is denying my claims that have been verified valid requiring us to overload the appeal system to wait years to have valid claims paid while we suffer to obtain care so that someone in Washington can claim they are reducing fraud. There is no fraud here, when you can assign a contact number for vets to call in and review travel claim I will believe that you are not cutting. I have had 3 claims denied in the last month and need care. If you care, contact me… Then I will believe you aren’t blowing smoke.\nSure my stepdad been dead 3 yrs and still no grave marker.\nThen why Mr Secretary is the Legion having to push the Major Richard Star Act. Currently, combat-injured veterans face a reduction in their retirement pay for every dollar of disability compensation they receive. You lie. What’s next? Thank you for being another puppet in the Trump Musk Romper Room show. Resign sir.\nI find your videos to be absolutely arrogant and condescending. You do cheerleading for a POTUS who a 34x felon who DOES NOT respect vets. You say none of these haphazard cuts will affect healthcare but that is absolutely NOT TRUE and you know it. Stop lying! You KNOW the Veterans “Veterans Access Act” paves the way for pushing most and eventually ALL VA provided healthcare out into the Community so… Stop Lying (or hey, if you were unaware, see the assessment of this bill on Military.Com). You must be aware that there’s a GOP proposal to REDUCE VA disability payments by 30% once a disabled vet reaches 65.. right? Where are ya with that Mr. Doug? You’re also aware of the GOP proposal to reduce the healthcare services to those under 30% right Doug? Where are you with that? VA’s routinely SCORE HIGHER during Joint Commission audits than their civilian counterparts…. WHY Doug, would you want to dismantle a system proven to be better than outside hospitals? VA should be “the model” as their focus is on providing top-notch heath care rather than maximizing profit.\nAll those recent illegal firings now have the backing of a Federal Judge and have been ordered to be restored. Where were you for these employees? You just went along and broke the law… Then started spinning it. WHY? What is your motivation Doug? OPM’s now blaming the Agencies saying they never “ordered” you to do it… The OMB genius guy VOUGHT wants everyone traumatized. YOUR WORKFORCE is traumatized Doug… How do you expect a traumatized work-force to deliver top-notch care? How do you expect to attract and keep the best when YOU are literally terrorizing your staff and their families? Employees wont trust management for the next decade or longer and just how many of them are Vets that are being affected? You have to do better. If you cannot stand up to POTUS and his illegal actions, you aren’t fit to represent Veterans in OUR Affairs. If you are unable to tell the truth or do your job, please do the right thing and just resign. Right now you are absolutely tarnishing any legacy you might have had… The question is why? You ain’t no good ole boy, so stop with the bs ‘eh?\nWhere I am, my VA Doctor is the best doctor I’ve had. She is attentive, takes time to listen, and is very compassionate. She is leaving the VA because she is overwhelmed with the workload. The VA counselor I’ve been seeing for my PTSD is getting ready to leave because he is overbooked and sometimes double booked. I’m lucky if I get to meet with him once a month, (at my VA disability hearing I was instructed to see a therapist at least twice a month). There aren’t enough personnel to meet what is required. The pay is low, they get treated like robots, so they are leaving for the private sector. I have no idea how I’ll manage without my doctor and therapist. Getting hung out to dry after my service.\nI am not having fun or enjoying life as much today as the Veterans Association says their accounting records show I was overpaid by them a couple of years ago.\nI am told the Biden Administration and his Veteran System says I overpaid. The employee stated my old pension of $1413.00 a month would be $327.00 from now on. They reply,”there is nothing I can do about it as their accounting shows the proof. They never sent me any accounting or proof.\nThank god. I am 72 and get $1060.00 a month for social security. It was kind of a surprise for this old Vietnam veteran who is now having to live on $1387.00 a month.\nI just remember my old motto,”Things can only get better.” I am grateful though as I have God, family and you, my great friends in my life. I hate to post this but per the internet and on the Veterans sites it is an ongoing problem for over 50,000 veterans who are currently appealing this. Anyway, just wondering, can you help? Get the word out?\nThank you.\nJOHN BLANCHE/DBA ELVIS\nplease stop the cuts – you can’t cut your way to better health care. firing VA employees and reinvesting the savings doesn’t make sense. Government employees provide better service than contractors and in most cases at less cost.\nBlaming the press for news about significant cuts in VA personal is bogus. We veterans are not stupid. The fact that thousands of people are in fact being cut from the VA employee rolls (including veterans) is bound to have a detrimental effect on the delivery of benefits.\nAnd you did not address the question of whether Musk and his team of slash and burn expertise executioners will have, or do already have, access too our personal information. Instead you spoke about their reviewing contracts These actions are extremely worrisome to me and many others like me.\nIn this day and age, when “retribution” seems to be the operative word, I may be sticking my neck out by posting these comments, but as a conscious veteran I feel compelled to speak my piece, which I assume is still permitted in this great country!\nI retired from the Army in May of 1995. I didn’t apply for any disability rating until 17 years after I retired. My experience through out this entire time has been that the VA operates in a 3 word doctrine , Discourage, Delay and Deny. I watched as my neighbor who was a decorated Vietnam veteran of the 1st Cavalry Division kept applying for a disability rating for years due to combat wounds and Agent Orange exposure and after 5 years of trying he was awarded a whopping 0% disability rating. He passed away 2 years ago. I am rated at 70% currently but should be higher . My question for you sir is : Who sits on these revue boards and what qualifications due they have to make these decisions ? From some of claims that have been denied I think they are just unqualified people who can’t see the obviousness of why some claims are submitted. Please look into this ! I would also like to add that wait times for appointments at the Floyd Lindstrom VA clinic in Colorado Springs is way to long as it also is at the Rocky Mountain Regional Medical Center in Aurora Colorado. The excuse they both use is lack of staffing . When I ask for community care because the wait times are so long it takes another long period before you get an authorization. When there is an issue with getting a response from someone for anything and you contact a patient advocate, it takes sometimes 10 days to get a response from the. and just today I received an email from the the VA western Colorado health system that the Patient Advocate office hours are now limited again due to staffing issues. PLEASE FIX THIS !!\nWhy has the Indianapolis Radabush VA Hospital project to build a new Hospital been put on Hold??\nPlease assure us that The PACT Act will remain intact. We fear that laws passed by the previous administration will be targeted for DOGE scrutiny and removal. My husband is a “Bluewater Vet.” His Parkinson’s Disease and dementia are related to his Navy service in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam era, and we are grateful for the financial assistance provided by the PACT Act for his increasing need for care. Respectfully,\nThe out sourcing of disabilty claims is a nightmare for Veterans in many cases. Secretary Collins VA has our records. Many of us have records on file tha VA can provide by contacting a non VA intermediary. They often don’t have the Veterans records and the ask the veteran to to do the leg work in acquiring the records on their own. That can be beyond the capabilities of many us and a valid claim of a veteran may bo by the wayside and may be denied. Thiscan be simplified by VA keeping outside services who are I’ll equipped to provide proper service to the veteran. The want us to travel to their arranged places for tests. Many times they are many miles from our homes. When we have VA facilities in our local communities. I just had serious brain surgery and can not travel to locations for An EEG and another for an EKG and another for an XRAY and another for a psychiatric exam. This is out of control when all of these tests are in the VA records already. The aneurysm claim is linked to my service disability for high blood pressure. I need my claim to be expedited and granted 100% due to unemployability. I can not work with all of the issues that I have. This is not unique many of my fellow veterans are in this maze of VA red tape. I will assure you my local VA Clinic is outstanding but VA disability benefits go to outsourcing for further testing. Not necessary. This needs to get to VA Secretary Collins desk.\nI want the medical services at a VA Health care facility. Stop sending veterans to the private sector unless they specifically ask for that. Reducing staff means you’ll be trying to force veterans out of the VA health care system and into the private sector again. Stop denying it and stop doing it.\nThank you for saying this part. This has been my experience with the VA since 2020 and I hate it. When the VA was forced to use the private sector due to the CARE Act, I ended up being lost, forgotten and ignored by the private sector with the VA being unwilling to intervene. I’ve been without care for 5 years now. It took me years to get in to now have nothing and no faith in the system.\nGlad I left my VA job then too because I would’ve been fired for sure.\nThanks, Trump for fucking me and many other Vets over them and continuing to fuck us now, you Russian traitor. How the hell has any of what Trump has done has been good for us Vets?\nPlease partner with habitat for humanity to provide homes to vets. There are thousands of abandoned houses across the nation that they could refurbish and give to homeless vets\nI truly agree with this. It saddens me to see our boys in the streets… wondering about with a million thoughts in their minds…. No mission….no battle buddies….HOMELESS!\nI will personally work on this! Not via HUD and their red tape protocolos and policies, but via the private sector. I am designing $30,000 handicap-ready compact homes that can be built on a large track of land as cluster homes and be financed via our VA home loan benefits.\nIn essence, these will be Communities for vets only.\nMr. Collins\nAs Secretary of the VA, your job is to fight for Veterans Benefits rather than just accept the loss of 80,000 jobs. If you plan to just accept this loss you should resign.\nChet Hebble\nI will be asking the VFW,DAV , American Legion , Vietnam veterans of America, and all veterans groups to appeal to DOGE not to destroy the improvements that President Trump made in his first term in office. As someone who has personally dealt with downsizing of a organization I can understand the hard choices we need to make by contributing to the National Debt. I will be asking that Veterans Administration do a Four percent reduction in force for the first year 2025, Then five percent in 2026 . The total distruption of the Veterans Administration is not needed or necessary.\nYou are piece of crap Mr Collins. You and your drug addled south African asshole and go jump off a bridge. Its pretty clear that you, POTUS, and all republicans could care less about VETs.\nGO piss up a rope you fascist.\nDon your comments to Mr. Collins are totally uncalled for. I hope you don’t always have this attitude.\nHe has only been in the job three weeks. Your nasty post should of been deleted…………………………….\nGOLD STAR WIFE\nWhile your intentions sound good, why should anyone believe what you are telling us now? Trump and Musk are cutting things daily and the VA was already short. While the contention is that nothing will change for us Veterans, there have been too many lies, changes, etc., coming from the top, on a regular basis. Why should anyone trust you when you take your directions from these same unreliable people? With short staff already in place and open positions, cutting will only contribute to decreased care and less top notch providers.\nYOU ARE A FASCIST TRAITOR. I SEE A CHAPLAIN AND A VET. WHAT? A SINNER AS WELL.IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES.I HOPE TO GOD YOU ARE NOT A FAMILY MAN.YOU ARE A HUMILIATING EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COUNTRY GOOD LUCK GOING OUT IN PUBLIC YOU WILLBE MORE HUMILIATED. God is watching you\nAs the saying goes: You can fool all the people some of the time and You can fool some of the people all of the time but you can’t fool all of the people all the time. Unfortunately you may be fooling enough of the people in the short term. I’m waiting to see improvements to the system not its demise. In the short term you may find yourself to be the bureaucrat hearing “YOU ARE FIRED”, And it may not even be your fault. You may not have been able to find enough fraud and abuse or at least to say that you have. There will be no next comment. I am a registered independent voter. A veteran who has thus far been treated fairly and respectfully by the VA. What is going on now does not have the appearance of fairness. Why call for balancing the budget while at the same time asking for tax cuts? Show some common sense first make progress on the deficit and come back in two years to get paid for any progress made.\nSelf promoting political hackery. Not a word is sincere or believable. The current VA secretary has no intention of honoring commitments made to veterans. I recently had a visit to the ER at a VA medical center, and the nursing staff is freaking out. How does frightening and overworking medical staff improve veteran care?\nIt is sad and embarrassing to see the comments from the free loaders that did nothing to earn the benefits talking crap based on their mistaken political beliefs. Grow up and get a job instead of expecting handouts. They should cut the benefits for all that didn’t serve in combat or do a full 20. No more welfare for the lazy.\nGary, I served 20 years, and in 2 combat locations. I dont expect handouts. I am not a free loader. DID YOU????\nIt pisses me off that this Administration full of draft dodgers and notorious for disrespectful comments about veterans are now in charge, what a mess. YOU SIR NEED TO REEVALUATE YOUR COMMENTS OR MOVE BACK TO RUSSIA, YOU FIT RIGHT INTO THE TRUMP MINDSET> .\nGary, KMA and lick trumps boots.\nCombat does not happen with all of the support people also in boots—Medical corpsman here—was medical staff on the ground back home in hospitals that serve those who come back also important to you. Maybe that view from your high horse needs to adjust. We were ALL important in our jobs so that you could do yours.\nI have the upmost respect for Dog Collins. I listened to his video presentation and it left me with more questions than answers. As a service connected veteran, not 100%, I have been able to access the on base recreational facilities for camping with my family and guest for the last several years. We recently reserved camping sites as before and paid the necessary fees. A week or so later I received a call from veterans services on base that the regulations have changed and the benefits have been restricted to veterans with 100% disability and of course the normal active duty, retired, and reserve. The Service Connected veterans with less than 100% disabilities have lost some of their benefits. I would like clarification please. Thank you.\nHow much money does the VA spend on promo items like pen sets, coin purses drink coolers and MANY OTHER ITEMS FRIG MANEGNETS A TPON OF CRAP?\nHey, Comrade Collinski…I hate it when someone pisses on my leg and tells me it’s raining out. And I hate it more when it’s a Trump ass-kisser doing it. Do everyone a favor and keep your lies to yourself.\nSecretary Collins:\nCutting 82,000 jobs will indeed cut our benefits. This proposed cut is not a media fantasy, it exists in an official memo–and you know that.\nI am a Purple Heart Combat Veteran, and I want you to know that the VA provides excellent health care with its very limited resources. The VA has been running on a reduced budget already, so it cannot absorb a slashing of 82,000 personnel and still provide benefits we now have. Wait times will further degrade. My local facility has already eliminated paid reception and desk jobs and replaced them with unpaid volunteers. There is no slack.\nPlease honor your pledge to ensure our VA will continue to provide good health care. Go to bat for us.\nVa has been trying to get the iu and they are trying take away after 67 will the 200.000 over 67 will get the shaft and loose loss what states provide. Like home tax, free fishing licenses and much more Texas will give no home tax relief for my wife if i die. I am 82 years old and it want long before I will die .\nYou piece of garbage! You, trump, musk and vance are ALL GARBAGE!!!!\nMaybe you should have done something and served in the real military rather than talk crap.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what they seek, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. They, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the working and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with very little experience in the processes involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash the system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better.\nAt first, 1400 probationary VA employees were fired. And, now, you recently announced another 80,000 to be fired. How do you expect the VA to better assist Veterans, especially in areas like getting appointments more rapidly if you are firing the people who answered the phones? You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” And, from everything I have you say, you don’t care about veterans either. You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote. We had a term for “shipmates” like you, Bravo Foxtrot. So far, you have earned it.\nGer Elon Musk OUT OF THE VA. He doesnt care about VETERANS. NO PRIVATIZATION\nOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just noticed your disclaimer that whatever a Veteran post, the post is going to be changed to more moderate wording. To that I say what I post is my 1st amendment right, so hand off the wording…………………..\nDam!!!, I cannot believe you took the time to make another video with NO Factual basis (all lies). I am 80 years old, Disabled Vietnam Veteran, and your good old boy down home speaking is as phony as the word coming out of your mouth. The V.A. clinic where I go for healthcare has a hard time servicing all of the Veteran who need help due to MUSK and Trump cuts. The more you cut employees the Longer and longer it is going to be to schedule an appointment for care. Not enough Doctors, nurses or medical folks with the right expertise to care for Veteran’s needs. I believe MUSK and TRUMP would rather have all of the Veteran who served this Great Country Die off rather than help them with their healthcare. I guess you don’t remember what NON-MILITARY (draft dodger) said about the Navy Hero Senator McCain. Trump doesn’t RESPECT him because he got CAPITURED, Tortured, something he or Musk will never experience…………..\nI just want to know, why is it that the first thing every party, democrats and republicans always wants to cut veterans benefits and social security??? I would think the kickbacks being taken away from the politicians would pretty much take care of the deficit, wouldn’t you agree??\nPlease secure jobs for the healthcare providers at the VA. These GREAT folks are overwhelmed with veterans requiring their services. It would benefit our veterans if you could increase the number of healthcare workers and decrease the number of bureaucrats (most of whom are quite useless). In fact the folks at the Wisconisin Evidence Intake Center have NO idea what they are doing when it comes to Vietnam Navy Veterans. These people cannot even determine longitude and latitude on a map when determining where a ship was stationed according to the ship’s deck logs. This puts our Navy Vets at a disadvantage when applying for benefits. Please Mr. Secretary sort out this bureaucratic MESS!!! Thank You\nYou overwhelmingly voted for a reduction in EVERYTHING, so stop whining. Trump was correct when he said veterans are a bunch of suckers.\nCollins, you are lying. Stop lying to veterans!! We have been betrayed. Lincoln made promises when he created the Veterans administration to care for those that shouldered the burden of this country’s wars. Trump, DOGE and Elon Musk are bragging about cuts. Trump has never respected us. He calls us suckers. He says he has no respect for POW’s because they are losers for getting captured. He doesn’t want the most injured of us all to be brought out at public events. We remember. I will never forget this country’s betrayal. I used to take great pride in serving my country. No longer.\nI have been dealing with the VA sense I retired in 1998. The past month VA help has been better than the past 20 years. I got a referral that I needed for back issues I have had for worn out hip joints from running 5 miles a day while in the military.\nI see many posts on this site condemning the new administration. Most are unhinged. With nothing more than Ad Hominem attacks on a man they never met. Whom they hate, with a hate a demon would be proud of. Not even willing to hear the truth, but are influenced by a political party that would leave them to die on the battle field just like in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, or Abby Gate in 2021.\nThank you Mr Collins for taking control of a broken health care system for us veterans that in the past would allow us to die in pain rather than give us the treatments we earned for our service. May God be your guide and give you his wisdom and strength to write the ship that was left to list in the mothball grave yard.\nVeteran care is being impacted already.\nAlong with many of the previous comments I don’t believe anything you say. You are allowing a draft dodger who knows nothing about military service and is known to badger and insult military people make decisions on something as important as our veterans, he is getting rid of the pact act for revenge my husband gave up so much and is now a 100% disabled. I can not express how disgusted I am with this administration\nDOGE wants to fire as many as 80,000 VA workers. How does this not impact Veterans who receive care at facilities around the country that are being threatened with closure and the loss of workers? Providing easy to access care to our Veterans is part of their benefits we the people (via our government including our Presidents) promised to them, is it not?\nAll we ask for is the earned return for our signature that’s it nothing more nothing less.\nHe’s a liar. It’s been a right wing project for decades to defund VA until it barely functions. Then they complain about how it’s too big a bureaucracy and it’s failing vets. This is all in an effort to give the medical contacts to their wealthy friends. The VA is the only public healthcare in this country, and it is much beloved, so they have to destroy it. Hands off VA!\nYOU’RE JUST SPOUTING THE PARTY LINE! TIME WILL TELL THE REAL TRUTH.\nMr. Secretary,\nThe biggest issue I see with the current mandate to cut jobs is that it focuses solely on reducing headcount rather than improving efficiency or service quality. If the goal were truly to streamline operations, the mandate should focus on identifying inefficiencies within the department—many of which appear to be intentional. The VA routinely slows the processing of claims and services, seemingly as a cost-saving measure. By creating delays, veterans are forced to wait for care, which in turn reduces the VA’s immediate financial obligations.\nA personal example: My therapist switched practices, and I requested that my authorization be transferred to the new location. Despite providing all necessary information immediately, Community Care first authorized the original practice instead. When I pointed out the mistake, they canceled my authorization entirely. Then, only after I followed up multiple times, I was told there was a two-month backlog for new authorizations. A simple administrative change took four months to resolve, during which my mental health deteriorated. I can only imagine what happens to veterans with more severe conditions who lack the ability to advocate for themselves.\nTo make matters worse, I was informed that this authorization was intended to close my need for therapy. That decision should not be made by bureaucrats—it should be between me and my therapist. Given the lasting impact of my military service, I will likely need mental health support for the rest of my life.\nIf the VA is serious about reducing waste, it should start by identifying policies and procedures that seem intentionally designed to create bureaucratic delays in services. These inefficiencies do not just inconvenience veterans—they actively harm those in need of care. Additionally, the VA should conduct audits to identify deceased veterans whose benefits are still being paid, preventing unnecessary financial loss without restricting care for the living.\nThe current approach to cost-cutting prioritizes hitting a number over people. It’s time to focus on real reform.\nAdditionally, another approach to improving efficiency and accountability in military and veteran affairs would be to consolidate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget into the Department of Defense (DoD) budget. Instead of the VA receiving a separate allocation, a designated percentage of the DoD’s total budget could be earmarked for veteran care.\nCurrently, VA funding is a little over 41% of the DoD’s budget. Setting a benchmark of 40% as a starting point would save approximately $5 billion, while still maintaining strong veteran support. This shift would place greater responsibility on the DoD to prioritize the long-term health and well-being of service members, ensuring that decisions made during active duty do not create unnecessary burdens on the VA system later.\nAdditionally, this reform would introduce accountability mechanisms within the DoD. Right now, the DoD operates with virtually no financial checks and balances, as any effort to reduce or restructure its budget is often framed as being anti-military. By tying VA funding directly to the DoD’s budget, poor decision-making or inefficiencies within the military would have real financial consequences, forcing leadership to be more strategic about both spending and personnel policies.\nOf course, there would also need to be a separate accountability mechanism for the VA to ensure that the reallocation of funds results in better, not worse, services for veterans.\nI previously submitted similar ideas to the White House for consideration by the Department of Governmental Operations and Efficiency (DOGE), along with an offer to volunteer my expertise as a BA and MBA-educated veteran honor student. Unfortunately, I received no response. You have my name Mr. Secretary, I’m the only one I know of, feel free to have someone contact me.\nWould be even better if you didn’t reduce the benefits for a 100% disabled veteran because YOU made a mistake and paid me $1600 too much educational benefits when we’re sending money to every country, known and unknown, to pay for:\n* $1.5 million to “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities”\n* $70,000 for production of a “DEI musical” in Ireland\n* $2.5 million for electric vehicles for Vietnam\n* $47,000 for a “transgender opera” in Colombia\n* $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru\n* $2 million for sex changes and “LGBT activism” in Guatemala\n* $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt\n* Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations — even AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation\n* Millions to EcoHealth Alliance — which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab\n* “Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria”\n* Funding to print “personalized” contraceptives birth control devices in developing countries\n* Hundreds of millions of dollars to fund “irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan,” benefiting the Taliban\nBut good on you taking back $100 from me every month\nI appreciate what you said in your video. I have 3 claims that have been in limbo for months. Just trying to get the disability rating I deserve is a task I shouldn’t have to fight. I served in Desert Storm and Somalia (PACT ACT) and keep getting denied. Please fix that. It’s been months on these claims and they haven’t moved. DOGE needs to get involved with that aspect. People like Marc in his rude statement, should not be listened to. I’m a proud Veteran and I appreciate you. Thank you, sir.\nDeleting veterans comments because you dislike the words is not going to change the outcome for those that steal our benefits. Don’t forget who trained us and what we were trained for a$$clowns.\nYou were an election denier who signed his name to a brief seeking to overturn a free and fair election. No facts in that brief just made up hog wash.\nNow you are head of the VA appointed by Trump. You got your payback for supporting him.\nYou should be ashamed of supporting that lie on the record.\nFiring VA staff for no reason will only hurt veterans.\nEvery time I go to the VA I now have to avoid looking at your picture as well as Trumps.\nThere is no reason to be nasty to Mr.Collins.He has only been in the job a couple of weeks. Totally disrespectful.\nGold Star Wife\nGet off your knees and grow a spine. It’s unbelievable how a coward like you can actually run Veteran’s Affairs.\nMr Collins thank you for your post and video. I am a Air Force veteran from the 60’s and over all the VA has been good to me. However I hope you will look at the VA billing system which in my opinion is in great need to be upgraded, I am on a copay for some things and the way the VA handles this is a total mess. Just have someone check my account and it should be oblivious. I am treated out of the Columbia MO VA.I would be more thank happy to talk to someone about this. Thanks John\nYou miserable asshat! All you are is a “Tool” for an “Orange Painted” fool of a fascist. Your plans will harm those who you say, that you are there to serve. Grow a Spine!\nWow! A *lot* of comments here! Just wanted to say that I’ve been dealing with VA since ’76 and realistically in the past 6 years or so has it been consistently great for me. But now I can imagine which services are going to be axed, delayed and impaired with cuts… And basically cuts just for the sake of cuts (with a sword not scalpel), without actually looking at and identifying areas that could be cut, or further improved for matter. I hate to say it but it feels like, “hey let’s do what Elon’s doing because, hey, he’s the richest man in the world” even though helping veterans who served their country is far cry from buying satellite and rocket companies.\nSadly, I have noticed a slow down with processing claims Since the election, I am a supporter of President Trump but I think there’s been a mistake at the VA and it’s gonna cost all of us pain. We cannot even ask for a projected date for the resolution of one’s claim. Normally it would take about 45 days to approve or disapprove a claim now I am at 60 days in step number two and Fear that there will be no definite time resolution it could go on for months or years. I’m losing confidence in the system. This is very scary at 71 years old now I don’t have a lot of time. And from reading the comments below from my brothers, it appears that I’m not alone, the secretary remember is a politician first. So it appears that these cuts at the VA are in fact impacting veterans in a negative way. That’s why I came to read these comments one can only come to the conclusion that we as veterans are going to be hurt. How sad.\nThis administration gives a ratsass about veterans. Hell, the Dictator in Chief called us losers.\nWe will pay the bill for our votes.\nReally Johnny? So that’s why POTUS DJT started the Veteran Crises Hot Line in his first 4 years? Giving us Veterans a hotline to call if we need help. Maybe you should stop watching the paid for media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.\nYou actually believe that Trump created the VA helpline? The suicide prevention line? He did not. I worked in the field. Trump created nothing but problems for the active duty and now veterans. Those lines are not the work of Trump. Anything having to do with mental health related lines were already in practice. He takes credit for others’ work.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line in 2007 as a 24/7 resource to provide confidential help to veterans and their loved ones in need of support.\nIn 2022, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline transitioned from the standard 10-digit phone number to the more recognizable 3-digit number, 988.\nTo reach the Veterans Crisis Line, callers can now dial 988 and press 1. The line is accessible through call, text, or chat.\nThe intent of this shift was to make the phone number for the Lifeline easier to remember and more accessible for people who need immediate crisis support.\nJerry the veterans crisishotline has been going since 2007 you couldn’t be more wrong\nSo, what did you think he was going to do while you watched him lie to the American people? Then you voted for him. You are a fool for believe his lies!!! The Bible warns of increasing lies and deception in the “last days,” with passages like 2 Timothy 3:1-9 describing a time of moral decay and a strong delusion where people will reject truth and embrace falsehoods.\nIn 2000, DOD and VA conspired to drive off grass roots groups. We used\nto be invited to Pentagon briefs. But, with the creation of Deployment\nHealth – only members of the military family alliance that were chartered\nby Congress were allowed to attend any more. Service groups were fine\nwith this. Less disruptions. Less to compete with. DOD cuts us off.\nBy 2002, DOD slowly started to also cut off the service groups from certain\nevents as well. Limiting access to information. By 2003, all were distracted\nwith OIF OEF.\n2004, Deployment Health did all it could to pad, and hide any medical problems\nsurfacing from Afghanistan, Iraq. West Nile Virus, Acinetobacter Baumannii,\nVisceral and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, and IED as well as EOD injury issues.\nBy 2005, VA no longer allowed grass roots upstairs to meet with staff. Only\nservice groups. Service groups were fine with this. IOM / NIH began cutting off\ngrassroots and service groups from its workshops.\nBy 2010, VA started driving away the service groups. Not briefing them on\ncertain things. As did DOD. Sec of VA Eric Shinseki had grudge matches with\nanyone publishing news or materials he didnt approve. Then he resigned\nin disgrace.\nBy 2012 VA and DOD actively started removing advocates from committees\nand functions. Started rigging VA committees with internal ringers that would\nnot publish, seeking out congress, or rock the boat. Media started writing less\nand less veteran stories.\n2016 would be the last serious batch of veteran related congressional hearings.\nCongress no longer wanted the service groups and limited them to there\nbudget proposals in the spring. After this, it was mostly OEF and OIF till the\nPACT act became necessary.\n2021 came along, Covid let VA and DOD keep every one at bay. Limit meetings\nto video conference. Stopped answering phones. Now media is on board and\nno longer writing veterans stories. Cutting VSOs out as well. Google started\nblocking any websites that said anything harsh about VA and DOD.\n2024, VA started removing public comments from its meetings and ignored\nany still up. VA stopped writing anyone outside of VA that wasnt part of\nthe inner circle. Openly opposing the service groups. No one was welcome\nupstairs and the dont have to answer phones, email.\n2025, Trump and Elon step in to take advantage of this vacuum to gut most\nagencies, and with VA disregard for veterans – there is no loyalty. So no job\nis secure and everyone is threatened. Your public comments here are largely\nangry veterans spewing at you with no loyalty. You may have a few ringers\non the inside still supporting you, yes men, its not enough to stop the wave\nof cuts coming. because there is no unification across the boards.\nThis all started with DODs need to hide in plain sight, and lump all wars into\nthe Deployment Health catch all. Make everything generic. Seems like now is\nthe time to team up with all sides, eras, and the service groups like it was\nbefore DOD undermined all this. Strength in numbers. Now is a good time\nto post a public voting format within VA of what its veterans want. Instead\nof telling them what they want.\nKeep the current path, it all ends in chaos. Stop insulting people, keep things\nsimple – and just provide the service you supposed to minus the games. At\nleast with this purge at VA, you will unite people alright – an angry mob that\nyou betrayed protesting in unison in front of your doors. The elitist days of\nsnobs looking down on the public is about to unravel. More of the same\nand worse failed. Each angry vet created is for a lifetime, and dont think they\njust plan to keep taking this. Millions betrayed, Im so thrilled Im not you.\nThank you for breakdown.\nSecretary Collin’s, I hate to see anyone lose their jobs but the answer to the problem isn’t quantity of people, it’s quality of people. My amazing VA primary care doctor retired and was replaced by a provider who personally insulted me the first time she saw me and has treated me like garbage. Now shdoes not want me for a patient and I don’t go to the doctor even when it is needed. I suffer daily! we have a beautiful new facility here in Columbus GA but I’m not sure what the purpose of building it was. It appears to be a big empty building.\nI am grateful for t he OUTSIDE care I get from the VA. Seeing outside providers is the only way I get quality care except for mental health care I receive. Why can’t I see someone outside the VA for primary care?\nIf you are going to reduce the VA work force by 83,000 employees. That means that 82,000 veterans will loose their jobs.\nAs a veteran, how is that supposed to be OK with me?\nAbsolutely Trump propaganda!! DOGE, project 2025 & Trump’s entire agenda is anti American, anti democracy, pro Russia & meant to advance the mega rich. Cutting the VA workforce by %20 (70,000) is not advancing the mission, it’s sabotaging the delivery of services to veterans. Musk/DOGE could start by eliminating the waste & abuse in Musk’s numerous billion dollar government contracts. You are part of Trump’s “revenge/retribution administration. We are not fools. Those who speak out I’m sure will be targeted by Trump’s administration.\ni have being trying to fight the VA for over 18 years and the only goal for the VA is to see us die and never get our entitlements. Sadly the VA is not here to help us Veterans but to impede us from getting help, aid and ensure that many of us never get our entitlements. I have seen many brothers and sisters die because the doings of the criminal organization known as the VA. I have being trying to disability retire from my current job but all can only be attainable if i ever get my 100% total and perm but even as my law firm fights for me, I still do not see the light because the criminal organization known as the VA will do anything to ensure we vets never get our entitlements and just die to completely push us away.\nMyself and many of my brothers at arms have been fighting the VA for years due to the VA denying everything illegally, unlawfully and simply in spite. I personally have being fighting the VA over 18 years and they illegaly remove % for our records to lower our profiles. after many years and many law firms i was able to get a 90% because they denied many ailments that where proved to began while in service but they have continue to deny myself and many of our brothers and sisters our rights. I was even downgraded illegaly to 80% without no appt, no proof or anything.\nWhen I left the military in 2007 I have no idea what i needed to do with the VA because nobody ever helped me or guided me to what my entitlements were, i had no idea. So since then i have been fighting this uphill battle. I have helped dozens of vets so they do not have to go through what i have been going thru for almost 20 battle. and thankfully most have been able to get their entitlements assigned properly due to getting out prepared and with good guidance.\nI am pursuing disability retirement from my current job due to my ailments but finally receiving my 100% total and permanent that I deserve is imperative and hopefully my current law firm will be able to finally.\nThe VA is supposed to be here to help us Veterans but they are only here to hurt us and worse.\nYou are a LIAR!!\nHell yeah he is. He must think we’re stupid.\nI’m a disable Vietnam vet and have been dealing with the VA since the early 70s.\nAll I can say about Secretary Collins’ “kicking the can” message is that it’s just more self serving BS from the Draft Dodger in Chief and his MAGA minions.\nThe VA has always been chronically understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed by requests for care so how is removing 1000s of employees, many of them veterans, along with programs and funding going to help anything or anybody, let along improve things?\nThe plain truth is that it’s not and if Sec. Collins goes along with this farce it just proves that he’s more interested in keeping his place at the tax payer funded feed trough than he is in helping veterans.\nAll you boot lickers are disgusting.\nStop by Doug Collins office, make him tell you to your face that he supports cutting 80k VA jobs.\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 2042\n#VeteransRally\nI’m decorated, injured and former member of socom with full benefits, and have NEVER had an issue with my benefits or staff. Yes, there’s been a few messups but always resolved. We as veterans earned benefits and should greatly appreciate what we get. The members of other agencies who also put in work have often gotten none. Can it be inproved? Always !!!! It hasn’t even been 2 months. Breathe in people.\nWhile I am not in the same league at 60%, I also have had the best care at the VA for my SC injuries. However, I do not want to wait while my fellow veterans are harmed by the actions by this political appointee Collins. He does not appear to speak truth.\nCentral to these efforts is a pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care benefits and services to veterans,” said Collins. Collins is in support of cutting VA health care workers. He is a fake Jesus loving liar. He will need increased security\nArmy veteran.\nI listened to your comments on “making the VA more efficient”.\n70k job losses….are NOT the way you make the VA more efficient.\nMy suggestion? Check yourself into a VA mental ward.\nOoooh my mistake…the wait will increase from 6 months to 2 years to see a doctor with your cuts in VA.\nJust lunacy.\nWhy is the va allowed to use there own math when dealing with veterans disabilities I happen to be 100 percent disabled but va math makes it 70 percent to me this is a huge slap in the face of veterans who put there lives on the line then find out the very agency that is supposed to be helping veterans comes up with this formula I am not naive they use this tool to save money off the backs of those who have sacrificed themselves I would love to new secretary to address this issue.\nThanks\nSo please explain to me why I’m still a homeless veteran trying to deal with SSVF or VASH and human beings that should not be working in Customer Service or social work in Sacramento CA.\nJust saw this liar on PBS. “Veterans benefits aren’t being cut”.\nWhere does Trump find these dumb hicks to run his government?\nWho is this joker…?\nDOGE needs to focus on the top and work its way down. Why don’t they first look at how much The White House spends daily? Or why in 2000 we had a surplus and now in the trillions in debt. Hmm could it have been that we were in two conflicts for almost two decades. It was ridiculous the amount of money spent there. Why don’t they look at how much we spent on defense contracts all those years. Or maybe we increased our force during those times for the surges. Why haven’t we drawn down the force? It was done after Vietnam and first Gulf War. DOGE is focusing on making the rich richer and the poor poorer. I defended my country for 21 years active duty with multiple deployments. Is this what our country has become, full of lies from the top down? If each person in our Nation could do one kind act WE the people would become a Great Nation Again.\nHey 1sg, Newsflash, in 2000 the United states didn’t have a surplus. Check your facts before you spew bullshit.\nHow about you get the fact Cpt. Clueless.\nn 2000, the United States federal government had a budget surplus of $236.9 billion, the largest in U.S. history at the time. This was the third consecutive year of a surplus.\nDetails\nThe total revenue for 2000 was $2,025 billion, an increase of $197.7 billion from 1999\nThe total outlays for 2000 were $1,788.1 billion, an increase of $85.2 billion from 1999\nThe surplus was 2.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nThe surplus was the largest as a share of the economy since 1948\nOther budget highlights\nThe surplus was the result of the Clinton administration’s economic policies\nThe surplus was the result of a $363 billion reduction in the publicly held debt between 1998 and 2000\nThe surplus was the result of eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement\nAdditional information\nThe federal budget for 2000 was a spending request submitted by President Bill Clinton to fund government operations for the period from October 1999 to September 2000.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nIn your recent X post, you said the word duplicative. Please consider this: When a veteran is considered for benefits, the VA will send the member to a VA-sanctioned vendor to confirm the disability. Why do this when the member was already tasked to have a certified MD acknowledge the condition via a Nexus letter. Are the physician’s credentials, words, and signature stamps not worthy of acknowledgment of the condition?\nAnother cost-saving measure might be to allow retired members who utilize TRICARE Primary Managers (already sanctioned to care for veterans), as the determining authority. Adding a VA vendor to this process is duplicative since TRICARE Primary Managers are already vetted to care for retirees.\nTheir is a memo CNN obtained from your office requiring the firing of 70,000 DVA employees. That’s 20% of the DVA workforce. You stated, “concerns that Veterans’ benefits might be targeted for cuts”, “I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut”, “In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.” The memo is published and factual. How is removing the workforce by 20% improve healthcare services, compensations and pensions, the PACT ACT, DVA medical housing, suicide prevention, and other disabled veteran services. It takes 9 months to get an appointment with a neurologist in Tucson DVA. Veterans have died waiting for DVA appointments. Senator McCain took actions to improve the Tucson DVA by adding the doctors you want to fire. YOU LIE and must have no care for veteran services, just veteran service reductions. Prove me wrong with facts, not lies. I had lots of respect for Republicans, but not for the person, proven a liar by a court jury, guilty of 34 incidents of fraud appointing you as Secretary of DVA. I have no respect for the Republicans siding with fear of this fraudster. You too sides with the Fraudster with praise due to fear to stand up to the fraudster.\nNine months is too long to wait in order to be seen by a VA neurologist. I also would like to better understand how removing 70,000 to 80, 000 VA employees will lead to better care for veterans.\nI stopped believing you at CNN.\nI personally visited the Fredericksburg 3 VA Clinic in Fredericksburg, Virginia on 3 March 2025. It is a beautiful facility that was not adequately staffed. I was told that the lab would only be open until 2 pm and that none of the specialty providers were available at that location due to funding. Secretary Collins, I implore you to have the honor and morals to do the right thing for your fellow veterans. We are hearing you tell us that VA services are not being affected as we watch it happen in real time. You have a moral imperative to do the right thing for the women and men who have honorably served this country. I expect more of you than this.\nMy husband has enjoyed VA benefits for many years and I am glad to read in this article that benefits are not going to be cut. I believe this info needs to be published on every news channel over and over. The American veterans need to know for sure that their benefits are not going to be cut in this attempt to make our country more accountable in the spending that is done.\nPlease tell the people . The left media seems to be spreading false information about Care for our veterans.\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/192252/trump-lawyer-alina-habba-fired-veterans-arent-fit-job\nmy son was wounded in Iraq 2006,with TBI then MS. in a wheelchair, and went to Sneedville,Tenn. with a woman he married.

I was told died from MS> but I have alot of info. and statement from EMT. ,my son was left to starve to death. and I also found out more info. about other wounded . and us mothers call them “military maggots” who marry disabled vets for the funds. and I have dates ,times, and people who allowed my son to die this terrible way.

Dennis Keoki Cabanting served proudly ,only to die alone and neglected by so many\nAP article today 3/5/25 reports on an internal document outlining plans to fire 80,000 VA employees.\nAmerican veterans demand an explanation from Doug Collins.\nHow does this benefit veterans and their families?\nWhat services will be affected?\nHow will benefits be affected? How will they be “improved”?\nCan Doug Collins provide an explanation? Or is Doug Collins lying to veterans?\nhttps://www.wmtw.com/article/sen-angus-king-reacts-to-job-cuts-coming-to-veterans-affairs/64059551\nAs a 100% disabled vet (after a long 10 year battle) why does not the spouse get full benefits? They aren’t covered by the VA, they do not get Dental, they have to us ChampVA which alot of physicians do not take. Seems it would make alot of sense if they were covered just like the veteran is and could use the VA benefits he/she is entitled to. When you break it down, the spouse really doesn’t get benefits that are needed. Why is this:\nDefine faster. My 95 yr old mother is still waiting . Her case was filed for Aid and Attendance in Virginia in March 2024 and has been ” open ” since October 2024. It is now March 2025. Since she is over 85 , they were supposed to expidite it. I think they hope she will die first.\nGood day Secretary Collins, I got to say that something needs to be done to stop trump and maga. Tariffs! Really! The cost of living is already ridiculous. Folks working 2 or 3 jobs to make rent. I came from a Military family. My Dad, Brother and Myself. How can this person justify what he doing to us? Now he claims the flag is his. Bull Shit Sincerely. Alan Anderson\nI am pretty sure it has slowed down dramatically since Jan 20th. It was a 15 day turn around between steps, now its months before we see any movement.\nThe bva wing of the VA are full of unscrupulous lawyers and liers denying everything they can from veterans that need help the most. They don’t even try and hide their lies. It’s abysmal and this Collins fellow looks ominous and definitely insincere. He’s a lap dog for Trump. Good luck Vets\nHad hearing test at local VA add was told witch hearing aids I was getting and I told him I didn’t want that brand and he ordered them anyway. I told him again I didn’t want that brand and he said they are what I need and try them. Twice going back for adjustment and still ringing in my ears. Went back because the right one quit working. He said he would send it off for repair and once again I explained I didn’t want them. He said it’s been over six months and he couldn’t send them back. Once again I told him he should have done that on day one. He had no words. So now I have to go to Costco and get a new pair of what I want.\nI would like to see the VA look into the current practice of hosing the retired military on their disability payments. Any veteran who serves long enough to be eligible for disability gets the full amount tax free. if you are retiree, you get hosed out of the amount of your disability right out of your retirement payment. This inequjity applies to anyone with less than 50 pct disability. This is a capricious and wholly unfair practice referred to as the “VA waiver”. They take your money that you earned, with one hand and give it back to you as your oh so generous disability payment. The kicker is it is tax free. BFD. The standard deduction accounts for that if you are not filing long form. In the years since I retired in 1991 I have been stiffed out of several hundred thousand dollars by this asinine waiver. your reward for extra decades of service is to get hosed out of your actual disability by having it removed from your earned retirement. Bravo! If they overpay you for any reason on the disability side, they come after you as if it was not your own money in the first place. Honestly speaking, other than a slight tax advantage, there is NO disability for the military retiree should he fall under fifty percent. I would have more than my presenet 40 pct, but you can only fight them for so long before you just give up. Someone in power ought to look at the so called VA waiver and return fairness to those of us who served long and faithfully and are treated like second class citizens compared to those who did not stay til retirement and get the entire amount without any money coming out of their p;ockets.\nDear Mr. Secretary, At the VA here in Atlanta, they have a third party reviewing xrays. We used to be ale to view the reports and images on MyHealthEVet but now, we are unable to see either of those because of third party review. Those are our records and the y should be put into our records and allow us access to them so that we can see and understand what’s going on. If a third party is used, it must be made clear that the images and reports belong to the veteran and must be available for the veteran to have access to. Also, the VA uses some kind of strange mathematical formula to determine disability ratings. They like to brag about the fact that they aways err on the side of the veteran. That is an absolute lie. Can anything be done to change the formula that they use to determine ratings?\nDear Mr Secretary; I had a dental procedure done in Dec 2024,that I had to pay out of picket for. I mailed in the proper form 10-320 for reimbursement, with explanation and receipts. Today they are telling me I can appeal it. This isn’t how the President set community care. Go to any doctor pay for it and get reimbursed. Needs to be fixed! $1500. For a root canal.\nAre Vietnam vets claims given quicker consideration because of advanced age?\nAre Vietnam veterans claims addressed in a different manner than others? I.E. advanced age given more consideration?\nI am an 81 year old Vietnam veteran with 13 years military service (Infantry and Intelligence) and another 17 years working in DIA and the Old Soldiers Home.\nI know used car salesmen with better pitches than this. You should resign rather than allow several thousand VA employees to be summarily fired. It is hard for me to believe that you were a military chaplain. You are a disgrace to the uniform you wore and should be ashamed of yourself. Do the right thing and resign.\nToday March 2, 2025 White house Froze VA funding! I am deeply sad and just beyond words as to how horribly cruel it is of our own government to freeze funding for the VA.\nHas the President or his $ slashers stepped inside a VA hospital recently??? If they did they would witness many America Loving Veterans who have suffered severe atrocities of war or put their lives on the line for the benefit of all Americans to live safer lives. These same veterans are waiting and waiting and waiting for the serious medical care they need! They are all suffering in fear of dying in the hospitals because our government is showing a callous, uncaring temperament towards these hero’s!\nIt’s not just that many are in pain waiting for surgeries, it’s that the anxiety and panic amongst everyone, personnel included are at a high pitch! Who is helping? Who is helping? Who is helping these desperate, anxiety , pain ridden good folks! This is an American Abomination of an All Time High!!\nI was cut $500 it put me in a bad place I can”t pay all my bills!\nKathrine Clark, aka Kommie Katie, Congressional 5th District, Massachusetts lies about VA benefits. Please let her know the “gas lighting” has to stop. He lies are an abomination.\n“Hello Edwin,\nLate last week, Donald Trump and Elon Musk fired thousands of veterans and VA employees . That’s thousands of families suddenly without an income and millions of veterans carelessly put at risk.\nThis will mean longer waits for medical appointments, fewer VA home loans, more homeless veterans, longer claims, and worse PTSD support for vets in need. Of course, Trump isn’t just breaking our commitment to veterans for no reason. All of this chaos is an attempt to give a $2 trillion handout to billionaires .\nThat’s the Republican agenda in a nutshell: More for billionaires, less for vets.\nThis isn’t what people voted for. Republicans in Washington are openly betraying our veterans and we can’t let them get away with it.\nSincerely,\nAn image of Congresswoman Clark’s signature.\nCongresswoman Katherine Clark\nDemocratic Whip”\nMy comment for today, I would like to Thank each one of you 2,050 for there service that has posted on here.Being a Navy brat my father was in the service 30 years, my husband was military and I worked on the military base 33 years serving all active,retired,reserves. Reading all these comments it is hard to understand when I took my job to heart and gave it my all. It is a shame that all of you have to play a waiting game. Gold Star Wife\nInstead of American Taxpayers being forced to thank Veterans for their “service”, Veterans should be forced to thank American Taxpayers for their money. Veterans are a fat and self-entitled class of government-dependent parasites whose very existence is unAmerican.\nYou pos you veterans are parasites? WTF are you talking about asshole us veterans put our lives on the line so you can live your cushy life.\nIt’s obvious you never served your country, you are probably on welfare sucking the tits of American taxpayers. You sir should fu$k off.\nMr. Bender, I do hope that you will be able to allow your anger to eventually dissipate and know that Veterans are citizens who chose to volunteer to enter military service. As a five year old child, I was sitting on my father’s lap watching President Kennedy giving his speech after taking the oath of office. I was struck by his presentation and especially when he said “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what can you do for your country”. President Truman served in WW1 as an Army Captain of artillery, his unit was in combat throughout the war in France, President Kennedy was the Commanding Officer (in the Navy) of the PT-109, in WW2 which was engaged in seek and destroy missions in the South Pacific. President Lyndon Johnson was a Navy Lieutenant Commander who served in Australia and the South Pacific during WW2. My father volunteered for the Army in 1950 and served in the Korean War as a Medic in the 23rd Infantry Regiment. He was in the invasion force that landed at Inchon; he was wounded three times in separate battles and was awarded the Bronze Star with’V’ for Valor in late 1952. He was a quiet Veteran and was simply a citizen who went to War as it was his duty to serve. He and the millions of other citizens that have served were all honorable individuals and your ugly statement demeans their sacrifices.\nRepublicans haven’t told the truth since president Ford.\nSomeone is bitter…..Thank you for your taxpayer money. It will help provide the much-needed medical care after putting our lives on the line for ungrateful people like you. People like you assume you’re safe and secure because you are in the United States, the police, the FBI, etc. are a barricade and will protect us. Let me ask you this, who protects them? What are they going to do when a military-like Russia’s or China’s attack us? Do you think the police are going to be able to stop them?? Negative my ungrateful friend it takes young men and women like the ones in our military and our veterans to take the fight to our enemies thus returning to keep America safe. So next time, instead of running your mouth and being bitter towards what our country and its citizens have promised to provide us for our willingness to put our lives on the line, say thank you and move on!\nMy dad’s va check. Is short 1900 dollars they told him that the program that pays him for at home help care is being cut? I want answers and another thing got cut also they told hi m it was an executive order\nGood video, although I don’t necessarily believe what he says about the press and Doge, and current VA actions certainly aren’t a positive for we veterans. In addition, your actions as a Representative and current actions by Trump & Doge certainly make me, and others question whether we can believe you. But for now, I certainly hope you’re right. If not, you’ll get this video sent right back with a remark that his word isn’t worth the space it occupies.\nDirector Collings is a joke; he doesn’t have a clue. The most recent round of cuts has impacted my VA healthcare in two ways. First, I was to have a laser ablation procedure in my throat in April. When I called the VA yesterday, I was told that the contract for the laser machine had been cancelled due to the Trump/Musk/ Collins initiative. (Several of the hospitals in the area have a lease agreement to share the machine to reduce the cost. Now the hospital is waiting to find out when and if the contract can be renegotiated.\nSecond, I have two VA compensation claims on hold evidently because the DOGE administration let go the workers who are assisting with the claims process.\nNow the administration has rescinded their idiotic decisions, but the damage is done.\nMy procedure is delayed, and my claims are further delayed.\nWhat the administration is doing is fraudulent and a disservice to our veterans.\nDenying and/or reducing benefits for which Vets have qualified- especially when they have been receiving those benefits and relying on them- is cruel and un-American. Equally cruel and unwise is curtailing of survivor benefits. Who will want to serve this country when all incentives to do so are removed entirely? Also, once the disability is designated, along with the qualifying percentage, and the Vet is receiving compensation from the VA, it is unconscionable to reduce or curtail compensation on which that Vet relies. I am aware that some Vet benefits appear to be windfalls. However when time served earning what is essentially a minimum wage is considered, this seeming “windfall” looks more like appreciation for service. In addition, I have to note that disparaging and smug comments, (made by Vets who are not experiencing problems with benefits), are inappropriate and not in accordance with the spirit of service. Sanguine comments that mock and dismiss the harm caused by indiscriminate denial of benefits to fellow Vets says a lot about the integrity of the commenter. I would not choose to be in a situation wherein I would have to, as a service member, rely on such an individual to honor their oath and commitment.\nYour extreme right views and support for all Trump’s wants and desires and your stint with Georgia’s 9th Congressional District, one of the most Republican districts in the country, belie your claim that no cuts will be made to the VA system. And your support of DOGE, claiming that they are doing exactly what is necessary is laughable. Rolling Stone reports: “Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins’ tenure is off to a rocky start. The former Georgia congressman and unapologetic Donald Trump loyalist began by releasing a series of videos assuring that “despite the rhetoric, there would be no cuts at VA.” These videos preceded two rounds of layoffs at the department — first, 1,000 employees, many of them veterans, and then another 1,400 last week. Notably, Collins was not being forced to make these cuts by Trump or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead, he appears to be slashing VA jobs simply to win favor with Trump and Elon Musk.”\nYou may not like Rolling Stone, but even the AP has reported: “VA pauses billions in cuts lauded by Musk as lawmakers and veterans decry loss of critical care. The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. ”\nI could quote many more news outlets, but you would simply falsely state they are all false claims. I give up.\n“Extreme right views” is all these veterans need to hear. You are a fake news consumer, aka Pravda Propaganda. Do some basic research. Your cognitive dissonance won’t let the facts in. Yes, the VA is notorious for their delay, deny and die ideology with it comes to veteran benefits. I’ve been fighting the VA for ten years. The battle continues. I will beat them at their own game.\nThe Democrat Communist Party Pravda Propaganda machine feeds us nothing except FEAR PORN. Fear is an emotional reaction. Using Critical thinking skills, logic and commonsense is the cure. Fight, Fight, Fight and win.\nMy heart goes out to Vets like Malcolm (who wrote on Malcolm February 28, 2025 at 09:01), and :\n“VA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at (Udon) Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof”.\nI am a registered nurse formerly employed by the VA. Meddling with the disability qualification requirements and percentages is CRUEL, SENSELESS, UNWISE, and just WRONG. If they are eliminated or reduced (and they should not be), then the Vets or their survivors whom are already qualified should not be denied the disability benefits earned and that they have been receiving. It is not wise to eliminate any of the few incentives for Americans to enter the military, as it is. They give life and limb. How can this be happening in the United States of America?\nThank you, Barbie Roelofs, for speaking out. At 74 that was devastating news. I’m sure all of these comments fall on deaf ears…\nWhat about Health programs?\nNot to be trusted. Trump will push him to eat his words. Especially since VA personnel are being disrespected and “fired” by the thousands.\nThank you Mr. Collins. May God Bless you in your job as new VA Secretary.\nWOW, what a used car salesman presentation\nKeep it up va I go to Hampton va for my\nTreatment and meds thanks\nFor the service sir no complaints and wife gets her champ va everything is great for her\nSir, I think you need to rescind your assurances that veterans benefits would not be cut.\nthe CBO is beating the drum again this year for reduction or elimination of va disability pay.\nThey do this annually and cause much angst among veterans.\nIt appears to me that if their scheme is enacted, it drive thousands of widows into poverty\nbecause of the loss of Total disability by their husband and concomitantly DIC.\nVeterans who have been receiving IU 100% for years have been unable to establish IRAs’\nand other retirement instruments. They are unable to work. They also are uninsurable\nfor life insurance because of their disabilities.\nI voted for Donald Trump, I can say factually that the veterans community are re-thinking\ntheir decision. I am 100% p/t from Vietnam. There is a tidal wave coming, these ill advised\nproposals will pave the way for the Democrats to retake the house and senate.\nI can state unequivocably that if these idiotic actions become reality I will be changing parties.\nIs this really what these bureaucrats want for disabled veterans\nLOL. Trump worked hard for over eight years to tell the world that he would dismantle everything great about America. Real Americans warned you a thousand times. You failed America with your votes for Trump. Own it.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at Udorn Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof\nImagine your 1SG letting another 1SG come into your company and discharging Soldiers at will. Collins let Musk do that. Proof that Collins won’t even protect his own workforce for the benefit of veterans.\nImagine your 1SG sucking up to the CSM like Collins sucks up to Trump.\nSecretary Collins … I would like to apologize, sir, for the need to say what I am about to say. Simply stated, I do not believe a word you said. On the one hand, with only a month on the job, you have not had a lot of time to prove your loyalties. On the other hand, we all know your reputation and, to be frank, do not believe for one minute that your priorities and loyalties are to the Veterans who defended our country and whose sacrifices have made your job possible in the first place. On behalf of millions of American Veterans, living and dead, I challenge you to prove to us, in the same way that we have proven our loyalty to our country, that you intend to be loyal to us. That’s it in a nutshell. Forgive me again, sir, but now the ball is in your court. History will record for all time where your loyalties lie.\nI second what John Washbush said here 100 percent. History and The Lord both will record your actions!\nMr Secretary Collins, I would like to extend my sincere THANK YOU to Ms. Grace Brumley, from the International Direct Deposit Team, VA Regional Office 351 – Muskogee, OK, for solving the 14 month long delay in my payments by getting Electronic Transfer rather than paying by checks being issued by the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Office https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/\nMs. Grace Brumley exemplified your challenge to ” focus relentlessly on customer service and convenience” and I hope that your office will recognize her efforts to “solve REAL PROBLEMS” being faced by Veterans in receiving payments or other services we have earned.\nThank you!!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nStop doing videos and stand up to Trump and tell us what you’re doing instead of on a video. I do not trust this.\nWhy aren’t you doing press conferences instead of videos? These one-way videos make it seem like the director is afraid soemone will ask questions and demand real data.\nWhy are they firing most researchers ones that are in the middle of studies that was already paid fo outside the VA makes no sense and all was to try and help the veterans i thought that was your job to help the veterans i was in the hospital on the 24 th. And everyone was scared about having a job if you think that helps the veterans your wrong and i voted for trump.\nWelcome to the Find Out stage of FAFO.\nWhy is the VA not properly paying its Community Care Providers, specifically Therapeutic Massage. We took a 24% rate cut in October of 2023 in the middle of the worst inflation we have ever seen. This caused many providers to cancel their contracts and others to reduce the number of veterans served. This action is directly responsible for the suffering of our Veterans. Please fix this problem!\nVA Secretary Collin’s ….DOGE= Dog “Shit”…They are cutting essential Personnel, How are us as Veterans suppose to get the care we need when the VA Facilities & Community Care are empty…..These are some of the most dangerous & corrupt cuts that ever could happen…..Rag-Bag Elon Musk(not even From our United States)..?? You need to explain yourself Sir, when you say you agree what (So called DOGE) is doing or are you committed to standing up for myself & my Brothers & Sisters (Veterans)…these cut @ VETERAN AFFAIRS… Secretary Collin’s has done nothing to speed up anything (except THE AGENDA) Veterans want “REAL ANSWERS” not the Politically Correct answers…..Our Veterans Employees deserve better than this Crazy Shit that is happening to them & thier Families….Lead,Follow or get out of the way!!!\nListening the emotional outbursts of liberals are annoying and bothersome. Grow up do some research.\nWhy are the VA facilities empty?\n“Collins said he would seek to bring more employees into the office rather than allowing them to telework, though he noted he was bound by collective bargaining agreements that represent 80% of the VA workforce. He similarly pledged to follow labor contracts and all other legal processes when seeking to fire more department staff, though he said he would ultimately not be restricted in getting rid of malfeasant workers. “\nThe VA demeans veterans when it does not permit admission into the VA medical system because of an income above some low level.\nI hope Doug can help with the LOGIN.GOV over reach of Veterans personal information. I’m absolutely disgusted with the VA as it pertains to that, specifically!\nThe VA is indeed clearing cases faster than before, but only because they are declining more than ever. Veterans hospitals are not improving, they are getting worse, The VA hospital I attend is very short handed on doctors and I learned yesterday that 2 more of our really good doctors are leaving the VA. Loosing Doctors and the hiring freeze is causing a 2 to 4 month wait to get an appointment. I applied for counselling at my VA due to depression and am having to wait almost 2 months to see a councilor. I have been fighting for my VA disability since 2010 and am still being denied. I can truly understand why Veterans commit suicide.\nNot worried about privacy info being exposed. After all, Equifax was hacked to the tune of 143 million citizens, so it figures that all of my info is already floating around the dark web somewhere!\nYour living in a friggin dream world!!! The VA in both NJ and wills Barre have done everything and did DESTROY\nMy ability to pass any background check by leaking out flat out toxic gaslighting lies all were from a fake woman rep 1 when I used to live in Jersey and now in wills Barre pa both were not related to each other but the pa VA hates vets so much when I applied for my PTSD and my broken bones from army they will call either 2 things “Nutzo or slutz”!! They deliberately infected me with a toxin from a surgical instrument in wills Barre pa and made me so ill I couldn’t even walk! The top brass gives orders to make sure you don’t get your benefits and if they find out you got them before admin finds out they litterly make sure you never go there again, so I tried waiting 2 years and went to one in upstate NY not only did they tried to lie to me, they wanted a surgery to go to the Bronx NYC for the dental surgery that would “take months” to recover when I said you know how can I have surgery when there is no teeth to pull? I knew the last wills Barre didn’t pay the community care dentist and I had to call a congressman to get the va to pay the dentist that and I’m guessing did not sit well with the top brass in Willsk Barre so a vendetta was made without my knowledge, so it’s a good guess that they want to give you the same dental treatment that John Gotti got in prison. The gov gave him cancer in a dental filling, and that’s what I’m guessing they have tried to do to me, this was a warning for me never to go back to Any Va!!! Willsk Barre is run like the Mafia.!!!!\nRep Collins , I not writing this to complain about the service of care providers in our community but, lol I have one small issue that we don’t have a VA hospital in Anchorage or Fairbanks,Alaska. I am lucky enough to be able to go to Chief Andrew clinic in Fairbanks and just to let you know I have received the best care I have ever received from VA. My issue is if I go to the VA clinic it’s over a damn computer and a nurse doing everything a Dr is supposed to do to help me. I don’t know how you feel about having to sit and talk to a doctor over a computer. When just down the street I get to see a doctor in person and God as my witness I can say that I have never been seen and treated like I’m a King ever time. We’re wasting our money on a clinic that works over a computer and I don’t see why we should pay for that kind of treatment. I would like to see that my fellow Veterans get the same treatment that I do thank you for listening to me. Per capital we have more veterans than any other state. Thanks Ron\nMr Collins , you are saying one thing , but in reality you do the opposite. I do not trust you, along with other veterans. You are allowing VA employees to be fired, possible changes in healthcare and disability. Whenever there are budget cuts, veterans are the first on the chopping block. Veterans do not want a yes man for the current administration. We want someone that will fight for us. We have earned every damn VA benefit. The current administration could care less about us. Trump is allowing an unqualified and unelected man to make decisions about the VA programs. Musk is the hit man for Trump and they are destroying everything that we know. You are either for veterans or you are not. Find your spine, voice and protect veterans. We have served our country through wars and conflicts. It is your responsibility to fight for us. Freedom is not free.\nGreat to that we got a Secretary that cares about Veterans. Let’s see if he’ll get us more than an annual 1-2% COLA increase. Congress goes and proposes a 40% pay increase for themselves and only about 10% served in the armed forces defending our country and the citizens of it.\nSome of us are deemed unemployable and struggle paycheck to paycheck. Like myself.\nI honestly don’t believe, or trust you.\nAs a Trump loyalist, your true allegiance is not to us, the veterans, but rather to the President.\nFrom your previous term, you should be well versed on the “Concurrent Pay” issue.\nWhy hasn’t this been taken care of. Even (then) Sen. Harry Reid made it his FIRST bill submission. It always gets buried.\nI was ripped off for half my 30 years of disabled retirement. When I received $400 for disabiliy, my meager enlisted retirement check was struck with a $400 deduction.\nPresident Lincoln established Concurrent Pay to help the enlisted soldier. It also was meant to put the responsibility of disabled Officers (then Aristocrats) on themselves. This is no longer close to fair today (although I have no idea why an officer gets 2-5 times more than this combat/retired/disabled Green Beret).\nShow us what you are made of. You should be our Governor or Senator. I hope you are the man I think you are.\nLead the charge, Sir!!! I have no dog in this fight as I’m now 100% (after a 29 year fight). But, our Brothers in Arms don’t deserve this.\nAnd, if President Trump wants to give away money, skip the people who won’t work and slide it over to us who have been screwed and fighting with our finger nails to get a fair shake. Otherwise, take care of the brothers behind me.\nGod Bless\nDe Oppresso Liber\nHe is correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nI am dating a 78 year-old veteran and I am 72 and all we do is argue because I’m a Trump supporter and he is not any throws in my face that this morning the president said he was going to cut the veterans benefits. What can I say back to him to quit listening to the fault narratives that are on the news but he said that Trump said it so can you clarify it for me?\nTell him that his statement is, as labeled by the great Gen. Swartzkoff…. “bovine scatology!” LOL! Just a thought! :D\nI’m a veteran and this administration has declared war on us… WHY?\nDo I believe that Collins has any control over the matter???…Hell No! Anyone who sits across the table from this president or Elon Musk will toe the line of the administration’s conjured up policies, regardless of whose lives they destroy. Wise up, and don’t be a party to this foolishness, Mister Collins.\nMy experience with the VA is that of honest people attempting to do their best with little time, resources, and management support. I pity them, but wholeheartedly thank and respect their dedication to. the cause.\nYou obviously don’t know Mr. Collins. He doesn’t cower to anybody. He shut down the Trump Impeachment with his legal prowess.\nYour experience with the VA is similar to mine, except I find several persons hanging around with seemingly nothing to do.\nI pray that God Almighty creates a special place in hell for anyone that wants to privatize the VA.\nDO you support the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025’s framework for restructuring, reducing and taking benefits and disability ratings from the veteran community ? Please answer this question.\nEnough of the Fake News lies: Project 25 is from a private organization. It has nothing to do with President Trump. Do some basic research.\nWill health care professionals be let go? The VA has made vast improvements in last 10 years or so. I was dealing with the medical issues. The whole operation seemed to be chaotic. Nobody would return phone calls. Sometimes there would be a neurologist on staff. Other times the nearest neurologist was in Buffalo. You never knew what to expect. I really dreaded dealing with the VA. I’d have to drive to the VA to get information or prescriptions or to get a simple question answered. Those days are over. Please don’t let them come back. You’ve made such great improvements. The VA has a new facility here (ROPC). I’ve had the same medical team for eight or so years now. The staff is friendly and concerned about my health. My meds arrive on time. And other vets I’ve talked with feel the same way. I can’t adequately express how much the VA has improved. The care I receive at the VA is better than civilian care (they seem to be going down hill). Please don’t let the VA slip back into chaos\nI was notified by my local VA that community care service is being eliminated. I had to cancel my next appointment. They said I could either go to the community care but then could not go to the VA. That doesn’t make sense. Now I have to drive an hour and a half to my closest VA instead of 2 blocks to local hospital. Also some of my appointments\nare further apart due to staff reductions??\nAlso since Trump started all of the funding cuts my medication deliveries have been stopping and I am constantly calling to straighten. Out the mess. Things just seem to not be working smoothly anymore.\nIn no way do I trust the current CIC, any of his appointees, and certainly not the “DOGE”. Looking for inefficiencies in all Federal government agencies is certainly a necessary endeavor, napalming those agencies is unacceptable and un-American.\nThey cut my benefits\nWhat? Are you kidding?\nWhat benefits were cut?\nExplain your situation, my benefits have not been touched. I don’t know where everyone is lying about their benefits being touched. Can you please give more details\nI got my disability cut from what they say is from 100% to 90% from apllying for the pact act and got cut from over $3800 to $2297 starting March 2025 and talking about going down to just over $2200 and wished I never put in for the fraud Pact Act to give others our money and I’m going to be homeless and starved to death and Unemployable that’s the thanks for our service is all we get and they hope we die before we get to 100% and decrease it. Just like the cadence says “they give you a hundred dollars and take back 99. I’m telling my grandchildren stay out of the military from grandad’s expeirience until they get the benefits right without the paper chase beuracracy\nYou didn’t know the Pact Act was a setup to do exactly what they did to you? If you were already 100% WHY did you file another claim??????\nYeah, you are a complete idiot for touching your claims after already having 100%\nThis is a sad day when people are on here rooting for this idiot from Georgia who is part of the problem. The Trump administration just fired the company that cleans the surgical tools in the operating room before they operate on a veteran they also just let go of the company who checks the radiation on the MRI and X-ray machines to make sure the veterans don’t get too much radiation. But some of you are on here praising this man they’re trying to sell the headquarters of the VA lol but they can actually sell the Federal building but they tried. And I see a couple people in their talking about give the man a chance you guys are pathetic. Cutting $80,000 jobs when the VA was already struggling and then you have somebody that is actually showing you they want to take veterans out anybody that voted for this crap is getting what they deserve.\nWhy is a company called Veterans Evaluation Services being used ? It has been my experiences with them to be a waste of time and “our” money ! All they have ever done is look at my VA records and confirm that my records are valid ! I’m sure that my 12 year old Grandson could do the same thing if I gave him access to my files ! And welcome aboard Secretary Collins !\nI really hope that I don’t get cheated as I been for 13 years, with concussion that has caused me demihelanation of brain,chronic high\nblood pressure, sleep apnea, seizures when anxiety is elevated and many others secondary disabilities.i have been unemployable since 2009 and not rated.\nI applied for an increase in my disability rating on 6/10/24. Since then I have received requests for employment info that I have responded to. However it seems I am in a loop without end. I respond and then receive another request, then I respond again. I feel that this is a delay tactic to avoid making a decision. It is frustrating to say the least. I hope with the leadership change with the VA that this can be resolved. I have always been grateful for the care I received through the VA, and by and large have been very pleased with the level of care its provided.\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new appointment. My husband was a veteran. He was shot in the head in Vietnam. He was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The VA took care of him for 55 years. Several years ago, a CT scan was done, and we found that injury took 50% of his brain. The VA paid for his rehab, education and ALL of his care. They even helped me through many difficult times. They hired him as an Educational Therapist and later as Prosthetic & Sensory Aid Services Representative. He was employed for many years and retired in 2000. We both felt that if he had been taken care of in the private sector he would not have survived near as long. The multidisciplinary team approach plus the knowledge related to veterans’ long problem lists allowed him to survive the 55 years. I realize there is waste in the VA and the waste needs eliminated. However, do not let anyone eliminate the system. It was certainly a blessing for him and me. Thank you.\nWhere is the waste? Elon Musk will gut everything and ask forgiveness later. You cannot encourage the reckless behavior of billionaires who have never known hardships. They don’t care what they cut as long as the number is big.\nYou are correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nActually I think you are a communist spy, trolling this site and spreading propaganda and lies, like a good little comrade. Please go take your cut and paste post and shove it.\nBottom line, a Vietnam draft dodger and a corporate welfare foreign national (the latter unelected) running and destroying our government and thus our country that we here lived and in some cases died for.\nSir, please don’t cave in to the spoiled Brat Billionaires who never served and don’t give one shit about us veterans. Anyone that calls POWs loosers can rot in hell – yes I’m talking about Captain Bonespurs Trump, he said that, check tape.\nI can only pray that current VA leaders have the spine and backbone that politicians left at the door.\nI am a 1980s Cold Warrior till I die, and you poster are in fact a commie if you support a Putin, Xi, Kim loving president.\nAnd I call BS on your post. It simply isn’t true, and you are probably a Russian spawed bot anyhow.\n(yea, Musk isn’t even a real American, he’s from South Africa and only naturalized in 2002, holds citizenship in 3 different countries, so yea, where does his allegiance lay?)\nThank you for the information, transparency and congratulations on your appointment. I’m a veteran, but also a proud spouse of a VA employee (also veteran). I’m hopeful that in the coming days you and your leadership team will be providing transparency to VA employees and staff so we can anticipate any future changes. I know the situation is changing daily and quite fluid and I’m sure we aren’t the only family looking forward to this information. We appreciate what you are trying to do. Best wishes.\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 1,955 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans and veterans. This situation we are living through can be overcome but we must work together, remember our discipline and memories of how we work together as a team even in the most dire of situations. We must hope and expect the best from our current chain of command as our success or failure is coalescent on their decisions and actions. Health, fortitude, peace and humor as we navigate these next few years but above all optimism that things will work out.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nHey Santos, you going to be so polite when your orange Jesus deports you?\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new job. I see all these comments and veterans are confused and need their questions answered. I see Kirt Love postings and he has many unanswered questions that need your support. Why doesn’t someone from your office get back to Kirt Love for some real questions to get answered. Please follow up. Ed Bryan\nCongratulations Mr. Collins on your appointment and your transparency. I receive excellent care all throughout the VA – way better than civilian care. Now, to all the negativity a select few continue to post – We are all proud that President Trump is back (I repeat, BACK!) in the White House.\nNo, we are not all proud that white supremacists who want to end the Constitution are back in the oval. You sure don’t speak for me nor millions of other patriots who want to PRESERVE the Constitution.\nI’m dealing with a really bad case of bone spurs. LOL\nGuess what over 50% of the people working at the VA are not Veterans, they don’t even know what a Veteran has done for this country, their families. You work somewhere, your boss ask or the book keeper as what you did that week before you get paid. Hey you can tell them and will tell them to keep your job. Realize that a lot of people took advantage of the virus, stopped going in to work, but continued to get paid by the taxes you and I pay to the government, then got another job or moved to an foreign beach and send in work by computer if at all. Notice how you can’t get anyone to answer the Phone. Wake up, they need to go and only those who care and want to work should be kept.\nI wrote to you last week, I have been a claims agent accredited for years 20 or so. The problem is here in Arizona Doctors are needed in community care. However, a chiropractor in Camp Verde put his application in again to help and was turned down and not answered as to why, he has to be creditionaled only by one company and that company want you to pay them and you have to take all of the insurances they have or you can’t be part Of them. Kick back in sure. For all of central and no. As there is one chiropractor. This is wrong and should be checked. Verde Valley Family Chiropractor Kyle French was at one time signed with VA, but stopped working for a while family diffaculties. Now they won’t let him help. Hope you can find out the problem. All doctors and nurses are needed in this area and across the country.\nI watched the video several times and all I heard was “the media is telling you things I don’t like. Well, nuh-uh!” but in a folksy voice.\nAgreed. What a waste of hot air.\nThe Veterans Health Administration is America’s largest integrated health care system, providing care at 1,380 health care facilities, including 170 medical centers and 1,193 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (VHA outpatient clinics), serving 9.1 million enrolled Veterans each year.\nI suspect that many of the negative, fear-mongering comments here are people with memory deficits. As a caregiver of a 100% disabled Veteran since Vietnam era, I have seen the VA rise and fall with each administration. I distinctly remember the previous short 4-years under the first Trump administration as being a breath of fresh air after the Obama administration’s middle finger to Veterans. By the end of his first term, President Trump had managed to clear the backlog, get enough doctors and medical specialists hired and streamlined the process of getting care. https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-putting-veterans-first/ Within just a few months of Biden in charge, it went right back to the boondoggle of the pre-Trump years.\nThe VA is a HUGE beaurocracy with multiple layers of services for every type of veteran from WWII to present. If you expect the system to change in 30-days, you’re only kidding yourself. You can yell or you can do something. Every county is represented by a Veteran’s Service Officer. Every county is represented by both State and US Congressmen and Congresswomen. Most, but not all, VA employees serve veterans and will do everything possible to assist you with information, processes and procedures, communications and expectations. If you’re not a jerk, one or all of these avenues are open to you. Even if you are a jerk, most will still try to help deserving veterans and their families.\nDoug Collins and Donald Trump have been elected to try to straighten out the mess once again. Work with them instead of against them and you will see a dramatic improvement once the waste, fraud, abuse and red tape of previous administrations are cleared out of the way. They truly do need to “clean house” at VA to make room for dedicated people with the will, training and dedication to help with this mission. There are a lot of them but we need 100% mission-driven patriots from the front door to the top floor and no slackers need apply.\nIn what bizarre world is A Vietnam War draft dodger who badmouths POWs, Veterans, even service members killed in a helicopter accident, a patriot???\nOh, and his buddy Musk isn’t even a real American. He’s an immigrant from South Africa naturalized in 2002, look it up. So yea, also not a patriot.\nThey are both self-serving billionaires with billionaire cronies, who don’t give two shits about Vets. That means you Reader, regardless of which party you vote for. These guys are gonna screw you in a heartbeat.\nHow can you tell a republican is lying? His lips are moving.\nCollins may believe he’s telling the truth but as soon as Con Man Trump determines the time is right, he’ll screw all veterans. You should expect nothing less from the draft dodger. And when he does change his mind, Doug Collins will be right there kissing the ring and do nothing to support veterans. It’s almost like I can see the future – right Doug.\nAs a veteran enjoying the benefits I earned after serving for over 32 years I can personally attest to how great The Community Care program is for when I need care that’s not offered at my local clinic. This program was introduced during President Trump’s first term. I can also remember how bad the VA was during former President Obama’s administration whenever I attempted to get care. Thankfully I had healthcare insurance through my civilian job. May I ask if you’re a veteran? If so, what has been your experience?\nYou may want to research that further. It’s so tiresome that people are always looking in the rearview mirror to vilify past leadership in an effort to elevate the current traitor, even if it is a lie. Pres. Obama signed it into law!\nThe “program started in 2014 following a scandal over wait times at Veterans Affairs facilities. The program was created through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill that was signed by President Barack Obama.”\nFact Check: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-veterans-free-health-care/\nFact Check: https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trump-veterans-choice-program/\nGlad to hear you are having a good experience and it is working well for your healthcare needs; however, it is not the same for everyone, everywhere.\nWhere I currently live it is not efficient. Females are farmed out to the community for basic healthcare, and the claims are routinely denied for stupid reasons, regardless of an authorization. Community care is limited to a monopoly healthcare system, and Veterans are not always treated with kindness or respect. The whole community care program is also untimely.\nFor example, getting a mammo or other female care should not require multiple intermediaries to get an auth and schedule the care. Furthermore, if a mammo is abnormal, and follow-up is required with further films or an ultrasound, etc. It’s back to waiting for the process, again.\nThat said, if I receive an unfortunate diagnosis and need to navigate community care program for cancer care, etc., it would be a nightmare. In my line of work, I saw what Veterans had to deal relative to unpaid community care claims, etc. The process could definitely be streamlined.\nNOTE: Any misogynists or sexists who feel the need to make negative comments about female Veterans can keep them. I’ve already heard it, seen it, and experienced it for years.\nThank you for setting it straight. I get so tired of hearing what Trump has done when it iks just an extension of Obamas work and I have been in VA care the whole time so I have experienced it personally\nI know of a lady who works for the Social Security. She told my wife that on the horizon are works in place so that we have to choose between SSN and our Veterans benefits. Maybe this is a rumor started in house to provoke us to behave badly. I trust my government, and that this is just a silly rumor perpetrated by opponents of our duly elected president.\nDoge is not a government entity. I insist that you stop working with a bunch of criminals.\nThey are not vetted or have security clearances. They are a bunch of egomaniac punks.\nDodge serves as the pleasure of the President. Legal\nAt the pleasure of a convicted felon, lifelong grifter, and someone convicted of sexual assault. Why would I trust him?\nThe predator in chief serves at the pleasure of an incompetent nepo baby. Clear the GOP lies from your ears and look at what’s in front of you. Donald Trump doesn’t care about you and never will. Elon Musk comes from a family of billionaire emerald mine owners who were literally proud members of the nazi party.\nI cannot believe how easily so many of you gave our country to a bunch of billionaire oligarchs who are cozying up to mass murdering dictators. Victor Orban, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un were the only people voting against the UN resolution condemning Putins illegal invasion of Ukraine, and your idiot president joined them.\nCongrats Mr. Secretary\nWould you please consider the letter on Panama Veterans submitted by 34 members of congress to identify Panama Veterans under the Pact Act/\nHe is lying.\nSenators (all Rep except Hawley from\nMO) rejected an amendment to the budget outline proposed on February 20.\nThe amendment brought by a Democratic senator I believe From Connecticut requested the VA healthcare funding be at the same level. It is now to not reduce those levels in the new budget. It was rejected by all, except that one Republican senator. All the Democrat senators and the independence voted for the amendment. They want funding for veterans healthcare to at least stay where it is now and to not be cut.\nA lot of people claim to be for the military and for veterans but when it comes down to it, they are not. They are for lining their own pockets. Rolling Stone has a great article about how doge has not found fraud in the VA all they’ve done to save money as fired, doctors nurses office workers and things like that.\nGoing to pitch a idea for everyone coming here. Instead of you posting once\nand walking away, look for others you share similarities and unite.\nVA does not want any of you to rally. They want you to remain individuals\non here and bicker. That way they can claim there is no common interest\nand nothing to answer.\nBest possible place to try: Change.org and set up a petition of things you all\nwould support. Single idea, easy to agree on. Dont write a book, Get the\nfirst or second idea running with a few thousand on board. Then VA cant\nignore you. Like “Open door policy at VA”.\nRight now, they just want to see who the loudest people are to ignore. This\nis a test bed on who to turn away or frustrate. Even the service groups. These\nfolks want to rule by keeping you all “Armies of one” No matter how good the\nidea, VA only responds to numerical support – angry mob.\nBeen doing this 28 years, watched what hasnt worked. Been pitching this to\nadvisory committee to bypass there own deadlocks. You only have to be a team\nfor that one idea folks. Regardless of personality.\nOther wise, sec of VA Doug Collins is going to ignore every one of you. He is\nalready doing that with me. All talk, same old song and dance as the others.\nIts easier than you think folks. Commit to a idea, and unite on it.\nI just got my second denial letter for VA referred community care since there are no in-house women’s programs where I live. As a 100% disabled vet, I’m once again a subpar citizen simply because I don’t have male genitalia. I get to bleed to death from a military related injury. Thanks guys!\nHi, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance.\nI agree!!! Same here! I don’t even bother to get female care anymore because it is an effing nightmare! Every time I was sent to the community, it was denied and not paid, regardless of a prior auth. Optum is notorious for denying payment even after they give an auth. I finally escalated it, with all the receipts, and nothing.\nHow many current and planned positions have already been lost since January 20th?\nHow many families have uprooted to move for a promised position only to have it canceled since January 20th?\nCan you explain why a pharmacist can change the dosage of medication prescribed by a heart specialist?\nSeems a bit strange.\nCongratulations on your new job. I am happy to know that you were selected for this job. I know that you will do great for us veterans.\nFor years democrats have controlled the VA. Now that President Trump and his team are in charge, democrat vets are singing the same disrespectful songs of the fake news radicals. (See comments) Secretary Collins has been in office for less that two weeks and they are already saying he is a failure. For God’s sakes men, give him a chance. The entire administration has only had a month to improve things, and the improvements in every area are significant. God bless you, President Trump, and your entire team. AMERICA FIRST!!!\nBernie Sanders and President Biden have done fine jobs on helping veterans but you want to believe a draft dodging LOSER and his lies over actual proof of those first 2 men obviously supporting veterans. I mean you do remember that President Biden had a son in the military he lost? All of DJT family dodged serving their countries, even his granddaddy first immigrated here to dodge his country, Austria’s draft to come here. You do know that means every time he dodged his draft other men were selected to go in his place? You’re worship of one of the most greedy money hungry loving conman actually makes me sick. You’re the type to have joined a hunting party to go after escaped slaves before and during the Civil War, just reading your comment tells me a lot about the type of person you really are. Probably joined the military to get to kill more than animals too, well I joined to help defend my country and to get more education and to travel the world and learn about different cultures etc\nShut down the VA go to medicare. I’ve been waiting for a consult for 3 months and no one can say why. They have lost some of my records when they can find any. Doing away with the VA is not cutting benefits. I can almost write a book of the disrespect and l ack of care I’ve received from the VA. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/\nAMEN!!! EXCELLENT reply, Ron!!\nI only hold them to the promises they made. No one forced them to claim they would lower groceries on Day 1, they said that . I say hold them to it or they lied for your vote and you still back them? Sad\nYou people are the biggest bunch of crybaby whiners I’ve ever seen. Not a positive comment in the bunch of you about what good the VA does; just complaints and “give me more”. Try a little gratitude for what good comes your way from the VA instead of all this entitled bull**\nEntitled? Are you even a veteran or just commenting to be a good little DT bootlicker? You do realize that some of these people have been waiting for decades to be able to get benefits like healthcare that they need in order to be alive? I know this one guy that said he’d fought for 20 years because he had to dump toxic waste for the military, but he lied about his age to join and they did something with his service record and he’s got witnesses etc but they’ll literally wait them out to death so they don’t have to pay out\nRoger That, Doug!!! It’s really difficult to believe that most of these brainwashed, Crybaby Whiners could have ever served our Republic with service in our Armed Forces!!!\nGood soldiers are not afraid to ask questions. Some of the people that you are censoring may have a question that you did not think of to answer. Stop badmouthing these heroes who are exercising the right that they fought for.\nThis sounds like the same attitude that our Vietnam Veterans received after the war when years later we found that their complaints were real.\nWell Doug (Collins), is this how you treat disabled Veterans. As “crybaby whiners”. This is why you should be last to be the Sectary of DVA. You finally responded to my request to view these complaints. “Not a positive comment in the bunch of you” makes you look like the biggest “crybaby whiners”.\nThe comments I made are relative to the community care process, not the VA care. The VA has provided excellent care and is my preference. My providers are outstanding and caring and very professional. Unfortunately, the facility doesn’t provide a lot of female care.\nOf course, this will be a reason for misogynists and sexists to vilify female Veterans.\nMy dad died in a VA hospital because of a lack of human resources. He sat in the ER for over 6 hours missing his medical golden window to survive and then spent 30 days in ICU with sepsis where he died. Veterans like my father deserve THE BEST.\nSo why, are so many veterans being intimidated about what they’re doing at their job. So excuse me for not believing a word you say, because you don’t really know it’s not you, is that criminal in the White House Trump and his pet muskrat, that will destroy veterans lives. It already has disrupted them by forcing them to answer by Monday night. I know a lot of veterans at the v. A, that I confused disturbed about what’s going on.So what do you have to say about that\nThank you for the comment. There are plenty of videos and quotes proving how little the current administration cares about veterans and anyone really\nRight on, Thomas! We have a right to ask questions. When I was an NCO, whenever a commander got in front of us for questions, I threw my hand up and encouraged my soldiers to do the same. Let’s keep doing the same thing. We are not a bunch of mindless infants. We are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that answered the call. Ain’t scared of nothin’!\nThe 1991 agent orange Bill was pass for all Vietnam Veterans that had agent orange Health Problems. in 2002 the V.A said had boot on ground.

To vote for someone who has absolutely no integrity ,releases criminals from prison because they adore him , which is what he believes we all should do . Because after all he is the king . Money and power for him and his rich supporters is his agenda . The rest of us be damned . Shame on all of you!!\nI’m appalled by this gaslighting and it was a Democratic President that passed the PACT act and has helped veterans immensely and because his son was a veteran, President Biden obviously cared a great deal about us veterans, especially those of us who were disabled. I also remember Senator Bernie Sanders a liberal,(Independent/Democrat) doing a wonderful job when the VA was struggling with backlog by years and even decades in some cases. I myself am still struggling at 70% when they stole my silver fillings and replaced them with the then new composite crap that’s cured with a blacklight. The 70% is for the agoraphobia they caused but they also caused PTSD and aggravated all of the previous to my service, mental health disorders. I feel like they tried to make me a mindless thing they could control and the programming failed if I was 1 of 5 from my squadron all in the hospital the night of the Air Force’s Airman’s Ball with the 17th Commander of the Air Force attending (his wife started the digitized blue, white and gray in all shades ? BDU idea, like people don’t need to “blend” into sky, they’ll be seen, duh ???) for trying to end our lives early. Yeah I know I’m giving to much personal information but it’s partly due to my manic phase I’m in right now.\nHow anyone would trust a man who was well known not to pay his contractors, cheated on all 3 of his wives as an unrepentant adulterer after he vowed to honor and cherish them, lusted after his own daughters (there’s plenty of interviews that are cringe AF with him describing baby Tiffany’s rack size and legs being like Marla’s and the Katie Johnson interview describing her looking like Ivanka and he made her wear a blonde wig when she was with him and to wear gloves so she couldn’t get any DNA from him because he had to see them get destroyed after use, he was careful not to leave behind evidence and she was a Epstein girl and happened to be close to his daughter in age at the time, he also stole her purity according to her account of their last meeting) and y’all think he didn’t and doesn’t LIE to y’all EVERY SINGLE TIME he opens his yuge gaping mouth?\nSir, what you described is literally what the Biden administration and democrats did. President Trump and Mr. Collins have only been in office for weeks, doing more that Biden did in four years. Shouldn’t we wait and give them a chance to set things right again, or are we going to continue to allow our feelings to dictate blame without facts? Personally, I am very confident that President Trump and his cabinet members will do everything in their power to correct what is wrong and then build it back better. Because the majority of the voting population to include a lot of the Democratic legislation are finally acknowledging how criminally unjust he was treated during his first term and are now supporting him. Don’t you think its time to trade our feelings in for observable merit-based accomplishments?\nNO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT CONCURRENT BENEFIT DOUBLE STANDARD …. VETERANS WHO EARNED BOTH DESERVE BOTH\nMr. Secretary,\nYou are not telling the truth; Veteran’s Administration staff are being terminated by email. You know this, if you really stand behind every veteran then you also need to be standing behind every VA staff member who has been terminated by the weakness and constant lying of Donald Trump. Every veteran served by the VA has been on the front line, in harm’s way they trusted the soldier, the marine, the airman, and the sailor next to them. It is time that you not only step forward, that you step up and call out the ignorance that this coming from the White House.\nVeterans have paid the IRS federal & State taxes for many years. I have paid taxes since I was in college until I retired in my 50s. Will veterans who pay no tax on VA benefits get a “DOGE Dividend Check”? I’m certain the IRS used the tax money for fraud, that veterans have paid as civilians, and we deserve a refund, as well.\nJust curious, has our care gone to crap becasue DOGE is trying to make it better? I used to have great care at my local VA healthcare facility. I believe a big chunk of the staff is gone. So how is that helping vets? I think waiting over 2 months for a Urinary Tract Infection is unacceptable. If you look online it states the average wait time to be seen is 2-15 days. Oh, and don’t fall for the lie of using the local urgent cares. The VA doesn’t cover the labs if they decide to do a urinalysis. I paid $149 to pee in a cup of which the VA will not reimburse.\nWell done and well said Mr. Secretary!\n34 years I been waiting on just one ounce of truth behind how I was Deserted in Desert Storm and how the Government has destroyed records and the time is coming to answer to the International Humanitarian and War Crimes major violations. I am an American Fighting Machine I will never give up on Justice or my innocence because I’m an American soldier and veteran. Put your seat belt on Mr. Collins. Because the final battle may come on your watch\nCan you explain how laying off probationary workers and offering buyouts to our underpaid healthcare providers is eliminating waste?\nWe need more people, not less. Instead of letting some kids who aren’t old enough to rent a car screw around with your systems, maybe hire some actual veterans to audit the system who give a shit. You do not have our consent to be doing this and it will come back to haunt you.\nBelieve it when I see it. The president is a lier and has always hated veterans. He avoided service. The idea of privatization of the VA is just a money grab by private insurance companies and private health care. They will deny care and keep our money. The VA isn’t perfect but works leave it alone. Many are happy with it.\nThank you, Doug. My husband is going through the process right now, and we received a phone call just yesterday, and our case is moving forward. Looks like the Democrats are spending every penny they have embezzled on trolls again. The only time I have ever seen attacks like this was after a pro-Trump post in 2017 when they targeted Trump. Just remember that liberals do not like losing power, and they have lost it all. Their following is only about 15% of the population, but their voices are always loud. We are winning. Keep moving forward as fast as you possibly can. All the right people are united in this administration. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world how wrong the liberals have been. Power and money are all they care about. I’m sure Elon is going to find a great deal of fraud and abuse. That money is for the veterans, and I trust this administration and you to put the funds right back into the veterans’ needs. God bless this administration, and God bless you, Doug. Thank you for stepping up.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Laura!!!\nThe VA does EVERYTHING in Slow Motion. From needing to see a Doctor (several weeks) to getting prescriptions (2 to 3 weeks) New glasses (6 to 8 weeks). God forbid I should get really sick! Someone needs to light a fire under under the VA!\nUs Vets have already shown we are willing to put everything on the line. Now the Rich want to cut our benefits? Lets find out. Glad to know my post will flag me for DOGE or some authoritarian response.\nI received a letter from VA a few days ago telling me that I was over payed in my benefits. The number is quite very high. They didn’t give any time frame of the over payment. I’ve been receiving service connect payments since 1993. What the heck, why did it take this long and why didn’t they give me more indepth information on the matter. All that was said is I owe money and my entitlements will be garnished. Sounds pretty lame to me. Now I have to pony up for a lawyer because VA just can’t get their act together.\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nThis is just a complete lie. There is no sense in which arbitrary firings can possibly lead to improved care.\nThere is also absolutely NO plan to *redirect* funds to VETERANS. The only “beneficiaries” you’re talking about are the rich paying less in taxes.\nShame on you. Shame.\nAre you a draft dodger too, Bryan?\nWe hear this all the time; however, the VA has been broken for a long time. I’m not holding my breath. The VA policy is delay, delay. and aways tell you what they can’t do never what you can do . As long as you have clinics like the one in Bismarck ND There are many others, but this one has to be the worst-case of incompetence. Talk is cheap, let’s see if we see any actions. I won’t hold my breath.\nYou will justifiably suffer if you believe you will be told the truth by anyone who has been given position and power under the Musk/Trump administration.\nDoug Collins DID NOT ANSWER the question about Musk&Minions having access to PRIVATE/PERSONAL information as with Medical information–An outright HIPAA Violation!!!! I DID NOT “release” my records to DOGE! Did you???\nThere is NO transparency and/or accountability amongst the lawless incompetents and robber barons accessing veteran/private citizen information via the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other government agency that tRump has opened to a billionaire TechBro that knows he’s buddied up to the perfect ‘mark’ giving him access to Data Mine the entire US Government. INFORMATION is POWER.\nNo doubt this DOGE activity will emerge as the largest (sanctioned) THEFT OF PERSONAL DATA of every Vet/US citizen (for misuse and monetization) in the history of the world. There will be ZERO recourse as all the avenues of reporting and enforcement are simultaneously being dismantled and/or lead by and stocked with tRump/MAGA castrati at the top and lots of sheep in the ranks.\nDoug Collins, Musk and Trump are liars and time (very soon in fact) will tell. The bad thing is our vets will have to pay the price when they have already paid so much to defend this country. Why treat them like they don’t matter.\nDan, your wrong. These people are known liars with intentions to lower the disabled veteran population to reduce the expenses of DVA. Less disabled veterans. My issue is the rest of the republican’s siding tor lies, injustice against the American ways. They are not the Superman’s except in their dreams.\nIt will be 2 decades before republicans can be trusted again.\nI admired Reagan and the Bushes, especially with the concept of “War against terrorism”. These were trusted Republicans. Now they are humbled, by Dictator Putin. What republican now believes Putin did not start the war?\nDoug Collins, prove us wrong and get the current president to promise VA disability, Social Security, and VA health care will not be lessoned like when he wanted to reduce social security to the 100% IU’s on a $ for $ ratio, to pay for his wall. Get the president to promise he will not treat disabled veterans like he did with the Honorable Senator John McCain, the last republican I could trust..\nMake that promise yourself. Promise to follow the Constitution over Trump.\nSorry Dan for the statement that you where wrong. You are right that the vets will pay.\nFWIW Mr Collins, most of us MIL vets don’t believe you have any power – Trump & Musk tell you what to do and you do it or get fired. They have demonstrated this thousands of times in the past month.\nAnd worse yet for us and what’s left of the VA you occupy office space at, this article was posted by Wired . com just 2 days ago – “DOGE’s USDS Purge Included the Guy Who Keeps Veterans’ Data Safe Online.”\nI’m a Disabled Veteran & I suppose when I posted the last time it got moderated…..but all of us Veterans need to think about all of the Employees @ DVA & thier Families that got walking papers and will not have a paycheck next month…..Really Sad for all involved…. Be Blessed\nMr. Collins…I very much liked your plain and to the point INTRO to believe! As DIS VET myself, it took me 11 years to convince the VA that a documented service connected disability was warranted coupled with my effort to have been massively complicated by attempting to do so via normal mail from an overseas location! I would like to see the VA promoting solid guidelines to the federal managers/selecting officials in the federal employment arena to consider job appointments for jobs applicable to qualified and certified 50% +, disabled VETs!!! Veteran preference is an absolute optional in my subjective opinion…as a Master’s degree holder, re-instatable federal candidate, TS security holder with 25 years+ experience, I quit applying for federal jobs after my 40th attempt!\nSome pretty harsh comments here. Gotta give Secretary Collins credit for not blocking them. But then maybe he didn’t see them, being busy as he must be talking up DOGE and Trump’s accomplishments so far, which can’t be impressive, considering they’ve only had a month to make a mess of things. Personally, I thought VA care improved a lot in the last couple of years, at least it did down here in the Texas coastal bend. Seems not all clinics and hospitals are run equally well. Mr. Secretary, I am sure you are a nice guy and want to give Vets the best care you can, but here’s the rub, your boss doesn’t seem to care much for Vets. Will he stay out of your hair?\nWhy would I believe this lying POS any more than I would believe bone spurs. The draft dodger said he will cut benefits in the V A, Social Security, and Medicare and he is doing it one by one with the help of that illegal immigrant musk. It’s just a matter of time. VA employees are being fired all over the country. They aren’t cutting fat, they’re cutting out the heart and soul of the V A and the country.\nThe “real truth” is my retired Army husband has oxygen tubes follow him around the house and is so disabled he never leaves the house. To get his 40% disability re-evaluated for an increase to 100% or at least 70% would require a 3 hour trip each way to Winston-Salem even though we are only 40 minutes from the Durham VAMC. He can’t even leave the house but a long trip is required. Retired Army were promised health care for life.\nThe last time we went to Durham VAMC he had to wait in the car for ten minutes because they ran out of wheelchairs. Civilian doctors say he needs a motorized wheelchair and home health care, but the home health care company needs orders from his VA physician and say his doctor doesn’t respond. I’ve called many times trying to get his physician to put in the orders. They say they relay messages but they never respond. It’s obviously due to cutbacks and poor organization since the last election.\nMr. Collin’s, you should be wearing a diaper on your chin for all the shit you are talking. They are cutting Veteran Employees who served in the military. If that is not a cut to the hard working veterans that served. You sir are just another Trump and Musk disappointment.\nAs a disabled Viet Nam war veteran, I have found the VA to be very good for all of the needs my condition requires. After discussions with the American Legion rep I found that many of the problems vets are having getting the care they need comes from failure to follow the rules in applying for and keeping up with the requirements of the VA. The other problem I see in all of these comments are the failures of the writers to show respect by making demands on others when they have not complied with the requirements properly. If you are confused or think it is too difficult, then contact your Legion rep and ask for assistance. Also, anyone who thinks that denigrating and disrespecting our President will help them, they are mistaken. Ask the Desert Storm vet who rode home on Trump’s plane whether they think he is not a good person.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Don!! There sure are a whole bunch of brainwashed, Communist CRYBABIES on here for the past couple of days, aren’t there??! I find it very hard to believe that most of them ever truly served our Republic in the United States military. If they really did, they sure aren’t displaying the characteristics one would expect from Warrior veterans!!\nNo cuts to VA staff or benefits? Unbelievable that our own Secretary is trying to have us believe this nonsense.\nI live in the Worcester, Mass. VA service area and was unable to see my Primary Care Physician on the two occasions I called for an appointment in the past 4 weeks. When I finally was able to reach someone in authority at the Worcester VA, that person explained that Worcester was experiencing sever Staff shortages and appointments for urgent care were being redirected to the ER’s in the area as well as commercial Urgent Care facilities. Ever try to get chronic disease related care at your neighborhood Urgent Care facility of ER? If you are near death due toa coronary issue or perhaps a stroke they are pretty good…but honestly they don’t really care about RSV or Sinusitis…both of which were misdiagnosed while I suffered with both for 4 weeks until I finally found a specialist through Community Care and was treated with antibiotics..cleared the sinusitis in two days. No reductions in VA care for Veterans? Nonsense…and shameful.\nSounds reassuring, seeing is believing.\nIt doesn’t matter where you go, you can’t escape chronic TDS. And frankly I’m beyond sick & tired of those more ons. It’s only the bottom of the first inning yet they’re already predicting the game is lost. Go away, PLEASE.\nI am glad to have seen the time come when veterans that have served this country get the care and benefits that they deserve and have been promised for years. The VA system is broken and needs restructure. Put administrators and department heads on a fixed salary that is appropriate to their skills, and expertise. Do away with the bonus system of saving money for the VA. Remember the VA is supposed to serve the veteran. It should not be about administrators and department heads withholding services and medical supplies to the veteran in the name of saving money and getting a bonus for themselves.\nDoctors and practitioner’s need not be sitting at their desk looking at the clock when the veteran is their to be treated. If additional medical staff needs to be hired, hire them. Spend some of that money that normally goes in the pockets of administrators and department heads in the name of boniness’s, in the name of money saved and cost reduction\nMake the system of filing for disability more efficient and in a timely manner instead of just “rubber stamping” denied to his or hers claim hoping that they will get discouraged and go away. Or even just die.\nOne other item that is important to me and most veterans i am acquainted with, is the prescribed drug program. If the veteran needs a particular drug made by a particular pharmaceutical company, prescribe that drug to him or her. Don’t prescribe a lesser quality drug instead. Which I have experienced personally. And address the issue of having the veteran pay for drugs, or even a portion of the cost. Remember the veteran has written a check to the Government that has no expiration date or amount on it. Giving his or her life for this country. What I have stated here are situations I have personally experienced and true to my knowledge.\nSo I would ask that the new head of the Veterans Administration, being a veteran himself, take these comments by this veteran into his consideration.\nYeah, no, the DOGE team shouldn’t have access to anything. To lie and claim they do not have access to the health records is laughable. They have access to our records. Also, they made sure the VA is an unsafe environment for LGBTQ veterans.\nGod bless you Sir, and God bless President Trump too. Clean it up please. Too many of my brothers and sisters have been waiting far too long for adequate physical rehabilition and/or adequate medical care. The disability review and decision process needs to be examined for more efficiency no doubt as well. Thank you Sir.\nLying puppet of the administration. Get bent, tool!\nThere is a reason he releases videos through youtube, and that is to circumvent actual reporters who might call out his blatant lying.\nI am sorry but when they fire the people that are in charge of our nuclear weapons and struggle to find them to hire them back is not a media problem. It doesn’t take a genius to know that if you are firing thousands in days you are not putting much thought in what you are doing. When you are telling people they are being fired for performance issues and your supervisor is telling you that is not why you are being fired. It creates a problem. There has been no time for performance issues to be evaluated on thousands of people. It’s not what DOGE is doing, it’s how. You people at the top will never get it. Thanks for trying to quell our fears but I am not feeling quelled.\nI see mostly sour grapes coming from what i believe to be disgruntled democrats. As far as I am concerned the VA is a god send for myself and vets who can still think for themselves and not be one of the bleating sheep who drank the joe and kalama kool aid\nAnything will be an improvement. My 95 year old mom has been waiting to see if she can get Aid and Attendance in Virginia since last March. Supposedly you expedite claims for those over 85 yrs old., if this is the fast track, lord help those younger. I guess you are hoping she will die first.\nHi, Betty. Thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nSirs:\nAfter reading all the comments…I am a 30 year retired CWO4 with several Agent Orange related issues. Now, I see\nall the comments…And I “KNOW!” of many, many veterans who VOTED FOR TRUMP. I said, this guy, with his\nrecord and his philandering….his treatment of General MILLY, his treatment of General H.R. McMaster (A roommate\nof my son at West Point)…\nNow you’re pissed off……I had a four year AF Airman First Class….who wanted all the Mexican kick out….He who\nworked with many Latinos…Voted for Trump!!\nSO YOU VETERANS…WHO WORE THE MAGA TO THE VA FOR TREATMENT!! Now suck it down……….\nCan’t cut what they don’t give. Veterans are not taken care of\nI do not DOGE anywhere near any of my information in the VA database. Doge is not House or Senate appointed or established entity and Elon Musk is not an elected official with legal rights and responsibilities for any of the actions he has been undertaking.\nIrene A. Abels, CDR, USNR, Ret\ni would rather you be focused on HELPING the veterans. not pushing your own numbers….\nIts why i am continually failing to recieve proper treatment, with BLOOD IN MY STOOL, and BLOOD IN THROW UP. Yet its not worthy enough to help a 100% disabled vet\nno…. no…… Cases. cases. cases. number number number\nMark my words……………….. I will die from this illness from lack of treatment, and then my autopsy and written testament will be plastered all across the country\nHi, Jared. If you’re having a medical emergency, please call 911. Please know that we’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nSay what you like, trump does not care what you think. Its going to take Congress to stop these cuts they are all to spineless to do their jobs but even if they took trump to the Supreme Court we all already know what the Supreme Court thinks too.\nThis is Trump’s agenda for the VA…\nTo revamp the Department of Veterans of Affairs with proposals to increase privatization, narrow the eligibility criteria for health benefits and replace civil service-style employees with political appointees in its ranks. – he basically wants to make money off denying care. Kinda like united health (whose CEO was recently gunned down) And to turn the VA into an extension of MAGA.. as in hire January 6er’s instead of career civil servants..\nThank you for looking out for veterans and their families and caregivers. I have been taking care of my 100% disabled vet since 1999. In 2000 he had a major stroke. During the next 20 plus years, hip replacements, open heart surgery and now suffering from dementia, parkinsonism, diabetes. I gave up my retirement money to help raise our children and in down payment for our home. He volunteered at an adult day care where he was placed to recover from the stroke until the last few years. The only retirement I have is Social Security and a small one from Wells Fargo. I just learned of the caregiver program about a year ago where I was able to get the stipend. My husband collapsed in our living room last December–heart failure–he is now in a nursing home (not a very nice one–none want to contract with the VA cause they do not pay enough). I now have to make a 40 mile trip (one way) to visit him. 3rd UTI and hospitalization since being there. Wehn he passes away, his disability pay from the VA and SS will be taken away along with the stipend. I will then have to apply for survivor benefit–which is not even half of his disability pay. In addition, last March he was diagnosed with arterial dementia and the VA supplied a wheelchair and walker. I knew I would be responsible for hauling him to appointments etc….and my 2006 vehicle was too small–so I purchased a 2020 vehicle that had more room. Now I am left with not even half the income and car and house payment (yes we purchased a different home as stairs in our split entry were too hard for him–so we got a rambler). I wish they would eliminate the survivor benefit for those married to vets long term and just let them at least keep the disability pay–sort of a retirement plan for caregivers. I hope you will consider this. It has been a difficult road for us.\nThe VA has been good to me. I have a good doctor from India. A concrete truck hit me from behind and I got surgery to correct a hernia. I fell 19 feet and cracked ribs and had a collapsed lung…the VA paid for the hospital and treatments. I would have been 5 figures in debt to the hospital if I didn’t have VA benefit. I consider myself lucky, most people have to pay horrendous amounts of money on insurance, and for the many things their insurance company refused to cover. I did complain when I first got into the VA because it takes so long for appointments, but I changed my tune when the VA stepped up to cover my emergencies.\nThank you, I think we all need to hear the real truth and not rumors. The main sream media likes to spead rumors just to get everybody all worked up. Again thank you and the VA to taking care of us Veterans. And I would like to send a BIG THANK YOU out to all those employees that are taking care of us, they are always courteous and caring to us.\nI and many others appreciate the efforts of ALL within the VA that strive to assist veterans. Thank you to ALL within the VA doing so much to help us in many ways!!!\nI don’t trust anything you say.\nComing from the state that you used to represent, I find you to be a very partisan politician.\nAs VA Secretary, I was hoping to hear something out of your mouth that didn’t sound like we are stupid and not smart enough to research facts. Instead we got a political soundbite.\nTime will tell what happens to us all.\nThe doctors at the VA Medical Center in Birmingham, AL said that they are worried – they’re hearing that VA Centers are going to be closed and many doctors and nurses are going to lose their jobs. Also, I have confidence that President Trump will keep his promise. The Biden admin gave VA money allotted them by the federal gov’t to Mayorkas to use for illegals. Our SS money has also been used for illegals. If people are given checks because DOGE has found fraud and abuse, then please give the same to our veterans. Social Security was in a private trust acct until Pres. Johnson used it for the Vietnam War – it continues to be in the general fund and is being used for anything they want. It’s so amazing how the Biden admin ignored any laws they didn’t like and broke them. Also, those who are slamming Pres. Trump for not being in the military – neither was Obama or Kamala Harris. I didn’t hear anyone saying anything negative about them – at all. President Trump will make this country operate as it should – he’s a business man who knows exactly how things should be done – fraud and abuse of taxpayer money isn’t going to fly with him.\nSo far I have been shown NO reason to believe we vets will not be targeted. Especially the disabled. There are changes that really need to be made. Start with Congress and their leadership abilities, moral and financial. I expect this will be be deleted.\nTo those pushing the “Leave a comment” conspiracy theories…the majority of negative comments are real and heartfelt. Veterans and retirees have always felt as if they were battling to obtain healthcare, especially for service connected conditions. They support system has perpetually lagged behind our nation’s desire for a capable and forward deployed military. It is not the general fault of an existing or prior administration. However, and with emphasis, there has never been an internal assault on our military operations and support systems as we have witnessed in the past couple months. I wont delve into the detrimental effects on other Federal entities…but they are all connected. VA healthcare is being negatively impacted, and political mouthpiece gaslighting cannot allay our concerns.\nYou get what you vote for…just dont complain about it after the fact.\nPlease add dental care to the Care in the Community program. Delta Dental insurance costs over $53.00 per month and offers only partial coverage for fillings, crowns and bridges. The VA does not offer dental care except for rare service related problems. I know veterans that avoid social interactions because of the poor quality of their teeth. Thanks.\nYou wrote: “Secty. Collins said. ‘In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.'”\n“He went on to emphasize that the Veterans Benefits Administration is clearing cases faster than ever and that VA remains mission-focused by doing what it is supposed to do.”\nGood, but not good enough. At a regional VA medical center town hall this week too many veterans complained of delay and inaction on their cases. My personal experience is PACT Act claims procedures need improvement. This was affirmed in Congress with proposed legislation last session to additionally resource VA claims processing but it was not fully voted on. There are too many processing errors due faulty procedures and rework is 3x as costly as getting it right the first time. Clearing a case is not a measure of success when the final disposition is incorrect.\nThat’s great thanks. But I think it is somewhat over-kill. There are a lot of problems and I am not happy with the VA, so many things I won’t even get into here.\nMy biggest concern though is and has been Why I have zero Dental coverage.\nThe other issues will work themselves out in the coming years.\nThank You\nAnd President Donald J Trump\nGod Bless\nI just don’t believe him. The 20 somethings with no military background will cut as they see fit and whether on purpose or accidentally benefits/services will be reduced. Will sooner rather than later. It will come like a thief in the night but be assured it will happen. If they can fire leadership, cutting services will occur. When your benefits are delay remember his comments.\nI have been at the VA 3 times since the election everyone is positive and looking for bigger and better. Doug Collin’s has been the head of the VA for what three weeks and he has communicated to the Veteran twice . I can’t even tell you who led prior … I have been involved with the VA since I got out of the Army in 1971…. I have good stories and HORROR stories … So let’s look for success\nYou talk the talk, NOW WALK THE WALK\nCome on my fellow VETERANS, how about giving the new SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS the opportunity to prove what he has said. Before you get on my case, I was drafted on Jan 17,1966 and sent to South Vietnam on Dec. 1, 1966.\nWhile there I went hospital twice. First time had a hernia the size of an ostrich egg. Second time,malaria two other tropical deseases, worms, and my temp hit 104.9 degrees. The only thing I currently qualify for is PTSD @70%.\nI also meet those other listed requirements, but have been denied compensation for them.\nThe VA DOESN’T DO THE INITIAL EXAMINATION OF CLAIMS ,THEY USE DOCTORS GROUPED UNDER THE VETERANS EVALUATION SERVICES! A doctor in Maryland decided that I didn’t meet the VA ‘s standards! I LIVE IN LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY , I HAD NO INTERACTION WITH SAID DOCTOR!\nNot Sure I can believe this. The present administration is fire-bombing most federal offices with major firings and layoffs across the board, including at least 1,000 in the Veteran’s Administration. I contacted my local VA Medial Center’s administrative office to ask about buyouts affecting staffing levels in the VA healthcare system and was told that, while buyouts were offered, medical staff was exempt and could not take advantage of the buyout. Still not sure how support staff, administrative staffing, etc. would be affected. The person I talked to said that there were still questions, particularly about any future actions. I guess we will have to wait and see what the future of VA medical care will look like. As a Vietnam Vet on disability, I am very concerned and this Rah, Rah speech didn’t do much to ease my mind.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them [Musk’s DOGE team] to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans, …”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what to look for, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. Your existing VA OIG team, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the internal and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices; that is what you are looking for. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with little experience in the processes and practices involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash a system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better. You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote.\nThank you!!\nI have a tough time understanding all the comments regarding mistreatment by the VA. I am USAF Veteran in the upper Midwest, I have nothing but good to say about the treatment I have received. It’s either me or just there are different VA’s out there. I am more than please with the VA. Thank you…keep it up!\nThanks Doug\nVETERNS NEED HELP WITH VA AND COMPENSATION- VETERN GOES TO IRAQ 2004-2005 ATTACHED TO 1ST ID QUARTER CALVES AT FOB MACKENZIE COMES HOME HAS A WIDOW MAKER AT 47 ANOTHER HEART ATTACK A MAJOR STROKE A SEIZURE BUT THE VA CAN NOT HELP HIM VA CAN NOT LINK ALL THIS TOGETHER. VETERN HAS NOT WORKED OVER A YEAR BECAUSE HIS CONDITION BURN PIT OINLY GETS 10% A JOKE EXPLAIN TO THIS VETERN WHY NO HELP VA SERVICE OFFICER WITH CLAIMS QUOTE THE BS RULES AN REGULATIONS VA SAYS NOT SERVICE CONNECTED VETERN NATIONAL GUARD FILES FOR PTSD VA CLAIMS TOLD HIM HE WAS NATIONAL GUARD DID NOT QUALFI FOR PTSD WHY\nThis is the classic Republican response when they want to cut spending:\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ”\nAnd yet, it is Republican run government programs where fraud, waste and abuse exist!\nFor instance, Republican supporters on this forum claim that fraud, waste and abuse exist evidently in the VA!! So OK you folks, can you point out anything you have seen or found in the VA system that is fraudulent, waste or abuse? I want facts baby and not your assumptions! My VAMC is great and takes care of all of my health problems. Hardly if ever had any problems with their servicing me! It seems that every Republican administration-Congress always tries ways to cut spending from the VA! Any anytime budget considerations come up VA funding-wise, they find excuses to vote against them. In reality, the VA medical system would not exist if not for Democrats!\nAnd please don’t give me this all liberals are communist bull! With Trump basically in bed with Putin, Xi and Kim Un, you know how he says he has love affairs with them, well–face it–they are all real communists. And anyone here who supports Putin and Russia (really still the Soviet Union) is in fact a communist or a communist sympathizer! And right now, its Republicans who fall into the communist category! It is the Republican party that does not want free and fair elections and supports a wanna be autocratic dictator in Trump! Trump has always said he wants to rule like Putin, and he sure as heck is trying really hard to do so!\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ” Hmm.\nI would like to see the exact cases made for each fired VA member accuse of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. These employees need to be given the facts rather than the opinion of DOGE or the president. Did they provide specific incidences or just told them you loss because we suspect you of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. Where is the Due Process within the Constitution that Trump himself applied to himself?\nThe Fraud part is at the top, with the person who got the due process and was guilty of Fraud. It is his second nature. To commit fraud is to lie. Therefore, Trump is a proven liar, and he will lie about his lie, like the Big Lie he did not lost to Biden.\nDoug Collins, prove Daft-Dodger Trump is not a liar. Prove to us that you served in the military and actually care for the disabled veterans. It is on you. If you do not respond here, then you show your lack of respect for people who served in the military., and people will not trust you.\nYeah? And trump said Medicaid wouldn’t be touched hours before endorsing a house plan to gut medicaid.\nI sure hope you’re willing to fight for this nation’s veterans Mr. Collins.\nHopefully, but time will tell. For those concerned with their information… really? Come on, your on the Internet answering this message and more than likely on social media, your information has been bought and sold long before DOGE had anything to do with it. The Patriot Act guaranteed that. Google and Meta are the ones you need to be concerned with.\nThe malpractice this administration is going to commit and the expense of veterans do to extreme incompetence and narcissism is going to be devastating and you, sir, are complicit and will be held accountable.\nWas this message put out before or after they decided to cut 1000 employees at the VA Administration..?? The date is the same.\nI, for one, am so glad that Doug is at the helm. Right man for the job, in my books.\nMr. Collins, please take a moment and actually listen to the people that are doing the job in C&P and see how it can be improved. There is still a backlog, these workers just got off mandatory overtime due to reduced backlog. Now with the firing/buyout there is a known fear that they will experience another backlog. Because whom is going to do the jobs of those people you let go? Then when those persons that are left to cover their work and those who left, and fall behind, then they are in fear of getting put on PIP and losing their job! The PTSD/Anxiety associated with helping veterans as a many are veterans of not knowing if you are getting a letter for firing, is unfair to those whom serve to serve others. THE BACKLOG IS NOT CAUGHT UP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE AND THEY SAID THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Someone is fudging numbers!\nPlease listen to those persons who are doing the job, not the GS 14s and up, heck too many of them!!! if 19, 20 years olds can work for DOGE, clearly you can listen to the GS 12s and below. Heck, I have a few names to improve the processing!\nWhile you are at it, can we get 2 increases a year, or 5% will truly assist us!! TOO MANY Chiefs at the VA and that is a fact jack!! too many petty managers that will fire hard workers because NOW they can for their own personal agendas.\nNo one should be allowed to touch veterans benefits or to privatize the VA hospital. It’s quite alarming that the two people who wants to cut our benefits never served in the military.\nDon’t believe you.\nI won’t file a claim because of the Hassel I have to go through, I’m a Vietnam Vet and desert shield Veteran, Please cut all the red tape.\nIf there are ANY interruptions to my benefits, Doug Collins, I will hold you personally responsible. There will be no explanation that will satisfy. Cooperation with DOGE is all the proof I need to know who to blame. And I think I speak for many Veterans when I say, “The only thing I have left to lose is my benefits.”\nI’m excited that the President and Mr Collins are working together. I believe what Mr Collins stated. We have enough negative comments coming from the Democrats and the fake Media. They lie with no shame. President Trump is the best President in my lifetime and I served under President Nixon. Great things are going to happen in President Trumps watch.\nSecretary Collins,\nWith all due respect the VA needs to decentralize it’s VA Hospital management. Directors should be free to make whatever changes they feel need to be made without having to check with their boss who has to check with his boss. As a 20+ year volunteer and patient I have witnessed first hands this absurdity. Let managers manage and if they cannot, counsel, retrain and if necessary fire.\nPLEASE REMOVE THE PHRASE BELOW FROM THE HIRING PROCESS. This statement is embedded into every Veteran’s healthcare job posting.\nPursuant to VHA Directive 1193.01, VHA health care personnel (HCP) are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 subject to such accommodations as required by law (i.e., medical, religious or pregnancy). VHA HCPs do not include remote workers who only infrequently enter VHA locations. If selected, you will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and submit documentation of proof of vaccination before your start date. The agency will provide additional information regarding what information or documentation will be needed and how you can request a legally required accommodation from this requirement using the reasonable accommodation process.\nAnnouncement #: CBTA-12690744-25-MTS\nThank you.\ni am a vietnam veteran and very happy to see the changes being directed to more services for our veterans 58,000 of my brothers sacrificed on that battle field they deserve the benefits they have for us it has been a long fight but it was woth it for the soldier who tookhis life at the trump tower was sending a clear message we need more or better services my prayers and thoughts go his family\nOkay, Please ‘listen’ to his statement. “Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut.” Maybe; but where they are going to slice and dice the VA, is reduction in VSRs, ratings staff for compensation, medical staff, hospitals and clinics. DOGE is looking for the “waste” in gov’t contracts, e.g., assistance with transportation, cuts or elimination of travel pay, costs shares will skyrocket up for medical needs, and we will pay for it out of OUR own pockets.\nMr. Secretary,\nI aske for proof VA appointment would not take longer to make. You did not respond.\nI asked you to guarantee VA and Social Security would not be lost on a dollar for dollar ratio as Pres. Trump attempted in his last term. You did not respond.\nI asked you to ask the president to promise VA health care, disability and social Security would not be negatively affected. You did not respond.\nI asked you to respond to all comments listed here on this page. You did not respond to my comment, did you respond to others?\nI asked you to not affect to retribution for these complaints on this site. You did not respond to me.\nI can only believe everyone comments will be used to lower all health care and disabilities from veteran complainers on this site. You collected our names.\nAs the president wanted to publish the name of anyone involved with the Jan 6 investigations, are you collecting name for retribution?\nPlease respond to each complaint and suggestion listed here. Assure VA will not be affected and the disabled veterans here will not be negatively affected. Ask the president to promise us. Until then, faith in you is not real. The news uses facts (except Fox uses hearsays). The president and staff uses innuendoes and hearsay, with lies.\nBe not one of these and protect disabled veterans and assure us what you are doing is authentic. Get the president to promise us. You promise us. You respond to all complaints positively. Or faith in you is not real.\nThere are 1679 comments on this site at the time of this comment. None show a response from you. Are you listening or is this a waste of time to you? I can only expect the worse since you wont truly assure us disabled veterans.\nNo response from Doug Collins yet.\nFirst, Mr. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. YOU ARE AWESOM, Thank you for taking on this responsibility, and We notice alreay a HUGE difference in Improvement since President Trump took office, and with you there.\nI’m also a consultant, and noticed a Lot of waste with paper being used and sent with Prescriptions. Rather than sending us Lots of paper that adds to the weight of postage, how about allowing us to just go onlinie since that info is already there.\nYou sound like a political hack!!!\nHow is cutting the VA workforce going to help us vets? The answer is IT IS NOT!\nLess people doing more work does not equal better care!\nDo your actual job – Serving us Vets & not Trump or DOGE.\nAre you trying to reassure us or go on a rant about the “media”? Very unprofessional and NOT reassuring.\nThey have a lot of political propagandalists in this forum. They only believe what they hear from others. The hackers only want to find out who is draining the coffers,If you are one then, you have a reason to bitch. If not then all the years in the military should have weaned you from the political tit and shit show. Its always been a SNAFU and until they let someone get it right it will be the same. The demo/socialists destroyed, piledged and stole from the US coffers and person that dont need your money are trying to fix it. Most of the persons on the cabinet are ex patriots or rich enough to not get paid for their service. Why the hell would they do that for US? I dont feel its a gainful reason to eliminate waste from a government that taxes the shit out of you, no matter how much money you make.\nI’m reading a lot of complaining, as usual. So let me say this. For YEARS, I have received VERY GOOD overall healthcare from my local VA. It’s much better care than civilian insurance plans that I’ve had in the past. ALL personnel have been nothing but pleasant and helpful during all of my visits. Thank you, VA.\nHaving endured pay delays and other suffering due to political budget shenanigans, it is hard to believe that DOGE led by an unelected official with no public accountability interference in VA management will benefit veterans. For decades Republicans and their wealthy supports have sought to privatize or deregulate government affairs to the detriment of the military, veterans, and the public.\nIts an awesome team that the greatest president of the US history has put together to gitter done. I really hope its not just another fight between political opposition.\nWas at the CBOC in Cottonwood,AZ and the picture of our President Trump was not up either, I see this may be happening across the country.\nI have told all of my Veterans that the Pact Act had no money behind it, as anyone that met the requirements the VA gave 0 % which means no compensation but they would take care of you medically. That is all it was good for.\nI have been a volunteer Accredited Claims Agent/ VSO for over 20 years. the biggest problem I think will save funds and a few trees is in the mailing. When I become a POA for a Veteran, I file the documents and when there is a decision or letter that needs to go to the Veteran, It is also in his electronic file that the Claims Agent can see in VBMS system. BUT, the VA sends a letter to the Veteran and to the VSO/Claims Agent/ Attorney who ever the POA is. This is not necessary as the VSO has it in front of them on the computer. Thousands and thousands if not millions of these secondary letters are sent for no reason.\nMaybe this will save a lot of funds and the eqrth.\nYOU CAN NOT BE CARING FOR VETS IF YOU LET A BONE SPUR COMMANDER IN CHEIF AND HIS hERMAN gOERIENG PARTNER RUN THE AXE OVER YOU YOU NEED TO STAND UP FOR VETERANS AS THEY ARENOT. OR ARE YOU IN LINE WITH HIS GOALS TO PUNISH US TO PAY FOR HIS TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH????\nThanks for the RIGHT information.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what they seek, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. They, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the working and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with very little experience in the processes involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash the system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better. You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote.\nI called the phone number and a very nice young man named Kent took my suggestion and said he would pass along. Thank you Kent\n“clearing cases quicker then ever” yeah by denying them! waited 5 years for my cancer claim to be denied!\nglad i was hit with DU, got cancer and having the VA at least pay for my treatments….\nI am not sure I believe you. We have heard too many times that this won’t happen or that won’t happen in other areas and then jobs are cut. I also know President Trump has always wanted to privatize services, including Veterans Health Services. One stop shopping and home and community-based services streamline veterans’ health services by consolidating them into one facility. You and President Trump should pay a visit to the Veterans Administration and Hospital in Kansas City, MO. It is efficient, wait times to get services and in to see medical providers are optimum, we are treated with respect, always thanked for our services, and get good mental health and physical care. Contractors and sub-contractors are currently providing jobs to over 100 workers to build an annex to move all the administrative staff from downtown KC to the new location upon its completion. The VA has already seen cuts and there has been a hiring freeze for six years. Veterans cannot afford to have to go to various doctors and specialists in the community as many cannot, or do not drive and Medicare premiums would be costly.\nWho is to find “things we need to get rid of”? I feel certain that it is not a Veteran and if they are do they get their care through VA? I doubt it on both counts. How about you do something radical and ask those who go to the VA for what is and is not helpful. Do not just chose by cost and money, the way the current crew works, it’s all about money, ande them having it, not those who need it. May our democracy, country and VA survive.\nYea, right, after 40,000 lies from dump you want me to believe that a man appointed by a draft dodging traitor is looking out for my best interest. Bullshit.\nWhy is it taking so long to get disabilities evaluated?\nThe gulf war veterans need the VA Secretary Collins help in our quest. 2-21-2025 2;40 pm\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So, CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo, it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\nThe gulf war veterans need an open-door policy to act on our serious health issues.\nThe Whitehouse hotline and the VA-IG system doesn’t work unless Secretary Collins fixes the complaints system.\nA fast food chain and the health care system for veterans have absolutely 0 in common. It is insulting that the people that choose to care for us as veterans medically are now without jobs, ways to support their families and themselves. As us veterans individually, has any of the actions taken in the last 31 days helped any of us. Ask us. Because when you ask us, you will receive a truthful answer of you are making our healthcare worse, not better. Also a large demographic of employees that you improperly and unjustly fired, are Veterans themselves. You make no sense. You don’t care about us veterans. You make short videos saying nothing. You answer no questions. Show data. Show documentation. Your words mean nothing. Where is the proof to back up your false claims? Where are the receipts? Down right disrespectful. A spit in all of the faces of veterans. Shame on you.\nYea, like we are supposed teo believe you. Retired back in 2008, and still fighting to get benefits that I earned. Why am I having to fight for it? I met all the qualifications for the pact act, had Lymphoma, been to the places listed, and still got denied. PACT act is a crock of lies that the dems made to make it look like they care for veterans when the fact is they don’t, nor do the republicans. Have back issues that I have had ever since I retired, and well, because I never went on sick call for back problems, they didn’t service connect it. Guess it was nice of my back to wait til the week after I retired to start having issues. And those commenting well it takes time, yea I know it takes some time, but, how is it when they send you correspondence, they give you a week to have the proof sent to them or all the sudden they can give you a decision in a short amount of time.\nDear Hank: If you look back you will see that it has always been the Republicans at the White House always hinting at cutting our benefits and Social Security for the elderly. Trump and Elon are Republicans. Also, you might want to try a different avenue of applying for your benefits. I went through a VSO after being denied, while other went through other agencies that try to help veterans get what they deserve without a fee. Some even got lawyers. If you ever complained about your back to a fellow soldier or if they witness an event that probably caused the problem, you can get witness statement from them stating what they saw or heard. Good luck and don’t give up.\nHank, why are you blaming the current admin?? get help resubmitting you request!\nGary\nWhen I was having troubles like yours I went to the American legion. They will help fill out the paperwork and send it to the proper persons. They also have personnel embedded in the va to hurry the process along. Give them a shot they have come through for me several times\nI know that is hard, but it there is a reason I always told me Soldiers, no matter what, go to sick call. I can’t blame the VA for their choice when in fact there is no documents in your records. My bother had the same issue with his knee, never got it looked at, and the VA said nope. Your best bet, is to get letters from people you served with that can contest to your back issues.\nThat’s your problem. To get benefits, your problems HAVE to be service-connected.\nWell let’s see if this comment gets totally censored out like my first two. Under the guise of moderation.\nRetired in 93, finally got a 10% rating last fall. Now I get a small check monthly, oh, but same amount is taken out of my retirement, so potentially I get to maybe save on taxes. Over the years I have known many others who did get disability, strangely, none were retirees, another significant %, well if I comment it would be falsely attacked as lifestyle prejudiced.\nPACT seemed a no brainer. After all my initial claims except 1 were denied, further checking revealed all the denials were done without any medical records, no recognition of RVN service. i had to even get and file copies of all my DD214’s and they still got my periods of service wrong.\nPlease, some improvement definitely needed.\nI would love to believe your comments, but looking at the current administrations ability to speak out of both sides of their mouth, and past/current actions I want to see it before I believe it.\nLet’s talk about cuts or better yet severing an established service connection due to glaring VA errors. Service connection for my sinus cancer was granted and then summarily severed due to the VA erroneously asking provider after provider for an opinion for “skin” cancer rather than my sinus cancer. DBQ Derm does not allow for a positive opinion on a sinus or any other respiratory cancer and as a result my service connection was severed then eventually restored after one provider pushed back stating she could not provide her opinion for a sinus cancer on a DBQ Derm however even though I have clawed my way back to even 100% now I am still waiting for the VA to recognize that my dental issues due to radiation damage that I claimed in October of 2020 are service connected. Cutting out the errors that result in such awful decisions will go a long way to providing better care for all veterans\nIn plain English, does this mean that DOGE has access to my personal health records? If so, I demand access to all the members of DOGE personal records and even Trumpy. They can’t have it both ways.\nI want to know as well. What information are you, Doug, giving them?\nI want to see President Trumps picture hanging on the wall at my VA center in Mobile, Al. It is unacceptable that it’s not up yet. They said they ordered the pictures jan 22,2025… Why?? He was nominated President Nov. 5th. No accuses. I am very upset. Please make that happen yesterday. Thank you\nI’m sure you are looking for his recently released “Long Live the King” photo… We took an oath to the constitution , not some jerk who thinks he can be a king.\nI’ll vote for that.\nDefinitely, should have been waiting in the wings.\nBro, Please re-read your statement. a) it took about two months before Biden’s photo went up. b) “He”, was nominated in July (or August), and elected (won) the presidency on Nov 5. Your putz is getting his face all over the VA soon… sadly.\nThat’s your big concern? Laughable.\nI was at my local VA Office this week. It was a relief not to see his disgusting picture there.\nYou are among the dumbest people on the planet. You are triggered but silly stuff and spend your time online crying about nonsense. Grow up and read a book someday?\nYou Go Mike!!! Let Us know when that happens…\n“No accuses” people are worried about their benefits, they are worried that the government is not holding up their end of the bargain.. and you are upset about King Trumpy’s portrait?\nI totally agree with you\nIs that going to make him more of a president than he already is. Get over it.\nHis picture is hanging in the bathroom.\nYou wont have to worry about anyone’s picture in any office. President musk is closing down all the V A offices in the country. You’re lucky that’s your biggest problem. Most of us have more important shit to worry about.\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nFellow veterans, read up on the Bonus Army. (https://department.va.gov/history/100-objects/object-21-bonus-army/)\nTrump and his cronies do not support us, and will do all they can to destroy our military. Here’s what he just did to our top military leadership: https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-fires-the-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-fd4a4d07\nStand up and speak out against Trump’s attempt to destroy democracy, Americans.\nYou and Trump are NOT to be believed…you are just one of his sycophant lapdogs who will do ONLY what is directly approved by Trump, his number one Lapdog-e Musk. Trump and Musk will cut our services and those in the VA who provide it. You will only respond by regurgitating whatever talking points provided to you.\nAsk Donnie T. how goes his famous heel spur that his daddy used to keep him away from military service. After all, according to Donnie T.’s own words that we–those who served are “suckers” and “losers”.\nNOTE Also: Musk is a native South African and immigrant who would not know the first thing about military service, where country comes before self.\nSpread your hate elsewhere! New admin takes time to sort out the mistakes of the previous administration!\nGary\nUSN Ret\nYour ignorance is absolutely breathtaking.\nI have set and read many of the comments and I think it’s hilarious that many of the comments are about having access to your private information. There is no way that you can so naive as to think you have any private information. All private information went away with the invention of the computer and the internet. probably 85% of you use your cell phone for transactions pertaining to money or with all of the little apps installed i.e. Tick Tock which pulls every bit of information off of your phone and sends it to China. the United States is constantly participating in conflict somewhere weather it’s on the news or not. I’m not saying it’s a perfect system but the Politicians that we have and continue to vote into office have done absolutely nothing for more than 50 years while becoming multi-Millionaires on a little more than average salary which the receive for life as well as medical benefits. so, for those complaining about Trumps administration after a month, Go call you Representative (if they’re not out in the street whining and singing like first graders) and ask them why they haven’t worked on this stuff. I spent almost 23 yrs in and have been through 19 surgeries, so I have earned the right to call you out.\nAt the risk of getting on a MAGA-DOGE future revenge list, as a disabled veteran I have to say that this disgusted me. It was purely partisan political apologetics. The “media up here” that he dismisses is doing its job of the Fourth Estate being a watchdog on government actions, and that’s why he has to be defensive. His boss doesn’t care about veterans, having repeatedly and publicly made it clear that he thinks service people who are maimed or killed or POW are suckers and chumps. And this guy should be fired for letting Musk and his DOGE minions into our data: I gave the VA permission to maintain my health care information for its use, I didn’t give it permission to reveal it to an unelected band of idiot thugs to mine. Maybe we were chumps to serve instead of paying quack doctors to certify “bone spurs.”\nMan you really need an attetude check. This news is all old false unfactual garbage.\nThe media were often proved right. While most media are probably biased, so are … who? Trump? DOGE? Absolutely! Cost cutting eliminates potential wasted spending on “loser” POWs and war-injured veterans. (quoting Trump). Sadly, we may all suffer in the end. I heard required follow-ups for suicidal veterans are delayed, sometimes by weeks or months. I’m sure there is waste potential everywhere, but let’s not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Trimming waste is hard work and takes time.\nI’m an army veteran ( peace time). I do have service connection for tinnitus and kidney cancer. Loma Linda VA saved my life. A doctor at Loma Linda said I was cancer-free. I sold my house. I moved to a new state. 6 months later I found out I had blood cancer through a biopsy from the El Paso VA. That was 3 years ago. Zero treatment for my cancer. Zero medication. All my pact act disability claims have been denied by someone in Waco Texas. I live in New Mexico. Oh yeah I’m a retired California state firefighter and EMT. Obviously these knuckleheads are retaliating against me, so I will never receive any of my VA benefits earned. I had to go out and pay for medical insurance just to get sleep medication. I have numerous medical issues and I will never even ask for help from the VA ever again. VA is junk. I recommend the leadership team and doctors and nurses be removed from the El Paso VA medical system indefinitely. The Las Cruces cboc ran by the El Paso VA Medical center is horrible. The nurses there call it the “Sh*t show!” El Paso VA medical system along with the Albuquerque VA medical system has it been a disservice to this veteran since December 2021. I will testify to this any day of the week.\nWritten by an army Cav Scout and retired Cal Fire firefighter and EMT.\nDid you think it’s the VA staff that gets bonuses for turn you down. Here in AL the head of VA disability service was fired a phew years ago because he received a bonuses for the longer wait time. Took 10yrs to get mine, it was in my medical record in black & white. Like you I went 1 1/2 years with cancer my first time before any thing was done. Now just yesterday was dx for my 4 round. Good luck\nHi, Jared. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWhy is this war hero a POW OF THE VA ADMINISTRATION?\nI know Mr. President Trump cares about very much, and is extremely busy cleaning up ( “finally” ) the mess. I’m hoping you free me so i don’t have to bother him.\nIt’s called being in “Lockstep”, to be in complete agreement or to conform with someone or something else; whether or not it is right or wrong. Did you hear how Virginia is going to financially assist those in their state who have been canned by Trump? It’s NOT the state, rather, it’s TAXPAYERS who are going to have to swallow this! That is, THOSE WHO STILL HAVE JOBS!\nMr Secretary, how do veterans, veteran families and caregivers contact you directly with their concerns? I read the OMB new director Vought’s plans for veterans disabilities. Now I can not steep at night over the worry. Vought is no friend to veterans. I would like to believe you sir , but I am not letting my guard down..\nI don’t believe you, nor do i believe Trump. What i do believe is that you will do whatever it takes to deliver tax cuts for the rich and cut wherever you can to get the funds for those tax cuts.\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are intitled to feel any way you want. But as Secretary Doug Collins stated, the reality is what actaully happens, not what folks may think or feel.\nDoug Collins knows what he is doing and knows how to do the job of making the VA as lean and efficient as it can be. However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. I hope you have a blessed day.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nThanks for clearing that up. Hurray!!!\n“However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. ”\nThis applies to Trump and Musk and the rest of the 1% way more than to ANY veterans receiving benefits or federal employess or other hard working middle class Americans. I hope that what is stated here by Sec Collins is true and that veterans retain their benefits and support from the VA, but it’s hard to ignore what is happening every day and the stories I’m hearing from friends, federal workers and VA nurses being fired without cause. The disruption in people’s lives by all this is real and not positive for them or their families. Why should we believe that we’ll be safe when others are not?\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are entitled to feel any way you want. Secretary Collins, lied, because DOGE does have access to the medical records. He doesn’t know what he is doing because he has never ran an organization, let alone a government one. Last time we heard the words “Lean and efficient” a lot of veterans lost access to care. I guess you support that kind of thing though. Also, NO ONE IS TAKING advantaged of any funds that were allocated by CONGRESS. Love your gaslighting.\nFred,\nYou’ve been duped, pal. (Unless you’re lying on purpose. ?♂️)”Probationary” doesn’t mean “new”. A lot of skilled career employees – veterans included – are being summarily canned because the incoming regime wants to assert dictatorial power and give tax cuts to the rich. It’s not to benefit us, and there’s not even any way it *could*.\nTrump just called himself king! Wake up already. If you still hold to the Constitution we all swore to defend, then there is no excuse for you to be repeating this nonsense. The truth is out there, and the proof is a search query away.\nI appreciate the change from the new Secretary and look forward to the new concern for Vets. I am a vet, 80 years old and the only benefit I have used was when I bought my first home in 1973, I am fortunate.\nThey are looking to get rid of Medicaid funding. So, all vets with certain conditions living in elderly homes will not have the ability to pay and stay. A daughter of a vet suffering from alzheimer, whose home costs $16,000 a month, is scared for her dad. Medicaid pays 1/4 of the bill every month, and they can’t afford to take up the cost. There is no new concern for Vets. If you cut employees, all VA interactions will take longer.\n“I only used my benefits to purchase a home when they costed 10k, shame on other vets who need services. Only for me but not for thee”\nI completely agree, that is what his first term was all about, tax cuts for the rich. I wish some people would read ACTUAL news and NOT just your right wing echo chamber where you hear what putin wants you to. When will they realize ALL cult leaders are evil?\nWe are all just frogs in a pot now. Some of us can can feel how bad the situation is getting, and some of us will deny to the end that there’s anything wrong with Trump’s moves to consolidate power and remove all checks on that power. Putin’s Russia is his model, and we are heading that direction quickly. Surface level freedoms to preserve the charade is all we’ll be left with while the billionaires loot everything else.\nLike what Mr. Collins had to say, and I liked the way he said it. Direct and to the point in language you could understand. Not a lot of blah, blah, blah and say nothing.\nYes, very direct, but was it the truth?\nI Love it.\nSir,\nI’m attaching a picture of a woke hallway in St. Cloud VA\nDon’t know what woke is do you?\nWhat is “woke”? You explain that to me…is it so called ‘woke” because you don’t agree, or is it because something just might be true! I am a veteran just like everyone on this chat, I’ve this before just like many of you have but I guess depending on what side of the aisle you sit on will determine how you comment. Every chat always begins with the issues then it turns into a political blame game, or who is oh so great. Politicians are all about “self”, and people are perfectly fine with things that happen or don’t happen until it affects them, then it’s the other parties fault…aren’t you tired?\nAccording to the US Office of Personnel Management, military veterans made up about 30% of federal employees in 2021, and many of them had service-related disabilities.\nThis entire administration is complicit in mass firings of veterans. They don’t respect us. They don’t care for us. They don’t work for us.\nAll of you who believe they do and support them are guilty.\nIm sorry that many of you think this is twitter. One line commentary.\nYour going to turn VA off, and they want this. To make this location\nthe scape goat to shut down future channels.\nSome folks caught on and wrote there public letters to the Sec of VA.\nThat this is a public soap box. Others think a ugly or vulgar one liners\nis all that is needed. Those are the ones going to get us call cut off.\nDont blow your only chance to be heard other than knee jerk reactions and\nspew pointless remarks. There isnt anything else left and VA wants to\nshut this down too. So they claim people are rude, and so they can go\non ignoring us. Already trying this at the other sec post location.\nIf you have nothing, stand by some of these other people who wrote\nparagraphs of interesting materials. Show them some support. Reply to\nthem and show some form of unity.\nUnity on something, anything. All of you agreeing on one idea would\nchange everything. Not even a person, just the idea. Areas that could\nchange if you all said it together.\nCan go on 1 thousand one liners, or all of you saying one common idea\nat a time till VA deals with it. Vote as a group. Take charge. Get past the\npersonality part, focus on content. Something simple, super easy. Like\nopen door policy so you can be heard.\nVA wants to say it lost control here, dont let them. Its already showing at\nthe VA Secretary Doug Collins addresses Veterans benefits rumors in latest\nvideo. VA wants this quiet again, no problems. Silent hallways.\nRealize what is happening here. Censorship is already raising its ugly head.\nYeah…and our social security is safe too…President Musk will take his chain saw to all the benefits of Americans paying taxes, while the Manchurian Candidate Trump serves as the puppet!\nHistory has proven ithat if lies are told often enough, they become truth. SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!\nThis guy is lying to us.\nHe’s not to be trusted. Now he’s also looking at ways to privatize our care – in the false interest of “efficiency” – when in reality it’s all about shifting the money to private insurance where we know care-denials are rampant and 21% is siphoned directly off of the top for overhead,\nFor a guy who has been on the job about a week, I hope he really knows what he’s talking about. There is a lot at stake here: I’m in the process of qualifying for a lung transplant. My condition is slowly worsening and ANY interruption in services will put me at risk for the rest of my life, bothe pre- and post-operation. There are lots of reasons for being incredulous, especially since my sources aren’t just the media. We’re forced to ride this rollercoaster to the end and I really pray that everything works out well.\nAnd we all pray with ya brother at arms.\nThere is very little chance that your hopes will be met by this man. However, there is still plenty of room to resist.\nFor one, you can educate yourself and others on the nature of “probationary” status in federal service. These aren’t necessarily “new” employees, and these cuts are NOT targeted to any reasonable notion of “efficiency” or “improved care”.\nYou can also contact Congressional representatives, or even attend a protest (health permitting). Let’s not throw in the towel just yet.\nI would like to know if you are a veteran ?\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nHere at the Milwaukee VA, programs are already being abolished without replacements and veterans with PTSD are getting LESS care. The art programs here that have helped a lot of veterans are being closed and deemed as unnecessary. It is very important for vets with PTSD to have more than talk and group therapy, we need to truly connect with our emotions and art, music, and recreational therapy does that and connects us with other veterans and the community. Changes that are taking away programs that veterans care about is actively happening.\nI don’t believe any trump appointee.\nNeither do I,\nI can only hope the words you say are true but I don’t trust any of you MAGA radicals, show me! The trend on the right is to put down true patriots and cut everything so the rich can have everything, stripping away things that benefit the rest of us. We are all for trimming excess and have our taxes spent wisely but the problem is in determining what is essential and not, and how it is done!\nWhat is this about cutting VA benefit payments. We laid down our lives for this Country, what more can we do. I’m 76 years old and cannot work anymore, I have service related problems that prevent me from sitting or standing for longer than about 20 to 30 minutes at a time.\nDelta Echo India – hire: Collins\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nThere is too much hatred on this website. You folks if you have a real problem at your VA, then immediately ask for a patient advocacy to help you with your situation.\nIn his first term it was clearly documented Trump lied or made stuff up on the order of 30,000 times. Now his co-president seems to spout stuff clearly not true. You do their bidding. How can I possibly believe anything you say? This whole government just makes stuff up.\nMore than 55 years ago when I was in the Navy we had a verb, a transitive verb I should add, that meant to discard without thought and depending on context to discard with contempt. It was to shitcan. Neither of our co-presidents served or have a clue about what it means to serve and the one who would be king avoided service and has clearly demonstrated contempt for those of us who. When it is expedient or useful I fully expect you and they will shitcan us without hesitation. I will enter all my information below so you can target me for shitcanning.\nObama didn’t serve – he said that he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala didn’t serve – she said nothing at all about it. So, I only hear people slamming President Trump because he wasn’t in the military. Biden et al and Kamala lied much more than 30,000 times – probably 300,000 times – as everything either said was a lie or some kind of unintelligible statement that made no sense at all. The Biden admin broke laws constantly because they felt that the Constitution and Bill of Rights have no placed in the government of America. All they wanted was to make sure the com mie doctrine was in place everywhere they could get it. During Trump’s first term, promises made/ promises kept. He has made this his pledge again. DOGE is making public all of their findings – transparency is taking place every day. Trump has done more in 1 month than Biden et al did in 4 years and all of it is good for the average person – DOGE is showing where all of our tax money is being spent – it sure isn’t being spent here in America. The list of items is unbelievable – there are many people in Congress who are getting kickbacks of money to add to their coffers, millions of $$$. Trump wants the budget balanced, just as in any business. It will happen under his administration. Promises made/ promises kept. The promise list is getting checked off quickly.\nGetting appt. Less than60 days\nJust because DOGE finds an item due to noticeable $Dollar signs does not mean the entire item needs to be scrapped. The slash and burn attitude of DOGE is reckless and irresponsible thereby not good for the Vets and their families. DOGE is having a negative effect on our population.\nSadky I agree with everything you write.\nUP to this timrI have always received excellent care from the VA.\nWhy sadly? Like you the va has only done well by me since the day i returned from nam. Kudos and thanks to the va. I will however say that since 1971 the va has gotten better as time went forward\nDOGE is only having a negative effect on the population who didn’t vote for Trump. He won the popular and electoral college vote. DOGE is NOT being irresponsible and they are not harming any veterans or their families. My husband and son are disabled veterans. During the Biden admin, my husband couldn’t get in to see his primary care doctor for over 2 years. His appointment was canceled every time. Now that Trump has taken over, my husband has seen his primary care physician twice and he will have a cardiac appointment for the first time in 3 years – all of those appts were also canceled. So, things are looking up for our family with President Trump at the helm. The last VA secretary, Denis McDonough, gave the money that was allotted to the VA for the veterans, to Mayorkas in order that he would have more money for the illegal aliens. Our social security money has also been going to illegals and they have been given free health care – Medicare and Medicaid – which American’s have to pay for – even Medicare. So, I think you better read something other than what you’ve been reading or watching on the news. You’re badly mistaken about Trump – he love his country and will do everything in his power to make America a wonderful place to live, again.\nThank you very much sir. We all know the news media likes to put out false information to confuse the Veteran’s who haven’t any way to see the real info put out by the VA unless they go to the VA for an appointment. My son works for you all and he was worried and I told that his job was safe.\nDEI hire.\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nI have read some impending doom remarks. I am appalled by some of the things being stated. Those of you waiting on your money, that’s not new, that’s the military units not knowing what needs to be done. Paperwork for retirement must be done 6 months out from your MDR. Disability claims take time with processing. I’ve been through it and if you don’t get the right physician and the verbiage isn’t correct it takes longer for them to adjudicate your case. All this again is based on the assigned people with individual cases. Remember you are not the only person applying for both retirement or disability. Since it’s only been one month as of today, please be patient with changes that are yet to come. The VA didn’t get this way overnight, so Secretary Collins is working hard to correct the negligence from years of not caring about the veterans. Keep positive and keep pushing for Veterans Rights.\nI agree. Been waiting 18 years but can still walk, talk and have all limbs. I can wait a little while longer. Cervical and Lumbar spinal replacement. Let those with better reasons to go first.\nAgree Peggy. I am a disabled veteran who fought the VA and won. My case was a lot of work on my part, the VA will not help and no one knows my case better than I do, so I treated it like a job . President Trump runs his mouth a lot so is misquoted a lot, that’s just who he is. He is NOT a politician, thank God for that. He has never disrespected us, and he will cut disability to veterans. DOGE has nothing to gain by looking into individual medial claims, that is not its mission. BUT to look into the VA itself, oh yes lots of DI there. Go to the main hospital and see groups of 2 or3 employees standing around chatting with each other. Obama did that–“created” jobs by splitting the job of one making it two.\nNo. While it’s true that this is a poor choice of forum for benefits issues, it’s not entirely irrelvant here. We already suffer obscene wait times and disturbingly careless denials of claims. “Probationary” does not mean “new employee”. It also includes anyone who recently received a merit promotion.\nThere’s no patience to give here, and asking it is harmful and insulting. These acts are not the march of positive progress. If the VA was actually overstaffed, that argument might have some play. But there’s simply no sense in which that is true. They are directly attacking on our benefits, in an underhanded and possibly illegal way.\nThere’s no honor or decency in the behavior of Trump or his loyal sycophants. Please stop spreading disinformation.\nI also was in Vietnam from January 1968 to February 1969. I was also exposed to Agent Orange. When I returned, the only help was to get a house or a loan to go to school. There was no medical help. I had a host of problems and didn’t know what to do, so I became a heavy drinker. Luckily I married a woman who refused to give up on me.\nMr. Collins, I’m copying a fellow vet’s comment. Heartfelt.(You know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been)\nSincerely Vincent A.Velasquez\nMr Secretary Collins\nThank you for standing up for our Veterans. I believe with your expertise and willingness to do the right thing will allow our Veterans a sense of honor and dignity. I would be willing to help in anyway I can here in Arkansas. I feel with my 35 years of military expertise\nI can be of assistance in the VA system. Thank you for your time. Respectfully,\nMAJ Penny Smith (Retired)\nWhat expertise would that be? He has no medical training.\nThank you for your service, I think some people here are just mad because they lost the election. Give the man a chance, then comment. Lashing out without merit is just petty.\nThis is Bull S—T, our VA System is loaded with too many top level managers, out dated web site, not easy to navigate and slow in following up on care. I’m 86 , 87 this and it appears to me ., that gthey drag my needs out and make me do cartwheels and the deny, it appears that they can’t wait till I expire ? so they don’t have to deal with me. Our commander in chief just froze VA workings and when you go in the Drs Nurses and workers are not smiling any more. NUFF said, Anchors Away, Hooraa, Semoer Fi.\ni do not know how any veteran could vote for this coward. my family has a total of 68 years in the army. we are not suckers or losers.\nPlease do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation. Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit. Our family goes back to Revolutionary War days. Take care my friend, thanks for your service, and have a Great weekend.\nIn context, he called service members suckers and losers and he has denigrated US on more than one occasion. Furthermore, his disgraceful actions have led to friction between our allies and the USA, caused the deaths of countless members of both the military and special agents out in the field, and has sowed hate and distrust within our own population, all while kowtowing to the most oppressive regimes on the planet.\nAnd lets not even start with what happened on January 6th, 2021, when he called on his supporters to attack the capitol in one of the most brazen insurrections in US history, while allowing for his own vice-president to face the gallows.\nThis man is not fit to be the president of the United States, is an active participant in the destruction of our government, and a puppet for foreign powers that enjoy seeing the chaos Trump is sowing in the USA.\nHe isn’t taking it out of context, friend. When a man says “I don’t respect you veterans,” believe him.\nMy family was of the original Virginia planters, and no one has ever reneged on their military duty. Your “boyfriend” has received SIX deferments (heel spurs) for service in Vietnam, yet his orange ass is all over golf courses! And, remember how the CRETIN refused to honor our WWI vets during the 100th anniversary while in France because “it” didn’t want to get “its” hair wet in the rain! Here’s your threat to the previous post, you SNITCH! (Please do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit). Put my name on your list, you coward! You’re thinking like the Clown in your making threats to fellow veterans. Remember who always had your back!\nSo why not post the context then, if that’s your sticking point? Maybe because it doesn’t make it any better?\n“In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.”\nLove the gaslighting you done.\nyou are lying , Trump never said that….. it was even never proven, quit spitting out lies\nThen you better tab Obama and Kamala cowards also. Obama didn’t serve – he said he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala – she didn’t have anything to say about serving in the military one way or the other. Walz – he lied about what he did in the military along with some other candidates who also lied about even being in the military. So, if you have nothing to say about the above people not serving, then don’t say anything about Trump not serving. Also, you have taken what he said out of context, like all good little com mies and the legacy media. All of you are NOT supporters of our President, you apparently voted for the opposition.\nThis is awesome news. Finally, sense making in the government. Slash waste, fraud and abuse, and focus the money on where it does the most good. As for Elon Musk and DOGE, if the paid for political hacks in the Washington swamp and career bureaucrats can’t stand getting an audit…that should tell you something.\nThere are three parts of Government. Executive, Judicial, and Legislative. The Executive branch is headed by the President as such he has the authority to open anything to anyone he wishes. This is the way any large business is run. To be effective he must delegate duties since he can’t do it alone. I have received a number of letters in the last few years about data breach’s regarding my personal information, so I am afraid my secrets are already out there to a lot less honest people then those working for DOGE. Do I agree with all the things going on in Washington? No, but I am sure that no matter the person running the place in the last few years the Executive has be run by various people in a fashion that has been shameful and needs an adjustment. Unfortunately going after new hires is the only way to do this until a system is established to weed out the deadwood in some of the offices.\nTime will tell but given President Trump’s well documented history of mockery and distain for America’s veterans coupled with his near total disregard for the qualifications, political courage, or character, of his appointees, it is difficult for this veteran to remain optimistic about the future of VA healthcare.\nWell said.\nSo, here is the thing, you survive the President….that is how it has been for the last 30 some years…we’ve never been given a good choice…so you survive the roller coaster ride, I am hoping that we will come out better on the other side. But, I will tell you that no matter what happens, the VA (and all of us veterans) will still be here. I mean, hello, how much have you overcome since getting out of the military? I was in during the Cold War era, and even as a female I was treated horrible by civilians (so that is my vote for NO PRIVATIZATION)…the civilian world is full of a bunch of greedy a-holes that we have to deal with on a daily basis, so if we need to cinch our belt for 4 years, figure it out. You were not given the tools you got while you were in the military service to wallow around like a civilian, so honey’s SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP. WE WILL SURVIVE, we did not learn the skills we learned while we were in to just turn into a big baby….we ARE survivors and we WILL survive whatever this presidency throws at us…\nAnd not for anything, but I agree with what they are doing, not HOW they are doing it, should have started with a FULL AUDIT….but, the waste in our government (wouldn’t you like to be able to give yourself a raise??) is out of control. I do hope that the country continues to back its veterans, because FREEDOM is NEVER FREE. It is paid for by those of us who choose to raise their hands in defense of our country & Constitution (not the government). So, stay true to yourself and don’t just go with the flow. Find what you need to do to keep your future bright, because it is UP TO YOU…I am scared of what will happen, I only have the VA for medical, but I will survive no matter what happens, because I survived being Active Duty! If you survived Active Duty, you can totally survive THIS!!\nI trust Musk and Trump to do for us what Biden only lied about.\nTrump promised to abandon our allies and take away American freedoms. You voted for that.\nI have been a Republican all my voting life, all the way back to the Young Republicans for Nixon’s 2nd election.\nHowever, I will not vote republican as long as Trump and his lackeys are selling our country.\nI can’t believe you and others are allowing this to happen.\nYou had two chances to stop it the first time around and did not! I did not realize it at that time either, but that is no excuse for what is happening now. He is killing people, don’t you see that?\nPlease show me I can vote GOP again. So, STOP LYING, and empowering liars. You’re handing our country over to, well I don’t even know what to call them.\nPlease wake up and stop him!\nWhen will you honor your pledge,,,,\n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic”\nYou are full of S–t\nVeteran’s medical records & personal information privacy was not addressed.\nWould like a straight answer.\nIs DOGE having access t this information??\nHe just addressed it and stated they do not have any interest in our info, they want to make sure that any contracts that are in place to service us veterans, that money is actually spent on us. Please stop listening to people who haven’t a clue or just spreading misinformation. By the way the SSA and IRS have people in the same capacity as DOGE and they look at your information. Do you trust them not to divulge your information. Just relax.\nI trust them more than I trust a bunch of tech-bros and a billionaire with hundreds of billions of dollars in potential government contracts to decide how our taxes are spent. Musk wants SpaceX and Tesla embedded in government spending so he can get richer. He doesn’t care about you, and Trump will go along with everything he says. I can’t understand why people like you continue to ignore the blatantly obvious conflicts of interest this administration continues to inflict on our country. Did you buy Trump stock, or his rug pull meme coin too? How many times must you be scammed before you wake up?\nMy friends work for VA and are veterans, their data was breached by DOGE!\nThank you for your input on our concerns over our benefits that might be cut!?….\nSincerely,\nMrs. James R Cales\nThey will not be cut!\nOf course they will! It’s in Project 2025, and so far they have been following to a T. People said it was not the president’s agenda, yet everything being done right now is straight out of the Heritage Foundation agenda. The budget proposes to stop any funding of Medicaid. Any vet in an elderly home or on long term disability depends on Medicaid to cover costs of healthcare. Vets in memory care will be left forced out of their homes.\nGood initial message. Let me know if I can help.\nI can’t believe what little faith you have in president Trump and musk after what you had under Obama and Biden. Neither one loved our military and Doug Collins is a good guy. I’ve watched him for a while now and like him a lot. It’s been a month give them a chance. The other two presidents have tired to ruin our country. I know it’s a long process and it’s hard when you’re hurting. My husband was 25 years navy and never wanted to put in for his VA” he said others needed it more. But we finally got him to realize how many problems he has. We’ll see what happens. I love America and president Trump.\nFirstly, I’d like to thank all my fellow veterans for their service !!\nIf you don’t believe that there is fraud, waste, and abuse of your tax dollars then you are absolutely right not to support Trump and his designated representatives in DOGE. You can join in with the politicians who are fighting against the audits of organizations like USAID, but unlike those politicians, you won’t be making any money off of it. The entire process is going to take time and will require some sacrifice, but the ultimate goal is to improve the economy, shrink the deficit, and put more money back in the hands of the taxpayers instead of other countries and economies. Refusing to believe the promises made by the president are somewhat illogical as he has most definitely worked to keep so many promises that he made during his campaign in the past 30 days.\nIn the end it’s all up to you and, of course, this is only my humble opinion, but I choose to believe that the purpose of the cost cutting and auditing of our government offices will eventually help us all to be stronger financially and fiscally.\nI would never see a fellow veteran hurt, and do not believe that in the long run we will be. If you disagree then is your responsibility to get in contact with your elected representative and make your concerns known. If you do not do this writing something here will not help you at all. Let your voice be heard where it will help.\nWe are strong and we are many !!\nI’m the wife of a highly decorated US INFANTRY Corporal. we’re in our fifties. My MOM has TDS. I am a 3xTrump voter& hubby voted Trump/Vance in 2024 after YEARS of political apathy …WHY is my Mom(&many others) he’ll bent on saying that Trump will cut Veterans’ benefits/cut seniors’ medicare etc etc…\nI’m honestly confused. I live in “stoopid liberal Colorado(Yea gangs of Illegals!)” It really seemed as though things were better 2016-2020…\nPatience is a virtue. It took four years of tyranny to completely destroy the US economy and security, it will not be fixed in a month. I wish all would look at the way it was in 2016-2020, he did his best with a democratic/Socialistic Senate and House. He knows what needs to be done, and now he has the citizen, senate and house republicans majority backing him. Just got a few bad weeds to pluck to get the garden producing real produce.\nAll I know is my 87 year old father’s VA funded homemaker services are ending this week. The VA did not call him or notify him of this. They notified the health care company that they would no longer be paying for services as he no longer qualified. Nothing about his condition has recently changed. His housekeeper stated that about 10 of her client’s home care services were cut this week. She states she will need to look for another job. When the VA cuts benefits it effects many different people. My father is not able to care for himself. I will need to do more for him now. This will make it more difficult for me to work. Everything has gone up in price and I am no longer able to afford groceries most weeks. Now I will not be able to take extra hours at work. I am poor now and it appears things are only going to get worse for the working poor as prices on everything continue to increase. I don’t believe what this man is saying because I read the recommended report that called for drastic cuts to the VA. I also know that Trump has made very rude comments towards Veterans on more than a few occasions. He has never shown any respect for Veterans, and I doubt that will change. I am sad for our country today and just hope that the US does not abandon it’s Veterans. God save the USA\nHi, Melissa. We’re sorry to hear about your father’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWill the Manila VA get upgrades . Not only are there older vets here\nThere is a growing community of DS,OIF,andOEF vets coming to the Philippines. Plus many at the VAhere wish they could offer more services (non-admin)\nMr. Secretary could you please look into what I am about to tell you please sir. The VA is making veterans like me that got separation pay pay it back by taking our disability checks away from us to pay back the separation pay. This separation pay was given to me almost 30 years ago and they are taking my disability check away from me that I need and I know a lot of veterans had this happen to them also. This isn’t right. As a veteran we shouldn’t have to pay back any separation pay. That pay helped me transition from military life to civilian life. Veterans like me depend on our disability check to help us each month. Please look into this and please get this stopped not just for me but to all the veterans, Thank You\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nI’m concerned about African national has access to my information not only on VA.gov. but also social security. I request that my name and info be removed from what ever info he has.\nIf you ever used PayPal he has it already.\nIt seems to me that you have never been independent and always pushed right wing policies. Will that change in your new position?\nwhat absolute bullshit. Trump Doesn’t Give a Damn about Vets and Musk’s Team of Juvenile hackers are attacking agencies that were investigating Musk. Paying Vet’s their Benefits or providing healthcare Doesn’t Profit the Billionaires one bit, and so will fall under the category of ” wasteful spending”. Trump has already Violated the Constitution averaging about Once per day since he Entered office, why would he stop at those of us sworn to uphold and defend it?\nOh! It seemed as though doge is a good things. I certainly do NOT want one more illegal alien crossing the border. Poor Jocelyn Nungarye, Laken Riley and too many others DEAD at the hands of illegal criminal aliens. We’re home owners, live less than 5miles north of EDGE OF LOWRY….THIS CRAP must end…our children deserve much better\nThey’re not doing a single thing for the American people, except taking our money. The president should care about ALL of the people. Not just some. He refused to send disaster relief to CA because we have a democratic governor. He has sent not one cent. That’s disgusting, and I’m sick of it!\nI would assume that you know for certain that DOGE is doing good things as you call it? Although I am in no way advocating illegal crossing into the US, those “Aliens” as both the president and you call them are human just like you…oh wait, their not from here so that would make them aliens…I see now! Do better\nHow can you sit there and blatantly lie. We were at our VA today half of the staff are gone. No one to help take him to the 3rd floor . You are a disgrace . You do not support the veterans only yourself and orange.\nShort and to the point – Well Done. Looking forward to the ramp-up of even better VA Healthcare. Best wishes to you and your team.\nWell done President Trump appointing Doug as our Secretary. I have nothing but the highest praise for our all three departments of the VA. Specifically, the VA Health and the VA Benefits Administrations. Excellent health care since retiring in 1991.\nDoug, you know where the Left and Democrats get their information. It’s truly sad when veterans feel disenfranchised. I’ve always recommended fellow Vets visit one of the well-qualified Veteran Service Officers (VSO’s) at the various veteran organizations. I am a Life member of both the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). America has great veteran organizations that provide support and guidance. BZ to you and your team.\nThis is a weak scripted response, as a Nam era veteran having served this country it is a disgrace what Trump and Musk and his bunch of cronies are doing to our country and hard working Federal Workers. Actions speak louder than words Mr Collins.\nMy uncles BOTH served Viet Nam in the Marines. I am still not convinced that “Let’s Go Brandon” would’ve been better for our Vets&Seniors’…. MY HUBBY is a Ver(US INFANTRY CORPORAL 1988-91\nMy husband is a disabled veteran and receives very good care at the VA. With that being said I know that there is much wasteful spending within our government. I wish President Trump would drain the swamp and not go after the Department of Veterans Affairs employees who only make 60,000 a year.. go after the big guys who are cheating the system. Why are so many people in Congress millionaires?\nThat’s not what DOGE said they have laid off 1000 employees though it’s not a large amount we have been having trouble with appointment’s and reliable transportation to and from appointment’s. So I guess I’ll just have to wait and see if things get any better which I seriously doubt.\nEver run this past the attorneys, Doug. Is this use of government resources for politicking? Does this violate the Hatch act? Just askin’, ole buddy.\nI’m a disabled Army veteran of 32 years, and a bi-lateral amputee. I’m still waiting on my SMC case to be heard, and I definitely can’t afford to lose what I do receive from the VA now. Trump should be hands off on a lot of things, and the VA should be one, as well as the Pentagon.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nHe has only achieved in destroying our democratic govt. It’s gonna take decades to pay off all of the lawsuits due to the illegal acts of Trump and Musk. You just can’t fire govt employees, especially those who have employment contracts, just because you want to.\nSubmit a congressional inquiry to your state’s congressman. This expedites your claim. If i remember correctly, from the time congress sends your inquiry over, the va has 72 hours to respond? I used to work in claims department and I myself have personally submitted a congressional inquiry and it did get addressed right away. *stuff they don’t tell you*\nThank you Sir.\nUnder no circumstance do my husband who is a US military veteran and myself support Trump and allowing Musk an unelected private civilian have access to any federal agency or make changes that can impact our well-being negatively. You, the VA, have the responsibility of protecting veterans their families and dependents from losing or reducing their monetary, health and mental healthcare, and other benefits. As it is the VA system is very dysfunctional and nearly impossible to navigate through, making unlawful and careless changes to the system makes it more difficult to almost impossible for veterans to access such a vital component for their well-being, especially the elderly, mentally incapacitated, and those with brain injuries sustained while serving to protect this nation.\n?? Veterans Deserve Better – Why Is the VA Ignoring Its Own Laws on Missing Service Records?\nThe VA is failing thousands of veterans by ignoring its own regulations regarding missing service treatment records! 38 CFR §§ 3.303, 3.304, and 3.307 require the VA to accept secondary evidence (lay statements, medical opinions, post-service treatment records) when service records are lost or destroyed. Yet, veterans are being denied benefits because of the VA’s own recordkeeping failures.\nThe VA Secretary has no power to say there will be no cuts. The Elon/Trump dictatorship will cut whatever they want, without regard for anything except their own pocketbooks. They will cut our benefits long all while adding to Elon’s billion $ government contracts. Don’t pretend like anyone in this administration is there to do anything other than make money for themselves.\nI got ripped off by the VA for 8500plus. All I got was a run around,not even a disabled tag for my truck.\nI am retired DoD employee, and a Vietnam Veteran that is 100% TDIU and I find it very hard to swallow that we have DOGE who is going around pulling people from jobs. The people that they’re targeting are those who are on Probation, and the government hire these people because of the downsize that they have had over the years. A person have to remember that when a person retire, they need to train another person for that job, and in most cases they’re hiring two for the one person, because of all the work a excuse my words (an old timer use to do). I know as a retiree I filled the work for two or three personnel at time, and now a new person have to come on board an learn the work by themselves without the aide of an old timer. Yes, a lot of stuff has gone internet or through google, but there’s lots to be said about book knowledge and not just Google knowledge. I hate the fact this administration is firing people without knowing the work that is being performed. As far as the Secretary saying what he’s saying, I to will hold you to your words. After all Congress passed a lot of others to their word, and now they’re going around chopping people from their jobs, just be of trump says so or this person name musk. The word must to mean only a bad odor, and this guy is a bad odor waiting to happen. You may not like my words and I don’t care, I’m a veteran and retired federal employee who did his country proud, and I’m honor to have served both. Now, treat your veterans right and hopefully in the future the Veteran Organizations that support the clowns we put in office, will keep their mouth shut and not support any politician and see if they can elected on their TRUE words. If anyone comes after my ss, accounts or any of family information, lookout.\nThis dude must think we’re all stupid. The mere fact that he used this snippet to attack the media tells you everything you need to know about him. Donnie D*mb *ss doesn’t give a damn about veterans. We’re props when he needs us for a photo op and we’re disposable when he doesn’t. Never forget these words spoken by Donnie….\nOn disabled veterans\n“Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.” September 30, 2019.\n“Look, I don’t want any wounded guys in the parade.

You and this administration disgust me\nI don’t believe one word of it, he’s a politician, he’s a maga clown for trump and trump hates disabled veterans, not trustworthy at all!\nSecretary Collins,\nI am concerned about my grandson; he is a disabled 101st Airborne Division veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained in combat in Afghanistan. In addition to the combat injuries, he is now being treated for leukemia which was most likely caused by exposure to toxins and other hazards in Afghanistan. Based on the PACT Act, he applied for a higher VA disability rating due to toxic exposure, but he has not yet received a response to his applications for over six months. Could you please expedite this slow process.\nLeukemia is a high priority claim. Those are USUALLY expedited. I’d get in touch with your vso or submit a congressional inquiry.\nI was denied benefits for secondary ed because of my advance prostate cancer. informed the va that, I tried penis pump, pills penis ejects still waiting to here back from them\nThanks to everyone for their concerns. This a little off from what you explained; but, I am a Vietnam Vet, came home,\nworked in private industry for a number of years; was college educated/with my blessed GI Bill Coverage: then\nbecame an appraiser with my Local County Government after 31 years, then was told my years of service with the\ngovernment would conflict with the amount of money I was entitled too under SS would go down if I wouldn’t retire from\nCounty Work. Hey, I felt it was time to retire because I was treated fairly. So, here’s my question; Will the government\nallow the full amount of SS allotted to those, like myself, the framed amount over the time we spent in Private Industry work without losing that money, for working under the States PERS scheduled money allotted? Thanks\nfor your reply. Mr. Keenan PS. Word has it that President Trump is going to pass it thru to follow the new guidelines of Social Security Monies and Government Work Monies. Thank you very much for your reply\nI don’t believe that Trump really cares about our Veterans we need to spend a lot of money to take care of them which is exactly what we need to do ? problems though are that doesn’t help the 1%\nI certainly do not and will not trust any sort of message from The Traitor’s Cabinet. DJT, the draft dogger, called veterans like us “loosers and suckers” and naturally will not stop President Musk from destroying the VA. The VA is extremely understaffed yet 1000 employees from the Crisis Line were summarily fired. Action must be taken to restore democracy in the US starting with Congress stopping the illegal actions by DOGE and the DOJ arresting Musk for his violations of US Law including his fraudulently obtaining US citizenship.\nI cant trust President Trump or Elon Musk to speak the truth when they don’t seem to care about the Ukrainian nation and more about what pleases Putin !!!\nHere here, trumpy has lost his mind.\nHe’s not interested in Ukraine because he has no financial interests there like he has in Russia. And I guess post WWII, the Iron Curtain, and spread of communizism have been conveniently forgotten. Let’s see, Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Crimea was part of it until Puti stole it in 2014. You don’t annex by force or coercion. Puti didn’t stop with Crimea…. will he stop at Berlin this time. Trump makes America great again after he makes Trump interests great again. Putin’s puppet.\nI’m pulling into your way as secretary of the veteran administration. I’ve been trying to get my disability for the last 56 years. Haven’t got anything. All I get is deny deny deny.\nI’m holding you to your word I pray for my benefits. My disability benefits over 34 years ago hadn’t received anything. They keep denying me.\nThey are going to make it even hard to get service connected if you are not already….\nNO MATTER HOW IT IS LOOKED AT, THAT NARCCISSIST/ILL-MINDED SO CALLED DICTATOR THAT YOU SEEM TO LOVE SO MUCH, WILL STILL SCREW ALL IF NOT MOST OF US “VETERANS”, IN THE LONG RUN OF HIS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME. HIM DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL GOV’T IS DOING US MORE HARM THAN GOOD. TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF AND UNPLUG YOUR EARS AND “LISTEN”, TO WHAT HE IS SAYING TO ALL. HE IS CREATING HAVOC WITHIN THE USA AND ABROAD. SO DO NOT PREACH HE IS DOING GOOD, HE ISN’T. HE WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE A FRIG’N DICKTATOR. HE IN THE PAST ALREADY PUT DOWN ALL DECEASED “VETERANS”, HE WAS OVERSEAS DURING HIS FIRST TERM IN THE PEOPLES’ WHITEHOUSE. IF YOU ARE NOT DISGUSTED BY THAT, THEN YOU ARE WORTHY OF THE POST YOUR IN!!!!!\nI hope things get better with clearing cases. I’ve been waiting since July 2024 just to add my dependent and there’s not been a single update to it on the web site since it was submitted. I’ve called several times to inquire about it, all they can tell me when I call is that’s it’s “pending.” Secondly, it took nearly a year for my disability claim to be processed and came back with only a partial rating. I’ve resubmitted additional information, it that going to take another year to get feedback on? Finally, I’ve been trying to get a community care referral for a procedure that is authorized by the VA, and if authorized for one Veteran, it should be available for every veteran. However, getting this referral is proving to be very difficult with multiple hoops to jump through and the providers at the VA hospital not being very helpful or being cynical at best.\nI just find it disappointing that illegal aliens, those on welfare or receiving other benefits seem to get signed up and receiving these benefits with little to no effort while Veterans have to run a gauntlet of numerous obstacles to “maybe’ get the benefit they have earned.\nI wish Secretary Collins much success in his new role and I’m hopeful he can make the highly needed improvements. Hey, how about reassigning those 87,000 positions authorized for the IRS to the VA instead?\nI do not trust Doug Collins nor any other Trump appointee. Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, is taking a meat axe to our Federal Government, firing people with institutional knowledge and civil service protections, while Trump shreds the Constitution and the Rule of Law. We will be lucky to come out of these next years with our democracy intact. Quacks and incompetents are being installed to head cabinet positions. Real people are hurting as a result of Trump and Musk’s actions. More cuts are in the offing and no program is safe.\nTime will Tell !\nGlad to hear benefits earned will continue. Perhaps vets can finally receive the federal mileage reimbursement for medical appointments vs the .41 cents per mile and a deduction of $3 each way. Fifteen years ago, homecare nurses here got $.58 per mile. Wonder what VA employees get for their qualified mileage reimbursement.\nOoooorah! You said it, now stand by what you’ve said and do it! Semper Fi!\nI see when he was asked about DOGE getting access to Veterans personal information how he really didn’t answer that question just like the rest of them avoid answering a simple question.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, you need to resign effective immediately and should be banned from any position within the VA or any Federal position.\nThank you for your comment.\nThank you Secretary Collins! I am looking forward to your leadership with this Department. I really appreciate your transparency and your energy! As we say in the Navy….BRAVO ZULU!\nFiring thousands of employees… but healthcare won’t be affected? How dumb does he think we are? Has anyone else been at the VA and heard anyone talk about being over staffed?\nTypical trump boot licker trying to save face while he plans to stab us in the back later\nI’m a 77-year-old veteran (1968-1975, Honorable Discharge). I just watched the President of the United States with his [virtual] arm around Vladimir Putin, announcing to the world that Ukraine started the war that has devasted their homeland and killed thousands, followed by a rebuke by Vice President Vance of members of the European Union who had the audacity to suppress AfD’s assault on a demoratic society, and a clear move to abandon allies of 80 years for a war criminal. So perhaps you can excuse me for being skeptical of anything coming from this Administration. The G.I. Bill gave me a career after service, for which I am extremely grateful. It is devastating to see what has become of a once-proud nation.\nThank you for your service. I wish you well\nAction has a Reaction. Ukraine did start the war and Putin said “OK, let’s go”, and moved Armored vehicles into position. Biden got USA involved with dollars and the game was afoot.\nWatch your back veterans! He sounds like a Trump suck up. Remember that Trump dodged the Viet Nam war and has no respect for veterans!\nTrump did not dodge the VN conflict. Bone spurs are identified by X-RAY not by a letter from daddy who was a land developer not a government official with pull. Clinton dodged the war by fleeing the country.\nThere is a special place in hell for you and the others that bend the knee and kiss ring. Sacrificing veteran care to line your pockets. Utterly shameful. You are a disgrace and I hope both sides of your pillow are hot in hell.\nFull cowardice on display. They break us in their wars and then get upset when it costs money to keep us healthy. DOGE and trump will cripple the VA. Firing thousands of “probationary” employees to save a buck in the name of “efficiency”… what a disappointment and disgrace.\nI was out drinking… I just woke up… what’s going on? aslo… how did you get my email?\nMr. Secretary,\nI was not deceived by the rumor reports but appreciate you prompt reassurance.\nAlso I regret that the VA is subject to such false reporting.\nI don’t understand what ‘website’ is required to leave a simple comment,\nThank you for the straight dope on the situation. Much appreciated.\nThank you for your service to America’s Veterans !! Please keep up the Great Work !!\nVery disappointing message delivery and content. Hypocritical and disingenuous when thousands of VA employees have been axed by an administration that is doing immediate and lasting damage across all Federal agencies. As happened with the Bureau of Land Management 6 yrs ago, there is no concern for the impact, only moving in a manner that eliminates opposition and any effort to reduce costs responsibly.\nMr. Collins, your political invocations show you are as crass and uncaring about Veterans as the angry orange you serve. You do not serve nor honor my 20 years (and 3 family generations) of Navy service.\nPlease inspect the Tuskegee va\nI found Mr. Collins remarks about veteran benefits being cut or threatened as a standard “talking point” that is the answer for any DOGE complaint about acting as a legitimate branch of our government. Congress needs to stop allowing him and his team to have access to any records of any Federal employees. Don’t trust the media but trust Trump, Musk and you? Your actions speak contrary to your message. Will you resign your position if this continues or will you stand up to Trump and Musk?\nMy experience with the VA where I live has been A plus for 35 years. I have watched them deal with staff shortages, uncertainty with funding and now the threat of having their position eliminated without a valid reason. I appreciate everything they have done in the past and worry about how the future will look.\n50 years in the VA healthcare system since 1969 Vietnam I am in Shock and want to Scream\nMike R, that is straight left-wing conspiratorial fear-mongering garbage. You’ve trusted an incompetent federal government with your personal information your whole life, and didn’t think twice anytime they’ve asked you for your personal information. It’s utterly laughable that you think Trump and Elon are going to take your banking to steal your VA pension.\nI’ve been waiting 3 months for approval…To have a tooth fixed!!! The government has ALL our information already.\nYou either work for them, are 100% leftist, or NEVER had to deal with the VA.\nQuit bellyaching…Most of us want the VA FIXED.\nWalter Cook\nDo you honestly believe there is no waste that can be addressed? They need to go over all the contracts from govt. contractors go bankrupt without finishing a project. Salisbury NC VA. Contractor won a bid for a 3 story parking garage. Stopped at 2 levels because of structural problems. And most of the 2nd story is unusable because of those same problems. The contractor got paid $10 million and declared bankruptcy. The VA needs to stop paying for shoddy construction. And seeing how the democrats are the first ones to call for cutting DD funding. I am more worried about them. The standard talking points I’ve heard over the last40 plus years is everything is good. While waiting weeks or months for appointments. especially to see a specialist. No communication between VA hospitals or clinics. Ask about it being computer generated and was told they don’t talk to each other unless specifically asked. There can be improvement. If I believed the media rhetoric the world under Trump would have ended in 2016.\nSecretary Collins,\nI am going to hold you to this. I am in a 6x month estimated waiting period myself for backpay owed. I, also, 100% support DOGE. It needs to happen, and that much is obvious to me. I read a lot of scathing comments below that make me think there are simply bad actors who aren’t actually a part of this crowd within them, specially the ones that have nothing to do with the VA or your message since it appears that anyone can comment here. I can tell you that it has taken many years to get as far as I’ve gotten with the disability process. It shouldn’t take actual years for this. That’s ridiculous.\nDear Secretary,\nI hope your words are of truth: only time will tell. Please help the displaced federal workers that need help as well.\nRespectfully,\nChief Johnson\nIt won’t be understaffed if you privatize it\nNEVER PRIVATIZE. VA offers the best care. Average wait time in Civilian Hospitals for new patients, 26 days. I never wait that long. The VA offers community care if they can’t see you in a timely manner. Privatized Care will cost taxpayers (you and me) lots more money. The care givers are not specialists in war time injuries. This is a money grab scheme.\nGood idea! But I am 1-Hr+ away from any VA facility anyway.\nWhy not just cut the VA down to just those required to treat and work with serious war injuries and severe PTSD. For the rest of us, make it so we can go to the Dentist, Doctor, etc. without having to wait weeks or months for approval from “Community Care”. I have been waiting over 3 months to get my tooth fixed. THAT is RIDICULOUS!\nBut, yes, privatizing would be better than it is now.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nTrump/ Musk, sounds like brown shirts to me.and all off his picks have drank the cool aid.\nI served three tours in the Nam with the USMC, was wounded twice ,suffered broken bones and am a diabetic from exposure to agent orange. I do not trust you or any of Trump/Musk appointees, none of you are qualified for the jobs you have. I firmly believe despite your statement that if Trump/Musk says slash and burn the VA you will be the first to light the match . I believe that the VA secretary should always be a COMBAT VETERAN!!!!!! How can we trust a president who buddies up with a Russian dictator????????\n100% Agent Orange Killed Us In Vietnam We Just Haven’t Died Yet Sprayed and Betrayed 1967\nI agree with you he sounds like a Trump suck up! Please remember this in the 2026 election when no Republican is standing up to Trump!\nIgnorance. Remember this, no Democrat stood for us. Or cancer kids,gold star moms ECT. Y’all are all about me me me me. Pogs\nTotally agree, he’s going to prove to be another spineless jellyfish making excuses for commander bone spurs, who dodged the draft.\nSince when did he buddy up with a Russian dictator you ate up POS.\nYou did not address the firing of 1,000 probationary employees, many of whom at Vets.\nDoug , STOP! We know from the video you are a Trump Boot Licker\nAnd we also know you’re a liberal. You are using hate and media propaganda instead of common sense. We have a $70 trillion debt. Mostly to China. $5.6 billion a day interest payments. A almost $2 trillion deficit. Now give me any examples of democrat cutting or even slowing of any spending. And I’ll give you one to start. They always throw the Dept of Defense out first for cuts. Guess where the money for the VA comes from. It’s all part of the DOD budget. But the democrats always say they would never cut VA spending. But like many it seems to be a case of don’t touch my govt benefits. Go after someone else. right. There are many Vietnam veterans who voted for the change. I’m one . The country is going broke. The left doesn’t care and spends taxpayer money on their agenda instead of the people who need it most. Homeless Vets and other citizens.\nI don’t believe that it’s only Liberals as you call them that use hate or media propaganda instead of common sense. Yes we do have a huge debt, many people act as if it juts happened in the last 4 years. Government spending has always gone both ways, when one party is in office, the said spending is just right, but the other party is in office they are wasting tax payers money. We have a tendency to make excuses for whoever we voted for so hat we can feel good about our choice…but always remember, common sense is not common to everyone!\nWhen will choice program come back. President Trump said he would privatize the VA, I can hardly wait.\nMe too, John. VA incompetence is stunning.\nThis is embarrassing, you’re just towing the maga republican line blaming the media for your parties inability to lead. You sound like a used care salesman. Your fast talking isn’t fooling anyone but the fools. Keep your politics out of our medical care.\nQuick question, tell how firing people is going to improve the speed of getting an appointment?! Get your head out of this administrations a$$, the military is apolitical and so should be the VA. You’re an embarrassment to the uniform.\nWe have to take to the streets\nFor what. If the democrats would agree to cuts for their pork barrel agendas like sending 50 million to house illegals in hotels in NYC or for DEI programs in other countries. Building a roads to nowhere. Maybe the deficit and $70 trillion in debt would be addressed and our benefits would be better. Instead of attacking the ones trying to fix the mismanagement of the country for the last 50 years.\nWhat about the reduction of disability benefits due to household income thresholds with reductions of disability payments to start at houshold incomes of 125k and a reduction to zero benefit dispursed at 175k. That was voted on and put in place that is supposed to take effect in April of 2025 , but keeps getting pushed out and delayed, please address this.\nTypical Trump dog. No substance with more BS. Agency under staffed but does best it can. Then it gets cut more. Doesn’t look like anyone has any balls. Your just another puppet.\nWhere has it been cut. 1000 probationary people out of 475 thousand. Nationwide. If it’s like the FAA firings it’s janitorial and lawn mowing people. $70 Trillion in debt to China. $3.6 interest on that debt daily. Almost $2 trillion deficit every year. Is that BS. You find running a home or business in that economic state good? Which party always calls for the first cuts to be the DOD? Democrats. And guess what that’s where the VA gets its budget from.\nTrump spent $15 million to attend the Super Bowl. He spent $5 million to take a lap around the racetrack. Numerous times golfing while Americans are crying and unsure of the future. Disgusting. He cares nothing about us.\nI would like to know why the V.A. took the 100% rating from me and put me at 30% by in 1988 . Now the V.A. a few years ago gave me the 100% rating. I was in the Army 1966-1988 . August of 1968 I was in the Army hospital at Fort Polk La. The Army doctor said no more active duty for me. He said I had a bad Heart and could not stay in the Army anymore . So from August 1968 to October 1968 I had no duty . So I sat around for 3 months till they said I could go home with only 30% disability rating . With a bad Heart it was hard to find a job. In August 1981 the V.A. said that they are going to put a artificial heart value . I was rated at 100% 1981. In 1988 V.A. said that I wasn’t sick anymore. They put a valve in so I am OK . So from 100 % back down to 30% . So a few ago 2023 THe V.A. put back to 100% . So my Questions are Why wasn’t given a medical discharge in 1968 . Question 1988 to 2023 why wasn’t I given back pay . I have had a very sad life because of not being able to work .\nTypical VA BS. Over and hour drive for me so I use Community Care, but approvals take forever…But so does sitting at the VA.\nSounds like they should give you a LOT of backpay, but wouldn’t hold my breath. And what’s the deal with all these people in the comments bashing Trump??? He ain’t even been in a month. Not like he can make it much worse?! Bunch of Hanoi Jane wannabes trolling the comments!\nPraying for You and all our Brothers & Sisters dealing with the bureaucracy.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nWas your bad heart the fault of the military..\nI hope all of you that have posted comments or asked questions including me know that the only ones reading these comments/messages/ETC are us and the waste basket, but its interesting to see that many of us have pros and cons on the VA service and the past and present Government. the race of the Turtle and the Hare that the Turtle won bec of caution, determination and a a real consistent approach Once again todays venture Haste makes Waste\nSecretary Collins, I am Henry Dittman, Major, USAF (ret). I just watched your Video Message, re Real Status of VA vs Rumor Mill Vapid, Vacuous B.S. Thanks for the update.. I look forward to seeing you and the NEW Leadership in VA providing support and help for ALL of Veterans.. I have confidence that Pres. Trump wouldn’t have selected you for this position if he didn’t have the UTMOST confidence in your capabilities. Press On, Sir…”Kick the tires and light the fires” and get this Bird in the air!!\nMan have you drank the cool aid!!! This guy is a suck up to Trump who was a draft dodger for Viet Nam! On the plus side the V.A has treated me with respect so I wonder how many of them will be let go?\nIf you look at the rest of the very unqualified people filling cabinet positions, you should understand this one is only marginally better. He’s still a Trump sycophant but if you think that’s okay, so be it. I don’t hold people who openly flout the Constitution in high regard.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When his only self-serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nJust a note. Most of us totally support President Trump’s efforts with DOGE. I for one am very thankful for my local VA and the truly dedicated staff (Topeka, KS).\nI have to believe the new Director of the VA is sincere in his remarks but I have to add my story. I’m 75, I previously applied twice for VA Health Benefits, denied both times. Since the PACT Act I did extensive research to establish and prove my ship did gunfire support in areas of Agent Orange exposure. After 40+ years I was granted VA Health Benefits under what is labeled “Naval Herbicide Service”. I guess no-one wants to say Agent Orange out loud.\nFurther research indicates I have several conditions related to NHS/Agent Orange and I have applied for compensation. That was right at five months ago. I do understand there are probably thousands now applying. Most of my Vietnam era group do not have much time left.\nI received a letter February 17, 2025 dated January 31, 2025 from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs saying they are still processing my application for compensation and apologize for the delay, I would be notified upon completion of processing. No estimation of anticipated date of completion.\nToday I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.\nDoes that sound like a disconnect to anyone else?\nRome wasn’t built a day, and good things take time. I want to believe the Director’s optimism will come tobe.\nMost of us DO NOT totally support Cap’n Bone Spurs, speak for yourself!\nonly 2 types of veterans exist that don’t support trump. 1 the stolen valor veteran 2. the never seen combat veteran with no pride in their country. put down the kool-aid and your M.A.P magazines.\n“Today I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.”\nwhat proof do you have of what you are saying or are you just repeating what the trumpers are saying? so much of what has been said as truth turns out to be lies. i pointed out the story in Military.com and for some reason it never showed up here. it is about the firing of over 1000 VA employees.\nI’m sorry it’s been delayed for you. I think the statement about completing faster than ever is because of the recent hiring of claims processors. Especially since the PACT Act, the submissions has increased. Compared to years past, they are moving quicker, slowly chipping away at the backlog in addition to working priority claims (think terminally ill, old Veterans). You can view the current inventory and backlog plus more online. Currently sitting just under 950k.\nUntil recently, processors were working mandatory overtime. Since that is no longer the case, the backlog and claims inventory may go up.\nI hope your claim will be completed soon so you get the benefits you deserve!!\nYou know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been. The armed forces of America plan and hope everyone gets KIA. It’s cheaper. Much less Veterans to deal with. The only thing is they do need clinics for their budgets. It makes it easier to steal the money. Because it damn sure isn’t going into my bank account. When I see this BS rhetoric. It just pisses me off. I was so ripped off spent 4 years in. Did a good job. I volunteered for extra duty. I went to extra schools so I would be extra qualified so I could volunteer for extra duty. I was passed up for promotions because I am a white man. I entered the Army as an E3 due to four years of JROTC. I GRADUATED Lieutenant Colonel and battalion Commander. I earned drill team Commander for the last three years of high school. We won every drill meet. My Jr. and Senior years to give others schools a chance we went as exhibition only. Because we were so strong and flawless. I and team did not mind. I was even in honor grad in basic training as best drilled individual. I have letters in my file of accommodations. But my skin was too white. When I got to permanent party every single private was promoted to E4. Going through the ranks before me. I entered the Army as an E3 but time in service and time in grade did not mean a damn thing!!! I was even a sponsor for a few of the new E1’s. I was married for 2.5 years before ever joining the Army. Reverse racism really is alive and well. I shook the hands of all of the privates that out ranked me. I was happy for them they did very well and deserved the promotions however I thought I worked as hard if not a little harder due to my volunteering for extra duty. I just wasn’t dark enough. You know you have to keep the numbers in balance. Don’t want too many white men getting a head due to white privileged you know.\nOh Daryl…..so sad you are….and a racist too….white supremacist?\nI read your post. I agree with you. If you’re not black or LGBT or over qualified you get passed over. Black and queer privilege now. I’m praying things change. Thank you for your service. I served in the Navy.\nWow, you actually said that out loud, thank you for being transparent. Many people who have that mindset don’t they just simply smile and deny the most qualified person of color. I am unsure what world you experienced, let me know where this is at where people of color are moving ahead of white men, white women, asian, indian? Please we want to go, quickly!! Minorities always have to have more education, more experience and change our appearance to be considered. Hey all you blacks, listen up there is a place where we are getting put ahead of white men and women WITHOUT EXPERIENCE and EDUCATION!!! We going please tell us. Believe it or not, some people are actually more qualified than you, yep even black and brown folks. I know in my family alone we have: Neuro Surgeons, medical doctors, lawyers, chemist, educators, high ranking military enlisted and officers and News reporters for major channels, but they all have that 1 thing : EDUCATION and they have to EARN their positions and watch people with LESS get the positions. BTW, I watched young white girls get positions without experience because white men wanted their cute faces over qualified WHITE MEN, and us others!!! S\nI read both your posts and I totally disagree, if you really did your homework you will see that there are far more white soldiers in the military than there are black or any other race, and I know that LGBT isn’t a race or on any soldiers report card! Do I think that there is bias when it comes to promotions yes I certainly do, but to say that you have to black or queer (as you put it) to get ahead is just not true. Also there has NEVER been and will NEVER be Black or queer privileged in the military, and praying that things change says something about you!!!\nI am a third generation veteran who is currently APPALLED by the actions of the new presidential administration. Reading through the comments of my fellow vets, it is clear that the overwhelming majority DO NOT HAVE FAITH in Trump or Musk, or that their actions won’t end up hurting the VA. You know, so they can free up funds for giant tax cuts for the wealthy. What we really need now are strong advocates for the VA, not apologists for Trump.\nIts interesting about the Office of DOGE Government efficiency is a big joke i am from CA so i am very aware of\nGovernment efficiency i continue to watch one of biggest income state in the USA 5th largest in the world going downhill every day because of the ridiculous spending of taxpayers money Just like some of the large major companies that have gone bankrupt because no one is controlling the expenses I hope that the rest of the country doesnt follow CA I just hope that Trumps effort to Make America Great Again Hasnt gone to far in Haste Makes Waste\nit would be better to proceed with caution\nI have no faith in this new administration. The lack of professionalism is astounding. All my years working with Veterans I’ve never seen such unprofessional behavior by a top leadership. This isn’t a campaign rally it’s a honorable institution serving honorable Veterans. Secretary your statement about not reducing Veterans Administration funds is a very empty statement. 1000 VA staff members have been fired. Many of them are Veterans and some are Disabled Veterans. You are a not in service to Veterans. You are only serving the traitor Trump.\nWell, at least the news is good, we’re finally getting what we voted for, even if the video link doesn’t work ( yes, I tried it in both email and browser, it doesn’t let me watch it because it says I’m not signed in, even though I’m signed in over on YouTube. And it doesn’t give me an option to sign in on the video itself).\nYou are an absolute liar. Lying to veterans is a total disgrace.\nIf you think trump/musk care about you, you are not very intelligent.\nnever trust trump and musk to do what’s right for veterans. I understand there could be a real reason behind the job cuts, but I’m do not understand the inhumane way it was done — no respect\ntrump is a draft dodger and has already called veterans “suckers and losers”. He does not care\nYou sound like a liberal communist. Trump cares about Veterans . Biden had soldiers sleeping on a garage floor, Trump put them in his Hotel. He is cleaning up government waste and strengthening our military and stopping this woke crap. Things will be way better under this administration. I’m sick of ignorant people commenting negativity.\nHey Kiva, Sounds like you should do a bit of fact checking before you accuse people of sounding like a “liberal communist” and being “ignorant people commenting negativity.” How do you interpret Trump caring for veterans when he faked a bone spur to dodge the draft, calls us suckers and losers and does not want to be seen in our company? Maybe you’re watching too much Fox News.\nWrong, Trump doesn’t care about veterans or the military, never has, never will. Maybe you should wake up, read something other than drivel, and realize you’re supporting a draft dodging coward.\nClearly, your TDS has warped your simple mind. Clinton was a draft dodger and all you dimocrats still worship the Clintons. Trump never called our veterans “suckers and losers”. Where was your outrage when Biden said “clap, you stupid bastards” right to our active duty military? Typical dimocrat hypocrite!\nYou might look into just who the new sign in procedures are supposed to be helping. I am an 82yo Vet who has been using the MyHealth.va site for probably as long as it has been in existence with varying degrees of success. Now comes the new double sign, double verification system which is completely beyond my grasp. I have spent many hours trying to comply but as things stand now, On March 4, I will no longer be able to access my information. I suspect this is make work for contractors. How do you “make thing simpler by adding extra steps? Anyway, I’ll survive until I don’t. Good luck in your new position.\nHi, William. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThanks for sharing that was total BS. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nDon thinks we are suckers\nand so must you.\nI’ve had several issues with injuries/issues caused from the military service that have been denied several times. I really don’t expect anyone under Doug Collins or, Doug Collins himself to read this, but my faith in the VA is very little.\nHi, James. Thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank you for caring for our veterans.\nI feel like we have one of our own (veteran) watching our six. All the best to him and president Trump.\nThis is the “VA”!!!! I believe are benefits will probably WILL be taken away. It’s just a matter of time. We do not get any raises! Except for COLA. That’s all we are worth. I do not believe President Trump will take it away but I know we will NOT be getting any raises!!!!! We are veterans. They don’t get raises. They aren’t worth any more money than they are getting now. We can’t say a word in fear of it being taken away. It has taken 34 years to break the $500.00 mark of monitory payment. That’s Thirty four years!!!!!\nThis sounds good, but doesn’t align with reality. Perhaps the large # of VA employees released occurred after this video was cut. Regardless, it’s difficult to believe that this downsizing will improve services. There has to be an impact when those who operate and support the Veteran Suicide Hotline receive notices of termination. Veterans are reporting scheduled appointments are being canceled. The messaging from the VA needs to be factual and convincing. Today that is not the case.\nBut no medical personell have been terminated from the VA. Only staff positions, most of which were working from home and did not want to return to the office. Regardless, these personell were offered a buyout which many accepted.\nPersonally, I have had no problems with appointment or staff having received 2 appointments in the last month. I think that we need to be a bit patient considering that the new administration has made many promises and is working tirelessly to keep those promises. Cutting waste, fraud and abuse….Money that is going to politicians instead of to the deficit or the taxpayer… is going to go slowly but I choose to believe that the process will ultimately prove to be a good one for our country.\nPoliticians never fight so hard as when their illicit money is threatened and a lot of our politicians really seem to hate the idea of organizations like USAID being audited.\nLet’s not make it a problem before it is a problem. If you really think that there is foul play afoot you should contact your senator or congressman and voice your concerns.\nJust my humble opinions…. Thanks for your service !!\nLarge number? 1000 out of almost half a million VA employees. Probably like the FAA firings. Janitorial and lawn maintenance staff. I’m sure that will create a care problem from the medical staff. Or those doing claims.\nDoug: Tell me what DOGE and the Muskrats are cutting and eliminating that constitutes waste, fraud, and abuse in the VA. Tell me exactly how you and the Muskrats are improving efficiency. I’ve had enough of ‘it’s gonna be great’ BS. No transparency, no TRUST!\nElon Musk literally posts on x all of the fraud and wasteful spending that DOGE finds. Just because you don’t bother to go read the information, doesn’t mean that it’s not out there.\nI am positively tickled that we are finally purging these money laundering mafias like US”AID” that have infested our government, squandering tax victim money on ungrateful foreign parasites.\nI’ll believe it when I see it. With all due respect, I don’t buy anything that comes out of trump’s mouth, which makes me extremely disinclined to believe anything that you tell me, Doug. You seem to be in lockstep with this administration, and I don’t trust them at all. Trump likes to give lip service about caring for the troops and for our veterans, but his actions tell another story. The bottom line is, you have to prove it, or it’s just more glad handing and empty promises.\nI would like to know why so many Veterans that spent as much as 25 years in the military and took a government job that are at the end of their probation was cut just because they are on probation.\nThey spent their entire life in the military and now fired, regardless of their job and outstanding skills just because they had not completed their probation period.\nVeterans are losing their homes because our President doesn’t want to take the time see what their job is. If you are telling the truth then make Veterans on probation exempt.\nGood Morning. Thank you for reaching out with this video. Unfortunately, your words offer little assurance to the disabled veteran/military retiree communities. You talk about “media” stories mentioning “possibilities” that veteran benefits may be cut, that “means testing” may be used to determine disability benefits, and the privatization of VA services in general. I read a lot and can honestly say I’ve never read a story about veteran benefit cuts originating in main stream media outlet. What I’ve read are main stream media stories reporting on alternative media sites bringing forth this type of information. Isn’t that the job of the media? To inform us? You say none of this is true. Not surprising, you’re the only person saying this. You come across as a fast talking late night TV Cal Worthington and his dog Spot type car salesman. Hello! Red Flag! Here’s the deal. We all know your unwavering loyalty to the current occupant of the White House(forgive me, in no way can I type or say his name) got you the job. It’s just too difficult for many of us to trust you for choosing loyalty to a convicted felon over the millions of veterans you now serve. Good luck.\nThank you so much for communicating with us Veterans! Please keep on doing this. Maybe a monthly meeting online summarizing what is happening with the VA.\nWhen will these benefits be published in a handbook print again with ALL contact information.?\nWhen will the VA have a functional phone system that is user friendly to discover these benefits that only a few have knolage off?\nMr. Collins:\nThank you for your video about VA benefits not being cut. Your information is appreciated.\nA suggestion….begin your videos with the information you wish to share. Do not belittle the media. Much of what you criticized the media for is exactly what this administration is doing on a daily basis.\nI am proud to be a veteran. And I applaud the VA for the excellent care I have received. And I hope the VA continues to care for all veterans in the best ways possible.\nI am an elderly female veteran who lives on my VA and Social Security benefits . If this administration touches either of these two things, there will be an uprising like you’re never before seen. We’ve worked all our lives to get here, broken down and barely getting by. And I’ll be damned if I (and millions of others) will stand by and allow billionaires to play with our lives and our money!! Our government had better put protections in place and stop this madness going around!\nThank you so much for running this explanation. WE never know who or what to believe when so many negative “reports” come out the “liberal media”. So, it is really important that our SecVA comes right out and clears up the matter. JRMack, IL Army Vet\nWow! So much hate and discontent on this forum. I’m surprised the VA allows. This content to be on a veterans administration site. So many people really showing their ass. Sad. To the folks who screen these posts I would recommended to your chain of command, that this forum go away. The hate and finger-pointing here solves nothing. There’s a VA phone number to call and I’m sure there’s a VA email to send your grievances to. This forum is nothing more than watching MSNBC.\nAgreed. US ARMY vet.\nAmen my Brother Veteran. We served with Honor and our president Trump did us right in his first term, and why would he change now. Anybody remember serving under president Carter. I do.\nYou could always volunteer to not come here or comment yourself first. How about that & not parroting far right propaganda? I vote for that.\nI applaud the VA keeping all comments. It’s important. To provide some context, I’m a retired veteran (25 years, from E-1 to O4), and just yesterday, I was speaking with my neighbor and good friend who is 86 years young. He had tears in his eyes as he asked me if his 30 years of service (ending as CMSgt) meant anything, given the state of the government right now. Grow up and read the comments. You might learn something about people who’ve sacrificed and then who get the runaround, or worse. Not everyone has a great story to tell; some have reasonable grievances and concerns.\nVince, I totally agree with you!\nTell me how these DOGE clowns and Musk are qualified to tell Veterans what is a waist of money on them? Musk has never served in the military. He knows nothing of sacrifice or hardship.\nMusk is a naturalized South American……and the richest man in the world. Donnie despises him because he is richer than Donnie. His time will come\nMy faith in the VA is now in question. I don’t trust the officials in charge under this sorry presidency and administration. Waiting for the next Russian hammer to fall. I’ve had wonderful care for the past 30+ years and now I’m concerned. I’ve already had medication issues over the past year.\nI’ve already had medication issues over the past year….That would have been under Sorry President Biden.\nI appreciate all the good work that you and the new Administration are doing. Here’s a stupid question, tho – why is there a higher threshold & harder process for us veterans to get the help that the government’s already promised us, when they already have all our paperwork and we already proved ourselves to them, than it is to get welfare, even as an illegal? ??\nDoes *any* other government agency penny-pinch down to a fraction of a percent? Is that *really* a necessary part of the process when tax victim dollars are walking out the door by the billions and trillions unaccounted for (until DOGE), squandered on thankless foreign parasites?\nmy prayer is that your leadership will I have been trying to get my case settled since 2014 my claim was successfully remanded 10/2024 but still no settlement information to this date.\nIs the Russian hammer in the room with you right now? Geez, are you hearing yourself?\nDid anything happen to our VA benefits in the first Orange Age? No, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized only after president Trump with the VA into shape, and VA Healthcare massively improved (and then went back downhill under Creepy Joe).\nSrsly, seek out the mental health services on offer, this paranoid hysteria is not healthy, and is frankly unbecoming of a former servicemember. The Cold War ended over 30 years ago, let it go.\nThank you! People bashing Trump and saying stupid ignorant comments are ridiculous! A bunch of liberal Commies…\nWell, you folks keep on calling liberals commies–Right? Well how about Trump supporting Putin against Ukraine and Europe! Last I knew, Putin is a commie! But I bet you people love him as Trump does! Yupper, Putin is innocent regarding his invasion of the Ukraine. And it is Zelenskyy who is the Dictator and the Ukraine which started the war? Donald has serious mental issues it seems. And as for the VAMCs, if not for Democrats, they wouldn’t exist. Republicans time and time over the years have never voted to increase funding for veteran services! And in fact the opposite is true. They love pulling the wool over veterans eyes by putting forth their age old argument, that my cutting out waste it will help veterans, when in fact, what they really mean is that they believe way too much money is spent on veterans care and services.\nAnd as for you all complaining that you are waiting years for VA approval of care for your conditions, just read this and then go thank your Republicans for trying to do nothing to help our veterans:\n“The legislation is an attempt to hide the fact that House Republicans already voted to immediately rescind $2 billion from funding for claims processing and appeals, health care both within and outside of VA, research, and education and training for veterans as part of the Default on America Act.\nThis bill:\nDrastically underfunds by $14.7 billion the Toxic Exposures Fund, created with bipartisan support in the PACT Act to ensure veterans exposed to Agent Orange, burn pits, and other toxic substances will always be cared for.\nUnderfunds other veterans’ medical care needs by allowing the transfer of $4.5 billion in medical care funding to areas outside of health care.\nCuts funding for critical military construction. The bill backtracks on our promises to our servicemembers and their families by cutting military construction by over $1.3 billion compared to the current level.\nBuilt on a framework that fails to treat veterans’ medical care as its own funding category, thereby jeopardizing veterans’ health care.”\nBut regardless, thank you all for your service!\nBut I guess it was ok when it was Biden or Obama getting bashed…People have the right to their opinions, you don’t have to like it or agree but its their right, it doesn’t make them commies (as you call them), it makes them American!\nDear Secretary Collins,\nRegarding the 1000+ VA employees you just fired, what are you doing about them? Why fire them with NO heads up, in the dark of the night, no severance, or opportunity to move to other positions? What about those VA employees that you pulled the rug out from under who are Veterans that wanted to serve the Veteran community by working for the VA? Those who you fired that are Veterans, disabled Veterans, who moved cross country specifically for that job? For those who are living paycheck to paycheck that now may need to seek out homeless services?\nFrankly, if you want to cut costs, try examining the obviously CORRUPT Compensation and Pension “examination” process!!! I’ve been to numerous of those hideous “exams” where the “examiner” flat out LIES on their DBQs/opinions!!! Seriously, they flat out LIE!!! And even though the Veteran is supposed to have the benefit of doubt, the VA ONLY goes by the lying C&P “examiners” who strategically move the conversation from the Veteran’s symptoms, issues, residuals, etc., etc. to get the Veteran off track and then say, “Well, we’re out of time, now. Thank you for coming in.” And they got their nice big pay check and bonus from the VA!\nThe Veteran NEEDS to be able to have access to the blank DBQs ahead of time, to submit DBQs from their own doctors who know the Veteran better, and have immediate access to the C&P “examiner’s” completed DBQ/opinion immediately following it’s completion… PRIOR to the VA making a decision, so the Veteran has a chance and PLENTY of time to respond appropriately! That whole system is corrupt, corrupt, corrupt, and causes far too much stress and anxiety to Veterans who already experience much of that! And I know I’m not the only one who knows this.\nSUGGESTION – reach out to YouTube channels: CivDiv and Veterans InfoTap (or Veterans Daily which is a collaboration between the two).\nAll that said, I understand the reason behind the job cuts, but I’m at a LOSS for the nasty, deceitful, and inhumane way you went about it… much like running those employees, and their families, over with a bus!\nPlease do something to help them get back on their feet after this disaster? Are you going to help them with job placement services? Food assistance? Rent/mortgage assistance? Please do SOMETHING for them!\nAlso, PLEASE do something about the anxiety inducing corrupt C&P “exam” process!?\nThank you for your attention, and for tolerating my “passion” and deep frustration with this “system”!\nThank you for your service, and God bless!\nSandra (Sandy) Sutter\nHow is firing long-term employees ( a lot of them are Veterans themselves) helping to streamline our services? Will you stand up for us when things are wrong? Or are you just going to let Musk cut our programs that help Veterans????\nMR Collins,\nHow can you possibly believe, we believe,\nthat Trump/Musk will leave the VA unscathed?\nMusk is tearing thru the Gov’t agencies at alarming speed, with NO oversight. He is not an elected official, nor does he have the authority to de-evolve the Govt just because Trump has such a big grudge against everybody.\nMusk is overbearing and has ABSOLUTLY no cares for/about US Servicemembers. Neither does Trump.\nWill you RESIGN if your statements prove UNTRUE?\nBy the way this was on the latest feed from Military.com , “VA Crisis Line Employees Among Those Fired Amid Federal Workforce Purge”\nGood afternoon, Sir. I just read about the lies that the VA is looking into cutting down service for us veterans. At the same time, you just stated that is not true, thank God, please keep doing whatever you can for us Sir. I wrote a letter to our REAL President Mr. DONALD TRUMP, about the fact that us veterans must wait years after we applied for our disability. I applied back in May 1923, and I am still pending for that to be resolved.\nI personally, have seen other veterans that have waited for a very long periods of time, and the representatives that are performing this process, at the VA department, I am not sure of what the problem is, but it takes years to receive their so needed and well-deserved disability pension after serving our country, and plenty of us, like in my case, I was exposed to Agent Orange during my service in the Army while in Korea during the times specified by the V.A., within the notification that I received in order to apply, the VA informed me that I qualified to apply for a disability pension.\nI have submitted every piece of documentation, including letters of support from all my doctors’ Nexus Letter on my behalf my documents that the VA asked for, but I am still waiting for a positive resolution to my case.\nI am now wearing a pacemaker because I had a stroke back in 2023, receiving an IV Infusion once a month, and according to Doctor Viviana Temino, MD Section Chief, Allery & Immunology under her treatment since 2014 and I must continue receiving the Infusion for the rest of my life do to the fact that I was exposed to Agent Orange, also now I have spots on my lungs do to the same exposure and I am also been treated with Sulfamethoxazole 800mg 4 capsules a day for the infection in my lungs for at least six months. Furthermore, I have to take numerous medications every day, three different inhalers because of COPD and Asthma, blood pressure medication, blood thinners because of the stroke because different blockage in my veins, including my brain and to top it all, I also have been seen by the Psychologist due to all the stress and a counselor once a week because all the waiting, going into three years. Medication for my stomach, (acid indigestion). Under the care of DR. Eduardo J Lopez M.D. with the Blue team at the VA Hospital, him, Dr. Lopez, also reiterated the fact of that my treatments are forever Dr. Italo Novoa M.D., my cardiologist, and I am constantly going to the VA hospital for all the treatments that I need plus all the medications that I have to take daily because my immune system has been destroyed by the effects of the Agent Orange that was, not only this chemical agent was sprayed in Camp Stanley because of this camp was so close to the DMV zone, but also was stored in the same camp, Camp Stanley.\nPlease Sir, we can use all the help that we can get.\nThank you,\nArmando G. Torres\n[Editor: Please do not publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nAre you claiming to be over 120 years old and that agent orange was used in Korea rather than vietnam? ? Something about your story doesn’t quite add up.\nI know how you feel. Took me several years to even get my records. Vetrecs kept telling me they didn’t have them.\nWith all due respect Sir, you must be the oldest veteran alive. Thank you for your service.\nIn other words, “DOGE” which doesn’t really exist, does have access to our personal records. Thanks for clarifying.\nthey are screening emails. Trump: “Senator McCain was a loser “he got caught” You Trump-loving vets need a reality check. Trump was Never a friend to vets. His only friend are stacks of 100 Ben Franklins. He refused to visit the American cemetery when invited in France…and then labeled them “Suckers & Losers”\nFour more years of lunacy. I pray we still have a country after he’s gone. Don’t forget, he is challenging the 8-year term limit. He wants to be a Putin or Stalin. Die a King.\nIt’s funny, after president Donald J Trump took office, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized, and I got enough of those Benjamins that my wife and I were able to buy two homes.\nJessica, please look into the mental health services offered by the VA, this hysterical paranoia is not healthy.\nAs for mccain, well he should have known better to stay a hero rather than letting himself become the villain. Please, enlighten me as to what is respectable about an old man wanting to throw young men into a meatgrinder of *his* political ambitions?\nSpot On Jessica!\nNice try! Got any other fantasy BS you’d like to share with us! Got to admit that people like you sure have learned from your dear leader, how to lie so well!\nTDS – was debunked!\nhttps://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/06/27/biden-trump-first-presidential-debate/about-those-suckers-and-losers-00165625\nJessica, quit telling lies….. Trump loves the Veterans….. sucker and looser was more then once debunked as a lie…. you people get all upset bc he wants to clean house. you know there is a lot of waste in the VA….. office staff is the once who got let go, didn’t want to go back to office, nor medical people……. I had never problem with my VA in Asheville, you believe anything the left made you belief…… you had no problem the media told you Biden was fit for 4 years, I bet you voted for crackling Camel\nTrump did not refuse to visit the American cemetery in France.This excerpt from American Military News offers an explanation: “President Trump reportedly had no say in the decision, as the Marine Corps and White House Military Office made the determination collaboratively with the Secret Service that Paris’ overcast and rainy conditions posed too much risk for Marine One to fly to Aisne-Marne, which is about 60 miles northeast of Paris.”\nHow many of the staffers fired were veterans themselves?\nCan you tell me how many veterans have already been fired from government jobs\ni am a Viet Nam veteran. i was exposed to agent orange. I am receiving benefits because of this exposure. please continue your vigilant concern regarding veterans benefits. Thank you, John Brich\nI see you are a TRUMP fan so I do not know what to believe.\nFirst and foremost advice, stop the politics. This video and message grated on my severely. An assurance that benefits will not be cut would have sufficed. I assure you, inserting politics into the MISSION of serving veterans will only lead to undesirable outcomes. I previously worked at the VA at the management level and political stances and opinions are not to be voiced publicly.\nThank you for the reassurance, good luck, and best wishes in your new position.\nFor the moment, I will take the Secretary at his word that VA benefits will not be cut. In comment on his remarks about DOGE and the press, I emphasize the following: First, it is the responsibility of Secretary Collins and his staff to fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. Our tax dollars fund this audit and investigative function of the VA and other law enforcement agencies. Elon Musk and DOGE should not assume this duty. Second, the rule of law and ethics in government matter. Musk is riddled with conflicts of interest as a large government contractor and an owner of regulated businesses. Numerous Americans have lost their federal jobs based on the untruthful disparagement of federal agencies and disregard for the rule of law. We have regulations that provide fair procedures for the reduction of the federal work force and expenditure of our tax dollars, which have been dashed by DOGE. (BTW, the name “DOGE” is an unethical promotion of Musk’s favored cryptocurrency and misleading because it is not a Department of government.) Third, demonizing the press has long been a tool of regime change. Information is power and both Musk and Trump control significant media outlets. Secretary Collins should not attack the press, especially when transparency in government is in peril. (As an aside, our names and emails are required to post on this site. I do not consent to allowing anyone connected to DOGE to have access to my email. )\n“An” email address is required, but it doesn’t have to be yours. I’m using Senator Rand Paul’s\nI’m so excited about our new administration straightening this mess out. I’m a veteran and a RN and know first hand the system is broke. Change maybe hard but it’s very much needed! You have my full support! I’m thankful accountability and common sense are now being used, years late but better late than never.\nI have no faith in the VA as long as Elon (the Pillsbury Doughboy) is in charge. Keep politics out you say? Impossible. Everything about the grift-meister Trump is politics. Victim politics. Retribution politics. If put my name to this post, guaranteed he and his band of adolescent hackers will ferret me out and deep six me in the VA system. Trump IS a pathetic example of a human.\nDo you deny Trump & Elon are using the presidency to profit beyond their wildest dream? Wake up-smell the coffee.\nWhat does any of that hysterical paranoid rant have to do with the good news from the va?\nPlease, look into the mental health care services that are on offer.\nWhy would we trust what you are saying? Time will tell and I hope you are legitimate, prepared and successful in protecting/improving our care. Thank you.\nI had to wait 3 months just to get a dentist appointment. I’ve been waiting 3 months just to get community of care to approve a doctor that I’ve already selected. What the hell are you fools doing? No thank you King Trump. I don’t like what you’re doing.\nMy husband has to wait longer than 3 months!\nHi, Carl, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nRight!!! The firings have already started in the chem dependency program. Doug will role over like all the rest of the lackeys.\nP.S. I have been under the care of VA medicine at Lovell FHC for 20 years. I would not trade it for any amount of money. I’m not going to bore with how they discovered my Agent Orange cancer on my very first visit, or how they rebuilt a badly mangled foot from and accident, or any of the other dozens of services they have provided me over the years. I have sat in waiting rooms and listened to vets my age and younger complain about waiting 30 minutes. Complain about this. Complaining about that. OMG….millions of people in this country never get to see a doctor and these entitled little f-cks just complain about services they get for mostly free. I’m going to offer a totally white American suggestion. If you are so f-cking unhappy with VA medicine, take your sorry -ss back out into the private healthcare industry and die sooner.\nThe worst thing VA did previously was ordering referrals of Veterans to community service. VA administratorts , prior to referral, never checked the delays in the private sector service being requested, which in Albuquerque are ~twice the delay at VAMC. VA administrators never insisted on getting reports from the referral doctor, and paid for private care before checking that reports were received: payment should always be deferred until reports are in the VA record. A delay of 6 months to being seen in the private sector can change a cancer prognosis from operable to inoperable. All attenmpts to “privatize ” VA should be strongly resisted. In most cases VA offers the most rapid access, excellent care ,and adequate follow-up.\nA reduction in force is a reduction in benefits. Our VA office wwnt from 4 to 2 people, and changed the blood draws from appointment to walkin. My friend who has advanced parkinsons had to wait 2 hours for a blood draw. He is in no shape to wait that long. Please try to keep in touch with ground conditions so you wont look so out of it.\nBro, IDK if you noticed, but the VA offices have been short staffed ever since the red-plague lockdowns, just like every place else.\nIs there anything that this Musk “presidency” would lead you to believe anything they say ? unvetted..not elected…has added billions to his private funds…please, we had to take tests (ergo the ability read and comprehend) to join the military…we are not stupid!!!\nDid you pass a basic civics test about how the American government actually works??\nDo you understand that Elon Musk is *not* the president, nor was he on the ballot, nor can he ever be POTUS, because he’s South African by birth?\n“I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans.” So we “get rid of…”, people. Firing approximately 1000 staffers, is sure to help with veterans health, claims, well being, etc. Great quote from the White House clown show.\num….you do know there are 371K VA staff in America right?\nReally want efficiency get the contractors out of VBA. My experience is unimpressive. I was referred to a contract nurse to assess my heart. Nurse did not take an EKG. Nurse asked me about medication and measured my scars from the heart surgery. Later I received notice that I must have an echocardiogram and drive about 40 miles to the contractor’s site. I live less than a mile from from a hospital with clinics. Finally I was told I needed to get a echocardiogram and have it faxed by a suspense date. Called my cardiologist and arranged for the echocardiogram. Contractor is churing account for profit. Sent to a NP with post doctorial work in PTSD and the NP was to evaluate me for hypothyroidism. Said I had no symptoms. I suggested I had no symptoms because I have been on medication for years and treated by the head of dendrochronology at the Univ Maryland Upper Chesapeake Hospital He wrote a letter that said I he has been treating me for this for years and stated that I had something that was 30% disability in the law. VBA questioned. Seems the VBA contractor has a list of service providers and picks the next on the lit rather than a provider that is near the veteran. Look at that scheduling process.\nFunny my simple dependency update has been sitting untouched since submitted back in July 2024! Can’t imagine those actually needing something done when a simple dependent correction can’t move.\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAre you a disabled Vet? I am and it sounds like you are not…\nI am a disabled vet and agree with his comment\nWow the true TDS is someone who worships an orange, privileged, racist, silver spoon, veteran hating, criminal draft dodger.\nI agree with all the people pointing out that the Muskrats are not qualified to do any adequate work on saving money… except for moving it to Musk and other billionaires — and the criminal draft dodger, as you rightly point out.\nI also think that military leaders should hold strong to truth. If all people would speak up, we could stop the tearing up of our country.\nDOGE under Musk has only hackers. They have NO forensic accountants to look at the data they have stolen. The are yelling fraud and waste but can’t prove any of it, and they are not being held to account. I don’t believe that the VA should show then a thing unless there is oversight by competent independent accountants and others who understand how things work. Musk and his bunch no nothing about how government programs function and they have no idea how many people they have already seriously hurt. And they don’t care.\nAnother LIE from the musk trump regime\nAnd your evidence for this is where? Surely, as a fellow former servicemember yourself, you would have enough integrity to not be making false accusations, would you?\nYou and the new administration are cutting VA workers without justification ( or even knowing what they do) how is this going to help veterans ?\nAnother trump liar. Its sad you are lying to our brave veterans. And horrific that you support the self proclaimed King!\nHe doesn’t care about anyone including you. You are a pawn in his ugliness. He will get rid of you and retaliate against you too.\nVeterans deserve to be treated like hero’s, not rump and muskrat.\nI feel sorry for your family, they must be so disappointed and shameful you.\nI am extremely skeptical of what the Secretary is saying. What exactly is doge doing? What has the Secretary permitted them to access? There appears to be little or NO transparency!!!\nMr. Secretary, No, DOGE is not a government entity and the VA should NOT partner with musk.\nYou will be striped by so called DOGE and the veterans will suffer. Mark my word.\nEach tim Trump has said that something is off the table the cuts happen anyway. He said he would review his list of insurrectionists and if they were violent they wouldn’t be considered. Welllook what happened. Now he’s looking at Madicare. My dad CMSgt. Z.C. Littleton is 93 and served in the Air Force in SAC and involved in many operations during the Cold War including Operation Chrome Dome and in and out of Vietnam while we lived at Naha, Okinawa and Clark, PI. Don’t blame me if I don’t trust him at his word!\nWhat insurrectionists? Are you talking about the political prisoners that were kidnapped for simply exercising their First Amendment rights at a public government building? Yeah, you sound like another big mouth civilian Army brat who never actually took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\nNaval officer Robert A. Heinlein was absolutely right, it was a mistake to allow civilian political power over us by something as unearned as birth.\nAirman….you are so wrong. Killing a cop and causing multiple injuries to those protecting our democratic process, was not ‘Patriotic”. They should all still be in jail, not pardoned.\nCDR USN (ret)\nCDR, the only shooting was done by a Capitol police Lt who has since been promoted. He took careful aim, stepped forward and shot Ashley Babbott in the neck. Ashley bled to death as the camera rolled. WE saw this happen LIVE. And there were Capitol cops with long guns right behind her. A cold blood case of murder. That Lt should be in jail, not promoted. Only Capitol cops brought weapons on Jan 6.\nIt’s well documented that the VA recently fired one thousand probationary staffers. This means that benefits are already “cut” for those veterans who need VA services, as the pipeline will get even slower. I feel for my fellow vets who rely on the VA for healthcare and related services and I worry this will only get worse.\nWhy does the VA only allow 100% disabled people to access dentistry?\nthats avery good question i wanted to ask that My guess is that the VA Dentist clinic is most likely an outside referral\ngroup and the VA doesnt want to pay for anyone not havent 100 % disability\nThat’s actually a fantastic question, the answer to which I have searched for far and wide myself. The best that I’ve been able to find is an answer is that way back when, the dentist industry lobbied tooth and nail to not have to accept certain forms of insurance, and here we are today.\nThough that still doesn’t explain why the va’s *own* in-house dentist office is so hard to access even for those of us who are at 100% disability.\nHow many veterans died of Covid 19 from misinformation?\nSir, someone needs to advise you that the Veterans Crisis Line has been cut by approximately 1,000 employees. These people provide intervention when a Veteran is contemplating suicide – a recognized epidemic among vets. Please use your authority to get these people their jobs back with back pay. Allowing DOGE (an illegal and unconstitutional entity) to damage veteran healthcare simply cannot be tolerated. Any and all veteran deaths will be at your doorstep and for you to answer.\nFunny because already up here in Connecticut I’ve been knowington VA thinks I’ve already changed. Their people who are sending emails out to Veterans saying they’ll be out of the office until further notice people aren’t getting through it can be an hour and a half sometimes before you get through to somebody and the folks just seem to be in some kind of turmoil there. And I’ve actually heard it said that yeah we don’t know what’s going on but something’s going on. So when he started his conversation with Trump is doing what he said he was going to do I knew we were for an -ss wipe yeah I don’t think we need to believe this guy look at what’s actually going on they’re cutting people from the Veterans Administration I was told that the only people there weren’t cutting at one of the veterans Administrations are the nurses because they’re essential but yeah they’re chopping people left and right\nWe shall see! Are you sure that there are not medical professionals losing their jobs at the VA???? Because that is not what I heard! Not even those on a probationary hire??? Historically, the Republican Party has given nothing but lip service to the vets! Check it out see how many republicans voted against veteran’s bills! Prove me wrong! Rest assured if I or any other vet suffers any reprisals the news outlets will be notified.\nYou understand president Donald J Trump is not the Republican party, right? He’s the fire we elected to burn the GOP to the ground, and on its ashes build an actual pro-America party.\nBut let’s talk about how many bloodthirsty Democrat cowards sent our people to die in unjustified illegal wars ( fun facts, every American war after World War II has been unconstitutional because it hasn’t actually been voted for by Congress), or how Democrat Golden Boy JFK wantingly sprayed agent orange on our troops knowing that chemical warfare was illegal.\nthey didn’t vote against Veterans, they voted against the pork the Democrats added to the Bill. They only said “veterans” to blast Rs. The worst R was mcCain who voted against Americans, including veteran.\nRemember that his boss called us veterans “suckers” and “losers”.\nDon’t be a sucker or a loser. We worked hard and lost much for the benefits we have.\nHis boss has a 50 year record of reneging on promises. Do not believe him or any of his mouthpieces.\nIam a veteran never had any problems with VA or care . One think I believe tho is that Combat Veterans should never have to beg or depend on anyone but the Goverment to take care of them if you are a combat Veteran you deserve everthing you need to help get your life back and their spouses and kids should also be on the health insurance. Combat Veterans are entitled to more period\nDoug Collin’s word is not enough. There is a $6 billion budget shortfall for 2025.\nOn February 13, 2025, the VA announced the termination of over 1,000 probationary employees with less than two years of service. These dismissals affect various roles, including researchers in mental health, cancer treatments, addiction recovery, prosthetics, and burn pit exposure.\nI don’t trust a word from Collin’s as he was selected by Trump both of them are pathological liars.\nIn their Budget they show $9 trillion in cost savings. No comment on where the savings are coming from;. Trump is not sharing this as he is simply arraigning as none of this will matter anymore.\nMr. Collin’s,\nAnything that has to do with improving the VA and Doge is an oxymoron! Cuts to help improve? Layoff notices at the Milwaukee VA or any other VA facility? Vets have seen this disrespect from our Commander in Chief before. Do not insult me with this BS. You should know better.\nHmm, tell that to the vets working at the VA who got laid off for BS “poor performance”. Vets are speaking out how some of them got stellar performance reviews only to be let go days later. Way to look out for us vets. As some have pointed out, especially those who were laid off with disabilities, there is legal recourse for wrongful termination.\nMy husbands appeal has been waiting for a judge for years. His body is breaking down due to his past military career. He is in constant pain. He fought Multiple wars and conflicts. Gulf war veterans are being pushed aside. He was one of the first to cross the burm to Iraq in the ACE tanks. He don’t even try to talk about Somalia or the other conflicts. These men deserve better. Please help these soldiers. They fought for us and risk their lives for us. The government doesn’t have time to waste. Make our Veterans a priority!!!\nAmen ! Praying your husband gets his help asap.\nfirstly this site should not be used to attack the media or your political enemies Mr Collins. secondly I’d like to say that I have been very satisfied with the service that I’ve received from the VA both in Iowa City Iowa as well as in Des Moines\nSUBMIT A CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY TO YOUR STATES CONGRESSMAN. THEY FORWARD YOUR REQUEST TO THE VA AND THE VA IS REQUIRED TO RESPOND WITHIN 72 HOURS OF RECEIPT!! This action should expedite the claim. It did when I did it.\nI find it interesting that the day after this article posted, another article talked about VA people being laid off and the crisis line purged. Anyone who thinks our benefits aren’t on the chopping block is drinking the koolaid.\nAnd you expect us to believe this? VA staffing has already been cut by Trump. We have fewer VA representatives at different levels than we had two months ago. You are completely right about the media and how they work. But their spin on things is nowhere close to the spin that the government puts on things expecting us to believe them. And it has been worse these last two months with all the government firings and the cuts, human and financial, at many of the government offices. Why do you continually believe and treat us as if we are so stupid we cannot figure this out and are not able to know the truth? And the truth about DOGE and their requests and demands for personal information does nothing to help any of us, but is another verification of us losing our personal and private lives and information. This information they receive will do nothing but hurt American individuals. That can be verified easily by looking at the person that is in charge of that.\nThe VA already does not have enough employees in healthcare to provide veterans with healthcare services they need. Which means if Doug Collins and the VA are working on good faith to improve veterans access to healthcare, they should be hiring new employees, not firing va healthcare workers.\nAnd a lot of those unnecessary VA workers y’all just fired were veterans, disabled veterans, and spouses of veterans. Y’all are actively harming the veteran community by firing these folks.\nDoug Collins and the federal government can do all the hand waving and all the complaining they want about the media. I have eyes and ears. I don’t need the media or government officials interpreting reality for me.\nDoug Collins is up here pissing on veterans, and telling us it’s raining outside.\nI find these statements to be very bland and general in nature and appears to be a casual sound bit and a shot at the Fourth estate. The What quality control measures for contract performance were in place when you took office? How much time did you personally spend verifying this before bringing in an outside entity to do this routine job? Why don’t you use your inspector generals to do this task that they routinely do? How many VA employees have been terminated to date to “improve service”? How many of those terminated employees were veterans? This appea\nExcellent information grate to have you on board Honorable Collins.\nGreat report I am a 80% TBI Disabled awarded 100% Unemployability Benefit. USArmy Military Police in the Vietnam Era conflict.\nThis from The American Prospect:\nIf left unchallenged by VA patients and caregivers, veterans’ organizations, and members of Congress, Trump’s appointee will continue to slash and trash services for veterans long after Elon Musk has likely returned to the private sector.\nOn the same day that protesters assembled outside his new office, Collins dismissed 1,000 probationary employees at the VA, while claiming that this move “will not negatively impact VA healthcare, benefits, or beneficiaries.”\nIn a quick rebuttal to Collins, Murray pointed out that those laid off included staffers working on treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. “I’m hearing from longtime VA researchers in my home state of Washington who are right now being told to immediately stop their research and pack their bags,” Murray told the press.\nWho got all the money for healthnet in 2017 ?\nWe all know who you really work for, so save the empty promises. Why not be transparent and just tell us when your billionaire business daddies are planning to sell us down the river. I would rather be able to prepare for losing my benefits so I can at least try for a soft landing.\nI hope you have enough of a spine to stand up for us to the Musk/Vance Whitehouse because we will not forget, and we will not forgive.\nYou can talk to me about the weather, which I have no control over, or you could outline the services you’re making available to help me deal with the weather…and yes, part of that is making sure service providers have the support they need to be effective at what they provide. This felt a bit too focused on the weather.\nVery party line here – I take issue to the kids at DOGE having such access without being vetted. I would think that there would be forensic accounting involved – not hackers if the intent were to find waste.\nI’m on the same page as you. Although I don’t take issue with “vetting” per se. I take issue with granting what amounts to top secret clearance to guys with backgrounds that should be disqualifying.\nI mean, take Elon Musk as an example. Soldiers and veterans can lose jobs/clearances for pissing hot, but if you’re rich enough you can do drugs on a podcast and I guess that’s okay.\nMine has been stuck at level 5 since Dec 30th 2024. It’s supposed to take a couple.weeks. I need those benefits. So much for faster more streamlined.\nMine is stalled since September of 2023\nThey can cut costs at the Syracuse VA medical center they have a whole floor dedicated to female veterans but r sending us out to community care for mammograms they don’t do them there\nFrom a retired (100% disabled) sailor since 2002. The Minneapolis VA has treated me for numerous ailments and in most cases have done well. There is always room for improvement and the outside eyes of DOGE are probably best suited for determining what is best. What has been televised as cases of waste, fraud and abuse are mind boggling. May there be consequences and the punishment fit the crime.\nWelcome to the club and keep the bow into the wind!\nno evidence or proof of crime has been presented\nMy do AA has been stuck at level 5 since Dec 30th 2024. It’s supposed to take a couple.weeks. I need those benefits. So much for faster more streamlined.\nI don’t believe you as you were selected by Mr Trump.\nWhat is happening in every aspect of our government is abhorrent.\nRemember Privacy Act of 1974.\nThis was drummed into us when I was in the military.\nCollins is never going to help the vets find easier, more affordable care with continuing cuts, lay offs and hiring freeze. He, like virtually every other trump appointee are all going to kiss his a** and sing the praises of Musk.\nI agree!!! 57 days for a primary care visit, unless special circumstances or 100% disabled you can’t even get routine cleaning at dental, specialist without referral is not possible at my VA. Pulmonary only 2 days a week at my VA despite pact act. There is a local clinic that sees no new patients without being on waiting list for year or more. 80 miles one way to VA. Trying my best to move most to community care. Not best choice but 2.7 miles away. Did get Pulmonary care moved to community care. Have had my CT, Pulmonary fitness test and pulmonologist visit all within 10 days versus weeks. Same old story with most people here.\nLast, the question regarding vietnam and agent orange deaths. Here is just my personal story. Raised in town of less than 1000 people. Tons of fathers were WWII vets so lots of us went. 5 died in country, 7 more since of AO exposure have died. I have severe COPD, one of friends severe Parkinson, 2 more with kids born with spidabifada (sp). Same with every small town around me. Until PACT VA flat didn’t acknowledge. It’s going to get worse. I’m 75. Like the vets before us most vietnam vets dying quickly. Damn shame I believed the promise of health care for life when enlisting.\nUnfortunately, my comfort level is not very high.\nI would at least hope for status quo at a MINIMUM.\nAnother LIE from the trump musk regime!\nI would like to see spouses having CHAMPVA able to be treated at VA clinics. They are lifeline of assisting their disabled spouses.\nAs a DAV Chapter Service Officer I am very pleased that you have not hesitated for a moment to set the record straight. I have already heard from veterans that are concerned about their disability claims and THANK YOU for getting in front of the issue. ANYTHING that you can do to assuage their concerns by using every means possible to communicate with them is appreciated.\nI’ve had very little problem with the Va. they have helped me get my health back. I have talked with many other veterans and they seem to appreciate the va’s help. I don’t know what I was doing without those doctors and nurses. I believe Trump will do a great job for all of us.\nTim I am with you 100% on that. I am a combat vet . 100% disabled and have had and having outstanding care through though the VA. A lot of the post here just sounds like Dem. talking points. I remember a President in the not to distant past, that said, let the injured Vet pay for his own care, after all he volunteered for it.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins has a clue. Anyone who praises Trump, says he’s doing a wonderful job, and DOGE is doing a great job, does not live in the real world. He is a Trump ass kisser. Laying off people who provide help and support to veterans is not a sign of waste, but is a way to discard veteran’s needs. Being on the job for one week and making the comments he did doesn’t instill my faith in him.\nThank You Doug! Please keep us informed. Looking for wonderful things for our Veterans , spouses, widows/widowers, families! We need to know that our President Donald Trump and you have got our backs.\nNo they don’t have our backs, they’re kicking our -ss.\nLOL . . . they “have your backs” alright because that is where they are going to stick the knife.\nI need very little care from the VA. I am very satisfied with the care I have received for 50 + years. I very happy with the changes which have occured over recent years. I know and it is a matter of common sense that people are proned to take advantage of any system. Vets and non Vets alike. I am glad this sort of thing is being vigorously addressed because the ones who do need it most suffer. Thank you, Mr. Collins\nI HAVE HEARING AIDS FROM THE VA I USED TO GET THEM SERVICED AFEW BLOCKED FROM MY HOME\nNOW THE VA WANTS ME TO DRIVE 75 MILES TO LEBNON TO GET SERVICE. I AM 86 YEARS OLD AND\nDONT DRIVE FAR ANYMORE SIPES EYE CARE IN HANOVER PA DID SERVICE THEM UNTILL FEB 2025\nDONT MAKE ANY SENCE TO ME.\nTHANK YOU, EDWARD YINGLING, HANOVER PA\nHi, Edward. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nTime will tell the tale.\nRead comments, lot of bitter vets. I am a disable vet. I will not jut anyone on 14 days on the job. When my check gets cut or I cannot visit the VA clinic the I will beleive the media. DOGE is trying to cut waste and abuse I don’t care how old they are just find it, $600 million for sushi . Every president since Regan has promised to cut the budget finally someone is doing it and we are bitching. Only Hon Discharged Vets, disabled or abled, should work in the VA!\nI beg you all to research the nonsense you see on Facebook and Fox news, which you then repeat as fact. I recommend politifact, which is non-partisan. Elon Musk never said that he found $600 mil spent on sushi (https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/06/facebook-posts/no-fishy-food-bill-elon-musk-didnt-say-pentagon-sp/). Don’t get me wrong. I am NOT a Trump fan. I do not believe that Secretary Collins is being truthful. DOGE is a train wreck being used to hurt hard-working Americans while lining the pockets of million/billionaires. I do NOT think Elon Musk, has any business in our government. But, you’ve GOT to stop gobbling up the nonsense from FB and Fox and regurgitating it.\nHe’s lying like the rest of the unqualified people Trump has infiltrated our country with.\nThe Congressional Budget Office recommended ending TDIU benefits for those 67 and older. This is a joke, as Social Security benefits are continually being reduced and it is meant to be a supplement to retirement, not a retirement. In addition, TDIU Veterans do not receive retirement plans like they would if they could hold a job, so they likely would not be able to live on Social Security alone. Someone needs to fight on these issues.\nAlso, I attempted to add my 18 year old daughter in August when she enrolled in college, so she could use her DEA benefits. It’s been six months, and despite having all the necessary paperwork, it hasn’t moved passed initial review. I contacted the White House Hotline and requested assistance. The response I received from the Regional Office was “wait your turn in line.” Six months to add one dependent is absurd.\nLet’s talk about the 2017 Mission Act\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAs a 90+ YO Korean Vet. I’m sick of the bitching and bellyaching from the cry babies who think Biden did the American Veterans a great service. How did he handle the withdrawal from Afghanistan? My take is that that after visiting a Naval Air Station that celebrates gay and lesbian behavior with signs that they should be proud of their degenerate behavior. What is this costing us veteran in lost funds and access to healthcare? Get educated and thank God we have a chance to turn this country around. Don’t give up and KEEP FIGHTING.\nLet’s talk about the failure of Healthnet 2017\nExcelente News Sir. I’ve trying to get and increase in my disability % over 20 years (imagine it) and nothing has happened. This time I had to hire a lawyers so he can help me with this issue he charges 33.3% of what ever I get… if i get it. My health issues have increased since then; i don’t what to do anymore.\nI have received excellent care at the Tucson VA for over 20 years, and would not like to see their ability to care for veterans in a professional, timely (yes, timely), and caring manner impeded. So far, what the “lying” press has published about the manner in which Trump and Musk have handled the so-called elimination of fraud and waste – without having a clue as to what has actually been taking place, or delving into the ramifications of knee jerk reactions to their “revelations,” seems spot-on. Good luck on seeing the ongoing chaos bringing and semblance of positive results and improving the operations of the government.\nWe still have low information voter’s. As you can see by their comments. They have TDS and there is no treatment or cure. They don’t remember when the lines were so long and TRUMP pushed thru the community care program.\nIt’s only a month. Take your meds and give it time. Make common sense suggestions and not bully / attack the ones trying to get their heads around this mess, it’s been going on for ages. Give it time.\nP.S. there are several people who just walk around the VA appearing not to have a purpose. Veteran, nurse or whatever : they need terminated.\nThere should be more cameras on records actions of veterans and the staff at the counters for appointments and greetings. People on both sides are unkind. There needs to be accountability.\nWe veterans have been pushed against thru the system and had such a hard time getting even our records. Be specific about issues!\nDon’t be pricks!\nClueless. Look around. Research. Even Google. Shame.\nWow, did you drink the orange kool-aid! Poor fool,\nThey fired and investigated the DEI consultants’ spending and found that they were spending 8 million dollars a year on DEI programs when some VA hospitals don’t have full staffing for medical teams. Talk about crossed priorities. When there are hospitals so undermanned that they can only provide limited service, that isn’t the time to be picky about the diversity of its potential hires.\nYou’re so clouded by their constant stream of bs that you can’t see the forest for the trees. Musk will cut whatever he wants because your guy Trump has no spine. He backed down to Putin just like we all knew he would, and he put unqualified, traitorous morons in positions they don’t even understand.\nYou really cannot choose a provider through community care. For primary care, I found myself in a waiting room with immigrants who are on the public dole. I don’t know if providers are chosen by bids submitted, but don’t be surprised over where you end up. The doctor, by the way, mumbled to herself never having seen such “clean” urine, as she was looking over the results.\nI would like to believe that he is being truthful and above board about VA benefits not being targeted for cuts, but the American people were told the same thing about Medicaid and now it’s on the chopping block. So I’m going to have to wait and see while reserving judgement because this administration has burned us before.\nWe need your protection as our current president call us suckers. We never forget. DOGE is political bullsh-t getting rid of the IG;s can only lead to corruption.\nPlease find a way in your heart to continue being a peacekeeper and not perpetuate propaganda. Let’s help this administration make America a better place. There is so much work to be done.\nPlease find a way in your heart to wake up Tamara. Have you not been paying attention to what’s going on in the government offices since Trump Took office? Mr. Trump has never had anything good to say about veterans and has called us idiots for serving our country. What branch of service did you serve in, Tamara? The truth is out there, take off your blinders, open your eyes, and get your fingers out of your ears, please.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When it’s his only self serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nYour newsletter is N- propaganda. U.S. veterans know how to treat N-s. Fck you.\nBS trump is screwing Veterans.\nI read most of the comments and was not surprised at what I saw. Some never addressed his video most were very bitter vets, understandable as I am a disable vet, but I can’t take it out on a man that has been on the job 14 days. This man was in HOR and before I start throwing stones at him I am going to give him a chance and see what he does. I will get it out of the way so no one has to guess, I voted for Trump and would do it again given the alternative. I find it interesting that people are worried about their personal info, your info is all over the place now. They know when you go to the bathroom! As for DOGE we will find out but they really don’t care who Richard is what they want to know is Richard ripping off and or scaming the american people. Reality is,read you own notes, Collins can do no worse than any of his predecessor. The only advice I would give Sec Collins is that he ONLY hire QUALIFIED VETERANS to work in the VA. There are plenty out there that are disable but want to work. Still plenty others that want to work. Some work in government right now that may be let go look to the VA if you are a Hon Disharged Vet. Think don’t cry!\nThank you Richard!\nDawn Nance\nArmy 1978-1981\nThank You Mr Collins I’ve been with the VA for about 50 yrs . VA has always treated me with the utmost respect and fairness . The hospitals I have been in gave excellent care . It makes me very proud to say I am a United States Veteran . Thank You Timothy Foley\nThe operative questions just who is to determine “What’s not needed”- some 19 year old kid who never served a day in the Military??\nwow there are a lot of negative comments on here , much like the old bots on twitter , I wonder if the same concerned people had any negative comments about the feckless D.E.I. hires from the last four years? My personal VA treatment is excellent, I hope this success reaches all vets that need it.\nSo true. Those that are in our right mind, appreciates common sense thinking.\nDOGE is conducting an illegal heist of our personal data, and by allowing these uncleared, unvetted, unqualified criminal vermin to access our personal data you are an accomplice to innumerable Federal felonies. Resign.\nSir,\nIf I recall, the young rascals working for Musk at DOGE came from Space Ex with much higher clearances and IQ’s than respondents in this column. WE HAD TO WAIT FOUR YEARS to find out what Biden had been up to, how about we give Trump and Musk four months?\nYou are so right and don’t think these kids aren’t going to sell your info to the highest bidder some where down the line when Musk is done with them. Follow the money……always sound advice!!!!\nComplaining about the President is not helpful. Mr. Collins needs your issues and your recommended solutions, not a diatribe of your feelings to make you feel better. The VA has lots of problems but if you are not going to help solve them them you’re the problem. – 34 year Marine vet.\nYour words are well spoken, Marine.\nWe’re not paid to solve them, but nice try passing blame to the disgusted vets that are commenting here. Take your trash to FB or X.\nI have a serious concern when the current Trump VA fired so many veterans whom were fired without notice and now become jobless. This is not respect. In my life I have never used any VA services and only I have asked for assistance to change mistakes make on my DD-214 and NOTHING has been done in the last three years. Nothing!! I am 77 years old and I served during the Vietnam war era. So as a Native American I am still strong, health and waiting for VA response and results on my DD-214. As old as I am I need the corrected document to apply for a bank loan. Thank you and may peace prevail and the saying goes “United we stand divided we fall.”\nHang in there Doug! Just ignore the comments from the ppl terminally infected with TDS. Their disease blinds them to the positive realities Trump is bring back to our country and repairing the damage done by 4 years of a dementia ridden DEMOCRAT being in office. Refreshing to see someone with testicles putting a stop to DEI, drag story hours, illegal immigration, weaponization of DOJ, etc, etc, and on and on. The LUNATIC LEFT is finally being put in check. Absolutely amazing how many ppl are blowing snot about DOGE saving BILLIONS of dollars of OUR tax money!\nWell said!\nHe is ignoring them. Have you seen any replies? Dougie boy is laughing all the way to the bank.\nChaplain Collins, please remember…God is watching you. Something you seem to have forgotten or chosen to selectively ignore thus far in your political career. A large number of your words, actions, attitudes, etc leading up to now don’t really peacefully coexist with His word and He will judge you. Simply a friendly reminder for you to maybe do some self-reflection and prayer. Which holds primacy for you…God or “politics”? Have a blessed day!\nI hope this is all true, as a VET who has just got qualified to be on the VA health system I am looking forward to using the VA health care system to help reduce my cost of health care and provide quality health care for me as a Vet. of the Viet Nam Era. As a new enrollee I will need to learn how to best use the VA system that will benefit my health care and cost there of.\nSecretary Collins: Thank you for your continued service in this important position. Our active duty military needs to be the most efficient , lethal fighting force on planet earth and space. And when their active duty time is complete as mine is , the men and woman need to transition into a well run VA and insure the injuries they have sustained are properly treated. God Bless you in this effort.\nJames Carter (USN 1974-1981)\nhear, here! Let us just thank god that time exists. This guy will go the way of all and we will recover. have faith that another day will come and we will prevail. It’ll only be two years until it all ends and we can make things right. Vote in mid-term elections in order to make this joker a lame duck president, as Milania already knows him to be: limp.\nI don’t believe a word any Trump appointee says. They are all liars and cheats, and only out for the bucks.\nThis tells me you believe everything that the media tells you and the Democrats tell you. Grow up and smell the coffee our government is no different than the corrupt governments in other countries and this current administration is pointing this out that some federal employees are corrupt some of our politicians are corrupt and taking the hard earned money that should be going to people that need it like disabled veterans. Instead of wasting it on people that have been dead for 150years. Just look at where Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security have been giving payments to people that have been dead in the millions of dollars that have been sent to whoever that should’ve been going to people that really need it and those of us that are getting close to retirement age. The system is going to be bankrupt because wasteful spending of money the people that are dead and the fact the new generation of Young adults are not having children to be brought into this mess of the medias that lies. My wife left the media in 2003 when Robert Murdoch walked into her office and told her to get rid of the accurate information of who, what, where, when, why and to credible sources willing to go on the record with their names in face to be published. It was all about getting the story out no matter how inaccurate it was to pay her salary she immediately quit. This anonymous source bull***** needs to go..\nIf you look at the people that are yelling the loudest they’re the ones with their hands in the cookie jar taking the money from the disabled veterans and people that need it truly in this country….\ntrump and musk are the loudest in the country\nPossibly of dental care ?\nI have 2 complaints One I called for meds and after waiting one week I called back was told they would order my meds, waited another week to finally receive my medication. I was with out my medication for 3 weeks, second I had an appointment at the Nashville VA. I put in for my travel and was only given a partial. The reason was stated I could have gone to a closer facility. I do not make this appointment the VA does and It was my cardiologist,??????\nThat is a prime example of what goes on everywhere. Thank you for commenting.\nHi, George, thanks for letting us know. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nI’m really surprised that a former military member would act in such a childish way in a forum that asked for comments, feedback, and opinions. What I’ve read is really embarrassing to even be in the same ranks as some of you people. Practice your writing skills and come across like a professional that hopefully you once were when serving. In order to balance the budget everybody needs to suck it up and expect cuts in every department of the federal government.\nApparently you think Trump is a honest person who respects women and people in general; and what did he say about soldiers and veterans ( we are dumb and stupid). So far the appointees to these cabinet positions are unqualified and uninformed in the organizations and departments they are now running. Of course he wants you to tell him what to do, he doesn’t have a clue. The current actions of this administration are not thoughtful, informed actions. Its the opposite and I quote, “we will drive them out of government service” that’s not the “will of the People”.\nActually it was suckers and losers.\nThis is your opinion, same as the rest of the posts.\nThe Vietnam war will of been over 50 years this coming May. My records have been scrubbed along with thousands of brothers with classified operations. I first started having “Agent Orange” in 1994. 6 bouts of cancer later, I still can’t get benefits. Is there going to be another delay of the Army releasing Vietnam classified service records. Please remember, Us of the classified operations. We are the “Sprayed and Betrayed” but each one of us would go back in if our nation needed us.\nI have great faith that Trump and his rookie Collins are planning BIG cuts to Veterans benefits and services!\nConcerns are being raised regarding the potential impact of new VA Secretary Collins on veterans’ benefits and services. The new secretary’s background and political affiliations are drawing scrutiny, particularly in light of potential budget constraints and policy changes within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, described as a staunch supporter of former President Trump, has previously expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about his approach to healthcare for veterans. Furthermore, his past involvement in contesting the 2020 election results has led some to question his commitment to upholding democratic principles and the interests of all veterans.\nIn this video, Collins said he had been there only a week and there was already a problem (rite!) and then said not to listen to the media just to trust him bro. Some find his statements uneducated and unprofessional. Collins also rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.\nIn December 2020, Collins was one of 126 Republicans who contested the results of the 2020 presidential election. This action has been criticized as a dishonor to the House and a failure to uphold their oath to support the Constitution.\nWhile Collins has stated his commitment to serving veterans, his initial remarks have been met with skepticism by some, who are concerned that potential cuts to benefits and services may be on the horizon. Veterans and advocates are closely monitoring the situation, seeking clarity on the future direction of the VA under his leadership. Collins is the author of The Clock and the Calendar: A Front-Row Look at the Democrats’ Obsession with Donald Trump, published November 2021.” Not a good or popular book….\nIt is important for veterans to stay informed and engage with their elected officials to ensure their voices are heard as these changes unfold.\nMJ, 2nd Ranger Bat\nI support president Trump 100% Keep up the good work rhat you and your team is doing!\nFrom a vietnam veteran ??\nPeople are focused on the wrong thing of course thanks to media. I trust Doge to cut waste like they are everywhere else. What I’m concerned about is the proposed budget cuts recommendations written before the Trump administration that came out of the Congressional Budget office for 2025 to 2034 as a budget defeceit recommendation that would affect veteran benefits.\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/60557-budget-options.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkR6dleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHRH3c9KA4ojmwI3goVoZoj1NJUw5bnKSWzbsJu_WYJvP5_M1kyQSmSWHlw_aem_AOyjVclZFk48KhugaNMtQQ\nWith regards to DOGE and the benefits situation. There is a report that both the 30% rate is getting cut from compensation and that Unemployability is being taken out as a program moniker for the 100 % IU. What’s the truth, just what is the truth about the cuts announced in MilitaryNews.com. You’re praising DOGE as a watchdog group of sorts who are sorting through the contracts. A group of 20-something engineer grads are able to do accounting? Please.\nSecretary Collins, thank you for your service.\nI suggest a examining the connections between exposures to jet fuels that contain neurotoxins and cesium additives in JP-7 to the increase rates of advanced prostrate cancer.\nMany of us were unknowingly exposed to these toxins since they were classified top secret in years past. Anyone working around these aircraft were exposed because the aircraft did not have sealed fuel tanks and without being provided protective equipment due to the fact the additives were top secret during a special access / need to know program. We were exposed directly to the fuels and aspirated the fumes and burning exhaust of these fuels and ionized additives.\nWithout knowing of the hazards, we had to bring our fuel soaked uniforms home to be washed which cross contaminated our homes and further exposed our family members.\nCan we get some of the Doge money found to pay for dental work for vets. Our teeth take the brunt of all issues. PTSD sufferers grind our teeth, when we are sleeping, angry or just plain trying to figure out something.\nI have great hopes for what you will be doing for the Vets\nRE ptsd and teeth grinding. My dentist had a really thin tooth guard made I wear every night. Its actually helped me to stop grinding as much somehow (and it protects my teeth). If I stop wearing it I clench and grind again. Its worth trying one.\n60 day waits for Primary Care appointments are Unacceptable. It was less than 10 days till Republican s started chopping funding needs. Staffing and morale are at all time lows under Trump, are YOU going to stand up to Trump for Veteran needs or just cow down like the rest?\nBut it is in the Heritage Foundations budget proposal for 2023 amount things that Trump is currently actin upon. https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html\nStop blaming the “media” for when you say you’re doing “this” and then you do “that”. And Strump doesn’t know what he is doing anyway.\nRite brother\nAbsolutely! Truth!\nPlease keep politics out of Veterans Affairs. All you needed to say was you’re not cutting benefits. And then keep your word.\nThe funding comes from the Federal Government. Which is political.\nI totally agree to keep politics out of this. It’s a travesty he even brought this up. Focus only what you’re doing, not on a political leader’s policy you do or don’t support\nYeah, I caught that too. Once he said, “under Trump’s leadership,” he gave himself away.\nDon’t trust a thing that this administration says or does. Hope I’m wrong but so far there is no evidence to that.\nVery pleased and relieved our benefits are not going to be cut !! I had 11 hours a week for home health, which was not enough. You cut my hours back to 9 hours per week, which is terrible. I am wheel chair bound and have only my 85 year wife to help me the rest of the time. We get nothing but run around from the VA about who to talk to about more hours. The VA sends us to the VA advocate who sends us back to the VA primary Dr. (which they can’t keep) We have a beautiful new VA clinic here ,but it is not fully staffed. Sure wished we had the right person to talk to.\nThis outcome is exactly what should occur. I have attempted to explain this to others, but fearmongers prevent them from listening.\nMr. Collins, do you serve the veterans of the United States military and their families first or do you serve recently self-appointed king first?\nStop the Co-pay requirements for Vets Medical, doctor visits, and drugs!\nSir, you may believe what you stated (at least when this was recorded by you). However, Musk and Trump’s words and actions (including cuts of crisis staff and access to veterans’ personal dada) do not jive with your statements.\nthe va does everything to hinder old vets.I used to get online with the VA clinic in Niagara Falls ny..now I`m so confused with the changes .I can`t just get to my local va clinic anymore..Good going VA you made it hard for old vets\nSince you’ve only been there a week, I’m assuming you are a trump appointee. All trump and musk do is lie lie lie. How do we know if you are telling the truth. Nothing they have done is even legal. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nI am assuming you are a Democrat….. all you/they do is lie, lie, lie. Go see a doctor for your chronic TDS!\nObviously, you thought Biden did a good job which means your opinion is moot.. The days of the Biden crime family is over with Their just auditing the government which is long overdue Relax and watch your country get saved.\nI agree. Dental Benefits would be so helpful. I need over 10K in dental care. The dental insurance offered is not economically or practically viable. It takes 6 months of pay in before benefits can be used, it has high deductible and co pays, it limits care per year such that it would cost at least as much if not more. It would delay and stretch out care beyond what is medically advisable. I now have problems with my jaw, TMJ. I think they call it (likely the result of arthritis in the jaw), but cannot get care without my teeth being fixed first. Like fellow veteran Tyrone Burns, I also need extractions and dentures. If expanding benefits is true, not just spin, please consider dental care for all veterans.\nI don’t have the same faith in Doge as Sec Collins has as it relates to cuts. So far they (Doge) are not attempting to gain procedural knowledge of any organization before making cuts. I agree waste should be eliminated, but done so intelligently.\nHow Many Nurses Have Been Fired At the VA?\nWhy Did Trump Say He Is The King?\nOkay. I’ll believe that the benefits won’t get chopped. However, I still don’t like, and don’t trust those tech guys at DOGE who have access to personal information, be it mine or other veterans like myself. And I especially don’t trust Musk. He and those tech guys that work for him know nothing about doing any kind of audit. He has another agenda which involves making him rich(er). He is also in league with AFD (Alternative for Deutchland). In other words, he is in league with white supremacists, or he is one himself, which to me, means ha cannot be trusted.\nHow many Doctors have Been Fired at the VA?\nGet rid of DOGE and Musk!!!!!\nHow Many Vietnam Veterans Died From Agent Orange?\nHow Many Veterans Have Been Fired?\nId like to know how many commissioners took the buy out, quit, or got fired. Im still waiting for my HLR to be seen, 3 duty to assist errors going back to 08.. lets git r done\nDental help would be nice for all vets.\nWhy Are Veterans being Fired?\nThank you for fighting for us! Keep up the good work and may God be with you in this struggle to take care of those of us who stepped up to serve this great nation!\nLet’s see, my physical therapist ran by MyMichigan Health care (a Community Care referral) after a year and a half of therapy, recommended an exercise bike to help with my service connected disability and from a failed surgery to my neck that left me extremely weak on my left side and wheelchair bound. My PCP also submitted a referral for the equipment. It was DENIED bymy VAMC Prostetics Department. I appealed and after 2 years, I gave up and bought my own. No reimbursement for the equipment. Next, I am wheelchair bound, I have tried to get a chairglide put into my entertainment area of my house, I was issued 2 in Colorado. They sit in my garage currently and all they need is to be installed. The VA here installed a new one going to my bedroom but says they can’t install the ones I have that were issued by the VA to the entertainment area of my house because they can only issue 1. So I have these two sitting in my garage now and can’t afford to pay myself to get one installed to the entertainment area (basement). A quote to install is roughly $1,600. Again, being wheelchair bound, I have carpet in my home, and I’ve been trying to get help (2 times DENIED SHA/SAH) with the removal of it so my wheelchair is easier to navigate in my house. I was offered the $6k HISSA (sp) grant, but when I got a quote to remove the Carpet and replace with hardwood or similar, the quotes were at the lowest $24K and that was just the hallways, living room and my bedroom. I keep getting letters and emails about all the wonderful benefits that await Veterans in my situation, but when you apply for the benefits, like with the exercise equipment, flooring and chairglide installlation, you either Beg the VA until you give up and buy yourself or do without because this just seems like the old “bait and switch” game. Yes, I am 100% (Actually combined 750%) disabled per the rating scale. I only get paid for 1-100%, I took a 50% cut in pay from what my job paid me annually to accept the VA’s 1-100% rating because I was declared unemployable due to PTSD, TBI, White Matter Disease, Meniere’s, Depressive Disorder and sedentary lifestyle brought along with it DMII, OSA and heart problems which have required 3-stents.. If you mean what you say, why are us Veterans being put through the vigerous hoops? I am glad you are cutting back on the unnecessary cost to run the VA. I just hope the differences are returned to the Veterans as you say because as I described above, it has been really challenging to get the benefits I need and in the begging process have had to reach out to my Patient Advocate (which is a joke), my Congressman on two occasions, OIG on two occasions and am about to reach out to them again because service connection hasn’t been awarded for 6-post-op secondary disabilities that weren’t present before the surgery and didn’t start with treatment/medication until after my condition begain deterriorating Post-op! I am only 1 example as I am sure many others have experienced my plight first hand. We just feel at the mercy of the VA when we are confined like I am and rely solely on the VA and I’ll tell you personally, it is a daily, stressful experience which no doubt will lead to further decline based solely on the stress and depression I stay in.\nLYING SACK OF SH-T!!! Fire our hospital staff,REMOVE benefit at 65 no MONEY F-CKED on Medicare!! F-CK YOU TRUMPF SUCKING TRAITOR!\nLOL, the VA can help with that anger management but your TDS is terminal.\nLeave Terry alone. This is not funny.\nT rump is a fraud and so are his programs. All you are doing is dismantling the government to give muskrat and his friends more freedom to rob us. The day when we get tired of this is coming and you need to think about where you stand (hint, long term vision is better than short term).\nI think the administration is doing exactly what we voted for.\nYou have my support. 100% service related, Vietnam\nThat’s a bunch of crap! He is in Trump and Musk’s pocket\nWhat about the1,000 VA support personnel that are being cut? How will that affect our medical benefits?\nJames H. Donahue\nCAPT, USCG (ret.)\nit would be nice to see full Dental Benefits for all veterans , not just retired!!! Dental health is probably more important than anything as far as sickness goes. not having to rely on anti-biotics and painkillers because of improper oral hygiene would be a great plus for our overall health. i could use dentures or implants and a few more extractions to get healthier and an improved digestive system because of being able to chew food properly!!\nSecretary Doug Collins keep protecting Veterans benefits. Even my family says President Trump is going to cut your disability benefits. I say no they aren’t going to be cut. Secretary Collins keep up the good work. Lets take the money for luxury hotels for illegal aliens and take care of homeless veterans. George Miller Vietnam Veteran.\nMy 76 year old Viet Nam veteran husband called the VA yesterday (02/19/2025) for an appointment with his primary care physician and the earliest appointment he can get is for 08/01/2025!! AND the VA Eye Clinic is closed and not taking appointments at this time…..if this guy is trying to tell you that things are fine at the VA and deserving veterans are getting efficient and quality care, he is dead wrong and many of these veterans will be also with this type of care provided to them!!\nMa’am, this exact reason you explained above, is why Community Care exists. I couldn’t get an eye exam either, so I received a referral to get one at a civilian clinic. Just ask for the referral, and if the VA tries to give you a hard time, stand your ground. Also, if your husband cannot get an appointment in a reasonable amount of time with his PCP, again, have his PCP get a referral for your husband to see a physician in the community. This is what community care is for.\nHi, Donna, we’re sorry to hear about your husband’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nIt is sad to see that a Christian Chaplin would align himself with the likes of trump. When you earned your master’s degree in divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary you must have missed the day they taught Matthew 4:8-9. Because when trump offered “All these things I will give you” You choose to fall down and worship him (trump).\n“Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”\nI would love to be there on your judgement day and see you explain that decision you made to God.\nYou really should keep your political thoughts/feelings to yourself. “We the People” elected President Trump and he is doing “EXACTLY” what we asked him to do, like putting Doug Collins in as Sec of the Veterans Administration.\nsuck, suck, suck….taste good??\nIf there was a rumor going around my units that we were going to deploy, we deployed. I don’t know about everyone else, I just know what I know. Why would Veterans, Retirees and VA workers be on pins and needles for no reason. What about the “Women Clinics” closing due to DEI? Just our imagination? I’m going to wait and watch.\nIn fact doge is just a front for a fraudulent scheme and have illegally entered the government IT systems.\nA whole lot of worrying over nothing IMHO. DOGE, Musk and Trump do NOT want your money. They are not there copying all your info down (sheesh), ANYTHING to do with the VA is safe…including spouse stuff, etc. CALM down folks. STOP believing the lies.\nAnd to Richard L. That free time you speak of is due to your king sir..\nEither you are the VA website is a Liar ! The web page for Veterans announced at least 1000 people have Now Lost their Jobs but You sir Claimed No CUT BACKS have occurred!\nThank you so much. I am very apprciative of the work that DOGE is doing. It’s also reassuring to know that our benefits will be secure. Thank you, sir.\nI appreciated the video because it introduced me to the new Secretary. I appreciated Secretary Collins communicating his enthusiasm to take charge of the VA and his desire to allay the concerns of some Veterans. These concerns have been created because they have been duped in to believing what they read in newsprint and see on TV. It’s a significant challenge to educate them and build a confidence in the VA so they can know that the VA is getting its stuff together and can effectively help them get the help they need. Maintain the attack! VR–Leland Klein\nDear Mr. Secretary, how about dumping some of the crazy policies put in place last year under the previous administration, like child-proof hearing aid batteries! Sounds smart, but they’re Veteran Proof too!? Once opened, the VA provides pouches to store them in (not child-proof for sure! So, it makes it easier for a child to ingest a bunch of batteries, instead of one at a time! Please fix this & take a look at other things we deal with daily. You are much appreciated & I so appreciate you reaching out with the truth!\nHow can we trust that benefits will not be cut when DOGE shut down entire agencies without any evaluation of programs and mass firing without any justification, explaination or accountability? Yes, eliminating personnel reduces cost but has nothing to do with fraud, waste or abuse.\nI’m glad to hear that at least one part of the government isn’t being destroyed.\nSorry sir but the lies that have come out from the Republican administration do not give me comfort that your statement is truthful.\nDear Secretary McDonough,\nI am writing to bring to your immediate attention the unacceptable conditions at the Little Rock VA Medical Center. As someone who deeply values the well-being of our veterans, I am disturbed by the state of this facility and the substandard level of care being provided to those who have served our country.\nDuring recent visits, I have witnessed and received reports of the following issues:\nUnsanitary conditions, including dirty patient rooms, inadequate cleaning, and persistent maintenance problems.\nLong wait times for medical appointments and procedures, resulting in delayed treatment and worsening health conditions.\nStaffing shortages, leading to overworked healthcare providers and inadequate attention to patients.\nPoor facility conditions, including outdated equipment, broken infrastructure, and a general lack of upkeep.\nOur veterans deserve the highest standard of care, yet the conditions at this VA hospital suggest a failure to meet even basic medical and sanitary standards. I urge your office to take immediate action to investigate these concerns and implement necessary improvements.\nI respectfully request a formal response outlining what steps the VA will take to address these issues and ensure our veterans receive the dignified care they have earned. I am also willing to discuss this matter further and provide additional details as needed.\nThank you for your time and commitment to our nation’s veterans. I look forward to your prompt attention to this urgent matter..\nHi, Charles. Sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThe truth and nothing but the truth with our Veterans, Thank you Doug Collins for being transparent with the lying media(Cnn,Msnbc,etc..)\nAmen to that\nTo see so many veterans, who are helping other veterans, be fired from the VA (especially those helping prevent suicide) is disgraceful. To see our country’s leaders spewing lies and abandoning our allies makes me sick. I joined the Cold War Army and served 32 years, and never thought to see us capitulate to despots and believe their lies and propaganda.\nIndividual ratings equal 120 % , yet my overall VA rating is 80%. Cannot work due to TBI, PTSD issues yet the VA cannot see unemployable as they themselves won’t hire me.\nDont give up… They (current administration) want you to, and are likely going to try to change the way the Disability Ratings are Calculated and Evaluated to reduce them and “Save Money”. 2016- 2020 was a awful period to try to get a fair disability review done.\nHave you gone through the VSO in your county or the VFW? Don’t go through the VA yourself when trying to get benefits. A VSO in your county is the best thing you can do to receive benefits owed.\nWhy are you allowing a non-appointed civilian into the VA at all and allowing the minions to look around at our personal information. President Elon Musk should not be allowed through the doors of the VA. He is an immigrant and does not have the authority to be in Federal Buildings without an escort of some kind and to think that you or anyone would allow a group of teenagers and 20 somethings with computers into the building and snoop through personal records is shameful. Resist the ELON.\nI sure need to get my widows benefits…my husband Wayne Mosby passed away 09/06/2023. I would appreciate your help. Thank You\nThe questions is: Are our benefits going to be taken away in accordance with the Project 2025 guidance related to VA?? recommend reading it…\nThank you Secretary Collins for the video.\nI appreciate you clearing up some of the liberal media lies.\nThank you for working so hard to protect our Veteran benefits.\nBTW, The President’s Executive orders have not trickled down to all VA facilities yet.\nI still see VA employees using gender pronouns and LGBTQ flags at VA clinics.\nAs a Veteran and VA employee, I truly appreciate all the hard work this administration is doing to protect and defend the rights of conservative Americans that solely seek to follow Biblical Beliefs, God’s beliefs.\nAgain, many thanks\nIt is a matter of trust. Doug you took the first step in gaining my trust. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.\nDear Honorable Sec, V. A., Doug Collins,\nAnother Combat Wounded Veteran (CWV), has died today. Some CWV’s will die, as a cause of caustic or failed V.A. Medical Services. Some CWV’s, will fall prey to SUICIDE, (due to the same reason cited in the previous sentence), “ADDED,”‘ by THE IMPACT of the voluminous FLAWS, FAILURES, DEVASTATIONS, DISRUPTIONS, HORRIBLE DISASTERS, INSULTS, and THREATS, to We the People, and especially to we military veterans, that was willfully created by the EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, & ADMINISTRATION OFFICES-circa 2021-2024. Most of which was to repeat, and employ the antagonistic mantra of the “EXECUTIVE OFFICE-circa 2009-2016, TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AMERICA, from being OUR REPUBLIC, to a DESTRUCTIVE form of NWO-SOCIALISM.”\nThis depressed and overly stressed 80 y/o CWV (Vietnam 01/31/1968-@0200- TET’SURVIVER.), understands the opening paragraph WAS QUITE a RUN-ON SENTENCE…. but just the effort to cite a TRUTH … has given me calm, at least for the present moment. Though it is beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this CWV, has been the recipient of several VERY EGREDIOUS V. A. MEDICAL Services over the years, since I retied, relating to my never ending depression, dental, headaches, vision, and urinary tract V. A Medical Services, compound errors, that I must endure, as I am privileged, to survive with each new day my Creator THANKFULLY provides. Also with Gods love, mercy, forgiveness, direction and Guidance, to overcome my falling prey to suicide, while enduring so many emotional and destressing hardships, that has befallen on me over the years of writing that check, in Service to my Country.\nDoug Collins, Thank You for your service to Our Country, and I pray GOD SPEED your LEADERSHIP, Counsel, and CONSERNED DIRECTIONS to improve the present, V. A. Medical Services, especially to the many younger Veterans and CWV’s, that they will receive the best , and better, V. A. Medical Services, than was provided to us older CWV’s.\nHang in there young man, we are still above ground and for that we should be thankful. I am also a Vietnam Vet 66-67 SGT USMC with health issues related to my time in Vietnam, specifically tied to Agent Orange and I fight my health issues daily but I am thankful to God for he has kept me going all this time. I only started using the VA two years ago but they have been very helpful since I started using them. Hopefully Sec Collins will make the VA even better. You stay strong young man, you haven’t lived this long just to give up now. Thank you for your service and God Bless You. I will pray for you.\nI think we are going to be hurt financially and you know you are lying to us. Please stop telling people to tell us they thank us for our service this also hurts when it’s spoken with out sincerity\nOur concern is that the VA speeds up the approval for disability applicants\nF-ck your so full of bullsh-t Collins\nSure wish the VA would honor us vets that must keep medicare and supplemental medical insurance coverage. I pay over $450.a month for this as my two agent orange illnesses don’t rank me high enough for any none service related coverage. VA not honoring medicare is just a way for them to get more veteran at very low cost. Link up, please—-!!!\nI would have felt some belief in what you said if you hadn’t mentioned the draft dodging “orange felon” throughout your remarks\nI would like to know how hard are you going to get the Pact Act to cover burn pits for us Vietnam Vets? I would also like to know how hard you are going to push your former Representatives and Senators to pass the language correction initiative to the Pact Act, Section 804 being introduced this week by Representative Murphy and Senator Tillis?\nGreat.Democrat Media lies .\nSecretary Collins,\nAs a 2001 retired navy veteran, I want to thank you for the reassurance regarding veteran benefits.\nI am compelled to express concern on another matter, that being Elon Musk heading up DOGE. I consider it a conflict of interest for him to determine what is efficient use of my tax dollars while according to every source I read states he has to date received $18 billion tax dollars for SpaceX and Tesla.\nCould you look in to this or forward it to the appropriate government department please? Based on the various media sources I have read, it seems 47 (forgive the fact I have so little respect or value for him I refuse to even type his name) and Elon are collaborating on an agenda that is leading our nation to an end for democracy and towards a fascist state.\nThank you for your time and attention.\nIt’s about time that fraud and waste and silly DEI policies are rectified. Clearly instigators have to create false narratives to panic people.\nYou should know veterans fall under DEI as well. Diversity, Equality, Inclusion. That is why places are able to give “points” in the hiring process for Veterans.\nNot convinced. I predict that within six months we’ll see movement toward privatizing veteran’s healthcare or limiting it to combat vets.\nSince this guy is a trump appointee, I don’t believe a word he is saying. You said the magic word privatizing.\nSince you suffer from terminal TDS, I don’t believe a word you are saying. Sit back and immerse yourself in more Rachael Madcow, MSDNC, CNN, etc. Pathetic. Must really suck to have absolutely zero deductive reasoning. Hope you are able to reconnect to reality.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins\nI have listened to what you had to say and if you are truly ready to help Veterans then please contact me via the following email address. This address is one that I rarely use but I do check for answers to questions I submitted to other organizations.\nI am a veteran that has extreme difficulty getting around and I do need Community Care but currently the Northern California Health Care System could care less and in most cases have denied Community Care even though it was approved before. I do have Tri-Care For Life as part of my retirement benefits from the military and I have begun a transition back to Tri-Care to make sure I receive the care I need.\nAugustus, we’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWe were lied to about Vietnam and have been lied to since about defoliants end results. Many of us have AO related problems that VA keeps denying after numerous claims we have put in…backed by DAV…I learned early on to never trust anything the govt. says…and I sure as heck don’t believe anything coming out of the White House, or Congress,anymore.\nWho are the DOGE people reviewing VA contracts and what expertise do they have in federal contract administration.\nWill the VA post the specific contracts being identified by DOGE for elimination or reduction.\nHow many VA personnel (federal employees) has DOGE identified that their positions are being eliminated and what services did these personnel provide.\nYour administration has promised transparency in these actions, and thus far I have seen none. Promises that VA benefits will not be impacted without evidence is poor assurance.\nYour effectiveness as an advocate for veterans is yet to be proven.\nNow let’s see if he means it or if he tells alternative facts/untruths.\nHe is full of sh-t.\nJust wait and see what Bone Spurs does to the VA. Already fired over 1000 workers in a time the VA is understaffed and trying to hire skilled workers. The closest thing that we see to a real Dr is a NP or a PA. And they don’t stay around for long . They are the real benefit we receive but if you can’t hire them or they are fired, we are f-cked. Which we are as of now.\nSo Doug, you just keep spewing the same sh-t that comes out of Bone Spurs and let’s just see how successful you really are.\nSay hello to Elon. That POS.\nPlease Please look into LOWERING COMMISSARY PRICES at Ft Bragg, NC…(other bases too) MANY of the grocery prices are higher than the civilians counterpart grocery stores. THEN on top of grocery prices…we pay an additional “6% building fee” which is a tax no matter what its called. The VA has so much buying power…seems the buying contracts need looking into.. Meat (beef)Prices are especially high.. At Ft Bragg/Camp Mackall we have so many Active duty soldier families & Veterans..there has to be a away to LOWER prices at commissaries across-the-board. Thanks for ALL that you are doing! :)\nJust curious then. If commissary prices are higher than grocery stores, why not go to the grocery stores? That’s what I’ve done whenever I lived near bases. Commissary prices are ALWAYS higher. Also, this man’s job is not in the scope of reducing grocery prices at the commissary. The commissary is under a different department. He’s in charge of the VA. Groceries have increased in all stores, commissary or not.\nI responded to my call of duty in 1967 spent 1 year carrying m60 machine gun in Viet Nam, paid my dues, just like thousands of veterans and a 100 % disabled, no draft dodger and or billionaire should have right to to attack military veterans who provided them the right and freedom they have enjoy today . keep veterans in your mind daily, not these idiots that that want to screw us and never served . Keep in mind veterans are going to stand up and for there right as this administration is mirror Russia more and more on a daily admiring Putin, pardon me if you voted for trump, but this is happing on your watch\nThis video is a shamefully political plug for Trump and DOGE. It begins typically by blaming the media for running with stories that they just aren’t commonly running that benefits will be cut. I read a wide range of mainstream media across the political spectrum on a daily basis and have not encountered a single story about veteran benefits being cut, but Secretary Collins probably found one somewhere. Collins doesn’t cite a single source or example and then builds a cringe-worthy political endorsement on a falsehood. Keep our military apolitical!\nWhat don’t our veterans need? They have sacrificed life and limb to fight our wars! What could possibly be cut back? How much is it going to cost for the cooperation of the VA. I am concerned to say the least.\nI am concerned that they may cut our DIC benefits. My husband did 2 tours in Vietnam, he wasn’t drafted and spent 20 yrs in the USMC and died of Agent Orange.\nTouching our DIC would impact so many families who sacrificed their loved ones.\nYou can cut the two employees that ask the Covid questions at the door of the clinic. There are more screeners than patients. That would save millions.\nNeed to look into the Biloxi/pensacola VA. they do not understand how Community care works! “8 months to get orthotics. Finally after sending an email I had a supervisor repsond and flat out tell me so many employee do not show up for work an when the do they don’t work. This awesome supervisor and transfering beause she can’t take the extra hours doing others work anymore\nHi, David, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank goodness as my health care needs improved.\nI feel that we have to give up our benefits just to keep Trump happy. That is a no no, we did not volunteer to go to Vietnam in 1966, we were ordered to go and came back not the same. As secretary of Veterans Affairs are you representing the veterans to help them keep their benefits. There is going to be a lot of Veterans in an uproar and Marching on Capitol Hill. Trump can give up part of his pay since he is a veteran. You have veterans that can not work to pay their bills and and other necessities. Veterans work hard and came back injured and now we have a billionaire in white house giving advice to our so called Cammander in Chief , sticking his nose in our benefits we earned, they belong to us the veterans.\nTrump is NOT a veteran. In fact he used connections to dodge Vietnam.\nJust like Clinton avoided military service, just like Bush avoided military service, just like Biden dodged military service, etc, etc. Oh and by the way, President does NOT accept one penny of his salary as President. He donates it. The only president to ever do that.\nWell said!\nHe is also the only president who openly takes bribes – totally corrupt – hence the 34 felony convictions; wastes millions of $$ golfing more days than not, steals from charities, is notorious for never paying his bills, believes he is a king, calls Veterans ‘suckers & losers’, has total disdain for the military, lies about pretty much everything….. but sure, stay in the cult until he throws you under the bus because he will.\nVeteran, well said, Trump is a charlatan idiot and so are all his MAGA followers.\nSOMEONE SHOULD EVALUATE THE HOSPITAL IN DECATUR , GEORGIAN…THE FACILITY IS OLD AND FILTHY…THE TROOPS DESERVE BETTER…..\nThank you, VA Secretary Doug Collins! It is great to hear directly from you about what is the truth. I wish other Secretary’s would do the same. I am a 23 year Navy veteran and was less than a month from being cleared as Program Analyst probationary for the Federal Aviation Administration (Aviation Safety) and was just terminated last Feb 14, 2025.\nI am one of three who review and process the medical exams for the Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) here in the Pacific Northwest (we take care of seven states). Program Analysts along with the Flight Surgeons ensure that our ATC’s are medically qualified and we issue their medical clearances before they can control air traffic. Our job is critical as we protect the “safety of our national airspace”. Our Regional Flight Surgeon along with the Federal Air Surgeon is trying to get me back but they are not making any promises. In my opinion, it is about time that someone look into all the fraud, waste, and abuse in our government.\nPresident Trump and DOGE should have done things differently as far as letting people go. It is a long process to get hired for a federal position and then in a blink of an eye just get terminated. A blank statement of, “DOT FAA finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the DOT FAA would be in the public interest” is totally inaccurate and contradictory to what was submitted to HR, “I certify that the performance, conduct, and general traits of character of this employee have been\nfound satisfactory and recommend that the employee be retained beyond the probationary period.”\nThere are a number of veterans who want to keep serving our government (single parent and those who moved to another state etc.) and at the end of the day, this is the thank you that we deserve? We the People…\nSir, I don’t believe that our VA is being served by the current occupant of Maralago and his henchmen scraping our data, destroying beloved institutions, leaving this once great land into some future serfdom.\nPlease reimplement customer service feedback for each VA encounter so veterans can address issues (good and bad) at the time of occurrence. An advocate should review these feedbacks and address, resolve, or elevate, any issues raised.\nAnd what of survivors benefits?\nSecretary Collins,\nWhile I understand that you are a political appointee, serving the men, women, and family’s of the US military veteran community and the Civil Servants who work for the VA must come first.\nThose members and families are from all walks of life. They come from every Political party. Every State. Every Religion. They may be Gay or straight. They may have voted for Trump. They may have voted for someone else.\nThe one and only thing that should concern you is taking care of them.\nYou talk as if the men and women of your Department are the enemy.\nYou pay homage to President Trump multiple times in this video.\nYou use propaganda and misdirection to avoid having to address and answer real and relevant questions.\nYou try to convince everyone that “The Washington media.” is at fault, that they are manipulating us, and that they are not to be trusted. You are spreading propaganda and stoking the fires of distrust.\n“They take a possibility, and then run with the story.”\nSo using your approach, if the media reported about the four 12 December, 2024 Proposals submitted to the CBO, about reducing, cutting, eliminating, means testing, and taxing our Disability Benefits, you would claim what?\nYou clearly make the claim that they should not report this information as a possibility.\nAnd yet they have been developed, written, and submitted for review to determine how much money could be eliminated from Disability Benefits, in order to fund “OTHER” budgetary priorities, such as pre planned tax cuts. These Tax cuts, as proposed, have been determined to disproportionately benefit the small percentage of U.S citizens in the upper echelons of income.\nBut you say that this “Possibility” should not be disclosed, or shared or reported.\nI find this greatly concerning.\nIn my humble opinion, you are coming across like a used Car Salesman, Yes Man, who lacks the courage and willpower to be anything but a placeholding marionette. Someone else controls the strings and the words that come out of your mouth.\nYou need to be a Leader worthy of the position you hold.\nI’ll believe this when I see it.\nI know for a fact that claims have not been moving faster. With the PACT Act there are more claims needing attention and VA was hiring but on a hiring freeze and looking to terminate those who were hired in the past two years. Stop lying to us..\nOverall my experience in scheduling an appointment has been from 1 to 10, I give it a 6.\nI have used the VA for the last 55 years and always had the same criticism. The telephone answering system where you are transferred from one extension to another showed a lack of caring:\nthe attitude is to transfer the call to someone else where you have to give the same personal information over and over again\nAlso, the specialty clinics are understaffed so the average wait time for an appointment is 3 weeks and up. meanwhile, the person is in pain.\nWell the people who work at the VA are on pins and needles day to day. Did you tell them what you just said in this video? They are waiting for the other shoe to drop. Musk and Trump both want to go after the VA. What about the one thousand people who were already let go?\nI see the hateful boomers are in full swing talking trash about our president. You can clearly see that they have way to much free time to watch cnn or any other main stream media like NPR. You folks need to get outside and pull the talking points that you regurgitate out of your behinds.\nGrow up, you are being spiteful and regurgitating lies.\nStop it.\nFocus on helping veterans and keep your gross political views to yourself.\nSF\nAre you a veteran? Are you concerned about your earned benefits? The current actions being taken by this administration are clearly evident as not in the best interests of the VA employees and the veterans. You better read the Project 2025 chapter on the VA and then wait and see what occurs. We have a right to be concerned about what is happening, Considering the Russian relationship and unqualified individuals being placed in the Cabinet positions. Currently serving Republican Congress are not doing their job, they need to go. The Constitution I swore to defend is under attack.\nyou are disrespectful….\nYou must be disillusioned and not able to think for yourself. Disrespectful is what is happening to our country right now. I am vewry concerned….Illegal access to the Treasury Dept. The firing of a person because they are in a 1 yr prob period. Calling himself “KING”. Individuals in Musks employment being placed in every Department to observe and report on activities. Ignoring the Constitution. Who knows how much of the peoples money DOGE employees will steal from the Treasure. The bottom line here is the VA is important to a lot of people and the benefits matter, so I have issue with ANYBODY trying to reduce them or take them away, You should to, IF you are a veteran.\nI am a Veteran, I am a employee of the Fed Gov, I am a retired Veteran. I am not foolish enough to hope that Trump is going to care about me or any benefits I have earned. I am not lazy, I am not stupid, I have put 40 years of Service into this country. Who are you??\nSecretary Collins,\nI appreciate you sharing this video. In the video, you mentioned there will be no cuts to benefits. So to clear it up for everyone reading the news, these comments, Project 2025, and Agenda 47, I have a few questions.\n1. Will Veterans who are or will be social security retirement age lose any of their service-connected benefits. There are different posts out there that reference portions of Project 2025 that calls for them to be reduced to 30% or lose 30% (go from like 100% to 70%)?\n2. Since DEI is being eliminated in the VA does this mean that women’s clinics and women specific doctors and procedures disappear from the VA Medical Center System?\n3. Will Veterans who receive military retirement and VA disability compensation be put back to a pre-2005 timeframe where you could not draw both at the same time?\n4. Will Veterans who can’t prove their injury was directly related to work while in the military not be afforded service-connected disability anymore?\nThe hypocrisy will kill you!\nSome Trump supporters are actually intelligent people. The problem is years of right wing propaganda have them brainwashed.\nPlease STOP with the political garbage on this site. That’s not what this site is for. I voted for President Trump and I am “NOT” brainwashed.\nMy disabilities total 130% but my benefit payment is 80% due to the VA convoluted combined ratings formula. Also my colon cancer is not an agent orange presumptive despite what the American Cancer Society says. Perhaps the new director could look into these anomalies.\nThe Bill above my comment is a different Bill than me.\nWHY does it take 25 years to get an answer about my claim and you say you are working quick\nI had no doubt that the Trump admin was going to take care of veterans and keep their promises. That phony media machine is incapable of telling the truth. It was under the first Trump admin that I finally got some of my benefits expedited. Everything has been on hold for the last four years and now the needle is moving again. Thank you Mr. Collins.\nShould we join the January 6 “patriots” and surround the DC pig pen and show our disappointment with the Trump musk man love team? Neither one wore fatigues for our great nation which is why they’re tearing it apart. Don’t drink the kool aid!\nNo, this time they wouldn’t label them “patriots.” You’d be thrown in jail as an “insurrectionist” or told to get a job.\nIt’s great that you are addressing concerns of many but don’t tell me that you are above trump/musk in making decisions that may affect many veterans. I wouldn’t believe anything these days because truth and integrity seems to have no place in government.\nWish the VA video was shareable!\nIs any of my personally identifiable information being shared with DOGE personnel? Will it ever be unsecured?\nThank you so much Secretary Collins for clarifying, although I’m not surprised. Thankful to have people in charge that care about us folk!\nwhy is the VA allowing a vender set up in the lobby of the Loma Linda California VA hospital and sell his wares of military hats, shirts license plates holders etc ALL MADE IN CHINA!!!!! as a Vietnam vet i find this very offensive. is this allowed in all VA hospitals??\nThank you, not knowing what the DOGE is or can do is confusing. Please continue to keep us informed.\nThank you for standing up for the veterans benefits and I wish you well as the Secretary of this department. We need a strong VA secretary.\nWe shall see. I have learned to not hold my breath, as it seems to be sucked out of me with every inspiration of a new president.\nyou have a very serious credibility problem\nIf you are cutting personnel you are cutting services. That’s all there is to it. The organization is already understaffed, just because it’s doing better doesn’t mean its up to snuff and removing human capital endangers the work already done. The people at DOGE know nothing about veterans, healthcare or our needs. Get them out and lead, don’t let them run some AI search and cut needed contracts because they trigger some 1984-esque word ban.\nYou’ve been there a week. Nothing you’ve done has impacted a veteran out here in the world. You may have a concept you think may work, but “clearing cases” absolutely is nothing you can take credit for. We don’t need that officer sunshine blown up our asses. We need results. Post another atta-boy-me when you’ve actually done something that shows you helped us. Cutting staff certainly isn’t going to get you there. Soon we’ll be back to 1 million backlogged compensation claims like it’s 2013 all over again. Freezing hiring won’t either, as the turn-over rate for the VA is high.\nI wanted to watch this video to see about potential cuts to my VA benefits, not to hear a speech about how wonderful donald Trump is. Stop the maga ra ra bullshit, you are suppose to represent ALL veterans, not just the ones who voted for trump, and Elon has no business looking at my imformation, period!\nJust entered VA Health Care system after retirement. VA care givers are pleasant to deal with but the VA system is not connected very well in my opinion. I only have Kaiser Health to compare it to. I have been chasing MRI/X-rays for both knees and legs for two months which was ordered by the surgeon in December and I have exhausted myself to the point of thinking about leaving the VA health and paying for part B Medicare. Anything outside of general care by primary doctor is a challenge with no follow up or phone calls on next steps. The only real help I have received to resolve my issues came from La Shawn at the Clinical contact center.\nis there any truth to the idea that for every 4 people leaving the VA ya’ll can only hire 1 replacement?? also , is the government trying to Privatize the VA???\nYou’re a rubber stamp for your one and true god TRUMP. You’re a disgrace to the humans you’ve served with and the ones who continue to serve in the US armed forces and the VA.\nYou cannot guarantee anything! We don’t believe you! You serve your god as a chaplain while simultaneously erasing humans careers, retirements, and the ability to live. Service to our country is a noble duty so many of us have all taken on, IT DOESN’T matter what you identify as. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE.\nI like Doug Collins! He’s on the same wavelength as President Trump! No nonsense, straight talk, an honest love for America…back to good old COMMON SENSE!\nLet me know how you feel about all that in a year.\nI have great hope and belief that President Trump and his administration, to care for all people.\nPlease explain why retired military (Veterans) lose their “Tricare 4 life” benefits if they do not pay into MEDICARE part B. If a veteran is 100% disabled, (service connected) why does he/she need MEDICARE?\nIf VA is the “primary provider” why do Veterans need Medicare B?\nI’ve performed a little research on Medicare Part B in comparison to Veterans healthcare, and Part B is required to be paid by a majority of others also obtaining other exquisite Government/Military benefits, with those individuals being pretty much ordered to pay.\nHowever, those separated are typically not ordered to pay into Medicare Part B. Reading in between the lines, if the boss of a company is not paying into it’s employees’ healthcare plan (eg. Medicare Part B), how can he/she legitimately supervise those below them for whom are (struggling/risking health and) paying into Medicare Part B. On the flip, maybe I’m just giving the system an excuse, but seems only logical as owners of companies can easily exploit the system, having the system paying for their everyday careless mistakes from subsequent employee health injuries.\nAlso noteworthy, keep an eye on something called guaranteed healthcare. VA healthcare is not guaranteed, to a certain extent, and can likely be cut at anytime, forcing the individuals back into the civilian Medicare healthcare whelm. I don’t like gambling, and guessing those at risk (eg. non-service connected) should probably sign-up with Medicare Part B.\nFunny thing, nobody preaches the above requisites. Obviously though, Medicare Part B is expensive for the vast majority, and it is sometimes a decision between food on the table and a roof over your head; with a hell of a lot of other people wanting and taking from you, whether time or money.\nWith Trump lying so much, I dont believe nothing. When you say resolve the VA claims, do you mean fairly or like with Ukraine?\nPlease dont touch the benefits I EARNED. They were NOT given to me.\nI have a case that has been at the board of of appeals since February 22 waiting to be heard by a Federal Judge with a case number that has not been heard yet. I am a 100% Veteran and I get the same ole story every time I call about it. My spouse is drawing aid and attendance for taking care of me now. What seems to be the problem just asking. It seems that to me that veterans are getting put on the back burner hoping we will die before anything is done and it is too late. Sir for so many years we gave everything for our country and now when we need help we can’t get it or those that work for VA think they are giving us something for free that have never served or sacrificed as we did.Sorry for the rant but that’s how mostly all of us Vets feel.\nI am a 23 year Vietnam Veteran, who has had his life shortened by doing the right thing for our country. I am 100% disabled due to Agent Orange, which was lied to us that it would not effect us in any way, thank you President Lyndon B. Johnson, a POS democrat. After reading some of the comments on this post, I am amazed at how out of touch so many of these vets are with reality. They say that their benefits have been cut, and they have under the Biden Administration. Trump in his first term extended benefits for us. He has been in office a whole 6 weeks, and has cut so much graf out of the tax payers budget, not the VA budget, and will cut more bulls##t out of the ash and trash that Biden introduced in his kickback schemes during his first four years. I am from a small Oklahoma town, and my small VA clinic has seen more improvements in the last two month than it has seen in the last four years. Calling Trump a lier and boggyman is so far from the truth, and as for GODE, Trump would have never introduced it if he didn’t think it would benefit the citizens of this United States. He sure as hell isn’t doing it for the money, he didn’t even accept one pay check the last time. I suggest that before you go around and bash the President, do your homework first. And yes I voted for him….. twice and I do not regret it. As for you nay sayers, get a grip, get a life.\nSPOT ON RUDY\nYOU ARE CORRECT! Thanks for your Service, Rudy!\nYou’re lying. Benefits might not get cut for now, but access to care will slow as workers are indiscriminately fired. Firing all probationary employees WILL leave a mark and since the Department of Gaslighting Everyone is rummaging around in data banks of sensitive information, it’s only a matter of time before some poorly supervised stooge steals it or leaves some back door to be exploited later when all the commotion is over. You’re not fooling anybody.\nStop watching MSNBC, Mr. Thorne.\nI was feeling pretty good until I saw the word “DOGE”. They do not do anything positive and are only out to destroy.\nWell, if you read Project 2025 and make it to page 646 there is a discussion of what to do about the budget. This section is heavily focused on cost-cutting and infrastructure reform and they call the existing VA Healthcare campuses unaffordable and inefficient. With that in mind they want to cut them and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).\nSo, close the big campuses (hospitals).\nProject 2025 is about cost savings, not about improving your experience with something you earned by risking life and limb for your country.\nThank you for calling this out so clearly Jay. Project 2025 is no joke and calls out the “cost savings” that all Trump’s cronies envision. They tried to outsource and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in the first term and are making a renewed effort to do it now.\nShifting our care to CBOCs means longer waits and receiving care from providers who often don’t understand the unique needs of Veterans. The time to write to your elected representatives is NOW, especially if you reside in a district that voted for Trump, to reach out to your Representative and Senators to let them know you do not want your benefits cut. You can find them here: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\nI’m glad you can fall into lockstep with your man fRump. Oh nevermind he has heel spurs so he can’t do anything anywhere near the military. I don’t think you have any idea what DOGE is doing especially in other locations. I hope you don’t F… up the veterans benefits but right now you can’t be trusted either.\nCollins is full of sh-t, like a typical MAGA f-cktard. He is part of the push to privatize the VA and sell it to Wall Street and Elon Musk. F-ck him, f-ck Musk, f-ck Trump. These scavengers are traitors.\nYou got that right Mr. Paul!\nReply-Russell It seems everyone on here is waiting.There is no need in being nasty, sounds like you are mad at the world. Mr Collins has only been in the job a week\nGold Star Wife\nIf you want to thank me for my service properly fund the VA Health Care System. Fill the medical staffing positions that have been cut. Take care of veterans. Meet your contractual obligations. Thank you.\nSec. Collins, I’m very excited to be working for the VA under your leadership. I should receive my start date this week. I’m a Master electrician in the state of Washington looking forward to applying my expertise at the Vancouver Washington campus. I’m also an Air Force veteran like yourself. Keep up the great work you’re achieving and thank you on behalf of all veterans.\nDon’t speak on my behalf. Stick your own head up his -ss if you want, but don’t drag me in there with you.\nDOGE is not part of our Congressional government. It was not officially authorized or funded by congress.\nVA has been short of people for a very long time, then we’re finally authorized to build their staff so more veterans could get help and quicker. Now these no nothings about VA health care come in and start down sizing.\nCollins is just another Trump minion doing what he’s told to do. Not a real LEADER for the VA. No substance to his video other than, just believe him.\nActuallly Tim, DOGE was started under Obama under a different name, the United States Digital Service. The more you know…\nHow do SES (Senior Executives) within the VA get their own flag? 90% of the work done at VA is by rank and file employees. I agreed w/ Trump when he said “drain the swamp.” Our Union (AFGE) agreed with him as well, however “the swamp” is at the top. I supported Trump up until Jan 6.\nSES employees at the top making $200,000.00 a year for doing nothing for Veterans at all. This was especially prevalent within the VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration) where managers (“coaches”) were sent to central office in DC just to screw the system up worse. I worked for VBA for 26 years. Here’s and idea for Elon/DOGE – put EVERY employee on production and have them account for their workday just like I had to for 20+ years.\nI trust this guy less than a second lieutenant with a map. Anyone believe this crap? Protect yourself and your family. Back up all your information and medical records. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is a wrecking ball that doesn’t have the benefit of knowing what he is wrecking, and he doesn’t care about you or anyone else but trump.\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI work for the VA and can tell you they gutted a lot of Compensation depts to give to Contractors instead, contractors were never supposed to be doing the bulk of these exams. Now they get to make decisions no appeal, they make appointments for Veterans but don’t tell them and then say they never showed to the appointment. The project 2025 already said they were going to “look” at Benefits, you know what that means I don’t trust any thing this puppet says!\nSounds good, but how can you believe what any person trump appoints says. They are only saying what trump tells them to say, when trump’s actions indicate differently. A reduction in funding and removing 1000 employees can only increase wait times for appointments and treatments, adding to the workload of the already over worked and stressed VA staff. Upto now, at the VA hospital in Louisville kentucky, I have had excellent care and treatment with respect as a Veteran. I would hate to see the quality of care regress to what it was several years ago, when Veterans were not recieving timely care and would die. If this would happen, it would not the fault of the VA staff and employees, but trump’s and his appointments.\nThis does not address any transparency issues. This continues to devalue the role of news press, which is their role to inform the people of what our government is doing. I don’t see improvement in VA benefits, nor facilities. Your job is to ensure Veterans are getting the care they deserve based on their sacrifices for this Republic. They swore an oath to defend the constitution, not a king, nor his servants.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nUnfortunately this was posted as a reply… this is to the VA Secretary.\nBiden’s administration passed the PACT act and my local VA hospital was running smoothly and efficiently. At the time, I said that any vet who voted for, in Tammy Duckworth’s memorable nickname for him, “Cadet Bonespurs,” had to be insane. It turned out that more than 60% of you voted the for peabrain. You reap what you sow.\nRich, you cannot believe everything you hear on MSNBC. Set back and watch, see what President Trump does and THEN you can comment with some authority. “We the People” voted for President Trump and he is doing exactly what he said he would do, what “We the People” asked him to do. Why are you so upset, young man ? President Trump has only been in office for a few weeks, lets give him a chance before you condemn him.\nThank you for your service\nSemper Fi\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67 100% disabled\nCommunity Care services is a absolute disaster , appointments on wrong g days and locations as well as no regard for patients available and made aware of at last minute !!!!\nDon’t believe them. President Musk & Trump are proven liars. Please remember the oath you took to protect our country’s vets.\nI was wounded twice in Vietnam, one sustained from a bouncing betty mine and one from an incoming mortar. Got neither purple heart, it’s been 58 years without benefits deserved, toughie shitski no?!!\nRespectfully, Secretary Doug Collins?! Do you really believe that anyone trust what you say in this video. You were appointed by a criminal, liar, cheater, stealer, and everything that goes against the core values on the US military. Your message is not very asurring and somewhat unprofessional when addressing the men, women and transgender community volunteers of our military forces. FAKE NEWS sir! You sound like a MAGA (not a republican) mouthpiece for a PODUS (the New King of the US) that should have been locked up and sentenced to jail, just like any other American in the US who has committed the same or like type crimes. Best wishes to you and a an empire that is getting ready to fall, just like the Romans did from greed, crimes against people, emperialist, and capitalism at the expense of tax payers dollars.\nRetired US Navy Officer, please take your Left wing political garbage somewhere else, it’s not wanted here. Not what this site is for.\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67\nI don’t trust anyone appointed by trump, and that’s the way it is.\nI know it’s all made up by the media. You’re trump’s nominee so I don’t expect anything else from you. They will be making adjustments to the VA for “efficiency” This will change some benefits that Veterans receive and some of changes will not be in the best interest of Veterans. I hope you will make another video when these changes are implemented and explain why these changes are for the benefit to veterans. And by the way the administration stated they are using the 2025 Plan that most likely make changes for Veterans.\nI’ve had a claim pending since Oct, 2024. This guys is politician he is only telling what he is told to do to keep his job.\nGiven the fact that nobody knows what Doggy is doing and the capricious nature of this admin’s actions, I have no faith in anything that was said here. The US has a long history of screwing over veterans and this will be just another chapter in that book dating back to Washington and the first Congress denying promised pensions.\nI served 6 years, part of which was during war. I used my private insurance for my health care until after I retired . It would be good to realize that all of us veterans were trained to look out for those around us first and ourselves last. When I needed my VA benefits was when the cost of my regular healthcare threatened to take all of my substantial savings. I applied and was granted VA healthcare in recognition of my service. My medication bills went from over $1,800 per quarter to less than $100 for the same period. Keep in mind that many vets have always done what I did. We put off using our benefits until after we retired. That means the population of veterans who are being seen by the VA are more likely to have chronic diseases and need care for problems that require far more attention than the average American.\nThank-you President Trump and Secretary Collins! Most Veterans appreciate everything you’re doing.\nIf you don’t like what President Trump and DOGE are doing, it’s probably because you’re a recipient of the FRAUD, WASTE & ABUSE they are finding.\nNot hard to believe, you love trumps delusions. Sad part is his dislike for vets, especially those, who have been wounded. Cannot be seen in a parade, where the president may be seen in a photo. And to think he could not serve, due to his little toe problems. Stop with the false bullsh-t of expecting them to clean up the abuse issues. Lest we forget, the 4 trillion tax breaks for the Rich. I guess you would not mind giving, your\nretirement benefits to the cause? Would you? AJ Duke.\nSincerely Mr Collin’s (VA Secretary) with all due Respect…Congratulations on your Appointment of the Greatest most powerful Nation of Veterans in the World, but with that being said, We will hold you accountable & responsible for protecting our Benefits & Healthcare for all of This United States Veterans…Our livelihood & Healthcare depends on your commitment & Decisions as our VA Secretary ( Again the Greatest Veterans & Fighting Force in the World) DOGE Is only a Word to us Veterans & it should be to you also..Congratulations Again (Actions Speak Louder Than Words) Thank You & God Bless\nplease check my va-hotline message which explains in detail what change i feel should be made to help vets like that don’t want to be buried in a national cemetary. in my case i am 91 and already paid 11000.00 to prepare my remains to be burried next to my mother and father at a cemetary [ not va burial cemetary} and presently provisions othe than a upright stone and military ceremony are available to me . it is not fair i am sure there are many vets doing the same with no financial help..legislation should chang e to help vets like me doing the same expenses before they die. thank you peter pace\nGet up off your knees and raise your head.

I believe you and am glad you both will make the VA an efficient, well oiled machine! God bless you, your families and the USA!\nThis is a bunch of propaganda! I better not see my benefits cut.\nTravel reimbursement for La Jolla VA Travel is taking longer. last year it would take 2 weeks or less, now it is taking over a month. Why is this?\nThere’s a problem sitting in La Jolla for more than two weeks?\nHi, John. We’re sorry to hear about your experience.

I don’t think so.\nWhile I believe Secretary Collins that there are no Vet benefits being cut, I don’t believe much the rest of the BS he spouts. There have already been cuts to VA staff, including some who are Vets. Allowing Musk and his band of tech geniuses access to anything to do with the VA is ludicrous. I was on active duty in the Army from 3 May 1967 to 23 December 1970, which included two tours in Vietnam. While I was doing that, Trump was nursing his heel spurs and avoiding the Draft. Collins appears to have much more loyalty to Trump than to me and my Brother and Sister Vets.\nThe company that I work for does a lot of work at New York VA facilities. The waste I see is unbelievable, mostly due to laziness and lack of knowledge and using the system. I heard firsthand that two overhead garage doors had to be replaced at the facility. The facility super was given the task of getting a price. Several local contractors were asked for prices the best price was $18,000. Since the contractor was on the VA’S list of approved contractors, they had to go thru an already approved Veteran Contractor. The price turned out to be $32,000 dollar to do the same job. The contractor that showed up to do the job was the same contractor whose original price was $18,000. Waste at the VA.\nSo wastefulness from contractors and not the federal employees. That is what federal employees always say. Their hands are tied as to what to buy from whom and entering into contracts. But, will they actually deal with contracting fraud and abuse, of course not! That would be auditing accounts of big companies like Boeing and Space X all the way down to small companies like the one you mentioned.\nI am a VA patient with the Seattle VA Medical Center. I do not believe a thing coming from the mouth of a Trump appointee. DOGE is a hit job on the entire government by a non-elected, power-hungry oligarch. I will not be holding my breath for the “improvements” to care that this man describes. What I look forward to is a return to sanity in the federal government, a government not headed by a complete incompetent. In the interim, I will wait for the knock on my door from the goon squad.\nSpent 56 minutes on hold Tuesday for a 1 minute conversation to schedule annual eye exam.

And I am 90% compensated since 06. As a beneficiary, YOU DO YOUR PART and the VA will do theirs.\nBy retirement in 2014 I had had my fill of babysitting grown-ass male and female and a handful of other than” Soldiers who could not even tell you their contractional MSO nor their ETS! Bitching and whining about being told what to do. YOU tell the VA what YOU need, WHY you need it, PROVE it and it happens.\nDont step up and simply say, “my computer’s BROKE”, for example! It was NEVER Uncle Sugar’s job to hold yer and hand and coddle You!\n@Flightj – that is because he is a “There we are then” person, purposely appointed by MAGA, the future King Trump or Vance of the USA. Definitely NOT TRUE Republicans. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/twat?q=TWAT\nGet the phone system at the Malcom Randall Hospital FIXED!\nVA disability needs a overhaul In how they determine vets are service connected. Range of motion is not the “ONLY” way to determine one has lasting injuries just because it helps weed out claims so the government can turn their back on veterans. Thats one instance. Hearing loss – you put anyone in a soundproof box and then turn on sounds, of course you can hear them, but if your in the real world this doesn’t apply. In the real world so many other sounds are also going on that make hearing at a loss and not how we used to hear prior to military. Some age does apply and that could be taken into effect, but the current system is flawed. Only able to apply for one Mental issue? So if i have PTSd and also a mental aspect due to pain in another area, they cannot be applied together? sorry pick one. The whole program needs to be overhauled to help protect veterans. We waste a whole day for a simple dr visit if we go to the VA and the people working dont give 2 sh-ts about us. Then to get seen out in town by a truly qualified Dr not trying to just save a buck and push pills, well no way. Denied. or if on the choice program, We shouldn’t have to go get pre approval to see my choice if my out in town doctor determines i need treatment. How about if you get 12 visits to a chiro, but chiro says you need more. Denied. you should be fixed by now. Just ignore all future request that are sent in. Its a basic waste of resources and funds to keep the VA. Just give us the ability to go in town to our own choice of Doctor to be seen and get healed in our manner, Even if not the typical doctor pushing pills and its one that uses natural medicine or plant medicine to cure.\nThis man is a Trumper. I dont believe a word he says and I am very concerned about my veteran benifits\nThank you for putting that video out. I liked the “to the point” straightforwardness of your comments. It does make me feel more at ease hearing the truth.\nDurham VA dental clinic does not answer their phone nor do they return voicemail calls.

I have a disability case that as gone on for about 1 yr. I am now type 2 diabetes. This should be a slam dunk because of agent orange. The VA turned me down this first time. I appealed and they admitted their error and it’s still has not been resolved. This shows that cases are not getting done quickly.\nThey never have! They are understaffed and the Feds are not in the business to approve any case easily as the VA is the second highest spending in the government.\nWhen you allowed Musk (a fascist and Na–)-and his band of juvenile hackers, access to our VA data – you already betrayed the Veteran community. Your slick videos and worthless press releases will never gain you the credibility and respect that is essential to lead. Project 2025 targets Veterans benefits. We are not stupid -we can read. I suggest you reread your oath to the Constitution. As a Veteran, from a Family of Veterans – I cannot imagine why any sane person would support a convicted felon, rapist, draft dodger as our CIC. A person who has absolutely no respect or appreciation for service – and openly mocks disabled Veterans, will never, ever be worthy of respect. Do better.\nI felt like you were trying to sell me a car and slash the prices. And by the way DOGE is not an official department. All you idiots think that two billionaires care about low income and middle class workers. They are the reincarnation of capitalism and the abolishment of government. Guess what ?! The VA is government! Supported by federal money! You sir are completely unprofessional and your statement meant nothing. I hope for the Best Buy expect nothing but the worst from you and your dictators Elon and Trump.\nYou hit the nail on the head. Never buy a “car” or whatever else they are are sell. We are all doomed.\nI can tell that you are a Democrat and have very low IQ. It is your type of thinking that has almost destroyed this country. President Trump and Doug Collins are both working hard to save this country and the VA. Please move to Iran and talk bad about their leadership and see how long you will live.\nHere, Here. Agree whole heartedly. They are following project 2025 by the book, in case, well it seems that no-one has noticed. After, or once they finish, decimating the Pentagon and DOD. We are next. The DOGeS, have hip waiters on. And some teen hackers who know coding and computers real good will be barking down the doors of freedom and liberty, soon! We must unite, against this domestic enemy, and stand as one. Lets make noise and show what joke jr-6, was.\nFast talking used car salesman. Don’t buy into the lies. We’re screwed.\nWe had an oversite group in place with inspectors general for our government. I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nWaiting for 6,8,10 months for a benefits claim is not a good look for the VA. The backlog is not sustainable and very frustrate those in need. Let’s find solutions.\nFiring more people is definitely not the answer, when they are already understaffed.\nI’m thrilled and excited about President Trump and Doug Collins doing the right thing. I trust both and I know that they will Make America Great Again.\nThanks for your help.\nThank you Secretary Collins, for having our backs, for putting the truth out to the veteran community, for working hand-in-hand with the great work that DOGE is conducting, and for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our Great President (President Trump)!!!\nYou are very much appreciated Mr. Collins and we are so grateful that you are our Secretary of Veteran Affairs!\nSincerely,\nB.K. Gilbert (Retired EOD Chief, USN)\nThank you, Mr. Secretary. Looking forward to the administration’s success!\nThis message seems to skirt around possible data breaches regarding veterans personal information. DOGE has already broken numerous laws and it’s difficult to imagine that an unelected immigrant from South Africa cares about Veterans personal information being compromised.\nVietnam vets were screwed during the Obama years. In 2019 the Blue Water Naval Act of 2019 was passed by Trump and immediately the VA improved. Trump was given an overwhelming mandate to turn around the mess the Zombie president has left us.\nThis video is well-timed and provides good reassurance. But, can we trust it? The tone was overly partisan toward the Trump administration instead of being a nonpartisan head of the VA, which is NOT a partisan subject.\nFor the record, it was Biden who got the PACT act through and never talked poorly about veteran status (like DJT talking about John McCain’s status).\n???????????????\nThank you and thank God for Trump and Elon Musk. I hope DOGE will fix the Biden problems at VA.\nAll the hate directed at Elon and Trump is hilarious. Clearly bots. None of them address REAL veteran concerns. Like the fact that we can’t even watch the video without a YouTube account. We can submit anything about our problems with the webservice because the pages don’t load. We can’t ever get directly in touch with our teams anymore, it’s all online, and as previously mentioned, the pages don’t load. Not even to submit a bug!\nSince you are a Trump appointee, how can we be assured that when Elon Musk and his minions come calling, you will not capitulate to their demands?\nYou are lieing\nAny Vets that voted for Trump Jon Un now complaining about what he and his cronies and Musk are doing to our country with their ‘scorched earth’ project 2025 strategy (just like Putin or any other dictator), are just as complicit in this traitorous, authoritarian condescension, destruction of democracy and abandonment of American citizens. Don’t even try to argue that Trump/Musk/Project2025 and this congress is comparable to previous administrations. That s**t won’t fly. The average American voter is the dumbest (and most destructive) imbecile on the entire planet, bar none, with no idea what true patriotism is. It is they who are to blame, and it is they that must change their ways if our nation is to survive.\nWOW, right on the money. I could not have said it better. Thanks for speaking up. When do we march?\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI hope THEY are listening. Can’t believe grownups (MAGA GOP) are too scared to stand against tyranny, corruption, and now forsaking our allies for the war criminal Putin.\nOh my gosh, No Hope. Seek Help, SOON !\nHe talked but didn’t address concerns! The rumors are in Projection 2025! Firing Veterans from the Pentagon! I am sick of this.\nBenefits may not be getting cut but services are. The recent releasing of probationary positions as a RIF has very seriously impacted the Mental Services Department of the Danville IL VA. And now it will take months if not years to get positions filled again. Someone needs to rethink the hirring practices. It’s oudated and to slow. Veterans need better now, not in 6 months.\nI hope Director Collins is wise enough to reverse the firering in some areas and restore staffing before it’s too late.\nVeterans are depending on you.\nI, along with the rest of the veterans, will be holding you to this statement.\nIf this is a temporary distraction by you while they decide how they are going to dismantle our benefits, there will be a reckoning. You will have to explain why you did not protect and expand our benefits as you are now saying you will. Keep this in mind. We certainly will.\nYou don’t have to understand our lack of trust in this administration, you are tasked with building some level of trust in a country gone mad.\nBenefits should increase whenever they are supporting service connected health issues.\nI see all these negative comments about poor service and claims which have not been resolved for years, however, the criticism was never voiced during the past 4 years, during the Biden era. Did these cases suddenly occur now that President Trump is in office, or Mr. Collins coming onboard recently? My opinion is, those who are complaining are politically motivated and not a true measure of veterans nationwide. Regarding DOGE and Elon Musk, who was appointed by President Trump to oversee the waste and abuse of our tax dollars, why would anyone with common sense condemn such research? Should our billions in tax dollars be given away freely, with no accounting?\nBingo!! You hit the nail on the head…\nConsider the source – Just the “LEFT” being vocal with no substantial evidence of anything other than their own distorted view.\nBecause, like it or not, we got our benefits expanded under the last administration. You may hate Biden, but we weren’t being gutted like we were under the first Trump admin, and now they are accelerating the gutting process because they don’t care about veterans as much as they care about cutting costs for their Oligarch friends.\nBeing a Vietnam Veteran exposed to Agent Orange I’m experiencing medical problems for the pass 13 years. My private medical doctors say you can’t rule out that the cause wasn’t from agent orange, but of course the VA rejected my claim. But all the VA information says they don’t know the full scope of problems caused by Agent Orange.\nThe VA has been very good to me. I served my Country without any thought of a “payback “. However the GI bill helped with my advanced education, while the health care has helped me through serious issues.\nThank you President Trump and Director Collins. Remain vigilant and caring.\nYour video reminds me of a 1970s TV commercial by Ronco. “It slices! It dices!” Well it better not slice and dice my benefits. That includes the VA privatization scam from the Koch Brothers astroturfing “Concerned Veterans of America” and Heritage Foundation. And if I find out DOGE has been in my VA medical records, expect a HIPAA violation lawsuit.\nYou are not believable. Any one who has to disparage anything including the media to make your point holds no weight. I have been waiting ages for my disability rating to be increased and now I have to worry about the security of my VA data on top of all this. Praising DOGE and Trump is counter productive to all people with a brain. Results. We need results dumb videos.\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you ate leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity. The last four years under O’Biden and Harris has been demeaning and difficult foe us veterans. We have had to deal with transgender staff, what pronouns do you go by signs, rainbow flags and safe space signs on the entry doors to the VA clinics and hospitals and ridiculous videos on the screens at the hospital and emails related to DEI and wokeism. They took all of the military related signs and information in the halls and replaced them with stupid unrelated so called artwork throughout the hospital. I mentioned it to the maintenance workers when they pulled the military stuff down and they said, “We don’t want too, but we were told we had to do it or lose our jobs.” Please bring back an American and Patriotic VA that respects our military and it’s veterans. I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir,\nRespectfully,\nJohn Morris\nUSN American Patriot\nI read what you have experienced, not in my Community Based VA Clinic. In Arkansas. I was familiar with a Veteran Arts competition that was nation wide and regional. I think it was called creative arts something, I entered it and the Vets that submitted were given a show in Austin Tx, VA Hospital. The pictures, paintings and various art forms were from all Veterans-combat, Vietnam, Gulf War, Desert Storm (Mine). We got some certificates and a ribbon. So if you did not like the art work on the walls did you bother checking if was from some of your Patriot Brothers? Or do do you just like talking smack? And insulting us, Combat Vets, Retirees, Veterans and Brothers in Arms. Jerk-Off\nOh poor thing, how “difficult” it was for you to walk into a building and see a pride flag. How did you ever survive such horrible treatment? I sure hope you put a claim in for that.\nJust so you know, gay and transgender people exist, even in the military. And a real patriot serving in the military, a real leader, would fight for all and include all Americans who are willing to fight alongside you.\nGet over yourself.\nI believe nothing that comes out of these individuals mouths. You all are kowtowing to a psychopath. God help us all.\nDoug Collins is a slick talking trump appointee ie, a liar. If his mouth is moving, he is fibbing. I wouldn’t buy a used cat from the guy. DOGE is out to destroy the middle class. All the money taken from us, will be spent to continue tax cuts for Elon and the other ultra rich. If you believe otherwise, you are a gullible fool.

We are eligible for exams but not the actual pair of eyeglasses as we had received in the past.\nI have no benefits after my husbands Carlos death will this be changed at all he was 75 % disabled he went and fought in Korea ???Carlos Mann was an honorable man ??thank you Shirley Mann\nShirley you need to go to a local V.A. office and find out if you can get DIC payment for spouse.\nWelcome to the Veterans Team Sir, and as I know you all will continue to do great things to make the Veterans Services even greater. Me and my wife are retired Army Veterans and support the VA always.\nMr Secretary Collins, Welcome! I preface by reminding that my best VA experience was during Vet Friendly DJ Trump’s last term. After that came the purge, and change era. Veteran Benefit Cuts? That happened during the last 4 years (Biden), a purge of experienced doctors and nurses, replaced with inexperienced training less experienced. No one answers phones when you need, you leave a message and they call if, and when they want! The re vamped computer systems that are harder to use and deliver less Vet desired information? A joke! How much did that exercise cost? Who did that really benefit? Veterans clearing cases faster? Don’t be fooled CLEARING Claims is not a benefit to Vets Assisting to, and approving Claims is what benefits vets.\nThe media is part of the last administration, and will continue trying to misinform as always! DOGE? We should all WELCOME DOGE with open arms! President Trump has a track record of helping Military, and Vets at all levels, and it 110% transparent in his actions, which guarantees, All the money from waste found would be redirected to benefit the Veterans, not taken from them. DOGE will find if they HAVE BEEN stealing the money from you, as in the other departments of government.\nWelcome again Secretary Collins.\n4. End VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security: This option would take effect in January 2026.\nA) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older.\nB) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older who would begin receiving IU after December 2025.\nT he Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that were incurred or worsened during active-duty service. The amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. In addition, VA may increase certain veterans’ disability compensation to the 100 percent level even though the department has not rated their service-connected disabilities at that level. To receive the resulting supplemental compensation, termed Individual Unemployability (IU) payments, disabled veterans must apply for the benefit and meet two criteria. First, they generally must have a disability rating between 60 percent and 90 percent. Second, VA must determine that the veterans cannot maintain “substantial gainful employment” because of the severity of a service-connected disability. Receipt of IU is not based on age, voluntary withdrawal from work, or other factors.\nThis option consists of two alternatives. Under the first, VA would stop making IU payments to veterans age 67 or older (the full retirement age for Social Security benefits for those born after 1959).\nThat restriction would apply to both current and prospective recipients.\nWhen veterans reached age 67, all VA disability payments would revert to the amount associated with the rated disability level; veterans age 67 or older who were already receiving IU payments would no longer receive them after the effective date of the option.\nUnder the second alternative, veterans who began receiving the IU supplement after December 2025 would no longer receive those payments once they reached age 67, and no new applicants age 67 or older would be eligible for IU benefits after that date.\nVeterans currently receiving IU payments who would reach age 67 or older after the effective date of the option would continue to collect the IU supplement.\n3. Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Payments are structured differently than other disability programs. VA’s disability payments are intended to compensate for the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries, whether or not a particular veteran’s condition reduced his or her earnings. Unlike disability programs such as Social Security Disability Insurance, payments are unaffected by a veteran’s earnings or other types of income.\nUnder this option, VA would means-test (that is, restrict full compensation to those with income below a certain amount) all current and prospective recipients of VA’s disability compensation.\nBeginning in January 2026, veterans with service-related disabilities and total household income below $135,000, excluding disability income from the VA, would receive full benefits.\nThat threshold corresponds to the 70th percentile of total household income in the United States in 2022, adjusted for inflation to reach the threshold value applicable to 2026 benefits.\nCBO estimates that nearly 30 percent of veterans receiving disability payments from VA will have household income above that threshold in 2026. (After 2026, that income threshold would rise with the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.)\nAbove the threshold, benefits would be phased out at a constant rate: For every additional two dollars of gross household income, disability compensation would decrease by one dollar.\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 20342.\nNarrow Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation by Excluding Veterans With Low Disability Ratings – This option would take effect in\nJanuary 2026:\nA) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for all veterans.\nB) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for new applicants.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\nThe amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. By law,\nVA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable, on the average earnings that veterans would be expected\nto lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries.\nThose ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce his or her earnings.\nUnder this option’s first alternative, VA would narrow eligibility for disability compensation by REQUIRING A DISABILITY RATING OF 30 PERCENT OR\nHIGHER FOR ALL VETERANS. AS A RESULT, SOME CURRENT RECIPIENTS WOULD NO LONGER RECIEVE BENEFITS.\nThe second alternative would require a 30 percent or higher disability rating only for new disability compensation applicants.\n(Current recipients would not be affected.) CBO estimates that in 2026, about 20 percent of veterans will have a disability rating below 30 percent.\nSee like a bunch of liberal hacks are on this page. The funny thing is they’re blaming Trump for their sh-tty medical care and other benefits. Uhm, nice try. He has only been in office a few weeks. Your sh-tty care was under Biden.\nAnd the congregation said AMEN…\nI have received the BEST care possible, for the past years. Several MAJOR surgeries. Jaw Joint Replaced, Neck Fusion, lower back fusion. No wait times. Biden brought us the PACT ACT.\nAmen to that !\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 2034\n1. Include VA’s Disability Payments in Taxable Income:\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or\nworsened during active-duty service. By law, VA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable,\non the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or\ninjuries. Those ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce that person’s earnings.\nDisability compensation is not means-tested, (restricted to those with income below a certain amount), and payments are exempt from income taxes.\nPayments are in the form of monthly annuities and typically continue until the beneficiary’s death.\nNote: See Proposed “Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.”\nThis option would include VA’s disability benefit payments in taxable income.\nDoug Collins also says he isn’t a huge bundle of sticks, so can he be trusted?\nLet’s make this country the best it can be. Thanks for being on the front lines for us veterans. My comrades deserve it!\nA statement that wasn’t a statement. Anything to support your troll of a king.\nhow about giving dental care?\nWhy can’t we get an insurance card and a list of Doctors to go to when we are sick or need a specialist. If your sick you have to drive down to the hospital ER. I recently tried to get an appointment with a dermatologist finally got one 3month out. I went to an outside Dr. for my condition. Tried to get help with community care. No help. Filed a formal complaint never heard anything.\nIt has been reported that the VA Crisis Hotline has been hit with staff firings. Is this true?\nBlaming it on the “press” is not going to cut it. Thousands of VA employees have all been let go. Any veteran will have his or her own personal story of observation. Collectively, veterans are heroes, survivors and fighters NOT “suckers and losers”. To have two non-veteran lackeys taking away our veteran rights is a travesty. Vets have to keep their opens open and stay strong!\nSlower than ever I put in a dependent change August 1, 2024 and still in received status. 7 months? Really ?\nArticle seems like a one sided snow job. You should already be doing what you say DOGE is doing. The military playing politics is how PUTIN works.\nI’m also have a claim on process for then three years and waiting.\nYou said: DOGE representatives at VA are reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans.\n1st – DOGE do not know what the hell they doing. No experience at all.\n2nd – YOU don’t have not experience SO that make YOU don’t know what the hell you are doing.\n3rd – That so call President NOT a president, HE IS A BULLY, LAIR MAN getting PAID for the future.\n4th – How dare you make a Video saying what this so called President NOT going to do. I bet you want tell him that in Front of his face.\n5th – To say more, why don’t you send this Video to the SO CALL PRESIDENT and have him to address it LIVE on TV so millions of voters can watch it.\n6th – To do MORE, why don’t you HIRE Veterans (Wives) to do what DOGE does know how to review contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans. VETERANS ARE THE ONLY ONES KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE NOT DOING. We as Veterans deserve better services.\n7th – STOP THE BULLS??T, and COME CLEAN BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF IT.\n8th – And the last thing- go back and listen to YOUR Video and tell me ONE thing you DID NOT say WHAT THE AMERICANS and VETERANS WANTS TO HEAR. This tells me you ARE NOT the Secretary of Veterans Affairs we are looking for.\n#“ DROP THE ? “\nFrom a Vietnam Vet: You do not speak for me. God bless and protect Trump from all his enemies foreign and domestic like you.\nNicely put. We think alike.\nDid you finish grade school ? This is NOT a political site so please take your Leftwing garbage somewhere else. I disagree with you completely.\nAs a veteran, I am truly grateful for the care and support I have received from the VA. From the moment I reached out for assistance, the staff was professional, compassionate, and committed to ensuring I had access to the benefits and services I needed.\nThe healthcare services have been excellent, with knowledgeable doctors and nurses who genuinely care about veterans’ well-being. Scheduling appointments has been straightforward, and the quality of care has exceeded my expectations. The benefits office has also been incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process, making it easy to understand my entitlements and how to access them.\nBeyond medical care, the VA provides invaluable resources for employment, education, and financial assistance, which have been instrumental in helping me transition successfully into civilian life. Their dedication to veterans is evident in every interaction, and I appreciate their continued efforts to improve and expand their services.\nI highly recommend the VA to fellow veterans seeking reliable healthcare and support. Their commitment to serving those who have served is truly commendable!\nFirst i trust the media and always have as secretary of the VA do the job for the veterans who made our country safe and not for DODGE TRUMP OR MUSK\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you are leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity. The last four years under O’Biden and Harris has been demeaning and difficult for us veterans. We have had to deal with transgender staff, what pronouns do you go by signs, rainbow flags and safe space signs on the entry doors to the VA clinics and hospitals and ridiculous videos on the screens at the hospital and emails related to DEI and wokeism. They took all of the military related signs and information down in the hallways and replaced them with stupid unrelated so called artwork throughout the hospital. I mentioned it to the maintenance workers at the time when they pulled the military stuff down and they said, “We don’t want too, but we were told we had to do it or lose our jobs.” Please bring back an American and Patriotic VA that respects our military and it’s veterans. I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir\nFaster than what? For fifty years I have sought the simplest of services, nothing. Last Jully I filed again, got diagnosed with PTSD, Chemical poisoning, hearing loss, etc etc. Still nothing. In fact, trying to trace my claim, it was sent to another office in another state just to be lost again. I’m tired of this crap. I don’t have that much time left on this earth and I’m stressing anymore over it.\nDear Sir\nI am a 90 year-old Navy Veteran with 32 years of Naval Service. In 1971, I was ordered to Viet Nam, where I was exposed to the Agent Orange defoliant and subsequently developed Prostate Cancer. I underwent a radical prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins, but developed complications that have left me unemployed since. Last September 2024, I filed a VA Form 21-8940 to apply for increased compensation based on unemployability. I have completed all the evidence , underwent a physical exam, but still awaiting to hear of any decision. I recently heard that President Trump was firing many VA employees and am wondering if he has fired those working on my case?\nSo thought I would ask you if this happened ?\nThanks for any help you can provide.\nSincerely\nRichard Mohr\nVA File Number [DELETED BY EDITOR.

For the first time, I feel good about the VA and that the individuals who served their country are going to be getting the support they need and EARNED.\nThank you VA Secretary Collin’s and President Trump for your continued support for veterans.\nI am one of those Vietnam veterans who Trump called suckers. While he sat back and took his deferment for a painful bone spur. His support is non-existent except where it serves him.\nYes I agree. Claims are not being processed faster, slower by the day. I have a dependant claim for over a year now. Why? When all.it takes is to add my daughter back to my compensation claim.\nLIAR!LIAR!LIAR!\nComments being censored ?\nYes, they are.\nThanks, for the info, You have always done greatwork in Washington, welcome aboard,sir,\nVA Hospital needs central scheduling. Started to use the Durham VA medical and to make an appointment have to call the various clinics directly and leave a message and hope to get a return call in several weeks to schedule an appointment that could be months out. Crazy.\nWaiting moderation ? Is this sensorship ?\nIt’s censorship….but yes, that is what it is.\nCongratulation on your appointment,\nI just want to ask a quick question here. I recently broke off two front teeth right down to the gum line. I need implants that cost $10,000 .00 to repair this. My Dental insurance won’t cover it because they say that it is cosmetic. The VA only will cover up to $1000.00, and it has to be done by someone that excepts Veterans Choice coverage which will only be $1000.00. Is their anything I can do to get this fully covered by the VA? The VA tried to give me an implant on a molar a few years ago and they botched it. So I am going to Clear Choice Implant center to get this work done. I have only one shot at this and I need someone who does nothing but implants. I have a 100 % disability from the Vietnam War and I am struggling with Small B Cell Lymphoma from agent Orange exposure and medical bills are mounting up. Thank You for letting me contacting you.\nHi, Geno, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nI was recently at the VA center in Hot Springs Arkansas and felt terrible about the way the older VETS were treated . I am 77and am lucky to have younger people to help me get to places like Hot Springs. this is a beautiful complex, proud of it. I was there for my eyesite exam. Older crippled vets had wives or friends pushed them inside. Once ‘inside’ they were told to go back out the door, take a left and walk back up a walkway to the end of the other building and look for a tent with their number on it and go in. This was done on the outside. Some Vets asked what was going on and were told where everyone could hear, that the other place had poor air quality had, not been repaired. This was over a year old they were told. Very sad.\nI am so thankful for our VA Services.\nThings do however take a long time. I have had a claim in for @ 6 months and no word on the status. So maybe more transparency on claims would be helpful.\nGod bless you, President Trump and the USA\nHi, Dan, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nFaster than ever! Yeah right. Claim and reviews are taking longer than ever. Says 140 days. Some one is feeding mis information.\nAlso say you are improving taking care of vets. But what i see is a system designed to reject vets. For sure the vets that are getting older. You have vets that are young and only served two years being taken care of better than old vets that served 8 to 20 years.\nMaybe you can explain why staff at VA hospitals are being reduced! That’s a fact!\nThis happens quite often especially now that more veterans are opting for video or phone appointments. This also happens if the VA hired way more staff than what’s necessary.\nI would love VA’s dental plan to be expanded. I currently pay for the Met Life program offered by VA but am still unable to pay for dental treatments that are needed. The copays and out of pocket are still expensive.\nYou either lie or are naive. I no longer trust you or the government of the former United States.\nWe defended the United States yet you traded it for a red hat.\nYou’re not allowed to be surprised when programs and benefits are cut. This is what you wanted when YOU voted against democracy.\nI am not buying it. VA just fired my PCP that had only been on the job for a few months. Now I am without…again.\nI have been suffering from crippling asthma and constant shortness of breath since my deployments to the middle east where I sat on top of diesel generators, worked with asbestos, and inhaled gas and excrement fumes for months on end. The VA has been willing to prescribe me combivent respimat medication for COPD and Advair, but REFUSES to diagnose me with asthma and approve my 10% disability claim for 14 years. I have done everything I need to do after the passing of the PACT act. I am tired of suffering.\nSecretary Collins,\nI understand that outsourcing C&P exams takes in excess of 10 Billion dollars out of the Administrations’ budget. As a veteran subject to at least 15 of these outsourced exams I think it’s time to move these exams back into the VA medical facilities. While I understand that the exams were outsourced to provide timely care, they have turned into a money grab by the providers.\nMany of these exams are being administered by providers in small offices with questionable qualifications. They are more likely than not to deny a service connection lest they offend their cash cow.\nA lot of people don’t understand what is going on, the ruling wealthy class (top 1%) want to “Make America Great Again” by turning back the hands of time to the past, not the 1950’s as many believe (when the tax rate was 94% on the wealthy), but to the 1890’s, The Gilded Age (the time of the Robber Barons). For those that don’t know the real history of this time period: https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/plutocracy/\nSo how did things get this bad that the ruling class could turn back time to a period in our history that was far worse for the working class? Brainwashing. The ruling class took the teachings of Edward Bernays (author of the book Propaganda), the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and have been using that to control the masses ever since. Bernays took his uncle’s work in the subconscious mind and perverted it into a means of controlling the masses.

I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nAbsolutely!!! I am a liberal–not a Democrat nor Republican, but someone who believes in freedom and human rights (equality for all people at every stage, income, race, creed, or religion) and I am horrified by how many veterans, people of faith, and those who claim to support the veterans can believe that this president is or ever was, an honest or honorably devoted servant of the people of this country or, and especially, its veterans. I am sick with grief over how the veterans are going to be treated by this administration.\nThey go on camera and feed us a line of BS thinking we will stay calm and forget our concerns. They have an agenda to gut social programs across the board, including VA benefits, to offset their funding of tax cuts for the uber wealthy plutocrats.\nWe elected the wrong people and now we will suffer the consequences.\nMost of us was mislead what the president said\nWe? You did, speak for yourself.\nTrump & Musk Are Lying and are Dangerously Taking Apart the Government to enrich themselves. Our Privacy Rights Have Been Violated.

Wake Up Veterans We have been Duped\nAmen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nNo offense, but any man who said that Veterans were suckers to go to Vietnam, who avoided doing his patriate duty because of a “bone spur” , attempted to overthrow the election results by sending his mop to the Capital then giving pardons to those who convicted and sentenced for that attach and is a convicted felony himself and not be trusted to protect the very vets he belittled.\nOH, yeah that’s the spirit.

It’s a great relief!\nIt would be nice to keep the same nurses and doctors for a while sir. The VA is a rotating door.

Disabled Veterans Do Not Want the 2017 Mission Act To Privatize the Healthcare At The VA; It is Mistreating Veterans.

Trump Hates Veterans, Trump is A Vietnam War Draft Dodger who is only interested in his wealth And Riches.\nMajor Richards Star Act is a SHAM. Only officers who served in Vietnam were all declared 100% disable due to agent orange exposure. Even Navy officers on ships miles off shore.

These officers can now qualify for 100% free real estate taxes and other perks.\nThe rest of us who served in areas where the toxic chemical was sprayed get shunned or expelled by the VA hosp.\nI could go on and write a book. I’m OK with the VA treating us like dirt. I’m not OK with the 30-50 vets that commit suicide daily because of the VA.\nWe all know(veterans) that Doug Collins or any individual will not help any veteran or change any VA processes to better accommodate veterans at all. For decades, veterans have been s@&t upon with no changes. Everyone knows that federal workers are only there just to ride the taxpayer funded gravy train, do their time, retire and once again receive the taxpayer funded pension to live out their life very comfortably. All the while, veterans who fought for these people to have the lives that they do, get nothing much in return. It’s been that way forever and will not change, no matter who’s in charge of VA.\nIn 2016, I applied for VA healthcare and was denied based on my salary and the county (California)that I live in. Fast forward two years, I revisited that decision with a VA counselor. I was told by that counselor that I should have automatically been approved because of my time in Persian Gulf and Desert Storm. That’s a very simple example of how unorganized the VA is.\nI do have two claims that I’m waiting for a decision on, upon which I know VA will reject. Because that’s just what the VA does, deny, deny, deny.\nWhy isn’t Tinnitus considered an auto-grant for veterans with clear exposure to harmful noise. Tinnitus is a permanent condition, there is no cure, and severely impacts the lives of thousands of veterans that served this country faithfully. We don’t need more bombs, we don’t need doge, we don’t need controversy, what we need is better care for veterans.\nI agree, my disability claims have been resolved quickly, with the VA App I’ve watched them zoom through all 8 steps. My annual primary care visit was very pleasant, blessed to have a good doctor. I’m proud of the VA.\nI am a Vietnam veteran. I am addressing the facilities at Long Beach CA. This facility is huge. The first problem to address is parking!!! They need to build a large parking structure. The other problem is knowing where to go.

He’s an immigrant, on the autism spectrum, and 3 of his children have birthright citizenship.\nmr. collins.\nwhat about the 1000 workers that were recently let go that provided vets services? treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. that move certainly backs up your comment about insuring care for vets.\nand allowing the richest man in the world to have access to VA information and suggest possible (dubious) ways to save money?\nmr. collins is an election denier, climate denier, once said democrats love terrorists, and has completely followed and supported trump\non every other major position.\nhere are a few suggestions for cutting government expenses…\nA Government Accountability Office report from 2019 said that four Trump trips to Mar-a-Lago totaled $13.6 million for the travel and security costs. If you do the math, that means Trump’s three trips to Mar-a-Lago in the first month of his second term tallied up to at least $10.2 million. Trump’s Super Bowl trip cost taxpayers at least $1 million just for the air travel and regular Secret Service detail that travels with the president. The field trip to the Daytona 500 event—where he stayed for roughly 90 minutes—likely cost taxpayers at least $373,000.\nThat’s based on the fact that it costs $177,843 per hour to operate Air Force One, according to information the outlet the War Zone obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2022. White House pool reports said the flight times between Daytona and Mar-a-Lago were roughly an hour each, plus the daily cost of $17,520 for the Secret Service detail, per Snopes, and you land at the $373,000 figure.\nIn all, Trump’s travel during his first month in office cost taxpayers at least $11.4 million.\njust sayin’.\nit is apparent to me that mr. collins will do whatever president musk and vp trump tell him to do.\nplease, at least treat vets with some dignity and honesty and tell them what you plan to do so that we have some time to prepare and adjust.\nrichard isom\ndisabled veteran, usaf\nFAKE NEWS from another King Trump MAGA croney and not a trustworthy Republican! Seriously, Mr Doug Collins. You really expect us to believe this?\nThis is a lie! It took 7 years to finally get my disability benefits. Last August 2024 I finally was scheduled my exams which I completed and last month January 2025 I finally received my disability benefits! But three weeks later last Monday February 2025 I get a call to schedule all of the very same medical exams AGAIN only 6 months after I took them and three weeks AFTER I received my final disability adjudication!! Talk about a DOGE violation of waste of taxpayer money! Or the VA is trying to claw back my earned disability benefits as an EOD (bomb disposal) technician! So the VA IS trying to cut veterans benefits and my case, now on its 8th year is an example of Collins doing it! Next email is to my Congresswoman and news so they can monitor my case losing my benefits!\nCollins, you sound like a trump appointed political hack. I’ve already been affected. My medication refill was simply removed or disappeared. Appt scheduling is worse.\nSpeak the truth or don’t speak at all\nMy question is, why does the secretary need DOGE to show him how to be more efficient? Shouldn’t he already have measure’s in place for that?\nSo it’s the media’s fault. They are lying. I wish you would not have said that. That’s nothing but the same lame political propaganda this new administration peddles out there to the public. And right off the bat. I don’t expect problems to be resolved in 2 weeks, that ludicrous. Change must come from a thoughtful, meaningful process. Not politicized nor chaotic. Taking a sledge hammer to it will not work. Firing countless personnel who’ve worked diligently for years is plain stupidity. Now what? Start all over with who? The VA needs to hire more Doctors, period. It takes a long time to be seen and many facilities do not have the people required to care for our Veterans.\nMr. Collins I do agree with you, the media are panicking veterans that a cut in benefits is coming but is the opposite all is DOGE is doing cutting cost on contracts that are being overcharge at the VA, I myself work in the retail business for many years and profits was the number one, the federal government don’t worried about profits and their productivity is the lowest. I myself don’t see anything wrong for some one else outside the system to audit and see where the money is being expend so that more funds go back to veterans. Wish the best. Semper FI\nWhy can’t the VA do electronic billing?\nThere are many many vets that are computer savy and would gladly welcome e billing instead of getting a three page statement and an envelope. Each month. For a bill that they will pay through their bank.\nAll other businesses have e-billing.\nMr. Secretary, Thanks for the confidence that our administration is taking care of our veterans! Good to see such enthusiastic support!\nGood to hear.I worried that Musk would start taking benefits away.benefits we all fought for and our veterans need and deserve\nYou put out this comment after you already know that vets have lost their jobs at agencies all over the board. That includes vets at the suicide hotline. How dare you try to continue to lie directly in our faces.\nAttention VA Secretary Doug Collins\nCared for my nearly 103-year-old proud Navy Veteran Mother for many years and dealing with the VA constantly cutting her benefits was a nightmare! I along with my sister spent years and literally hundreds upon hundreds of hours on the phone with people who were so inept, uncaring and who were being paid to do nothing but refer you to office after office as your rode the VA UN-merry-go-round. At 80 the VA determined she needed 43 hours of care weekly and at 94 cut her to 20 hours-then 5 hours- and we had to fight to try and keep even that. Seven of those years were spent being hired as her caretaker which according to the VA rules had to be done through a VA recommended agency (what a nightmare they are). They came to our home once and never came again or did a single thing after that except force me to fill out reports they sent in to collect thousands and thousands of dollars which should have gone to the rooms my husband (also a Veteran) and I had to build on to our home for her care. Mom is gone now- It took well over a month for the agency who was supposed to be caring for her to realize this Veteran who served her country in Washington during WWII had passed away. My husband and I are still paying the price of neglect by the VA and so are thousands of other families. I think the company that the VA helped steal from my Mother and us should be held accountable to repay the money they stole into and account to care for Veterans. However, realizing the slim chance of that and still caring for our Veterans, as a long-time advocates, I would welcome the chance to talk with Doug Collins! Washington actually contacted us some years ago because we have developed programs, we were told by a government official under President Trump would save taxpayers BILLIONS of dollars annually – and we have had programs ready to be launched! We could have cut government expenditures years ago and turned billions being spent to care for all of our Veterans in excellence as well as providing them with permanent jobs but the swamp does need cleaning. Please encourage Elon Musk to DOGE the VA. I would welcome speaking with him as well. There is so much to be learned from those of us who have been through this first hand! We paid a high price and went through many years of valuable heartbreaking experiences to make life better for our Veterans and will continue to do so even though my husband is in his 80’s and I am in my 70’s. Please help our nation to avoid using inefficient programs and people and ask me how our heroic men and women in uniform (especially those who are now homeless) can be better served.\nSincerely, Naomi E. Rocheleau\nFunny thing to promise after 47 just made an executive order stating you’re not even in charge of your own agency.\nIf this is true why have DOGE and other representatives of the Administration already gone on record stating they have ran comparisons on Veterans who receive disability from VA to FAA licensed commercial Pilots? Shame on targeting those who protected us\nYour lips to Gods ear Mr Collin’s but with cuts for the sake of cut that seem to be the the intent of the new administration I am afraid for all Veterans and active service persons as this administrations first term there was no respect shown for military as we were considered suckers….I appreciate the work you do for us Mr Collins and your dedication to it, Thank you.\nHow about getting rid of DEI hires that are present in our Hospital admins. The care at the Des Moines VA Hospital has gotten worse since new admin people were appointed a few years ago. Why hasn’t the Hospital in Des Moines put up pictures of our new President and VP.\nDirector of Veterans Affairs Administration,\nI live in Houston, Texas. My husband comes to the VA for all his medical needs. I came to the VA with him and notice your photo was not on the walls anywhere in that government building. I notice President Donald Trump photo was not there either.\nThe person in charge needs to take charge and display your photo and the President of the United States on the wall. The workers here at the VA in the Micheal De Bakey building in Houston, Texas needs to step it up and stop being lazy and racist. Their service is terrible.\nI submitted a request to add a dependent (my wife) it’s been eight months. Your help in getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated.\nYour request to add or remove a dependent\nReceived on August 27, 2024\nAs if I believe one thing out of his mouth. His first point was not about veterans, it was about media. Pick on the media first. So, what agenda does that belie? Tell me how that helps veterans.\nI strongly suggest that anyone with problems get in touch with a veterans’ clinic in a law school. That was the route I took when no private lawyer would take the case of my husband. My husband’s case was taken by the clinic at the University of Baltimore School of Law.\nIn a time when we have no draft,the younger generation has no need to serve our country for the benefits that are being eroded away from this administration. We have a very limited force as it is .Those who chose to serve have seen their benefits being taken away one by one. I am a former Marine and a combat veteran of the Viet Nam war. The ones who served before me in the Korean War are also on the chopping block and for what reason? To satisfy the bottom line for some moron Senator who wants to study the rats mating skills? They have for a long time put foolish requests in the budget to satisfy some stupid agenda for their personal request.Taken away from the true needs of our country and the true honest Americans who have relied on their Senators to do the right thing for our country.We called them Ear marks and pork barrel request in the past. And each year they have continued to pop up at the tax payers expense.When are they going to come clean and truly get rid of them? Or get rid of the MORONS that request the stupid things that cost us taxpayers ??\nthanks to The Department of VA affairs and Doge and President Trump! the veterans need our support and the benefits we deserve!\nThanks for the info on what’s going on in the VA\nMr Collins,\nThank you for your video stating the facts. The VA has improved dramatically since I got back from Vietnam in 1970.\nPlease continue to help improve and retain the services we all need.\nSincerely, Don Foye USN\nHello Mr. Collins,\nI’m a Councilman in the City of Campbell, Ohio and I’m also Chair for Veterans Welfare Committee. Would it be possible for you or someone from your office call me at your convenience. Some of the constituents I represent are concerned about their benefits, with the recent changes going, the mix news, media and even this website. I too have questions. But mainly I want shut rumors that are going on, that I know are not true, but feel hearing it from you would make people feel better knowing you talked to me and I can get back to the people I represent and tell them everything is going to be OK. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from soon. My office contact is 351 Tenny avenue, Campbell, OH 44405. 330-755-1663. Or you can email me\nThank you for the update!\nMr. Collins, because you were appointed by trump I can’t believe a word you just said in this video. You claim to support American military vets and praise so-called president trump who sucks up to putin, the communist who wants to fulfill Nikita Khrushchev’s promise to burry our grand children. American vets are going to get screwed over by trump just like everybody else. It saddens and worries me that the head of the VA will help trump do it.\nGreat presentation and thank you for all that you are doing for Veterans. The Administration is living up to promises.\nDoug, I have followed your career as a Congressman and since. I truly appreciate your contributions to our country. I am an 82 year old veteran as well as a Social Security recipient and Medicare patient (parts A, B and D), and I have a request and suggestion.\nWhile there are many good people in the VA Medical Service, getting care can be a nightmare and truly exasperating. Community Care service is obtained only after negotiating a labyrinth of call trees and waiting a long time for a call back. Community Care works great for me, only after I get through the VA part of the process. In addition, I get an annual VA physical as well as an annual Medicare physical exam. This is waste!\nWhy not eliminate the VA and let us get these and all VA services through Community Care by giving me a VA card that could be used just like I use my Medicare Card and my Medicare Parts B and D insurance cards (no going through a grueling VA approval process). It would provide us with the convenience of using nearby providers and eliminate the waste of having two systems, all while saving the taxpayers a lot of funding. Those VA employees who work hard could easily find work in this private sector scenario.\nThanks for listening.\nFAKE NEWS! Don’t let any person (croney) appointed by King Trump and his MAGA presidential cabinet (not republicans) fill your head with false truths. How can I believe anything a MAGA slave to the King says. We all know the PODUS is a lier, cheater, stealer, and most of a CONVICTED FELONIST. I served 20 years in the US military, and these are not the Core Values I was taught to lead our troops. Where is your HONOR, COURAGE, and COMMITMENT to the US military Mr. Doug Collins? You sold your soul to the antichrist – Donald J Trump! And what a very lame non-reasurring video message to post to our Country’s AD and RET military personnel. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it is probably a DUCK!\nI wish they’d just let our president do his work and stop scaring people for no reason. The media is ridiculous! There’s no news reported any longer, just their opinion- and I didn’t ask for their opinion!\nWhy would we believe an appointee of Trump, the one who called veterans losers? Clearly in his revamping of our democracy, those losers don’t deserve any benefits any more than any other group he’s targeted. Although, he needs to keep the military alive and active for 1) ridding our country of all the criminal immigrants and, 2) defending against the coming coup to overthrow of his criminal administration (which cannot come soon enough).\nThis is the winter of our discontent. There is very little trust in the new administration. Defense is being cut and it appears Generals will be fired and replaced. Why would we expect the VA to be any different?\nVA Healthcare is under assault by those who wish to privatize it, i.e., to create another “public subsidy for private profit” system. The privatizers have one concern: maximize wealth and power, and have little to no concern for the health of veterans or the public. VA Healthcare works because the people involved are pursuing actions to help people while in the private sector the goal is to maximize profits.\nI should be able to contract the Secretary directly, I know he does not have time to read my email but he staff should, as a disabled Vet I should voice my concerns about the VA health care to him. The number one thing I have seen is VA employees that know matter how bad they are at their jobs cannot be fired, some of them are even promoted so someone else has to deal with them. thank you\nThank you Doug!! You are serving for all the right reasons!! SEMPER FI!!!\nWell as a daughter and wife of 100% disabled veterans I do hope we clean up the financial waste in this area so we can have more qualified doctors in our local areas so we don’t have to travel to baypines for certain illnesses. Hard to be driving around when you don’t feel well.\nMore concern to the veterans, doctors, and nurses.\nThank you Doug and good luck\nRemember these veterans did not say you have to wait when they were called why are they waiting now!!!\nPositive comment…I would like to volunteer to help Doug..I am a Vietnam Navy veteran, a retired Supply Chain Executive, father and grandfather…..I am serviced connected and in the system..\nThank you\nClean out the democRAT swamp scum. Faster, reliable, timely mail order prescription NO BROKE USPS! Fix website on myehealthyvet or get rid of it. Put Track prescriptions back on website. Re-Allow service from providers other than centrally located VA centers. Wider based, easier understood description and rationale for limits on certain disabilities. Cut the mountains of approval levels, Employ an easier self service application process for older Vet’s with lower computing skills.\nThank you . Your message was short and to the point. The main stream media is lying again. You getting the truth out to us is appreciated.\nPlease continue to share this message, as it may address concerns that some individuals have. Thanks for looking out for us vets. We need to stop the fear mongering-it will be all right, there is waste in any government organization, even in the VA-this disabled vet has had excellent service with the VA-again keep up the splendid work. Sorry for those that are having issues, I say that downsizing the VA will provide better service-it might be hard for some to believe, I have worked with organizations as a consultant in the private sector for 30 years which has proven to me that efficacy through streaming lining and UPGRADING TECHNOLGLY is the ticket-=the VA is no doubt using outdate technology.\nAnd to know those waiting on disability claims, it took six months for my disability claim to be approved, and I received my backpay for this two days sooner than was indicated on the letter so I can vouch that the VA is moving faster at this point in filling claims at least in my case\nWhy should any Veteran believe ANYTHING you SAY or PROMISE? You were appointed by a fairly elected sociopath who cannot be trusted by anyone in this world.\nAs a public servant you should not be criticizing our country’s free and open press whose diligent work has helped millions of Veterans. The press you criticize has always played a crucial role in raising awareness about the needs of veterans, particularly disabled veterans, by publishing stories about their struggles to reintegrate into civilian life, advocating for better government benefits, and highlighting the work of veterans organizations and pressuring policymakers to improve support systems for returning soldiers. Do a little history about the organization you claim to “lead”. This administration knows very little about true leadership, yourself included.\nVSO offices by appointment only with long wait times to get in still in Covid protocol. Administrative law judge hearings months to years waiting to hear cases. Veterans deserve better than this.\nLike a good puppet, you spew the same lies president Musk and his lapdog Donny vomit out of their mouths. When will anyone on the right in politics stand up to this poor excuse of an administration? The entire party is a disgrace with their lies and patronizing veterans.\nWhen Trump was president, the first time veterans had a paper which they could take to a pharmacy if they needed medication when their local clinic was closed and that was terminated under Biden as I tried to use it, and I was told it was no longer valid. It is extremely important to have that benefit because example I got out of the hospital on a Friday and let’s say the VA was closed and I couldn’t get the hospitals prescription written on a VA pad. I would have to wait all weekend until Monday to get antibiotics after coming out of the hospital for pneumonia. Please see what you can do to reinstate this benefit for veterans.\nYou can still use community care providers if your local VA is closed. I just used it this weekend. And the prescription service is still active too. I would call and speak with someone at the VA to receive clear guidance on this. There is a protocol for using the benefit. But that benefit is still available to Veterans. It was not discontinued under Biden.\nWhy comment? No one will pay attention or do a thing. I’m a disabled vet. Somewhere close to 90%. As I recall I was told I would have 100% coverage as a vet when I enlisted in the very early 70’s. I don’t have it and what I do have isn’t nothing to be excited about. Thanks to Republicans the promises made to me are just platitudes and we already went through the Republican version of efficiency once to get here. The VA is underfunded already and this DOGE bullsh-t is just another way of making cuts to the VA to help get tax cuts for the already wealthy. All we as vets are, are photo ops for the Fascist right wing and are expected to put our lives on the line for little to nothing in return because it might inconvenience the already wealthy if we’re treated like we were led to believe. I swore to protect the country against all enemies foreign and domestic and as far as I’m concerned Trump and the rest of the right wing are domestic enemies… Rest assured I’m not the only one to see that…\nDoug Collins already helped cut significant services and staff. I don’t see how we’re spinning it as a good thing. Dude is just another liar.\n60,000 square foot state of the art new facility in Zebulon, Ga. Only one primary care physician with months and months of waiting to get an appointment… help please. Thank-you.\nI should have been 100 % many years ago but have been denied over and over again. I was a combat engineer in an Atomic Demolition Munitions team 12E20 in Germany in 1966. I have had nightmares about setting off a device, killing people and team members ever since. I have PTSD Iand recognize it drove away my wife and daughter. The Army used agent purple in Germany and I have had. Many health issues. But the VA has said they didn’t have it. I have proof now I as a 79 year old reaching a point I may loose my house.\nCongratulations on your appointment. I am a supporter of DOGE. I have many thoughts on how to improve the VA and the Government, to many in fact to include here. So I guess my first recommendation would be to get rid of that ridiculous paper wasting survey and come up with well thought out questions and simplify. Last one I got I started and never finished because 1. the questions were ridiculously long and sometimes immaterial or the multiple choice answers were leading or misleading or didn’t reflect what I wanted to say. Anyway I trust you will do a good job and from what I remember about your background and time in congress you care about people and the county. There’s no doubt this department and the entire government can be better and efficient at the same time. Thank you and good luck.\nGo Secretary Collins\nThis VA leader is a boot licking Trump loyalist who has no business running this organization.\nTrumps only agenda is to sow as much chaos towards his perceived enemies as he can. That is not helpful for this country.\nTo point out the disinformation from Secretary Collins, any funds DOGE “saves” on contracts for veterans services will be used to partially offset the tax cut going mostly the very wealthy, like Musk. it’s not going to go to veterans.\nI agree VA staff has, when ever I needed to speak with them, has provided outstanding service. Although I do not use VA medical ( I have TRICARE for LIFE) I Saw the medical staff in action in Louiseville Ky. A friend needed emergency eye care. The staff stayed until we arrived and then made sure he received the treatment he needed.\nI am a Vietnam vet 1967-70 and I trust Doug and President Trump much more than those woke, inept progressive socialist democrats sucking our taxpayers money with fraud, waste and abuse. Dig in deep Collins and get rid of ineffective employees and bring back the competent and caring profesionals, di it Now.\nI’ve noticed that we have numerous comments by people with TDS or are simply the usual negative political hacks that simply enjoy complaining. Mr. Collins, I know you are a former USAF Colonel Chaplain and a man of God, and I wish you Godspeed as the Head of the VA. You will have a mighty task ahead of you to improve the socialized VA system. I certainly hope you can also streamline the Community Care system as well.\nTake care and God Bless!\nI would like to see my benefits reinstated I was dropped due to making too much income and i’m on SSA.\nI don’t trust Trump or any of the GOP members of Congress ! They have gone in a direction that takes all our fundamental ways of rights and freedoms away from the American people and put them in the hands of a egomaniac called Musk .\nSo the VA needs fewer nursing staff?\nhttps://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nI KNOW we need MORE hospital staff, not less.\n??HOW DID DOUG COLLINS GO FROM A VOICE IN THE RECENT PAST VOUING TO CLOSE ALL VA HOSPITALS??\nMy husband is a Coast Guard veteran. We thank you for this video. The media is into scare tactics. We appreciate the truth.\nMy husband of 26 years of military service was let-go. He only has 3 months to go to complete his non-probationary period. Other probationary folks are still in their jobs in the same agency. The dismissal letter said it has nothing to do with performance. Is this the response to veterans who were honorably discharged? Also, how is DOGE firing people? By draw lots? Kindly answer, Mr. Secretary.\nI’m not interested in “getting rid of things” at the VA, when we all know what you’re getting rid of is nurses. I’m not interested in your efforts to privatize the VA and its services, do not think we are fooled by your rhetoric around waiting times and service availability. Just fund the VA and give us staff for the clinics and hospitals. That’s the promise you made to your Veterans, and that’s the promise you’d better keep, because pissing off a population of Veterans is a bad idea.\nI respect the Secretary, and I believe him when he say’s our benefit’s will not be cut!!\nGood god why would we believe anything this administration says after yesterday when Trump spit on the graves of every service man who ever fought for the ideals that this country USED to represent!?! Trump just threw Ukraine under the bus and sided with a brutal dictator. All of you who support this traitor need to wake up.\nThis is how it starts….getting the vasoline ready…Jack booted thugs coming for you!\nWas the EO allowing VA health records to be sent to any requesting agency rescinded? I noticed this change when I was applying for homebound care benefits. I will not consent to my health records being sent to SS, IRS, and/or any agency that requests them, without notifying me or a having a warrant. Needless to say my application wasn’t accepted.\nThis is what they say right before they cut funding. Every. Single. Time.\nI doubt that . . .\nDisgusting mouthpiece of trump\nDOGE is a farce. Elon Musk and his youth tech hackers have no business in our veterans health care and benefits. That has been an ongoing process the past few years and it’s happening!\nThe VA has come a long way in taking care of us.\nDon’t let an unvetted, illegally appointee crush our vets.\nDOGE might not change our benefits much, but the staff won’t be available to carry out the mission to all of us veterans.\nSir,\nWhat is this I am hearing and reading about VA Disability Payments being reduced in 2026 based on the household income? Why cut what someone has earned?\nYea… They are processing claims Fast, Because they Just Deny Deny Deny !!!\nY’all think people who make decisions are even reading these comments.\nI called both of the Senators in my state and asked if the rumor were true that Veterans Preference was considered the same as DEI, they gave big big promises they would check and get back with me……crickets.\nI understand your fears and anxiety over our situation as veterans.\nBut I just don’t think Mr Collins has the slightest idea of what is written by us here and really doesn’t even care\nThis video is a joke. Let’s blame misinformation on the media not the source. This what we can expect from a secretary appointed by Trump.\nI have been turned down for service connecting disabilities since 2009. WHY BECAUSE VA HAS SAID MY PROBLEMS ARE FROM BEING OLD. I WAS A HAZARDOUS WASTE PERSON IN NAVY FOR YEARS WHILE IN\nI HANDLED SAME STUFF THAT BURN PIT PEOPLE DID. REXCEPT HUMAN WASTE. THIS IS BS. AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS GOVERNMENT AND PAST CAN BURN DOWN.\nWhy is it so hard to get VA benefits for those who served in the mid-60s through the end of the 70s’.\nWell said Mr. Secretary. And Congratulations on your appointment as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRegardless, I truly believe by eliminating positions and most importantly eliminating Vets who work for the VA is not the right approach. A sledge hammer does not replace a scalpel. With a king in office who does not, and will never, respect the Military, all veterans should be cautious and concerned about the cuts to come.\nWe served the country, NOW, the country can serve US!!!\nThen explain to me why my appeal that I opened in October of 2022 is still not heard.? The system is broken and those vetabwho are waiting do not see an end of the road. Just more aggravation\nI believe in improving benefits and other things at the VA for us veterans, we all sacrificed alot to defend our country, freedoms, and the American people, we were promised to be taken care of after our military service, and there have been times when veterans had to fight for their benefit rights, and that should never happen not only did we sacrifice, but also our family members also sacrificed watching there loved deploy when we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, so improve the VA for all us veterans and do not take away from us who sacrificed for our country, as I am still fighting about being exposed to burn pits while on deployment, as well as a Desert Shield/ Storm veteran who was exposed to all that oil well smoke up in Kuwait\nWith Musk and Trump in charge i will take a wait and see .\nMr. Collins I have been fighting a losing uphill battle for almost 35 years. I was OTH Separated from the Army in 1991 as a matter of fact I was Deserted by my command. I still to this day do not understand why not one person has taken an interest and called for an investigation. I have done everything possible and I will never give up on my Innocence. Now that I am service connected disabled what is the VA going to do to help me get this set aside, and exhonrate me fully and bring relief and Justice to me and my Family? The worst part is no Courts seem to have Jurisdiction but they did not mind having me falsely arrested and held without any probable cause or mandatory 48 hr review, and sure as hell never mentioned administrative credit for that time. Why would they right all my due process, substantial, and constitutional rights are still being held hostage as POW’s. I have never in my a adult life been able to have my rights even restored to me what a shame. Maybe yourself and Mr. Trump s should DOGE a after the truth to recover Justice for me. You have the power to grant me Equitable Relief, I requested a such relief from the prior Secretary and even got an email stating give them 7 days to respond that was in N November, I’m s still waiting on that email.\nThank You\ni dont trust a word from any Trump rep — Trump is the biggest liar in the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, don’t let that liar make up new facts\nI am a four-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving proudly its Security Service, from 1970 to 1974.\nI will speak frankly, sir. I don’t trust you. You are a Trumpist. You will follow whatever he says, for his good, not\nfor ours. You have, and will, bend the knee. I will not. I support democracy, liberty, our constitution, and our\ncommitment to our ideals and obligations. I support our allies. I am totally against oligarchs and dictators in the\nworld, and now, sadly, here at home. The oath I took is as meaningful to me today as it was when I took it 55 years ago.\nI SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHAT HE AIS DOING TO CUT WASTE AND TO SUPORT OUR VETERANS WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY SCREAMING FOUL AT THE TOP OF THERE VOICES HE HAS TO BE DOING IT RITE.\nI have lived here in South Carolina for almost 7 years and I can tell you this, the VA has really stepped up to the plate. It started with President Trump during his first term as President, he replaced the secretary because he wasn’t doing his job and it took veterans forever to get care. Ever since then the VA has gotten so much better. The VA is a different place because of President Trump and the people he has put in place. My only hope is that the VA moves forward to keep making health care for veterans even better, please don’t cut services to save money. I am a patriot and I love this country, I fought for this country as my father did before me. Please take care of us.\nGet rid of the DOGE bros. ONLy way to have any credibility. These guys are amateurs.\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThanks Doug, from a fellow Georgian and recipient of Vet benefits.\nI have been waiting 2yrs for an approval to my VA claim that the VA says is not service connected I was injured during field maneuvers in Germany and the injury is documented in my medical records, and I have been trying since 2017 to get the VA to see this injury in my medical records but they say it is not service connected.\nGreat hearing directly from the Secretary. No fake news from him!!\nSaying benefits won’t be cut is not nearly the same as saying disability payments won’t be cut or reduced. Please make another video that states disability payments won’t be cut or reduced.\nVeterans need to listen to the context of this message. It speaks volumes that no one’s comments have been addressed.\nPlease do not cut women’s services anymore than it has been in Florida. I can’t believe that my primary care physician has to be my gynecologist because that dept. was cut from the Jacksonville VA clinic.\nI already had to miss 5 months of mental healthcare because it was canceled for no reason other than I was seeing someone in the community instead of at the VA hospital. Now I have to start all over with someone new that I don’t trust who looks like she just graduated from college.\nIts good to hear from the top. The rumor mill can needlessly cause unnecessary anxiety. Thank you for the information.\nTom Bellows\nMy father was WWII veteran in Army Air Force. He pushed me to sign up with the VA after my enlistment was up and I had no idea the opportunities that became available to me. I served in the US Air Force to protect this nation and did it to the absolute best of my ability. No regrets. Proud now to be a veteran and I meet daily with veterans at the Montrose campus and we built a friendship that is beyond words. The VA is critical for veterans that gave their lives and I for one appreciate immensely all that it has given me personally. Please continue the work that the VA offers and always remember Freedom is not Free.\nAnother Leader in fairy tale land. They already cut 1000 employees. Yes, the ones that help veterans considering suicide. Why is so hard to find a real veteran to lead the Veterans Department? Got rid of judges. Reminds me of the veterans that died before they recognized agent orange did cause cancer. Old Bone Spurs is not our friend!\nthe proof is in the actions and not in his words that are unproven. I remember the former congressman from Georgia before he was placed in this position. He has made several mistruths in the public space in that later position and that was one of public trust as well. So I’m waiting to see if he is a man of his word or just an empty suit for the Doge stooges.\nOk I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who has had a claim for legitimate benefits that has passed the 3 year mark. Seems I got putting on the back burner. Would like to have a determination whether it be approved or denied. Just want to get it over with\nsocial security is not and should never be an item for discussion of cuts. its our money and congress should keep their grubby little hands off of it. Secondly, concerning a veterans disability compensation, should be provided a cost of living raise every year. In fact, we deserve more than what we are receiving now.\nWhat does Musk and his DOGE slash and burn team know or understand what Veterans have experienced or need to heal. Only Veterans understand what other veterans experience and need. You should hold the line and resist this attack on our government and support what we need. We have done what we were asked after volunteering to serve. Do not roll over to dictator in chief and his henchmen.\nConsidering the mount of damage DOGE has been doing to everything it touches, having mainly to do with the fact that Musk and his army of inexperienced interns have no idea what they’re doing, I have very little faith in ANYTHING being said here. Musk is an entitled rich doofus who has no idea the kinds of traumas and disabilities we veterans are dealing with, so he is a TERRIBLE arbitrator of what is and isn’t “fraud.” I’m tired of decisions about our care, and our benefits being made by entitled clowns who have never served a day in their pampered lives, or having some moronic DC talking head telling us that we are somehow leeches because we require assistance after our service. Like I said, I have no faith in DOGE, Musk, Trump, or Secretary Collins, and I do not believe that they will not slash our benefits.\nAre these individuals lawyers? Do they have significant legal experience? Have they been given backgrounds checks? Are they cleared by law enforcement to handle personal information and confidential documents? Is there accountability to those who are going over contracts? Or are we just expected to believe they are working in good faith? Lots of concerns.\nGood morning,\nI am a veteran (US Army)\nI filled out the form for my case since august 28th 2024 and still waiting. In today date february 20th 2025 I haven’t seen anything, more than 6 months.\nI hope they address the issue of the low pay for the VA workers and see that is why so many leave the VA. They need to Pay what the outside pays. I am not a VA Worker I am a Veteran who uses the VA\nHow about we cut-out putting Veterans into dangerous FDA/Pharma guinea-pig…I mean, clinical trials? I was a victim of said program that gave me a brief trip to the other side of the veil. That would the ceasing of Life functions by sketchy, dangerous untested drugs for all you naive types. While that was an experience, I never signed up for it.\nYou want to really help us veterans? Get rid of the WHOLE BODY RATING SYSTEM. Our percentage should be added up as a whole percentage and not reduced because of going over 100%. Make the 100% the maximum. I currently have 40,30,10,10,10= 70%. This is how the country I served for 21 years wants to short change me and every other veteran?\nEat s**t you Trump lackey scumbag. The only one lying here is y’all, not the media. Same old excuse.\nDo you really want us to believe that Trump — or any of his sycophants – have our concerns at heart? In 2018 / 2019 our town was taking up food contributions for the military personnel here because this guy executed the longest shutdown of the U.S. government in history because they wouldn’t fund his wall. This is the guy who dodged the draft by having Daddy get 2 doctors (who both rented apartments from him) to say he had a bone spur – which could have easily been corrected with an operation. this is the guy who had the nerve to call McCain a loser and denigrated the record of the late Republican senator on veterans affairs despite routinely appropriating one of McCain’s crowning achievements as his own. This is the guy who said when declining to go to a ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018: ““Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” This is the guy who called the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. This is the guy who asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades. Just think about how many vets are losing their jobs right now, unable to make monthly payments, because of his executive orders and Co-President Musk’s DOGE cuts. This is the guy who is now posting on social media referring to himself as a king. Do you think he cares about us? You need to wake up and smell the roses – and stop trying to BS us. Like the entire congress, it is time for you to grow a set and stop lying. No job is worth your honor or integrity. JBK\nLet’s Do the VA Math Hustle\nVA disability ratings are based on “remaining ability,” not straightforward arithmetic. Here’s how the system works:\nA veteran is rated 50% disabled for PTSD, meaning he has 50% remaining ability. He also has Tinnitus, caused by severe hearing loss (HL) from exposure to helicopter rotors or jet engines. The VA rates the Tinnitus at 10% disabling but assigns 0% to HL, meaning it is acknowledged but not compensated.\nNow, does 50% + 10% = 60%? No.\nThe VA applies the 10% Tinnitus rating to the 50% remaining ability:\n10% of 50% = 5%. The VA rounds up, so he gets 10%, bringing him to 60% total disability.\nNow his HL worsens, and after a new audiology exam, the VA raises his HL rating to 10%. However, 10% of his remaining 40% ability = 4%, which the VA rounds down to 0%. His total rating remains at 60%—no increase despite documented worsening.\nThe PACT Act expands benefits for veterans exposed to toxins, including asbestos. The veteran has service-related asbestos exposure and is rated 10% disabled for it. Does this raise his total rating? No. The same VA math applies:\n10% of his remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He stays at 60%.\nYears later, anemia surfaces in his records, linked to asbestos, jet fuel, or firefighting foam. The VA acknowledges the nexus and grants another 10%. Again, 10% of the remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He still remains at 60%, despite multiple service-connected conditions.\nThe Real Cost of VA Math\nIf the VA used basic addition, his disabilities (50% PTSD + 10% Tinnitus + 10% HL + 10% asbestos exposure + 10% anemia) would add up to 100%, qualifying him for **$3,831.30 per month** in 2025. Instead, due to VA math, he remains at **60%, receiving only $1,395.93 per month**—less than half of what he should receive.\nEven worse, because the VA only compensates from the **date of claim**, this veteran loses decades of retroactive benefits for service-connected conditions that trace back to Desert Storm or Vietnam.\nThis is not a minor technicality. It is an institutionalized method of **Denying, Delaying, and Defending** against rightful compensation.\nEnough talk and start showing by doing what word came out of your mouth. I supposed when the PACT Act came out nothing really happened considering we have been suffering after Post 911 conditions. And with all the conditions I reported I only got 80% when it is suppose to be 100%.\nAs for education and training, there is much more to improved with helping Veterans domestically and internationally to allow Veterans to get full access if their education benefits unconditionally. Having credentials from higher institutions are not enough to get jobs that Veterans desire to do as their calling to find their new purpose in life. Do more and do better!!!\nRight off the bat we have a highly politicized attack on the press? This augurs badly. The LAST thing VA should be is partisan and trying to create a narrative to control perceptions.\nI’m a VA patient. Twenty years ago VA health care was really second rate and, so I avoided it at my expense. Over the last few years there has been obvious and substantial improvement. VA brought in much more competent primary care, expanded the quality and availability of specialty care and improved facilities. The most important thing was VA’s effort to recruit people, to upgrade staff. These people can make more money in the private sector but they choose to serve us because VA employment was more secure, more compatible with their family life, LESS bureaucratic than private insurers and because they have a more grateful base of patients at VA. Immediately upon jackass Musk’s shock and awe campaign a big chill went through, pending offers didn’t go out, applicants had second thoughts. The immediate damage will take time and effort to repair because confidence is important and the new administration has shattered confidence and trust.\nAnd what are you doing? What’s your first contact with us veterans? You are sending out political messages to attack the Press? If that’s what you think then volunteer to go on TV or give interviews to the Times and confront the press directly and see what they say in return.\nEven more chilling you want my name and e-mail. Anyone who’s been following events recognizes a vindictive streak in the new administration, I’m frankly concerned for my benefits because you seem to be “making a list”, here. But, damn it I’ve already seen a terrible change in morale and recruitment so I’ll take my chances.\nCan you help my husband a 30 yr vet ? He is trying to contact the Navy retirement office the other day they had him on hold for 3 hours then disconnected the call we can not get any help any where thank you for your service\nI’ve had a claim in since 1970 so I hope he doesn’t wait until I’m dead so that it goes away. Since I don’t know the claim number I know I can put my service number because that is public knowledge so here it is. The public is able to access this number and only access the number they can’t go any further but he can so you don’t have to delete this number. Thank you and have a wonderful day and may God bless.\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your sensitive personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nApparently, Mr. Collins has not read Project 2025, nor is he aware that the VA OIG has been illegally fired. The VHPI”s take on the impact that the implementation of Project 2025 ‘policy’s’ is here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=project+2025\nWhat this adminIstration SAYS and what it DOES, will likely be different. DOGE may have already gained access to the VA computers. If their previous actions are an indication of their present actions, your privacy may have been compromised. DOGE was NOT supposed to gain access to CLASSIFIED data, yet managed to post it on its UNSECURED website.\nTRUST AND RESPECT IS EARNED, trust and respect can be burned with LIES. Veterans have a long history of DISTRUST of the VA for decades. The reason being – WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO, been disrespected, given the run around, delays, being treated as LESS THAN. Each new administration brings issues and policy changes. But WE ARE PEOPLE, not numbers, groups, things, actual living people who served our country with HONOR. When the time comes for our needs to be met, we cannot be assured of consistency of care. DOGE shows up and employees are told to go home, you’re fired. Did suicide hotline calls go unanswered?\nH.R. 5697 ACCESS ACT is described here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=ACCESS+ACT\nMr. Collins, your office sent me an email announcing your new position. I wrote back that I did not have faith in this administration to provide quality care/service. Nothing that you have said has changed my mind. I doubt that you will ever bother to read these comments posted by the very people that your department is meant TO SERVE. LIES HAVE CONSEQUENCES, FACTS STILL MATTER. Viet Nam Veterans said after they returned “NEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN” They made it a point to ensure that Veterans were NEVER treated with disrespect, they way they were treated when they returned home. My family has had US military service members in every generation as far back as the Civil War. Generations of Veterans have experience with the government . This administration does not respect the military, nor Veterans. The man has profound issues with his own interests outweighing those of the country. I am not alone in reserving a wait and see attitude, as we have seen this clownish sh*t show rodeo before. When our government asked us to step up, WE DID, we demand that our government STEP UP FOR US, as we fulfilled our obligations completely. ALL GAVE SOME, SOME GAVE ALL. Our dues are paid in full, we expect to receive what was promised to us, when we raised our hands and swore under oath, to protect and serve the constitution, from ALL ENEMIES – FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.\nTHE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION WAS NOT WRITTEN TO PROTECT CRIMINALS, IT WAS WRITTEN TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT FROM BECOMING CRIMINALS – Lenny Bruce, Veteran\nWell Doug you’ve got the easy part done now let’s see results.\nWhat about having to close all radiology at the Pueblo Colorado VA because everyone that could run the equipment were fired by Musk/Trump. Now thinking of sending people from other VA clinics for a few days a week to try to keep Pueblo open but cause shortages at other Colorado clinics/hospitals.\nI don’t believe a word he is saying. Muskrat and Project 2025 leader and head of OBM, have already said they want to cut disability payments once we enter retirement age.\nWhy can’t people see that this administration says what they think people want to hear. Then do what they want. All you have to do is watch and listen to them.\nCollins, from my home state, is as crooked as the day is long . He will do whatever Trump and muskrat tell him to do.\nI wish more folks would take a little time to just read Project 2025. It details Everything that this administration is doing. Even though Trump lied to voters by saying he knew nothing about it. Yea right. Tried to tell folks that he was lying.\nShameful.\nThey have sent Tens of Thousands of people to the unemployment line. Tariffs are causing prices to skyrocket. Every govt. agency is being led by appointees that have No Clue what they are doing. And they have already Fired Thousands of employees at the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and Healthcare. At a time the Dept. is vastly undermanned.\n” Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it”!! And MAGA is getting just what they should have seen we would\nget. And what sux is, the rest of us will suffer for their uneducated voting practices.\nHope to God out Nation survives this Blatant move to Hitlers Fascism\nFIX Community Care. It sucks. Takes too long to set up and approve provider request.\nPlease consider increases to the spouse’s survivor benefits. It is impossible to make ends meet on the current amount. I’m so worried how I will survive if my husband passes before me. He has been 100 percent disabled for over 10 years and has suffered from his disability since 1971.\nHope your article is correct I have been waiting for a higher level review for 4 months, that’s just ridiculous. Been waiting on my C file just as long.\nThanks for the information. Sadly the media has lost all credibility with me. The one thing I cannot tolerate is a liar. As a former Sailor, liars can get you killed or seriously injured. These past 4 years the democrats and media has proven to me that they are liars. Once that bridge has been crossed with me, I will never trust that person or entity again. Never! Once a liar, always a liar.\nTrump lies every time he opens his mouth. How can we trust his “gofers”? As a disabled Navy\nVietnam vet (86 years old) I am scared I will lose my care giver, my VA meds , VA DR and housing.\nSay, could you be any further up T-Rumps behind? Sorry, I wish I could believe you but you basically addressed nothing in this video. It might as well been Donald himself rambling on saying nothing.\nPardon my skepticism, but quite frankly I have heard that all before, and to be completely honest our current (sic) commander-in-chief does not have a sterling reputation when it comes to honesty so I take everything he says with a large grain of salt. Nor, for that matter, do I place any trust in his chief minion, Elon Musk, who also has a track record for flights of hyperbolic fantasy when it comes to stating facts or telling the truth. As the old saw goes “The proof is in the pudding” and the veterans of this country will be watching closely and holding accountable this administration for honoring “The unwritten contract” that was implicitly guaranteed when we raised our right hands and swore an Oath that stated “ I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” It’s been 55 years since I swore that Oath, and I believe in it as strongly today as I did then and I believe that the overwhelming majority of our military, past and present, feel exactly the same way.\nI amma full timem teacer with 70% V Disabiity. How will then Fairess Act effect my benefits?\n“Hey y’all…it’s me again” … Great, a week on the job and already a total lack of professional bearing. Please spare me the Jerry Falwell bumpkin buddy chat…you are leading a massively important agency. Don’t try to sell me on what’s great for the VA and our current political administration is better than what’s right for the Veteran. The American tax payer understands with the utmost respect that these benefits are the price paid in keeping our enemies out of their backyards, continuing to give their children and grandchildren the freedom of choice and expression, and the ability to sleep soundly each night knowing we have/had the watch. God help you if you are knowingly being deceitful.\nYou are attacking the media for reporting what may happen? Isn’t it their job to keep us informed. So far it seems that our government is following the Project 2025 playbook fairly closely, and that does not bode well for veterans, or anyone who relies on their government to provide services.\nDear Sec Collins,\nI live in Jakarta, Indonesia, and I fall under your VA’s Foreign Medical Program (FMP) and I am APPALLED with the poor service that office has been providing.\nFor over a year, FMP has been delaying payment of over $50,000 that they own me and have not disputed, but because they cannot or will not move from paying by checks to paying by Electronic Transfer they are delaying the money they owe me to PREPAY the next phase of treatment, approved and authorized under the PACT ACT.\nI have even sent FMP the forms being used by the IRS, Social Security, and even some VA offices to switch from payment by check to payment by ETF.\nI have been working with my state Senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan and state Representative from New Jersey, Ms. Mikie Sherril and they have made no discernible progress in addressing a major problem that should only take days to correct.\nThank you for looking into this and if you provide me with a name and email address, I will attach the documents I have been providing to the FMP and VA.gov for over a year now with no success.\nThank you!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nI am a 78 year-old Vietnam vet (1st Cav Div) in-country 1968 to 1969 at Khe San and Phuoc Vinh. Honorable discharge and returned home in Aug 1969. I immediately went to the Winston-Salem,NC VA office and filed for disability due to Agent Orange (peripheral nephropathy), PTSD, Sleep Apnea, hypertension and a knee injured at Ft Bragg the medical staff recommended medical operation for torn ligaments in March 1968. I was given orders to Viet Nam for reporting in August 1969. After discharge in August 1969, returned home, with peripheral nephropathy (Agent Orange), Sleep Apnea (nightly rocket attacks at roughly 1:00 AM EVERY NIGHT and unable to go to sleep until the all-clear siren blew about 3:00 AM and having to wake every morning at roughly 6:AM every morning; PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome); Hypertension (high blood pressure); being in I-Corps originally, roughly every other day for 6 months, you could count on a Agent Orange “shower” because we were in the tri-border area of Viet Nam, Laos and North Viet Nam.\nUpon my return to the States, I immediately went to the Winston-Salem, NC office to file for my education and disability benefits. I was given a paper claim card, which I still have, and given education benefits for school. My subsequent claim(s) was adjudicated that I did not have a claim because: (1) The lost my records because of a fire and the VA office; (2) there was no records that supported my claim regardless of the fact my DD-214 showed I was in Viet Nam and given a Bronze Star; (3) they had no record of my filing a claim and/or, I had not been stationed in Viet Nam; (4) All items claimed for disability were diagnosed by VA doctors on multiple occasions, yet the copies of records were in my records and the examiners told me that my DD-214 was invalid because it “appeared” to be invalid and I could not prove that I was ever in Viet Nam.\nI finally got approval for 30% disability, regardless of the fact that every visit to the VA hospital was met with the “stick test” that clearly showed that I had peripheral nephropathy; was given a sleep test for sleep apnea and given a machine for breathing help, and other medications for the items that are indicative of problems the VA found with those who were in-country and related to Agent Orange.\nI have been referred to outside consultants for Sleep Apnea, Peripheral Nephropathy, High Blood Pressure, given a cane for my knee. With these and other items found by VA doctors, I have been prescribed 17 different medications for the items diagnosed by the VA, yet, I was only given small compensation starting in 2011.\nI have more than 400 pages of medical records from the VA, which have been forwarded to the VA Records Collection in Janesville, WI. A recent inquiry concerning my records by the Dr working with my PTSD showed there were 2034 records in my file. The following week, I called Janesville and asked them about the disparity in the number of records, I was told they only have 434 VA medical records. The problem with the scenario is the record count is never consistent. I have only used the VA doctors for my military medical diagnosis, yet, there are occasions when their record count is zero.\nWhen asked about my claim, I was told they have made progress on my claim and the representative told me that I have a large amount of money due to their increasing my claim percentage with the implication being “I would need a large bank account” to hold the back pay I would get. To date, only my percentage has been increased effective December 1, 2024.\nIt is a constant fight to get this situation resolved, as in my case, 55 years with 4 conditions that is on the VA ‘s list of compensation is nothing more than an empty promise.\nI have tried the legislative approach, using my State and Federal House Members and Senators, to no avail.\nI haven’t seen anything in the media about benefit cuts, Sec Collins. Or is attacking the media part of your new job? What has been accurately reported is that 1,000 VA employees have been terminated – about which you say nothing.\nWhy do you trust DOGE to make wise decisions on VA contracts? They are led by a mad-man named Musk who is trying to reach reduction quotas for Trump’s tax cuts. I’m concerned – and you should be also. Or are you afraid to lose your job if you encourage caution?\nYour words are full of lies. I do not believe for one second you have veterans well being at stake. I’ve been lied to so many times by the VA and I’m supposed to take your word. Your word means nothing to me. Deceit and lies make up the VA and I have proof. You deny veterans benefits at a rate that is unacceptable. The VA denied my benefits for 11 years in hopes I would die. When I’m looking at my military health records stating I was injured while jumping outta planes for the 82nd Airborne and the VA was trying to convince me it never happened. When ask after 10 if I would like the VA to make the final determination or a judge I choose the judge. Exactly one month before seeing the judge the VA called me and said they would make an immediate decision within a day if I let them. My answer was no!!! I seen the judge one month later and it took the judge 13 minutes before deciding in my favor at 100% disabled. You act surprised when we have 23 veterans per day committing suicide. What do you think is happening? They lose all hope in providing their families with food and shelter. So I firmly believe half would not be committing suicide if given what was promised to them when signing the contract when entering the military. The VA administration is lying to all the veterans and denying them their benefits for as long as they can. You know this is true. Don’t sit behind your desk adding more lies.\nMr. Secretary,\nPres. Trump’s last term included an attempt to reduce social security benefits on a dollar per dollar basis for veterans IU. This is fact. DOGE is firing people with an hour notice of job loss. How can I be sure my Social Security and VA Disability will not be lost on less than an hour notice? Is there a public presidential promise? VA i s losing its employees by DOGE analysis, are VA employees going to face minimum employment loss notification or at least, a 2-week notice? I need to know the facts with proof, not possible hearsay by you or the ??? news. Please help us believe with proof, that our benefits for disability and social security will not be lost, like a public presidential promise on the news. I already illegally lost my military career on a on a Chap 61 by contractors, after serving 19 yrs, 4 mos, and 26 days and now I am not eligible for CRDP. CRDP requires 20 yrs of service. We need to know that our healthcare will not return to months long appointments like during the president’s last term. Please, we need the proof or what you say remains haunting. I cannot afford a loss of social security on a dollar for dollar basis. The President has demonstrated his disrespect for veterans the last term, publicly against Sen McCain for being an injured POW, from my state.\nPlease don’t permit retribution to our VA benefits for making a complaint.\nPlease read and reply to all the veteran statements sent to your office. Lack of responding will lead to a lack faith in you. Don’t let the news prove you wrong, present the verifiable facts.\nThank you for your service to OUR country.\nDLHJ\nSFC, USA (forced retired illegally)\nFeb 19, 2025\nThis is the “Thank you for you service” from Pearl Harbor Naval Base…..I booked and received confirmation at the Navy Lodge in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. My wife was with me on this trip of 4 days.\nMy flt arrived Honolulu at 7pm. We drove to the base so I can check-in at the lodge. The main gate sentry told me that my wife cannot enter without a pass and the pass office is already close. He told me I can access the base with my VHIC card due service connected imprinted on my card . I turned around and drove out to book a hotel downtown for one night. Next day I drove to the pass office and got a pass for my wife only to find out that it is only a one day pass for her and that I have\ngo back to the pass office every morning to renew her one day pass during our stay at the lodge. Talk with you counterpart Mr. Hegseth to see if wounded veterans/service connected veterans be treated with some kind of dignity and respect. Hell, Guam Naval Station excluded base access veterans from their Trusted Traveler Program.\nSecretary Collin’s, Thank you so much for clearing up the issue regarding benefits.. I am a 78 year old Vietnam Marine veteran who is suffering from prostate cancer due to my agent Orange exposure. I am hoping you can help me with a question I have. I submitted the information to the V A regarding some benefit issues.\nYou will always be in my prayers for the time I have left and I am hoping God will keep you safe and guide you in your decision making to help our country and our veterans. Thank you for reading this.\nThank you, Sir for prioritizing our Vets. It appears as though this page thread is being spammed by a lot of activists. God bless Trump and the U.S.A.\nHave you lost your ever-loving MINDS? They/We/Us put a EFFing TRAITOR in the White House as a MAKE-Shift POTUS. Once Trump and Elon figure out that the Military “WILL NOT” Shoot/Murder Brown Americans. Then you can KISS YOUR VA “BENEFITS” GOODBYE, via DOGE. World War II was never even close to the current THREAT that these Domestic Enemies BURNING this country down to the ground as WE WATCH. I spent over two decades serving the US Military and America. To watch a LIFE-LONG CON MAN destroy America before our own eyes. I am ASHAMED. Trump already “KILLED” three quarters of a million Americans by his INEPT INCOMPETENT COVID Response. That’s just a drop in the bucket for what will and is DESTROYING the CURRENT FECKLESS USA. – FOFO\nAnd DC, (something tells me ok to be up n friendly with you, Doug) I took a head Hit plate in skull etc. and helping at our VFW when able to AND just glad previous vets administration is Done (no comment – that was then, this is now)! Just many congratulations and anytime you are in SE Asia let’s have coffee together with ret.msgt Janet Cmndr. Luv it. Be safe my friend.\nDOGE is already cutting jobs at the VA. I feel I am being lied to by you. DOGE is cutting jobs and benefits to people all across the government. The GOP is going along with DOGE and is doing so in order to come up with money to give people like Elon Musk huge tax cuts. I do not like being lied to. I served my country in the war in Vietnam. I was an enlisted serviceman. Please do not give me a story about caring for the veteran when you are a part of Donald Trump’s ongoing effort to tear our government apart and run it like he is a mob boss. I am sick and tired of what is going on and will work with my Congressman and Senator to put a stop to this. How dare you put out a message like this and lie to the veterans.\nThank you so much for the update Sir.\nNice. Collins is a good man\nFirst – CONGRATULATIONS Truly. And thank YOU for sharing the Truth of Our Veterans Administration svc. as this cabal or d.s.enemy, “Fake News” as Pres Trump politely calls it… Trump’s America calls it ” The LIARs’ Media Lies-Guys who spread gossips harming Our soldiers AND their families… Just thank YOU very VERY much. Luv your initials: D. C., I forward “Our New Veterans Administration Boss, D. C. Doug Collins is guiding D. C. Washington to MAGA & HE Will. Just wait n see! “\nsickening – a south African born inherent racist proudly throwing N- salutes is digging though our VA system. My great Uncle, and WWII combat veteran, rest in peace, fought the fascist and N-s in Italy. He was captured and held prisoner til the end of the war. And here we are and republicans aren’t concerned about a ‘sieg heiling’ billionaire trying to defund our government agencies so he can loot a tax break for himself. I will NOT forget what my great uncle fought for and against –\nI don’t trust anything that the President says and I now don’t have any confidence in Collins. Let’s see some action, not words/\nCollins has a track record of being a Trump yes man. So it was disappointing, but not surprising, that he gets slotted to head the VA. Sadly, as we all know, Trump is a fake military man that steals valor from real Americans in order to project power. He would never put his life at risk for the betterment of the rest. The concept of service bewilders him, but not in a respectable way. Oh, no. Service and its accompanying risks are the plight of suckers. The military is nothing more than a bag of idiot toys to to do his bidding. This is what he had to say about fellow Republican John McCain and his military service that included 5.5 years in the Hanoi Hilton “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, okay? I hate to tell you.”\nBack to Collins, lack of qualifications aside, I was and could still be willing to give a fellow veteran a chance. He has been talking a big game about sticking up for us. But this video appears disingenuous and contrived. We are not stupid. That Collins is welcoming Big Balls and his band of tech kiddies to access our private information because it is all part of Trump’s puppet master’s plan to harvest every piece of data the administration is stupid enough to give them, tells me Collins is trending more toward lap dog than VA guard dog. Once the VA has been dismantled, funding won’t matter.\nAlso, DEI? Are you kidding? Our military and the VA are built on the backs of minorities. And the military is very good at producing disabled people, so it would seem fitting that the VA would be open to employing some vocational rehab or rehabbed folks. And give us a break on the LGBQ nonsense. I’m still waiting to hear of a legitimate instance where a service member’s or VA employee’s LGBQ status, on its own, impacted their ability to serve. Let’s try to focus on the real issues the VA faces that are obviously hindering its mission to provide veterans with the care and services they deserve and please stop wasting time fighting some made up war on wokism.\nAnother Trump shill making excuses for the cuts that have already happened. Notice the gaslighting in the phrase “media concerns”. No, they are our concerns. Trump is on record being anti-vet and anti social safety net. Musk is gutting everything to enrich himself. None of the 20 year old kids in DOGE are auditors. It’s only a matter of time.\nTime will tell if this actually means all veterans or just the straight white male types.\nHow can we be 100% sure? There is so many lies coming out of the current administration from an aircraft accident was caused by DEI to the the president of Ukraine started the war with Russia when the entire world saw the Russianv build up at the boarder and heard Russia say there were there just for an exercise, to the amount of deaths in the war and the amount of money that they have supposedly found that was fraud, to the administration cutting budget money that has been allocated any by law has to be sent for that allocation. I hope you are corrent in what you are saying, but please excuse me if I have a hard time believing anything this administration says.\nI find it extremely difficult to believe that anyone downstream of Trump is actually competent to do the job they are tasked with. Why, Trump has made it quite CLEAR he demands loyalty to himself above all others and their tasks. He has made it clear vets have little value to him through his many actions and quotes. Let’s see: demeaning Gold Star families, calling war dead “suckers and losers”, being a draft dodger himself etc. No one in his entire family has ever served either. Now we see first hand that VA systems are LOSING staff when most of the facilities are already understaffed. So how does this work to improve the VA serviced to the veteran community, of which I am a member? Sec Collin’s, I have No trust or confidence when it comes to Trumps action or word. He has proven his word means little. So, from that alone, i do not see good things in store for the current VA system. Not improvements, better budget perhaps, no I see the goal of privatization in the future. For the benefit of his wealthy handlers.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, Spineless Sycophant\nI am so so pleased that Doug Collins is in charge of the VA now. I am hopeful that things will be run more efficiently to the benefit of the veterans it cares for. Is there a way to get a letter to Secretary Collins through regular mail?\nPlease add a Bluesky link for ‘Share this story.’ Thank you.\nThis guy doesn’t realize what a fool he looks like, waving his arms, flapping his gums and using the pathetic fall-back “media’s doing it” BS. Please talk to Veterans like a human, not a tool. Do you think we’re children? “Don’t worry, nobody’s taking away your benefits!” You moron! When you make it so there’s not enough workers to handle the workload of helping Veterans get their promised health care, that’s denying Veterans their benefits. When a Veteran spends the better part of their days trying to make contact with the VA health system for an appointment that’s a denial of benefits. If enough of us Veterans simply give up trying to access benefits, that’s fewer Veterans to have to spend money on. I know I’m not expressing it well, but I won’t be around too much longer so the trillionaires can keep whatever extra pennies they would have had to pay out for whatever medical care I’d be needing.\nU lying for musk and his VP trump\nSecretary Collins, I want to draw your attention to the incredible VAMC, Boston, MA staff. I have never experienced such professional excellence, administrative genius, and remarkable decency as I have at this location. Best regards, J.L. Ross, MD [retired, US Navy]\nWAS HOPING FOR GOOD CHANGES FOR THE FUTURE OF THE VA FROM HEARING ABOUT YOUR CONFIMATION. I VISIT THE VA HERE IN OKLAHOMA. WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED PHONE SYSTEM FOR THEM HERE AND IT TAKES US TO AN OPERATOR AND THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR, THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. FINALLY GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY SENT YOU TO THE WRONG DEPARTMENT. BEFORE 2024, I COULD CALL THE CLINIC AND TALK TO A HUMAN. IF YOU HAD TO RUN YOUR OFFICE WITH A PHONE SYSTEM LIKE THIS, THAT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IN A HEARTBEAT! TAKE ABOUT 6 WEEKS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. THEN XRAYS , THEN MRI ANOTHER 6 WEEKS, THEN YOUR PRIMARY IS GONE AND REPLACED WITH A PA. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU FIXING SIR. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR MISSION STATEMENT FOR THE VA, BECAUSE NONE OF THE POSTED ARE ADHERED TO. THANK YOU\nSorry I don’t find this all that believable. We shall see I suppose who is telling the truth and what is hypothetical. I don’t see the President having much respect for veterans or for military service but that is only my opinion based on his past comments and actions. DOGE is a new government bureuocracy already given too much power and too little oversight. I think as veterans receiving VA benefits we have a right to be concerned about the intentions of this new administration.\nI am losing faith in the country that I served proudly. Actually, not faith in the country, but any faith or respect for it’s current leadership. I cannot understand how our Senators and Representatives, who in theory work for us, can stand by and watch this country become smaller and less of a source for powerful good on this planet. They now stand by and watch an administration rape and pillage the good will we had in the world. They watch as the adminstration disrespects the countries that have had our back, and show favor to those who mean us harm. At the same time these “lawmakers” allow disrespectful (dare I say illegal) access to the institutions of government and those that serve there. Should there be changes, and is there problems, you bet. But using a sledge hammer is sure as hell not the proper way for sensible people to address these issues. Way to indescrimate. It will be interesting when the sledge hammer hits the VA. I pray we as veterans survive this senseless and brainless rampage. Think “Kristallnacht”.\nI don’t believe this is true DOGE is gutting every agency why not VA and there is no evidence that what they are saying is true. I believe we Vets are about to get screwed again.\nThis sounds like a political propaganda video. There are cuts being made and many veterans that work for the VA have lost their jobs. How does this help ALL of our veterans. I am thankful for being a veteran and for everything the VA has done for me but when someone has to create a video praising our first felon President and a new program (DOGE) that was created by this corrupt President gives me pause.\nThank you, Secretary Collins.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) improperly awarded $10.8 million in bonuses to senior executives using funds from the PACT Act. The money was intended to retain employees in understaffed positions.\nExplanation\nThe PACT Act expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to environmental toxins.\nThe VA Secretary could award up to 25% of an employee’s basic pay as a Critical Skills Incentive (CSI).\nThe VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the money was given to senior executives in the VA Central Office in Washington, DC.\nThe OIG report found that seven executives in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) received bonuses of more than $100,000.\nI will have my lawyer contact you since I still have cases pending.\nI am not a firm believer in the lies the politicians, news media, and just anybody speaking is saying. I depend on this money to survive, and I am concerned about what a nonelected official does with my income and the nation’s money.\nMy lawyer info:\nTravis Neidig\nI actually copied this from a previous comment to save me time, as I am a 100% disabled veteran who served in Desert Storm, Desert Shield, and left the military at the end of Operation Enduring Freedom. I retired from the Government job I had about 2.5 years ago, because I just could not function anymore due to the amount of pain and discomfort, plus my double vision in one eye/eye sight loss from a head trauma while on active duty. I need to know as like it is stated below, as I have sent messages to my Senators, and I get back a typical Republican statement that does not answer my question. I need to make sure my disability payments will not be in jeopardy, period. My wife is disabled from a stoke and I need to care for her. If my disability pay gets cut I will have to sell everything I own, as I have a house payment, bills, and her medical as well. I have been following what this administration is doing and I for one am worried as my pension from the government is small. You said there will no cuts the Veterans Benefits? I need some reassurance on this.\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nHey, Doug, what a bunch of bullsh-t. You work for President Musk and vice-president Donald Trump. They are nothing but bullsh-tters. How can you guys fire thousands of VA professional workers and expect things to improve for us veterans? Trump is a five-time draft dodger. He never served in the military. Neither did President Musk. They don’t give a sh-t about veterans; they only care about themselves and their billionaire friends. You have to do what the -ssholes tell you to do. How do you expect veterans to believe or trust you? Two of my VA medical appointments were recently canceled and rescheduled farther out. My primary care doctor is booked up close to the end of 2025; actually, I can’t even get an appointment with him. My doctor appointments are now being scheduled with nurses. I don’t care to hear your bullsh-t, which is just parroting what your bosses tell you to say. I’ll believe you when you can stand up to Musk and Trump, bring back the fired professionals, and make actual improvements at the VA for veterans and VA employees. Oh, and tell Musk and Trump to take their DOGe bullsh-t and stick it up their -sses.\nIf you feel like it is time to do something about your disability rating send me a message. Don’t put it off any longer.\nUS Army Retired PA and former compensation and pension examiner\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed. It has come to my attention that these employees, who have undergone a rigorous and lengthy vetting process, are at risk of being reduced due to financial decisions influenced by external factors, such as the actions taken by Elon Musk and his involvement with DOGE.\nWhile it has been assured that monetary benefits for veterans will not be affected, the quality of care we receive is undeniably compromised when there are insufficient staff to meet our needs. The dedicated federal employees at our VA facilities are crucial to maintaining the standard of care that veterans rightfully deserve. Reducing their numbers would significantly strain the remaining staff, ultimately affecting the well-being of the veterans they serve.\nI urge you to reconsider any actions that would lead to further staff reductions and to prioritize the needs of veterans by ensuring that our VA facilities are adequately staffed and resourced.\nYou lie. You are posting a pro Trump video. Doge doesn’t need my info. My disability is minimal. I deserve more.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed.

Tell me Veterans, do you feel supported?\nHe supported the decision to FIRE 1,000 VA employees\nMr Sectary\nI filled out the form and the computer says I already made the comment and things still haven’t changed in the last eight years.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non-citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. You can’t even go in to drop off paperwork without an appointment. The guard at the doors won’t even allow you in to talk to someong to make an appointment. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007. Was put on these lifetime drugs. When I moved to my new location because of marriage I was told by the VA station I couldn’t get my heart medicines because they weren’t service related. There is tons of missing benefits here and we are treated like animals.\nArthur Christopher Tanny\nSecretary Collins,\nFirst and foremost, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT.\nSecondly, I started reading through the previous comments and personally I was shocked at the vitriol and downright hate (SCREAMED) at you and you just walked in the door. I am sure you will have everything straight by next week.\nAs some of the posters noted, their distrust of the VA and all of the red tape is warranted, taken sometimes years to get anywhere. Personally, I am a proud Vietnam Vet 68-69 and I didn’t approach the VA because I felt there were many more Vets that needed the services more than I did so I stayed silent. However, fast forward to 2021- I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer and CLL-Leukemia at the same time. I reached out to the VA to see if I could get added to Community Care with my outside Oncologist to be able to get my medication through the VA Pharmacy. On the outside this medication is $3,000 a month but through the VA it was $11.00 so you can see why I worked through the process and was successful. Fast Forward once again to 2023 my VA Oncologist asked me why I wasn’t submitting paperwork for the Pact Act benefit which listed CLL Leukemia as being associated with Agent Orange. I applied and after back and forth paperwork over months and months I received my 100% disability, for which I am eternally grateful.\nThank you for what you are doing and good luck as you dig through reams and reams of backdated paperwork. I’m sure you will be finished by next week.\nFrom a fellow Georgian\nI agree with our secretary in TOTAL. DOGE will make the necessary cuts anywhere possible and most needed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of our tax dollars.\nSo how does his speech line up with Elmo firing a thousand probationary employees of the VA?\nYou Trumpers really know how to lie with a straight face, don’t you?\nThe VA budget is being cut and VP Trump via Project 2025 seeks to minimize veterans benefits. That covers healthcare, disability, staff, hell, you’ll probably go after pensions next. Your sick Prez Musk is in your computers right now removing people and projects and cases and accessing our personal and financial information illegally. You’re Trump’s sycophant. You and the rest of the criminal gang want to kick us to the curve and let us fend for ourselves.\nBecause this is an oligarchical coup, not a government, and the only thing you care about is your tee time. Not us. End the gaslighting. Just tell us when you’re going to remove certain services.\nTo anyone reading this: if you abstained or voted for Trump, YOU are the problem. We who voted rationally don’t want to hear your whining. You refused to listen to your libtard neighbor and your snowflake kid who insisted you were voting against your interests. He’s in there now. Think he’ll leave after four years? Ha! Fascism and oligarchy rule now. We’ll be lucky to see another election until he’s out.\nThis message is not WCAG2.1 ADA ]accessibility compliant. The text is too small to read and there is no button to click up or down to change the font size.\nHey knucklehead, they have already been reduced with the lack of hiring nurses and in other ways. Stop the gaslighting!\nLots of complaining about what hasn’t even happened and “you support an authoritarian” blah blah blah. Shut up. I’m not sure all of these responses are from Veterans, way to self interested.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007. Was put on these lifetime drugs. When I moved to my new location because of marriage I was told by the VA station I couldn’t get my heart medicines because they weren’t service related. There is tons of missing benefits here and we are treated like animals.\nArthur Christopher Tanny\nThank you Secretary Collins. You are a good man and are dedicated to veterans. The system is pretty broken and has been for decades as you know. DOGE will find tons of fraud I’m sure. Hopefully with the common sense decisions you will be able to help the VA get some efficiency!\nWhy is the government telling the VA they can’t prescribe pain medicine ? Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin doesn’t always do the trick. I’ll bet when someone in government needs pain meds, he can get them without any hassles.\nI personally believe we veterans deserve the continued assistance we require. The VA health system has been my lifeline. It has provided me with numerous treatments and medications that have sustained my life. I could not have experienced any better care even on the outside as much as I have at my VA facilities. Please do not take this very needed assistance from us. Thank you.\nThank you for VA services, veteran’s care, efficiency, and all services and funds provided!\nI communicate with the entire staff on my VA visits and I hear the same thing all the time. All staff feal they have no say in what their department needs. In the military we had the same problem! The officers have to communicate with the grunts to know what their needs are. I hope the new administration can make this happen !\nSo, reading between the lines here… our benefits are in danger, the administration is looking to cut services to us, and this is Mr. Collins trying to hide that fact so we think that we’re safe so when Musk and his goon squad do come in, we won’t be ready for it.\nI remember that NY Times Op-Ed about how our benefits package is too generous. I remember the limp-fisted attempts to manufacture consent for this. Musk and Trump think we’re stupid, and either Mr. Collins does, too, or is desperate to save his job.\nI doubt if anyone appointed by felon T can be trusted.\nRight. Way to toe the line. Cuts will come. The republicans are after Medicare, veterans benefits, Medicaid, and social security benefits. If you are working to improve the VA, then why did you allow President Elon to fire 1,000 VA workers? I assist veterans with obtaining benefits and I am seeing simple things like keeping a college attending child on the veteran’s benefits taking upwards of 10 months (and counting). Don’t say you’re improving when they are reducing efficiency and the ability to get benefits.\nWay to toe the party line.\nI have a vet friend. Who is 100% because he has a rare terminal blood cancer caused by Agent Orange. He just got a letter from the VA. It stated he was being DROPPED to 10%. His cancer is service connected and will eventually KILL HIM. Why is he being downgraded?\nThank you for your work\nWe must fill the jobs a our VA’s Hospitals across the country so we get the best care after fighting for our country as we were promised.\nOh, our data a safer alright. Problem is us vets can’t get into our accounts anymore. Read the comments on the how to sign in section!!!\nWatch for censorship here, as is common in Yahoo.\nI THINK THE ISSUE IS THE RUMORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ANGRY RELATED TO THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nI THINK IF YOU PROVIDED AN OUTLINE OF WHAT AND HOW YOU WILL MANAGE THE VA WILL CLARIFY ALL ISSUES.\nPLACE ALL ISSUES IN THE SUNSHINE; OPEN TO PUBLIC REVIEW.\nIF FRAUD; SHOW THE FRAUD ETC.. WHO, WHAT, WHERE , WHEN AND HOW MUCH?\nPROVIDE RATIONAL FOR ANY FIRINGS OR REMOVAL OF VA STAFF.\nI AM 82. VIETNAM ARMY MEDIC IN 1966-67 IN CU CHI, TAY NINH, IRON TRIANGLE, HOBO WOODS TDY WITH 196TH.

WE DID OUR DUTY.\nNOW YOU MUST DO YOUR DUTY. GOD BLESS.\nAnd you all are going to believe this guy? Wait (not too long) and watch. Be ready to act (if you haven’t started already).\nThat guy is pushing the party line and that’s to be expected. But I only see our nation crumbling around us if we don’t protect ourselves.\nFelon and draft dodger Trump, ignorant and uninformed, continues his vengeance against the federal government, hurting veterans and their families. Congress and the Supreme court must stop the lunatic, and send him to prison where he belongs.\nSecretary Collins,\nNeed we remind you that going on video for all the public to see with a bald face lie will mark you a liar and just another sycophant to the king wannabe. The administration is leaning HARD on every single organisation to make 50% cuts in personnel! VA has always been under staffed and sorely underfunded….exactly how are you planning on improving care and services….your math doesn’t add up and your dog doesn’t hunt.\nThank you for you gracious address to all Veteran’s. The VA has assisted me in obtaining a college degree in education. I taught U.S. History, U.S. Government and taught other subjects including Coaching High School sports.\nI was a Hospital Corpsman in the Vietnam War and in maneuvers I damaged my left shoulder severely and needed basically a rebuilt shoulder. Unfortunately, the shoulder never healed properly and have had seven other shoulder surgeries, plus a replacement shoulder on both the left and right shoulder. The VA has been cordial and I have had a disability since 1975. I am now at 90%. I have suffered many years with mental and emotional stress and a divorce because of being drafted the same month I was to get married. The many days away and missing loved ones home caused great animosity. The ridicules, the spitefulness, the blatant acts employers displayed with their discriminatory acts of hiring then later firing because of so called necessary lay offs particularly to Vietnam Veterans. It took me thirteen years to finally feel caught up with those who didn’t have to go in the service for many unexcuseable means that dealt with the rich and what congressman did you happen to be acquainted with. All wars are always fought by the pons on a chess board, or families are just to poor to get their son in to the reserves, national guard and of course college. I have never come to grips with all of the anxiety and the deceitfulness that I constantly received. I still can’t decide what branch of the military I belonged with. I did appreciate the respect the Marine Corp gave to the Hospital Corpsman. One of the greatest titles I have ever received is “DOC!” I am still attempting to finalize my disability to 100%. It may bring a conclusion of the four years, difficulties after the military years, and anxiety and emotional setbacks. Sorry about allowing me to sound off. I feel I have but a couple of years left and I would feel compensated for those many years of unsureity. Sincerely, Daniel R. Polad\nMr. Secretary,\nWhile you raised important points, it is noteworthy that you did not reference the current budget proposal that aims to implement these exact cuts. While I understand that media coverage may not always align with the perspectives of officials, it is essential to recognize that the media plays a crucial role in informing the public and promoting awareness. If there are claims being made that you deem inaccurate, I urge you to counter these reports with relevant information rather than relying on political talking points. regardless of our political affiliation, Veterans deserve transparency and honesty regarding our benefits and the policies affecting them. Therefore, it is imperative that you and your team provide us with accurate and comprehensive information. We understand that you are the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. As such, we expect full transparency and request that you address the current budget proposal that aligns with Project 2025’s goal to implement several radical changes to VA benefits.\nSince DOGE is currently conducting finical awareness, will VA Disability have an increase. Like when Congress voted on a 40% increase to their annual pay. Also will there be a look into revising the appeal process for disability, some vets have been dealing with this for over 5 years. Lastly , will they be reviewing TAPS? Didn’t get much out of it to be honest.\nYeah you really shouldn’t be carrying Trump’s water.\nPeople are gonna be pissed, and your reputation will be in tatters. We aren’t stupid.\nMR. COLLINS,\nAS A COMBAT VETERAN, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE VA AUTHORIZE GLP1 FOR WEIGHT LOSS PURPOSES. CURRENTLY THE VA WILL AUTHORIZE GLP1 IF YOU ARE OBESE OR DIABETIC. THERE ARE LOTS OF US WITH WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT FALL INTO THE TWO PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CONDITIONS, WE ARE NOT ELGIBLE FOR GLP1 OR SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS. MANY HAVE WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BECAUSE OUR AGED BODIES NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO METABOLIZE SUGAR. IT’S VERY SIMILAR TO HYPO THYROID CONDITIONS, THE BODY QUITS MAKING THYROID HORMONES AND WITH PRESCRIBED MEDICATION WE CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. I’M EATING 1000 CALORIES PER DAY AND CONTINUE TO GAIN WEIGHT. SO PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS TO THE VETERANS FOR WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION. I CURRENTLY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THESE MEDICATIONS.\nTHANK YOU,\nAL LEHMAN (ALSLEHM@GMAIL.COM)\ni want to remind the President and Trump that this countrry’s veterans are highly trained and do not take it well feeliing that our government is going to try to take away any part of our earned benefits. Screwing around with veterans is a fast way to be removed from office one way or another. Also, get the Camp Lejeune Pact Act done!\nYou’d better hope so\nYou Sir, sound like you are completely full of sh*t. Just another T**** stooge. “Hit the ground running”?? Yeah, sure did—abolishing basic rights enshrined in our dear Constitution and claiming to be the arbiter of ‘what is law’ or not. Literally calls himself a ‘king’. What the actual f.\nWe certainly can’t trust the new potus, so why in the hell would we trust you when you say he’s doing a ‘good job’?? Pound sand you smarmy politician.\nI am a Georgian and Disabled Combat veteran from my service in combat in Vietnam and Gulf ! (Desert Storm).\nI offer my congratulations to my fellow Georgian Secretary Collins on his appointment. AND to my fellow vets i know this man from his campaign rallies for political office in Georgia, and he is a fine, honest man who will offer HOPE to vets for equitable and FAIR treatment by the VA. He has already addressed his intent to greatly improve the VA and I hope we as Vets can aid him in helping us.\nLike all of YOU, I await better things.\nIf you say the VA will not be affected then why have VA employees been fired by DOGE ??\nI do not believe you. I do not believe you have our best interest at heart and I do not support our President Musk and his lackey Trump. I did not vote for those derelict felons and so don’t appreciate our personal informative being given to them. My family going back to my grandfather has served in every war since the Civil War. The way this government is going, we will not be the United States of America anymore. We will be the United States of Russia or whoever has the most money.\nDo not touch our benefits or you will see war.\nPlease get the Community Centers in Colorado to approve care outside of the VA. I’ve having to pay for my care while they sit on the paperwork. Then to be told that their doctor that reviews case said no over rides the PCP (who’s in North Carolina. Haven’t seen a physical doctor since 2020 ) from the VA. Been fighting this for 3 years for care and can’t get reimbursed for treatment that I’ve had to pay waiting. They have 45 days to processes refusals, then send a notice denied for continued care on acupuncture. When they do approve it’s for 11 visits. If they allowed 30 visits for a year it would save money in all this process. Folks that have test for cancer and other serious conditions are having the same problem here in Colorado. I have been to the VA in DC and they have the Community Care call me which doesn’t solve the problem. I’ve been told by them the “Corporations” policies state they have to deny at least once a year. I have a long list of excuses they’ve given me for delays and denying or approval. Please help.\nOur benefits may not be getting cut but it is a shame that the job cuts and hiring freeze has stopped the expansion of a new CBOC branch in Las Cruces New Mexico.\nI don’t believe a word of it. Anyone appointed by the current regime is suspect at a minimum, a co-conspirator and kleptocrat in reality.\nHe’s a trumper. I cannot trust him.\nThey cut the Veteran Crisis Hotline this week. This is so necessary for veterans who are suffering from PTSD and suicidal ideation.\nOn average, around 17 U.S. veterans die by suicide each day. In 2023, according to the most recent VA data, Its around 17 to 22 people daily.\nAs for the Veterans Crisis Line, the VA reported that in 2023, the hotline received about 1,000 to 1,500 calls per day on average. The number of texts and chat messages has also increased, showing the desperate and growing demand for mental health support among veterans.\nCutting these services means more people who are desperate don’t get the help they need. It means more people will die. I’d much rather have my tax dollars go towards helping kids be able to each school lunches and veterans in great need than padding the pockets of people destroying the last fabrics of community and care we have for our most vulnerable. Tax cuts for the rich don’t benefit the great good. No one voted for this.\nDOGE is a scam designed by south African musk and felon don to screw veterans out of their benefits.\nThey’ve already fired suicide prevention counselors and other vital VA workers.\nDo not trust them. These fascist are dangerous.\nThe secretary of the VA, Doug Collins, speaks with forked tongue!! Check the Ann Arbor, MI VA. People are being fired. One lady with 38 years there and only 2 years from retirement, gone! Take his words with a grain of salt. That VA medical facility is one of the busiest in Michigan.\nthere are approx 19,000,000 living Veterans.\nless than half, about 9,000,000, are served by VA.\n(far less have P&T ratings)\nimagine if VA had them all or even 75% — they’d need 6x budget increase, as they already need a 3x.\nREMEMBER THE VA’S MOTTO\nLIE, DENY, THEN YOU DIE!\nSO YOU ARE GOING TO HELP THE VET. I AM A VET US M C 66 70 IN NAM. I GET TREADED LAIK A DOG OR WORSE AT THE V A. HOWABOUT 38 MONTH TO GET HEARING AID. HOW ABOUT THE V A LEFT A TUMER IN MY HEAD FOR 4 TO 6 YEARS. I COULD GO ON AND ON. IF THE VET CONG DONT KILL YOU THE V A WILL.\nDoge needs to be eliminated like all enemies of the American People\nThanks, good to hear\nIt’s a cinch you’ve NOT been keeping up with nor understanding EXACTLY what is happening within and to our VA! You “claim” to be partnering with DOGE … however, these teenagers have NEVER been vetted nor given “clearances” as any other government worker HAS to do. They are also NOT experts in contract development nor do they have the necessary background/expertise in budget forensics. They are ONLY programmers who know LITTLE about the Cobalt (one of the main program languages used by our government) language or HOW to use it. WE have no guarantees that they are NOT just scamming the data as there are NO apparent guardrails to ensure WHAT is done with that data both during and following their “rummaging around” those databases. You are NEW to this Department and job. You have NO ONE with any historical background to understand WHATEVER they might tell you. We know, for a fact, that they’ve delved into the SS database and have NO expertise for dealing with that data. Their claim that some 150+ year olds are still being paid PROVES they have little expertise to parse out the data in a meaningful way! I’ve no confidence in your ability to “cover” the VA’s needs given how you’ve addressed this attack on the VA data.\n100% SC veterans at the Louis A Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg , WV. (VISN 5) are waiting over one year to get dental services needed in the community, that they cannot offer in house ! Only approximately 6 veterans per month are approved on the waiting list of over 100 names ! Why ?\nVerty nice shill for Trump.

I Was at step 5 for the past 10 weeks, then suddenly I went backwards to step four and got emails that I’m going to be redoing my C and P Exams, I’m guessing to do their best to make me look like an idiot and a liar.

I constantly feel on the brink of losing my sense of reality and breaking down beyond the ability to pick myself back up. I don’t know how to try harder,, I’ve given it all I’ve got. I know longer know what to do. I know there are others in what seems like a desperate place and now this, now another failure. You say you’re here to help, but I now feel that is a cruel untruth . I’m going to pray for me and all of the other veterans that are counting on you.\nBrenda Grimm\nI DO NOT BELIEVE YOU. Prove it that you are going to keep and expand the VA work force that is in dire need of MORE health professionals, not less. When I can not get an eye appointment for six months at the VA in Lakewood Washington and have to go to community care, THAT IS WRONG. We need more VA professionals, not less. Tell DOGE, go to Russia to find savings!!\nut oh. now we know our benefits are up for the chop.\nThese people are straight up liars.\nI was recently drooped from80%to seventy because they said they made a mistake and keep saying bone on bone gets better what kind of doctor or human being is that stupid afer 43 yers\nNobody believes you. Of course why should we be surprised.\nHow does DOGE define “efficiency”? That’s such a broad term.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/\nClose and sell all VA Hospitals and clinics, property, medical machines, etc. All of those employees laid off (DR, NP, RN, MA, etc) will hire into the medical field where they want, filling staffing needs at local hospitals and clinics. It will either grow hospitals and clinics, or empower those workers to start their own businesses and locations. You could even give them preferential service agreements/contracts. That allows us to go wherever we want/need to go for services needed. The VA ID and SSN is our insurance card. VA gets billed & bargains with the providers, and settles to pay them. That way we find and keep our PCP, specialists, etc. No need for travel claims and reimbursements. Selling the buildings and properties will also allow new businesses to develop and put money back into the VA. Only a few employees would be needed for staffing admin (negotiations, verifiers, approvers, and logistics). Run the numbers and tell me I’m wrong.\nY’all just cut 1000 workers and you’re trying to feed us this line? Trump calls us all suckers and losers, and you’re one of his sycophants who defends him relentlessly despite that. You need to do your ACTUAL job and defend veterans with more than just false reassurances and platitudes, what are you actually going to do to help us? Hire those thousand people back and then further expand the VA’s workforce because a consistent problem with services is everyone who works for the VA and does real work is overworked due to how poorly staffed it was before your lousy boss decided to cut that many people for no good reason. Do better. Don’t let some illegal immigrant heading an illegal “department” destroy the VA.\nhttps://youtu.be/9RMzs0EplZw?si=RBEJ–KbuMUvZnmT\nIn the words of Carol Kane from the Princess Bride, “Liar! Liar! Liiaaaaaarrr!” Of the 1,000 VA employees who were cut, hundreds of those were direct service providers including those who man the Veterans Crisis Line. Many others were claims processors and related positions, who are responsible for making sure veterans claims for benefits are processed in a timely and quality manner. Therefore when you say we are putting the money to use for veterans, you are liar.\nOnly two defining forces have ever offered to sacrifice their lives for us, Jesus Christ and the American Veteran. I’m a 100% disabled veteran and any reduction or cuts to our benefits would create a hardship for me and my brothers! BM3 USCG Cold War veteran.\nDear Sir,\nI have faith in you looking after the veteran.\nThank you\nDon A.\nI’m sorry to see the VA secretary become a mouthpiece for the lies that the POTUS is spewing. I’m sorry, but he’s not worth listening to.\nALL of these firings within government institutions is “their” effort to have only those loyalists (fellow republicans) staffing them. Voter rolls were the first to be examined before the chopping began! Trump hates anything to do with the military (having stolen the one million he raised for vets during his 2015 campaign). Remember how he refused to honor WWI vets while in France during the 100th year anniversary of the war because his hair would get wet! He’ll disrespect and will take everything away from you, too!\nHow could we believe ANYTHING that this guy says, based on who he represents?? It’s so sad. Unfortunately people will find out after the fact.\nWhen will the Secretary address the issue of benefits which have already been cut? Namely, the reduced hirings of doctors, nurses and technicians throughout the 170 hospital and clinic system. The shortage is acute. The only way a vet can see a real doctor these days is to protest the medical attention of “nurse practitioners,” who obviously are not doctors.\nVeterans are not dummies. We see, as Secretary Gen. Shinseki warned before Trump fired him, that a certain faction of politicians and avaricious businessmen is doing all it can to make the VA appear to be dysfunctional and failing, so that the way will be paved for giving the VA to Wall Street. And the ultimate reasoning behind this nefarious plan is that our free hospital system for veterans is “socialism.” Capitalists hate giving away “free stuff,” even if it is vital medical services and drugs to care for the men and women who sacrificed their precious time and sometimes their health and their very lives to defend the United States of America, whatever role, great or small, that they played.\nBetter helping us? Clinics and centers are already understaffed, in what reality is firing 1000+ staff helpful? How is downsizing the Crisis Hotline helpful? How is getting rid of SSRIs and telling receiptents to go to ‘wellness farms’ helping veterans?!\nIn what reality is taxing benefits and even thinking of limiting benefits and making them even harder to get helpful? This administration is turning into a dumpster fire and regret ever having voted for him and his unelected lackey. I have more trust in the real people getting notices and emails within the VA, on ground dealing with all of this and sounding the alarm then I do a bought yes-man.\nCan you get the VA clinics to hire more doctors? There seems to be a shortage and have to wait months to get into to see one! Also, can you get the VA clinics to start answering their phones? I live in Texas .\nSad situation!\nSecretary, you say at the end “…come to see me.” I need to see you and give you the first-hand look at what this highly rural service-connected disabled veteran needs in the form of efficiency. And I can fill you in on exactly where it is so inefficient in the VISN 20 system of VHA. I don’t need to apply for a claim, I don’t need to ask for more money, I don’t need to hope that the Office of Rural Health will be there for addressing the rural veteran’s delima of the benefit of basic medical care because this division of the VHA is only apparent to the veteran in this corner of the country to be a research gathering institution and no longer accessible to the veterans that depend on that voice that separates us from the urban veteran that has much more efficient/available/more choices of receiving medical care whether it be basic medicine or even more critical, the unique medical needs of that mostly alone to the veteran and not that of the general human race. Please let me know how I can speak with you, I’ll even be glad to make a trip to the big building in DC where you keep your desk, that is if I’m even as a veteran allowed to enter that building (past administrations made it off limits in the simplest of terms where as it was easier and more productive to be invited in to the White House complex just down the street). So please reach out to me and I’ll be glad to provide some efficiency from the most western spot in the lower 48 that one can live…and loving it.\nPersonal note: I always knew the chaplain had my back in the many years I served, and it’s the chaplain once again that has had my back in recent years at the VHA, and I understand and have confidence the chaplain on the flight deck is going to have my back also. Instills confidence there is hope.\nI don’t believe anything this man says. He is nothing more than a Trump toadie.\nI would like to come see you.But ,i probably wont be the only one.\nI find it hard to believe the words coming out of the mouths of imbecilic lickspittle…\nThank you very much! Unlike many people commenting on here im doing great! I appreciate my benefits, it seems like everyone is a victim these days. If you need any help let me know. Make America Great Again!! ?\nLeave my VA and my disability benefits alone. Stop firing staff! Allow me to continue to receive the excellent health care offered me since 1975. And I don’t believe you Collin’s.\nThis could not be more wrong. VA employees have been fired en masse without cause. I fail to see how that could possibly make anything faster. Where is your integrity? Shame on you, Mr. Secretary.\nWe have been waiting many years and were told by the end of June this year. (first it was January. Hope they get more people to help sort this out.\nHe’s lying. Like a snake. This administration and all their toadies don’t give a damn about veterans. They’ve fired the staff manning the suicide crisis phone line. They DON’T CARE about us. Period. This is all bullshit and mirrors, and we vets need to stand up against those who would reneg on the promise we made – our lives for the safety of America, and they will take care of us afterwards.\nWhy are my comments not being posted as I wrote them? I thought we had free speech in this country.\nThat’s what Hegseth told the DoD…And now guess what President Elon has announced?\nIn the Philippine, they do not pay travel pay because a few file a false travel claim. Instead of punish them, they are punishing all veterans. I think if someone file a false Travel claim, they should lose all their VA benefits.\nLook into veterans getting private doctor prescriptions filled at the V.A. pharmacy.\nWe can’t see our providers because we have NO providers. Tell me what’s efficient about that. The programs mean nothing if they are not accessible and efficient. How do I know this? I’m a Physician Assistant and have practiced medicine for 18yrs in the Army and now in the civilian sector. THE VETERANS NEED HEALTHCARE and other services NOW.\nIf they aren’t going to attack VA benefits, why has musk and his clowns fired people hired to saves veterans lives from committing suicide!? From what I’ve read musk and his idiots have started firing sucide hotline personnel!\nYou are serving a criminal who is dismantling my beloved Republic in a EO coup and handing over unconstitutional power, to an unelected, unvetted, Unconfirmed by Congress civilian billionaire that has him by the short and curlies. You and the rest of his fascist oligarchs and lapdogs should be ashamed of yourself, and you’re not. You have spit on my constitution, my oath(and your own) and my service as well as all those who have served before me and continue to do so. If you voted for Fat Nixon, you are either complicit in his crimes, or you allowed yourself to be duped because he hates the same people you do. You are NOT patriots. You’re nothing but low-level co-conspirators and I wished you would feel the pain that’s coming the most. But that’s not how this works. You’ve hurt all of us equally. Way to go.\n“find things we need to get rid of…”? That’s oddly not reassuring. What do you mean? What things? Be more transparent!\nYOU SOUND LIKE ONE OF TRUMP’S HENCHMEN IN WHICH WE SHOULD QUESTION ANY STATEMENT MADE. IT’S A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS, BUT THAT IS WHAT MYSELF AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE FACING. WORK ON GETTING TRUMP OUT AS PRESIDENT AND INTO A JAIL CELL (WHERE HE BELONGS AS A CONVICTED FELON), AND THEN YOU MAY BE MORE CREDIBLE.\nThanks for making it clear to all Veterans.\nAny veteran that voted for the current occupant of the White House betrayed the oath they took and disgraced the uniform. Our fathers and granfathers fought a war against fascism…. and you voted for it.\nI agree hole heartedly\nyour good i support trump and believe you\nYou don’t hire a bunch hackers (including a teenager) to do audits and forensic accounting work.\nI give this guy as much credibility as I do Trump and VP Musk- zero.\nNo veteran wants to — nor deserves to — be held in suspended animation while you attempt to digest the words of a lactose intolerant Commander-In-Chief with a documented history of bone spurs.\nThe rest of us have REAL issues.\nSecVA Doug Collins is either cutting veterans benefits or he isn’t. Don’t play the game, twinkle toes.\nRestore the SIPU’s Combat Vets need them\nWho removed Paragraph G in VFR 1108.08 and why?\nBill Montanari\nInteresting. Tell me, why would there be a need to “find things we need to get rid of”?\nWhere did that money go that you will have to “put the money where it belongs …. back with our veterans”?\nCan you give a guarantee that it won’t get “lost” again? I know, there is no guarantee.\nThank you for clearing up the rumors. Additionally thank you for taking on the role of VA Secretary, this job will certainly change you.\nI am very familiar with the Charles George Medical center in Asheville, NC. My husband had a hemorrhagic stroke in August 2020. Agent Orange left my Viet Nam vet with, among other things, chronic high blood pressure that, although he lived an incredibly healthy lifestyle, caused a small blood vessel to burst in his brain. My guy, who was a very successful small business owner, a great father, a builder of all things, including a family, a business, a cabin cruiser sailboat and our current home, has spent the last 4.5 years in a bed, having been robbed of all his gumption and motivation, not to mention the use of the left side of his body. He’s a shell of the man he used to be.\nIf it wasn’t for the Asheville VA and the amazing and dedicated employees and support staff, helping to guide us through the complicated morass of the system we would not still be in our home, I’d probably be in the hospital and my husband would probably be in a substandard hell hole of a “nursing home”.\nHow dare you and your commander and his ilk be so damned cavalier with the futures of the men and women who kept you and all the rest of us safe by offering up their own lives in service. How dare you fire the very people who make so many veterans’ and their families’ lives more liveable!\nEvery damn single employee (or volunteer) we have encountered at the VA medical center is there because they CARE and appreciate the men and women who serve/served this country. We do not need less of them, we need more! I feel very fortunate that my husband received his disability rating (a year after initial application), I am being compensated for being a full time caregiver (a year after initial application) and that we just got major funding for a converted van (a year after initial application) that my husband can drive his wheelchair into and we can actually TRAVEL to the VA again. We hope to go visit our daughter and other family members now!\nIt was the dedicated workers through the VA who made this happen for us. We are grateful every day for them. They, like the Capitol Police officers, should be held up in praise for the sacrifices and dedication they have made for us. WE NEED MORE OF THEM.\nIf you want to eliminate WASTE, start at the top, with the commander in chief and the unelected Elon Musk lording over the DOGE.\nHow long will you continue to lie to our faces!\nStart answering the 100s of questions posted here instead of continuing Trumps big lie!\nIt’s about time I am a combat wounded from the operation desert stormn/shield seen combat and got danger pay and over seas pay and got the combat action war ribbon but not a combat action badge why not thank you joseph\nDon’t believe a word this man says. He is Trump selected.\nWhy does the VA play with my percentage? every time I have had an evaluatuion they may give me an increase in the area of concern at the time, but decrease the percentage on a prior evaluation percentage.\nSo….. I call B.S. Sending Vets out in the community isn’t “improving Veterans care…” In the 21 yrs I’ve gone to the V.A., I’ve never had a bad provider. If you think waiting to be seen would be better, try calling a civilian provider for an appointment and see how far out they are booked. The V.A. is well versed in matters specific to Vets, like Agent Orange exposure, etc; that civilian providers (especially those with no military service background) are not experienced with. The contract with those who defend this country is based in part by the country providing care…it’s one of the reasons we take so much less compensation then our civilian peers. Pushing us out to the civilian community is just a ‘passing the buck’ play of shucking that responsibility.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD (even though I provided a buddy statement from my commanding officer who also served as VA Secretary), TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nLooking forward to the improvements and increased focus on Veterans!\nThank you for the update !\nWe are supposed to trust your word? I didn’t cripple myself in order for fascists could take over our government.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD, TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nHow can we be sure that you are truthful? Certainly, the president isn’t as well and is not being transparent. How can we trust you when you believe in him?\nI am a 90% unemployable disabled Army Veteran. I am also 63 years old. I fought tooth and nail and struggled for years to receive my rating. To cut my compensation would truly put my wife and I in jeopardy. The VA has been helping me and my wife now that my rating has been increased. I have VAHC and she has CHAMPVA that helps us with our medical care.\nI have faith in Pres. Trump and Elon Musk to cut government fat. I was shocked to see what USAID was spending on other countries under the title of CHARITY. That money could go to homeless vets or programs for Americans.\nMr. Secretary I have confidence in you and your office. I trust you are fighting for the Veteran along with Sec. Hegseth and Pres. Trumps team.\nHorse excrement. I was at my VA clinic today – there is a nurse shortage AND A HIRING FREEZE thanks to your buddy the S. African fraudster and his little band of DOGEbags. Congress already woefully underfunds the VA to serve veterans and now the hiring freeze..?\nYou’re a liar, sir.\nNEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF BOYS! AND HE WORKS HARDER THAN THE LAST 5 ADMINISTRATIONS PUT TOGETHER. NO MORE FUNDS FOR DUDS.??\nOne week on the job and Collins is already attacking the media who is trying to report all the cuts this administration is making. Collins is lying, they have already fired all the provisional VA hotline workers.\nBS. I was at my VA today – there is a nurse shortage and now a hiring freeze. So even if you were telling the truth the VA is woefully understaffed to serve veterans properly. And that is on the Congress. Call your buddies and call OFF the foreigner and his DOGEbags\nYour comments are all in present tense. You do NOT affirm that benefits will not be cut in the future.\n1000 VA employees were cut. The VA was already understaffed. Where are we when VA staff retires?\nOur new VA secretary is an obsequious Trump toady . I watched the video. No explanation about the 1,000 employees who were fired last week. Plus a half truth about DOGE. We don’t know if they’ve taken VA patients information – yet. But they already have every US citizen’s personal info following their raid on the US Treasury. Yes, Project 2025 plans to cut your benefits. The way I see it, the plan is to annoy you into giving up by having you constantly re-verify your disability rating, plus some services will be made unavailable to you. I’m sure the new Secretary is going to be OK with that. A lie by omission is still a lie, Chaplain Collins. Proverbs 19:9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish. Oh, and remember Mr Secretary, If you “hit the ground running”… You’re more than likely going to trip and fall on your face.\nI don’t believe anything that Trump, Musk, or any Trump appointed person says right now. Trump said one minute that Medicaid wouldn’t be cut. An hour later, it was announced that Medicaid would be cut. Firing employees at the VA doesn’t say to me that the cuts are meant to provide better services. It’s the exact opposite.\nA tax on is a cut. A reduction in COLA is a cut\nI am in the same boat with others for my Pact Act retroactive claim.\nDoug Collins on the job one week and he’s already attacking the media. This guy is getting ready to cut benefits, all the while lying through his teeth about it.\nAnd when will something be done about Fort MacClellan. All the chemicals we WACs endured. No one has helped. Sad sad sad yes we are getting old and death has knocked at many doors. Are you waiting till only two are still alive?\nYikes, the wording in this is so concerning. Another pandering to the corrupted leadership. Sure, they won’t do this or that….then proceed to do exactly those things. I’m not holding my breath.\nDEI removal from various VAs already making the staff take down anything dealing with Black History, LGBTQ+, and Woman Veterans says it all. The illegal “promises” of paid leave so you won’t just get fired later is all a joke. Then, not stopping the hate given from old, hateful, brainwashed salts to various minority groups that are also Veterans like themselves is just sad. What happened to this supposed comradery?\nAll of us Veterans served to preserve the freedom we ALL enjoy in the U.S.A., or is it just for the straight white males? This whole video makes me disappointed in the appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\nThere are a lot of individuals below that worded it just so excellently. I will be submitting complaint after complaint to all the various offices until shit stops going backward in time. Even before all of this, it was and still is a full-time job to babysit the VA into doing what it is supposed to do. Several VHA Directives were broken, and lies were spouted. If the military had not messed me up, I wouldn’t be dealing with this organization but here we are.\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nI was told VA is cutting benefits for tinnitus patients. This was alarming. I do suffer from tinnitus but when I had my hearing tested at the VA in Houston I wasn’t tested for tinnitus, I was tested for hearing damage starting from my separation date. After 6 years working on fighter aircraft I have to ask twice, turn the volume up too high for others and other issues not associated with tinnitus and in conjunction with tinnitus. If my disability benefit is cut, so be it. But reading this article seems to conflict with what I was told. So thanks.\nSo why are VA staff members being fired for no reason? That’s not lawful, what about the families of those employees?\n“Trust me, I’m the president”\n“I’m not a crook”\nThings to remember.\nI don’t trust you Collins. I hear that anyone who obtains a position like yours has to state that the 2000 election was stolen in your interview. I don’t trust that sociopath Musk and I damn sure don’t trust that draft dodger Trump. Trump is an amoral unethical dishonorable liar, convicted felon, corrupt businessman and politician who sexually assaults women.\nI hope that what you’re saying is true and that they won’t be taking away veteran’s benefits, for your sake and mine. Because if they do, Oh boy. I can’t even imagine what 5 million veterans, their families, active service members, and the people who support us would be willing to do to wrench that back from a despotic regime. The second you do that, the second a coup starts. Good luck getting the military at large to support you.\nSo much waste. Like paying to ship insulin overnite and it takes FedEx 3-4 days to get it to the veteran. Most time ice pack is warm. Putting the Dexcom transmitters with prosthetics . And then trying to call and ask for refill. No body at VA answers phones. Or returns a call.\nHopefully you’ll go back to letting vets go to outside resources when the waiting list is to long for care.\nThis is how it was done during President Trumps first term and veterans loved it.\nPlease go back to this exceptional resource.\nThank you Secretary Collins\nVetnam vet my records were cleaned came home 1968 they keep denying me veterns affairs needs to get fixed\nHow about helping Veterans who served Honorably instead of Denying better percentage rates. Trillions if dollars go over seas, and billions went to illegals, but Veterans get denied.\nThe secretary can’t guarantee that. How can we trust what the Secretary says, in any case?? 8% cut at the Pentagon and veterans are getting fired so who’s to say that benefits won’t be next in the spring?? You can’t guarantee that Secretary, now can you? Chaos is all that we’re seeing and no promise lasts 5 minutes around here…\nRhank you to all of those trying to make things better !@\nPlease make the VA Insurance considered “ credible” under Medicare guidelines so we can quit paying $180/ month to stay qualified for Medicare without penalty if the VA ever drops veterans currently under VA insurance\nWhy did they cut the Hotline for veterans that had veterans who were thinking of suicides calling in?\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nI hadn’t heard the rumor that benefits were being cut. I DID hear that most of the layoffs at the VA were veterans. Is that true?\nStaffing at my assigned VA Medical Center was already short staffed and personnel cuts will be devastating. I saw my primary doctor at the Baltimore Medical Center in December, when two lumps were found on my throat. She recommended that I be seen by an ENT specialist. However, the earliest appointment I could get is March 4th. Three months to address something that could be very serious in unacceptable. The first week in January, I was referred to physical therapy for lower back pain but the earliest available date is February 25th. I also asked if I could go through Community Care to have my therapy done locally because I live an hour and fifteen minutes from the medical center. Previously, it was quickly approved for another problem. However, this time it was quickly denied. So, at this point, it surely doesn’t seem like money and staffing is being directed to better Veterans health care.\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nAs a mouthpiece for the man who is carving up our civil services and selling them to his toadies, things already weren’t looking great for you. Then you put out this video lying to our faces when we can read exactly what the executive orders say and we know VA staffing, budget, and benefits are being attacked. They’re even floating taxing VA benefits as income as if that were a sane idea. You ought to apologize to us and wash your mouth out with soap. You ought to resign. I’ll thank you to at least stop lying to my face.\nI’m in Spokane where they have been trying to “fix” the new computer system for the past 5 years. If you need a place to flush more money…I’ll take it. The system should have been scrapped years ago. It was to work the day it was paid for and still has problems. Veterans are tired of reporting them as it seems no one cares.\nI Do not trust a draft dodger or a legal alien musk digging into our personal business like soc va and our personal bank accounts veterans deserves better than this.\nI have been fighting the VA since 1969 to have my disability upped to 100%. The most they will grant me is 90%. I have a bullet in my back, and scar tissue from the base of my skull down my back to just above my butt. I also have a scar just behind my left ear and numbness on my hands and both feet un into my calves. Most a bullet logged in my back that somewhere in the paperwork went from be recognized as a bullet to shrapnel fragment. It clearly shows a bullet on my x rays. The VA refuses to understand that I have serious health conditions and continue to ignore my doctor’s letters and medical records. DEALING WITH THE VA especially NOW is horrible and because of the strain it puts on my health I have to step back and keep quiet. There isn’t any hope of help from the VA especially with tRUM P AND musK IN OFFICE.\nAnother Trump shill following his marching orders in fealty to draft-dodging lying Trump. Nothing but bold-faced lies from another radical right christian nationalist on a mission to implement Project 2025, which was the intent all along. I think we’ll soon see Veterans medical services handed off to a private corporation that will only give veterans less service for more money.\nI hope you do I was treated for cancer I did not have 6 months of 3 kind’s of chemo and my primary care doctor told me to shut up about it also severed my lyranex throat has a hole in it\nWhy should we trust anything anyone from this administration says about anything? Going by previous history, none of you cab be trusted.\nThere is no way the VA will operate as efficiently as it should when you fire thousands of employees without doing due diligence and without having invested the time to understand the processes.\nThis is reassuring. However, at Charles George in some clinics long awaited doctors in the employment process ready to join a clinic are having their commitments cancelled. Doctors needed to provide long needed care where the need has for a long time out weighs what can be provided.\nI wish I could believe this guy.\nVietnam vet here. I volunteered to serve, unlike your draft-dodging blustering bully of a President. VA workers are ALREADY being fired and you have the utter gall to gaslight about “improving services.”\nYou are a disgrace and should resign. With all due respect, f-ck off.\nI try to utilize myhealthyvet but cannot figure out why I can’t make progress with any issue that arrises. I got a n assistance with try to find records within the new sign-in processes, and with the assistance was able to get some things to work but during the 5 month process, have lost the myhealthyvet account Username and password to the account itself. The system says my account has no username or password on it.\nHow can it determine the file is there if when requested it says neither item exists??\nI do not want Trump’s goons hacking my email for their filthy N- political messages. Now they want to politicize VA. None of the cowards served, but they’ll suck on the blood of those of us who did. I don’t want Collins hacking my email for his N- agenda, Now I hate Trump and his goons worse. Get out of VA.\nConsidering the manner in which all this CHANGE is taking place and the commotion it is causing, there better be something really noteworthy on the horizon.\nChange for the better is good but the manner in which it is being undertaken is questionable.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins. When the VA has been understaffed and underfunded for at least 50 years, with reports of “probationary staff” at the VA are being fired, and with current difficulties in getting timely appointments, I have serious trouble believing that things are improving. I can imagine VA staff is having a hard time wondering who will be fired.\nWith p47’s past comments about veterans being losers and suckers, I don’t believe he or anyone in his cabinet will make the veterans’ situation better.\nGerald K. Ambroson\nThank you Mr.Secretary and Congressman for your video and straight to the point, no bs regarding the rumors that gets amplified by those using scare tactics. I served 30 years in our Armed Forces, served 1 year with the VA and soon realized to many didn’t live by the creed of President Lincoln’s promise during his famous Gettysburg address. I have also served 11 years as a DOD government employee. Yes those rumors travel fast and many retired military and active duty personnel hear these rumors and I appreciate your video and your words addressing the rumors!!\nYou lost any chance of getting respect from veterans when you allowed Elon’s baby N-s into the VA and gave them access to the computer systems. Congrats on being on the job for only a couple of weeks and already losing the trust of the people you claim you are here to serve. If you are doing anything under the “leadership” of a certain hitler wanna be, then you will never get an ounce of that respect back. YOU ALLOWED THEM TO FIRE 1,000 employees right off the bat, and you think we trust you?\nWhat a crock of trump.\nI don’t believe this sh-t in the slightest.\nThere is nobody associated with the fat orange felon that can be trusted.\nI’m rich, I’m a 0.43 percenter, so I really don’t care if I get my 100% disability each month. Maybe all of you out there should have been a little more financially responsible while you were wasting your money on nonsense.\nThank you for your commitment.\nThank you Secretary Collins for reassuring Veterans that our hard earned benefits are safe under the leadership of President Trump. However, like a football game we are only in the 1st quarter. I continue to be concerned until the 4th quarter. I have heard about 1,000 VA employees (many Veterans) being fired with little or no notice because they were recent hires. The VA must take care of its workers who in turn take care of its Veterans. Please continue to place our Veterans, some [other than me] who have given so much, first. (2/327th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam)\nSir, yes you are clearing cases, but not in the favor of the veterans at all, just the VA. Please don’t try to tell us different! Apparently your office doesn’t answer any questions, as I’m seeing from others. 2 weeks, Sir we’ve been dealing with the bullsh-t longer than that. Ugh!\nAs a veteran,as well as someone who worked at the county level of the VA helping vets with claims and benefits, why would I believe anything he had to say. He is appointed by trumpthefelon, obviously from his statement on DOGE he is giving access and is cooperating ! They are gearing up to privatize the VA health care which IS NOT in the best interest of veterans! How in a week on the job he can say they are “clearing cases faster than ever” is s beyond me! That statement alone sounds exactly like trumpthefelon’s boasting words! It’s a sh-t show that will just continue to get worse .\nCould you clarify for me how many civil service employees received letters that they might no longer be employed by the VA and what this mix of personnel looks like. You may be processing claims more quickly but are service members getting the care they need or are they being farmed out to civilian providers with 6-8 week wait periods? I am a veteran of 28 years service with a disability. I receive my care through Medicare and Tricare for life due to issues w the VA availability of care. It isn’t much better w Tricare for life as the majority of referrals go to outside agencies. The service members and their families are then on their own to find a provider. We called that turfing patients when I worked in health care. Seems there is still a lot of it going on.\nYou did not address peoples concerns about loss of benefits-you shoved it off to an irresponsible media. That is not what I, as a veteran, want to hear.\nV/R\nDoug If the V.A is working faster than ever I would like to know why my higher appeal for care givers has been sitting on someone desk since Nov 2023. And im still waiting for it to be asign to someone . My Husband is a Vietnam Veteran . And was wounded in vietnam shot by is own lieutenant is 90% he has went down hill. For any verteran are family to wait a year is ridculous.\nYou Sir are, full of horse sh-t.\nFirst day in office Trump fired bunch of VA primary care physicians. My primary was one of them.\nIt has been 4 weeks and guess what, that number has surpassed 1000+ fired VA employees. Most of them are Veterans. Veterans taking care of other Veterans. And you’re here making a short video promising what? That our hard earned benefits aren’t going to be cut? Are you all there? Do you have any clue what’s going on in the government?\nThere is combat Veterans being deported because ICE doesn’t care about documentation. Trump just want numbers. And you sit here and right out lie that our benefits aren’t going to be touched? They are already touched. From fired primary care physicians to veterans working at VA hospitals. The VA has already been affected massively even if it was a huge ordeal to Veterans just dealing with VA to begin with.\nYou’re a schmuck and a bootlicker.\nWhy should I believe you….\nSo that it’s clear, Project 2025, which Donald Trump has followed to the letter thusfar, has plans in place to fully privatize the VA and strip us of our benefits. The method they’re using is identical to how they systematically destroyed the Postal Service last time they were in office. If you are reliant on your veteran’s benefits for your medical care, housing, income, or otherwise, you NEED to have an alternative in place for when they do to veterans what they’ve already done to farmers. I could frankly care less about what Mr. Collins says. Also, you need to be resetting your credentials in all of your VA-related websites; Vice President Musk’s kindergarten class had no business being anywhere near our personal data, and you should expect to have that information leaked or spilled, so have resets on standby.\nStep 1, Cut 1,000 employees from the VA. Where did I get that info, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nVA Secretary is a full blown MAGAT.\nThis message from the boss seems to be contradicted by the notice I got yesterday that our Radiology location was closed down. I am not calling Mr. Collins a liar but don’t like the smell of this.\nI have a SDVOSB that service my fellow veterans!\nSecretary Collins,\nIf the VA is expanding benefits for Veterans, why did the personnel working on the Burn Pit Registry get terminated from their jobs? Why are no hiring actions for new healthcare workers moving forward? I see lip service, but no substance behind your words. Actions speak.\nWill a rating that is based on “presumptive findings” be across the board? I have a condition that gave me a rating due to harmful/toxic chemical exposure, but that same exposure didn’t cover other conditions like it should have. Will these conditions be re-considered? I have an appointment with my local VSO on 2/28/25. Will they know of the improvements that you speak of Mr. Collins? Is there a direct line/email to contact you? That would be great!\nI do not appreciate the new VA Secretary blaming the media for his inability to control the narrative on his agency. The media’s role is to report what it’s told frkm credible sources and journalistic standards require two verifiable sources. I only listen to and read media that follows these journalistic standards. I and my father are both retired military officers with high disability ratings; he was 100% and I’m 70%. He and I both served to allow free expression and a robust media to openly report important issues that inform the American public. This demonizing of the media is dangerous and un-American. I deeply resent the VA Secretary, who is suppose to represent and care for military Veterans who have been disabled in the the service of American ideals, to actively tear down one of foundations of our Democracy. I have personally read about the recent disgraceful suggestions of lowering some disabled Vets ratings assuming that only those disabilities received directly as a result of combat are worth compensating. This ignorant and disrespectful idea was obviously made by someone who has probably never served as it shows a complete lack of understanding of what it means to serve and the sacrifices all military members, and their families, make. Considering how little respect the new Secretary has for the fundamentals of a free and open Democracy, regardless of how difficult it might make his job, makes me believe he would support these suggestions as he seems just another puppet of an administration who also has very little respect for military members and the job they do. I an very disappointed, but not entirely surprised, that a man with these credentials and opinions has been named VA Secretary. After listening to video, that was somehiw meant to reassure Vets, I convinced that he cannot be trusted.\nYou Are A Lying Simp — 1000 VA Workers Just Got Cut, from DOGE — Many of these workers are Veterans, but you choose to spit in all our faces.\nNow if we can just get medical care sooner then 3 months from making an appointment. I don’t know how anybody thinks the VA had gotten better cause it hasn’t\nUnfortunately, any complaint or comment that is attempting to elicit a response will more than likely fall on deaf ears:\n“The comments section is for opinions and feedback on this particular article; this is not a customer support channel. If you are looking for assistance, please visit Ask VA or call 1-800-698-2411. Please, never put personally identifiable information (SSAN, address, phone number, etc.) or protected health information into the form — it will be deleted for your protection.”\n[Editor: I’ve removed eight SSNs from comments just this morning alone.]\nThis is who you all voted for so shut up and deal with it! He told you all exactly what he was going to do but I guess because you’re white you thought you were exempt lol! We could’ve had Kamala!!!!\nI am the 92%!\nWhy are VA employees, including health care workers, being told they should find other employment? I have been getting great care at the VA, but am disturbed that DOGE/OMB/Trump/Musk sent every employee an e-mail telling them they should terminate their employment with the VA. Note, my niece is a VA pharmacist and got the e-mail encouraging her to leave. Healthcare workers are hard enough to recruit as it is, why encourage them to leave? Note, my general impression from my VA hospital is that the workers are paid less, but the work atmosphere is better: less pressure to bring in revenue.\nSo glad you’re in charge of the VA, the quality and customer service and response time has suffered over the last 4 years.\nMake this website more useable. This thing flies you all over the place except where you want to go!!!\nWith all due respect, Mr. Secretary, you are gravely mistaken about DOGE and their actions. I urge you not to mislead our nation’s veterans with false information. Take a closer look at the insidious activities DOGE and the mastermind behind it are orchestrating within the federal government. Our veterans deserve the truth, and something ominous is on the horizon for them.\nThe VA could save a lot of money by allowing veterans to opt out of appointment reminder notifications sent by mail. Personally rarely ever arrive prior to the appointment.\nDr. Hunter R Novak, AD2\nThank you Mr. Secretary. Those of us that use the system, know all too well the deficiencies that exist, and I suggest to you, please visit with veterans and hear us out. I also support the elimination of dei. It is rampant within the VA. Good luck to you sir, and visit Houston sometime soon.\nI don’t believe a word of it\nSecretary, you’ve been there a week and already the VA is doing better, processing claims faster. Do you think we’re stupid! You have a credibility issue! Are you firing staff, or is the unelected DOGE bypassing your authority? Operating so much better while DOGE does its work? Come on!\nRun the VA appropriately, leave your political bull out of it.\nI guess he thinks he can bull sh-t us. My disability rating claim is stuck at step 3 since August. But Doug can fire 1,000 hard working, tax paying VA employees and delivering faster than ever? Who does he think he’s kidding. This guy doesn’t have two functioning brain cells to rub together. He’s as clueless as the rest of this administration’s picks. If\nI’m lucky I’ll get to keep my current rating but I think these guys are going to try to screw us over. Remember his boss thinks soldiers are “Suckers” and “Losers”…\nNo, the “media” is not the problem. I’ll take good investigative journalism over the nonsense you just spewed any day. Your video message was so unprofessional it was like if you think your audience are a bunch of brainless knuckleheads who can’t think for themselves. We deserve much more respect than that. Try again.\nI claim has been on APPEAL FOR FIVE YEARS. I am still waiting, Can you please help me!!!!!\nTypical leadership-speak that happens before budgets are cut. The VA Secretary doesn’t control how much the VA receives, others do. Usually it’s Congress, but it seems to be DOGE now. In either case it’s 20-25 year old staffers, who lack meaningful experience, that do the detailed work. So, (all too many) cuts will be made in the wrong areas.\nBeing a “company man”, the VA Secretary ultimately will proclaim success, stating: waste was cut; money was saved; efficiencies were achieved; and service was improved. As evidenced by his video address, Secretary Collins knows this is how it will play out. But only the part about money being saved will be true. But don’t blame Doug Collins – he isn’t the one swinging the budget axe.\nMore bull sh-t from one of Trump’s inexperienced hired goons!\nI do not BELIEVE ANYTHING this administration says at all, musk and his vice president do nothing but lie and these spineless republicans do not even push back, when are they going to realize that they need to stand up to him ,he is not God or a god musk and his co-president are going to ruin this country we fought for our country that more than these 2 clowns can say!!!\nHow do I get a meeting with him. And can we get a X weekly town hall meeting\nSince we are accommodating everyone nowadays let’s award Desert Storm Veterans with a Purple Heart for combat. I mean the VA did acknowledge toxic exposures from this war by creating the PACT ACT. Let’s get the Purple Heart approved for those respiratory conditions caused by the Khamisiyah bunker explosion and release of sarin gases. Not to mention the chemical attacks by Saddam Hussein’s army or were those M8 alarms imaginary?\nWe need more wheel chairs at the VA hospital in Miami,that we can roll ourselves when we have several appointments the same day, because mobility transportation is too slow picking you up from your appointment and taking you to the next.\n2. All Veterans need full dental treatment. It’s a Shame, that because you are not 100% you can’t get it. You should help all Veterans regarding of your persentage.\nAre we supposed to believe this Trumper? The Trump administration is running on nothing but lies! Trumper said he would not touch Medicaid, now Congress is going to do cut it, and he approves it. Lies, Lies, Lies!\nHi,\nI recently requested a review of my 10% Disability, for. GI condition that has plagued me for over 50 years and I have been waiting for a determination. I was not aware that a reevaluation was even possible until recently, and it would be an enormous benefit to me, both mentally and financially as I am no longer able to work. Thank you for your time.\nHenry Thompson\nLets talk about what a scam the PACT Act is, I was denied despite having evidence and I know friends who are getting denied too.\nIraq 07 – waking up every morning to the smell of burning plastic and jet fuel.\nThey put you in charge because they know you have no courage or backbone – just another opportunist and yes man\nSecond attempt to post. I’m very suspicious of the video pronouncement. Anything coming from the current crop of “leaders” must be viewed with deep skepticism. There is clearly an attempt underway to further privatize VA Healthcare, and that is no surprise. The current administration is run by anti-human tyrants driven by one value: maximize wealth and concentrate power.\nI’ve only had excellent experiences with VA Health Care and the people are always extremely supportive and knowledgeable. When I ask VA Healthcare reps why VA healthcare is so much better than the (un)healthcare in the private sector, the answer is almost always the same: “At the VA, we care about people; in the private sector they care about making money.” Well, that obsession with making money, at the expense of the health of veterans is what they will try to bring more and more into VA Healthcare. Vets will be treated increasingly as disposable. Moves toward privatization started under Trump 1, and now under Trump 2, and the DOGE steamroller, they will roll over VA Health care. Vets better stand up soon to protect it, or it will be gone….\nThere is nothing efficient about this administration. Tired of hearing such MAGA nonsense. Give us a break, there is a rapist and wife abuser as the SECDEF who has nowhere near enough experience to run our military-he’s a Fox news host! That is beyond reprehensible-and that is who is leading our brothers and sisters still in service? What a slap in the face. That being said, I have no faith in any of you to take care of our veterans who are no longer serving, especially from a draft dodger Commander in Chief who was too cowardly to serve his country. Like everything the DOGE claims that is false and with zero proof, I doubt VA claims are being processed any quicker. You just fired 1,000 VA employees, most of them are veterans. Drop the lies….tired of an incompetent administration who cares nothing about the average American or Veteran.\namen brother!\nOh look, another status quo shill for our benevolent dictator.\nMr. Collins, I am a 74 year old Vietnam Marine Corps vet. I am 90 plus % with unemployability to 100% PT. I have a family of 5. They are all from the Philippines and are all legal with blue passports. I have a lot of friends who would love you to look at the matrix and our pay. My son from my first marriage is also as I am. 2003 to 2007 Marine and 100% by unemployability. He is 44 this year and cannot work.\nFor myself, I am under, I believe, poverty level. He is just above it. We will not be getting a raise with our President! Our raises aren’t even figured by what inflation truly is to US. Maybe you can figure out a way to at least increase the base pay for us.\nFor my son… He is moving to Thailand because social security says he can work!!!!! The government says he can’t. Maybe someone can fix the wording for Social Security or someone besides a DEI can look at his claim.\nSemper Fi\nSecretary Collins, thanks for posting this video. I hope Veterans will come to this site for VA news rather than be alarmed by the Lamestream Media. And thanks for serving our country, and Veterans well.\nDOGE, is not doing anything but wasting tax payers money. Stop falling for these lies. VA Secretary is not fighting for us he is going alone with them. They just laid off 1000 VA employees when the VA need more staff. This is BS.\nMany thanks for the quick clarification on our benefits. Hate to see guys and gals getting upset because of what has been said or inferred. We all know Trump’s way of thinking and he would not touch the benefits unless they were being taken advantaged or stolen.\nThis did not instill the trust and confidence I was hoping for from you, Mr. Secretary. You simply sounded like a Trump talking head pointing fingers and defending non-government employees. You have made it clear that if at any point the current administration says to drop veterans benefits you will bow the knee and roll over to their every whim. Very disappointing. You are absolutely not committed to us, the veterans. Grow a pair and stand for the veterans you serve, and not some childish billionaires.\nMy experience is first-hand and arises from my following up on the very unusual non-receipt of a reply to a message which I recently sent to one of my VA providers via the myhealth.va.gov messaging platform. I phoned and reached the doc’s RN, who apologized and explained that the doctor, who is additionally burdened as the department chair, was under intense stress and an unexpected extra workload because the arranged hiring of another physician for the department had been frozen. That turned the intended staffing plan, which had been inclusive of the new hire physician, on its ear and required major on-the-fly personnel assignment adjustments. Then a large group of nurses who had been working from home via their computers, since their jobs were done by phone and emailing with patients, were ordered to return to the hospital for no apparent reason, where there is no space for them! These kinds of created problems have no corollary benefits and are the opposite of improving patient care!\nWell done information, I was a recent inpatient for 8 days at the MKE VA, I found it interesting that 2 CNA staff talked while I was watching Fox news that the VA was going to have cuts ? Actually I knew better being a Retired Army member and not a Democrat voter !\nI didn’t watch the video, you lost me with your cowardly support of DOGE and its illegal activities. I don’t believe you for a second. Who doubts that your fearless leaders, cowards, liars and thieves all do not intend to cripple the VA and “drown it in a bathtub” with the rest of the Federal Government? I am offended that you think we are so blind and stupid as to believe these criminals are not going to hack away at the VA. Astonishing.\nAppreciate the information\nr/Al\nUSA/MSG(ret)\nlo que sea, donde sea, cuando sea\nWhat will people think once they find out how untruthful the current administration is with respect to what they’re actually doing; which is to undermine confidence in all government functions so the argument can then be made that privatization is the remedy to all of the made up problems that we’re currently hearing about. If that were to happen, how long do any of you reading this think it will take for those privatized and previously government functions to be raided, pillaged, and desecrated leaving all of us with nothing to show for our years of service and commitment? Better wake up.\nYeah, sure Jan. Benefits back to the veterans. Not likely, back to the wealthiest 1% and corporations. Shame on Musk and his adolescent henchmen as well as 47 for the illegal dismissal of the dedicated employees of the VA who were also likely veterans. I stand with you.\nPresident Trump made a great pick for Secretary for the VA in Doug Collins! I am very confident that Secretary Collins will fight for every Veteran in this great country of ours and Make The VA Great Again!!!!\nWhat I’m getting from between the lines is we’re gonna hear a lot more “that’s not service related” and more claim denials. Words are trash, we need to see results. We got enough lip service while serving. Show us actions and results or sit down and save the oxygen thieving.\nneither trump nor musk had the balls or the dedication to serve. if they mess with veterans that will start a very deadly civil war with men and women who are very good at combat. you do not want to f*** with these many millions of veterans most of whom believe in the 1st and 2nd amendments as highly important in protecting freedom. we the people will take our country back from felon trump–the worst embarrassment in our nation’s entire history.\nDoug, knock off the political bullsh-t; you are not a member of Congress anymore. I don’t expect to hear a partisan line of attack against the media. I will hold you accountable for ensuring there are no drastic cuts to the VA, aside from actual fraud and abuse. Not the cascade of misinformation coming from Doge. Do your f**g job and manage the VA to improve the range and quality of veteran services. I get sick to my stomach reading about the plights of some verterans in these comment.\nDoug Collins is a very honorable man. I feel very confident in his ability, integrity and work ethic. We all know you are dedicated and will give your best effort.\nMr. Collins,\nI have been fighting the VA disability benefits for 14 years. They do not recognize the Leukemia that I have and say it does not meet the qualifications that someone has set for Agent Orange. I have appealed the decision made by clerks not a doctor of oncology. I am on the Agent Orange registry two times but can’t get the full 100% disability check.I had to retire early from the Dallas Police department because of the Leukemia. It would be nice to have a doctor of oncology look at my records to make a professional opinion. I also have submitted a case of record that went to court and the Veteran was awarded the pension. We both have the same kind of Leukemia and he was given the benefit of having a compelling case.\nI’m a disabled veteran as the government knew the water that we were drinking,bathing and food that was contaminated with chemicals that the government knew. That water killed many and made veterans and families sick.. I for one spent 2 years at Camp Lejeune and have HEART issues and CANCER..I rely on my Veterans disability and medical insurance..I hope and pray the new administration that I voted in does not do anything stupid to our very loyal and dedicated veterans.. This seems like this administration cares about no one but themselves!!!\nPresident puts a freeze on federal hiring which includes the VA. – Then president removes the freeze on VA medical hires. +\nThen Musk fires all probationary hires-\nExplain to me Mr Secretary, how is firing all the new hires you just gave the green light to, plus all the probationary ( hires with less than a year already on the job) is improving veteran’s healthcare\nMy claim was received 2years and 6 months ago with no word or activity on my claim..I can’t believe that there are only 4 judges for over 400,000 claims..\nI Am over 75 years old..\nThe truth will surface about a year from now one way or the other. I live in Idaho and have to say the VA is much more responsive and efficient than the private sector health care. Please don’t mess with that.\nI find it hard to believe after over 50 years of the Vietnam War ended the Veterans are not being compensated financially for their services I attended a combat veterans counseling session I am Desert Storm/Shield combat veterans there were Vietnam Veterans attending also the reasons that I heard for these Veterans not being compusated properly is appalling you have to prove the chemical Agent Orange was sprayed in the area you served in that is unbelievable the military assigned you to fight in Vietnam and now over 50 years later I have to proved where I was in the jungle of a foreign country we need some Vietnam Veterans combat veterans working in the department for compensation to help assist in taking care of all Veterans all the opiates and the other mind altering drugs they are prescribing is not enough to help care for disabled veterans mental or physical disabilities we need help taking care of our own people here at home the good ole USA.\n2 of my va dr called me a lair.

I have no one to help.me.\nPlus after 3 wifes 2 passed away Please help me President Trump our Commander in Chief\nThe minute king Donald say cut the VA cost and befits this guy will drop to his knees and say yes sir.\nCongratulations Mr. Secretary!\nThank you for your service.\nMay God watch over you in your new role with the VA.\nStrength and Honor!\nThank you sincerely,\nSRA Alan R.

I bet destroying the lives of 1000 probationary employees was right up there with “improving veteran care.” Less care givers = more care giving. Got it.

It’s beyond unconstitutional we can do better\nATTN: US Troops in Kosovo on KFOR missions since 1999, much under OEF funding. The entire place burns everything 24/7 (there is no modern trash/sanitation system) and US troops serve on NATO FOBs downwind from KEK (Soviet Era dirty coal-fired Power Plant) – it looks and smells like Blade Runner 2049. I have the pics, DD-214 and lung nodules to prove it. YET, Kosovo is NOT on the PACT Act for Environmental Exposure List. Whisky Tango Foxtrot – VA? PS- I’m also one of the rare Vets who earned BOTH the MGIB and Ch33 Post 9/11. I got the letter saying “Congrats….you earned both, please wait for our next letter in ~ 22 month”. I’d like to re-start Edu ASAP …..please.\nThis video is nonsense! VA cannot possibly care for Veterans faster ,when you have allowed DOGE to cut the workforce so drastically, and so willy-nilly, with ZERO thought to the impact of those thoughtless cuts. Long term, expertly trained employees, many of them Veterans themselves, have been fired for alleged poor performance. RUBBISH!\nDoge never took the time to look at performance. They never took the time to look at responsibilities. They never took the time to look at the fact that VA employees are truly dedicated to Veterans, who have unique issues and concerns that require skilled and knowledgeable employees to address efficiently.\nDOGE representatives at VA cannot possibly be reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans, because DOGE is not qualified to do so. The folks who ARE qualified to do that for Veterans have been terminated, lied to, denigrated, and insulted. Doge is grabbing as much data as they can get their hands on, and nobody really knows what data they are grabbing, or what they will do with it now. And, that includes you!\nYour comment that you look forward to partnering with DOGE would indicate that you have been asked to do so. You haven’t!\nServices are not going to be better or faster with less employees present to doing what they know how to do best, while an unelected, un-vetted DOGE is determined to cut as much as they can, from wherever they can. DOGE makes these cuts, not to help taxpayers, but to funnel money into Elon Musk’s companies, assuring that taxpayer’s needs are not being addressed at all,. Nor are the needs of Veterans.\nIt comes down to this…you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. You also swore to support and defend our Nation’s Veterans. You can now either live up to your oaths, or fail entirely! Pick a spot!\nIf choosing the latter, you would not be alone. The vast majority of elected or appointed Republicans will be hanging their photos on the wall of shame, right next to yours, as Doge continues to be permitted to continue this chaos with no oversight, as our Veterans are abandoned, and Democracy is altered entirely.\nWhat you likely should not continue to do is to address us all with assurances that everything is A-Okay. You are honestly not in a position to provide those assurances. Nobody is.\nIn what state at they clearing cases, I have a case in DC, and file supplemental appeal that they broke into three case. There is no justice, nor when they claim an error in the case but the case remains or no change in decision dispite call center giving said information that there was an error. But I’m also sure no one cares or will fallow for more information.\nI’ve read that there will be a “means test” in 2026 using 2025 tax info. Any clarification on this would be great.\nI agree with Mike from 18 February 2025.\nLMAO like anyone is going to listen much less respond.\nThis is a propaganda piece/video. Anything coming from this Administration must be viewed with great suspicion. There is a goal of increasingly privatizing VA Health Care (already underway and pushed under the previous Trump Admin). I’ve had, up to now, only very positive experiences with the VA Healthcare and when I ask people at the VA healthcare facility why VA Healthcare is so much better than in the private sector the standard answer is: “We are here to help people; in private health care they are out to make money.” Those moneymakers are looking to loot VA Healthcare too. We must stand up and stop the privatization of VA Healthcare. The people in charge have anti-human values. They only value increases in their wealth and their power, and we veterans will suffer.\nHello Doug, my name is Sanders Cupac and I am a 72 year old Vietnam era veteran living in Thailand. I live off of my 994$ monthly social security payment and it was stopped in February for no reason. PLEASE help me. I LOVE TRUMP and the new transparency and stopping WASTE.\nPLEASE HELP ME, I am really hurting here.\nSecretary Collins, Make sure you direct them to PR. As a USVI resident and an old contractor for the Army, I see where efficiency can be easily had by using more LOCAL USVI Community Care providers (we have three Islands) and DME services. The Acting Director has stated he is addressing the discrimination he see between the PR VA and USVI Veterans and vendors. ex. The PR VA will fly a contractor to USVI to install a wheelchair tire or deliver a bedside hospital table.\nOr, they will fly the Veterans to PR to have a tooth cleaning instead of using the local Dentist that has been registered w/ OPTUM and every other similar contractor we’ve had in the past. I literally, had to fight tooth and nail to get VA community care employee to use a local dentist, pt or mental health provider for the Veteran I’m a Caregiver for instead of flying her back and forth to PR.\nYes, in the USVI we are lacking in Medical options, but the options we have are top notch, and maybe the VA should look at & take into consideration our high cost of living and give USVI community care providers an additional percentage over medicare allowance (out of the cost saving from airfare) to entice more local community care providers.\nOh hell since I’m asking for the moon, just build the USVI our own small VA hospital similar to the one we had in Alaska in the early 2000’s (just put it on St. Croix). Let me know when you’re going to do a site visit.\ndon peters II\nUSVI Veteran\n“Always out Front”\nI am an AF Vet. I utilize va community health care because I live far from any va health facility. Collins talks a good game. He’s allowing that idiot in the white house – I should BOTH idiots – Trump and Musk to get rid of va personnel that are needed to make sure va services are carried out correctly. I have to reapply yearly for my community care and EVERY year I have to jump through hoops to get it done. God help you if you don’t – I would have to pay the bills. This year is no exception. My end date is Feb 25 – I applied again in January and I still do not have confirmation on my renewal. This is just one example. These are not medical personnel but people that manage the ‘behind the healthcare’ paperwork and various other things that make the va work. BUT TRUMP HAS FIRED VETS – EVEN DISABLED VETS – FROM THE VA. You tell me how THAT helps veterans. What a load of horse hockey. You think the voters are buying this? Think again. D. Taylor\nMr Secretary: I forgot to mention the most important points.\nAs you know there is talk among members of Congress (your party) to change the requirements for\nservice-connected disability especially when it comes to PTSD. What is your personal position on\nthese proposed changes and your position as Secretary of the Veteran’s Administration?? Do you agree\nwith the congressmen’s comments that too many veterans are filing false claims and receiving benefits??\nMy position is that when ‘too many people’ are getting a benefit from the government in a particular program\nyou raise the requirements. Got an opinion??\nI am so happy Trump won. I am overjoyed that every DEI programs was cut. I hope DOGE takes a wrecking ball to every wasteful program that is ripping off the tax payer.\nThank you for the reassuring platitudes. Now, am I supposed to believe them? I suppose we’ll have to see but VAs history looks bleak. We, the veterans, have no real say and certainly no control over the services we are provided nor the quality of those services. As a medical professional, I can report they range from excellent – thanks to a dedicated, professional staff – to non-existent – thanks to a lack of funds that would make Mr. Musk proud.\nI have to say, in all honesty, that I do not trust you sir. I hope I’m mistaken. But, as the saying goes, “Money talks, BS walks.”\nAs an aside: The folks suffering the effects of the poisonous environment at Camp Lejeune will, I’m sure, receive the same timely assistance that those receiving assistance for Agent Orange poisoning: After they’re dead.\nWe’ve all been used and discarded.\nDear Secretary Collins, here in Rhode Island, we have concerns of cutbacks. Alost of rumors, to include a 91 year old Korean War Disabled Veteran being told he no longer will be assigned a primary provider, which has been responsible to prescribe his medications. As a veteran contributor for RINEWSTODAY.com I sent an email to Director Lawrence Connell, Providence VA Medical to address Rhode Island veterans concerns who have contacted me on benefit cuts due to termination of employees. More than 48 hours, and a response which only included attaching a VA press release, no response to how many employees terminated at providence VA Medical Center.\nIn addition, I also sent an inquiries to Senator Jack Reed (d) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (d), only to receive a response without answering the simple questions sent to Director Connell.\nIm asking for answers to the following:\nHow many VA Providence Medical Center employee were terminated and their positions( I review your list of exemptions, I see NO medical or benefits that would be impacted.\nHere is the mail sent to Connell, Reed, and Whitehouse ( only to be stonewalled on answers:\nGood Day Director,\nI hope all is well.\nFew question, about an article I am working on for publishing on Thursday for RINEWSTODAY\nQ1 Did any employees working at or for VA Providence Medical receive termination letters as part of recent 17,000 employees terminated?\nQ2 If yes, were you able to receive waivers for those employees; as you may be aware, VA Secretary Doug Collins statements waivers are allowed, and not one of the firings impact Veteran medical or benefits, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nQ3 Last week, according to a wife of a veteran at a private long tern care facility ( which the veteran is paying for), says last week she was told her 92 year husband primary care provider is no longer employed. She request a new one, to include an appointment. She was DENIED, VA advised he no longer was eligible for primary provider since the facility he is in has one. He still will be eligible to receive audio, prescriptions, etc…But will not be assigned a primary.\nWhat is the policy for a combat disable veteran living in a RI long term care facility—-are they still eligible for a VA provider, since they remain registered in VA Health care?\nHoping to have information no later than 5:00PM on Wednesday, for an article to be published as a feature in my weekly veteran column on RINEWSTODAY, which is published every Thursday.\nJohn A Cianci\nRINEWSTODAY\nVeteran contributor\nHow stupid do you think we are? 1,000 crisis hotline workers just got let go. This is all BS lip service. You’re a straight up liar.\nI am a Gulf War veteran and lost my hearing and I am considered clinically deaf but the VA pension program has determined that I am only 10 percent disabled. I receive a paltry $351 a month pension. I fear that The orange man and his sidekick, who have no problem lying to the public, would gladly take that from me at a moments notice. Anybody who associates themselves with those two men are liars by default. You can’t support someone who tells lies more than the truth, and not become complicit in those lies.\nIt is sad when “clergy” lie! Stop being partisan! Our media is doing what they are supposed to do. Report on the news. The REPUBLICAN controlled congress is saying that VA Benefits are on the chopping block! When you have to come back and “eat crow” by telling us that you were “wrong,” but probably not in another video, because you will not have the courage to do so, WHAT THEN?!? Trump said that he would not mess with medicare… oh wait, medicare cuts are being “doged” out too. Oh wait, wasn’t it said by some Republican Senators that no VA worker would lose their job? Yeah, tell that to the 1000 workers who were fired last week. Our social security is “safe” too, right?!!! Just stop lying! We veterans deserve more than “clergy” lying!!! All Veterans deserve a non-partisan VA Secretary looking out for all of our needs!!! #STOPTHELIES\nAnother liar from the Party of Trump. VA Health is already understaffed, and now, many staffers have been fired to satisfy Trump and Musk’s lust for chaos, injustice, cruelty, and to cut spending so that they can lower the corporate tax rate to 15% for themselves and other billionaires. Does that seem compatible with the lies Collins just spouted? Refer back to this video after they drop veterans in lower priority groups from VA healthcare, in line with Project 2025, you know, the plan that Trump denied any knowledge of. Russ Voight, who is helping to oversee the destruction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was the major architect of Project 2025 at the Heritage Foundation.\nThanks… And I’d like you to know that my local VA center here provides excellent care. I’m aware of Vought’s and Project 2025’s recommendations and I’m thankful for veteran’s organizations supporting the continuation of the services and benefits we currently have. I am still concerned at any attempts to split or divide veterans into new claimants versus old claimants or veterans receiving social security versus those not receiving social security. We all took oaths to serve our country knowing that we had no control over when or where we might be in harms way. We all deserve the same levels of care.\nPretty good video\nWe don’t believe you DOUG!\nI just went to the VA yesterday in Des Moines. They need staffing help and equipment. Please establish a hotline for us to call or chat with to keep things improving at our clinics. I have been miss diagnosed twice because of these things.\nIt would have been nice to be able to watch the video. Youtube won’t let me today unless I sign in so they can track me. I refuse to let them. So, anything you post using youtube will not reach people like me for a while at least. Youtube decides I need to sign in during time frames of their choosing for random lengths of time.\nSenator Collins, we have a huge problem with the VA in the Myrtle Beach area, myself and another veteran would love to sit down and discuss the issues with you\nsay what you want to say. ‘giving and improving services’ in your world means privatization.\nYour job is to continue this privatization program. Look at your background and your prior\nwork experience.\nThere are presently 40k unfilled positions at VA facilities. This is the hammer to use to\nsend to private doctors. Private doctors who have limited or no experience with veterans\nor veteran’s issues.\nDon’t play vets as fools, don’t bs us, tell us what you are really going to do.\nIt is disgraceful that they align yourself with DOGE and Project 2025 (which this administration is definitely following). DOGE has gained illegitimate access to everyone’s personal, professional, and financial data and we’re just supposed to accept that Elon Musk is going to police himself on conflicts of interest. Yeah right. What I would give to be a security personnel armed to the teeth at one of these locations. Musk and his fratboys would never make it to a single computer without going through an insanely extensive background check. I have veteran friends who have been waiting 2+ years on a background check and Musk just gets a green flag immediately? I call bull!.\nAs for the VA. I don’t have an issue with the healthcare I receive. Last year they extracted a tumor, and the wait time was almost nonexistent. Just had to do a number of tests beforehand that took some time. I tell my friends and family about the good care I receive, at what would essentially be socialized healthcare. Super scary, isn’t it? That healthcare would be funded by taxpayer dollars. That’s why republicans for many many years have tried to privatize the VA, which would turn it into a for-profit organization. You should be blocking every attempt to interfere with the VA unless it has to do with expanding resources or increasing funding. My local VA hospital is severely understaffed, and I live in a larger city. I can’t imagine how it must be to live in the countryside.\nMake no mistake, republicans are eager to defund the VA and turn it into profit for big pharma. Nothing scares them more than a citizen that has power over their own lives, and they want to take that power for themselves. Resist with all your might if you want the support of veterans!!\nDon’t look like a lot of NAM VETS here. Must be that we’re mostly gone and ones left are giving up.\nThat’s good to know I hope it’s true. Who is a supervisor to reach for Voc rehab. My husband school was not paid so now he’s not in school. Know one is answering emails. A phone number would be nice for Maryland\nlet us keep using ds login to access va.gov no need to make another login for va way to much work and 1 more thing to worry about as i go through during my cancer treatment\nPlease explain how loss of a thousand staffers will improve VA operations. Thanks.\nSir,you should do an investigation at the Austin VA clinic in texas.ive been going there for 32 years and it has gone to sh-t.they have mostly foreign doctors that are there for a check and don’t give a damn about your health.if I had the money I would go to a civilian doctor. thanks for your time.\nAny veteran who has ever had to deal with your entire inadequate and antiquated system for health, benefits, etc. will tell you just how BROKEN the VA has been for a very long time.\nNo intelligent veteran is going to believe the lip service you’re giving out. We’ve been buried in so much bureaucracy and red tape for so long that unless you actually back up your claims of positive change with some real action and results, you are just another politician who cares nothing about the brave men and women who have served this country.\nWe are human beings first and foremost, so start treating us as such. Look at the systems that you have in place and figure out how to run more efficiently. Ask yourself if the months and years it takes to process benefits, administrative changes, health requests, etc. would be acceptable to one of your loved ones. Would this be acceptable to you if you had no other options for healthcare? Would you take your wife or children to a VA facility? I won’t even take myself to VA healthcare, so I already know what your answer is.\nThe VA is like a sad, sad joke to veterans. It a shame that anyone who has served their country should be treated the way they are. You should be ashamed of what you’ve walked into and if you don’t do anything to clean up the mess, none of us will have any respect for you. We know when we’re being BS’d.\nAll you idiots in the comments want to blame this on Trump or Elon. You know damn well that the VA has been broken much much longer than that. So, Secretary Collins—in the event that you ever look at these comments, how about you earn your paycheck and show us Veterans some real results. Faster claims, faster appointments, update your systems… HELL, overhaul the whole damn system because it’s BROKEN. You wouldn’t run a normal business like this because it would have gone under a long time ago. FIX THIS BROKEN SYSTEM.\nSomeone mentioned contacting our congressmen. I highly suggest that we all do. It’s time for real change.\nRatings examiners are leaning on Contract C & P Examiners to give negative exams that will disqualify Veterans from establishing nexus for their conditions. C & P Examiners are conforming to the VBA’s desire to deny claims, which is trying to find fault and deny veterans’ claims. The Pact Act is not benefiting Vietnam Veterans.\nMy wife was in Balad Iraq and exposed to burn pits. She was denied on her initial claim so she asked for a higher review. The higher review said the VA made a mistake but it’s been over a year with no progress. It is not true that the VA is clearing claims quicker. She is incapacitated 15 days a month from migraine headaches a presumptive condition from burn pits. She was labeled as having tension headaches in the initial claim.\nThe voters elected draft dodging felon to be POTUS. The day after the election I asked my coworkers, “Do we have a new Commander in Chief or a new Dictator in Chief?” Not 1 person answered but the look in their eyes… PRICELESS! I cannot believe anything anyone says that works for this dude. Mr. Collins, please prove me wrong BUT, I have already had 2 appointments with my VA PMC cancelled. The first was scheduled for Feb 2025 and the follow in March 2025. I have not heard when they will be rescheduled. Do U have that problem?\nThank you for your comments and for clearing up the “RUMORS”! HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS OUR SECRETARY, thank you for serving.\nYou sir are a liar.\nIf there is anyone in government that I feel I can trust implicitly it’s Doug Collins… I believe he will put all of his efforts into improving services and working to ensure that Veterans get everything they have earned…As a 100% disabled Marine Vietnam Vet I am at the age where a lot of things need attention and being in the Central FL area I have had the best care anyone could want and I’m confident that the future will only get better…\nI believe President Trump and Sec Doug Collin’s. President Trump has always been put veterans first unlike Biden and Obama. And Sec Collin’s was\na straight shooter as a congressman. He is a good man.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!\nAll talk…How can he say they are clearing cases faster than ever in just a week. Another Trump Simpleton.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!!\nAnd thank you for all the VA does!!!\nYour mouth is moving so you’re obviously lying. No one in the administration should be trusted al all. In fact, expect the opposite from what’s said.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nI don’t have a comment, but I do have a question. Will Veterans have to choose which monthly check they want to keep receiving and their other compensation we receive be cut out completely?\nIf that is true, then you as sos and others are NOT doing what is best for Veterans. Firing employees at the Veterans Crisis Line is just plain evil, too. If you are not a Veteran then y’all don’t know and definitely don’t care what is important and needed for Veterans.\nThere cuttin . Just denied your claim\n“Doing what DOGE is supposed to be doing.” What exactly is that? Nobody in the Administration has publicly laid out who they are (personnel), what they are doing, who is in charge, and whether they are actually employees of the U.S. government.\nYou say that the VA is doing things quicker and better now than it was doing only 3 weeks ago. Pretty hard to believe that.\nFinally you close with an offer to “come to see me.” And just how is that supposed to work?\nWhat has been addressed by my Representatives in Congress is that VA Joint Compensation needs to be “looked at as a way to cut back on unnecessary spending.” This is not media fluff but from my Congressman.\n“Doug” are you going to fight for VA Joint Compensation or immediately do what you are told by the higher ups?\nYes you can contact me with follow-up comments.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nI am a 100% Disabled, United States Marine Corps, Desert Storm Veteran.\nYou speak so lovingly about DOGE, but who are DOGE, and what authority do they have to look at government (including VA) contracts?\nDOGE is not an official Department of the US government, as creation of Departments in the Federal Government can only be created by Congress, by law, according to the Constitution.\nDOGE is not a government contracted corporation, so how is it that they have Legal approval to enter government facilities, look at government contracts, look at private American Citizens information, stop actual government contracts and fire government employees? How is it that they can do all of this and more without Security Clearance or any other type of government background checks, or government contracts bidding?\nWhat gives you the right to forego the security requirements put in place to protect Veterans, and to just allow them to run through Veteran Administration data?\nYou say that DOGE is looking through VA contracts to find inefficiencies and that the VA is not getting it’s budget cut. First, isn’t that your job? Second, if that is true, then why are VA employees being fired?\nI request timely and truthful answers to these questions.\nI intend to gather fellow Veterans and sue you, DOGE, and the government and other heads of Departments of the Federal government, to get everything that DOGE is breaking, fixed, and to hold department heads accountable for allowing this to happen. I also intend to sue to have DOGE and it’s members, and it’s supposed leader, Elon Musk, brought up on criminal charges for likely violating a variety of laws involving:\n1) entering secured government facilities without the requisite approvals and security checks.\n2) illegally withholding funds provided by Congress.\n3) illegally accessing the private information of American Citizens, including those of Veterans.\n4) many other violations.\nThe American People, especially Veterans and Seniors, are Angry Mr. Secretary.\nInspite of your empty words, I know personally that cuts have already begun, and in all likelihood will continue to expand. Numerous employees and new hires at the Dept of VA have been removed or furloughed, including many veterans, as the government is one of the higgest employeers of vets.\nSupporting this regime causing needless unfounded destruction to our country based on lies and unsubstantiated claims needa to stop before we truly dont have a country anymore.\nAs a 100 percent service connected veteran. I’m concerned with the difficulties of seeing Dr’s in a timely manner. In Tennessee all i get are excuses. I can’t seem to get my medicine as I did in Alaska. I wish someone would contact myself so I can get honest positive results. I want to live. I did my part.\nSimple question: will he stand up and fight Trump and Musk if they try to cut Veterans benefits or be just another sycophant?\nHahahaha!!! No. No one believes you and it’s not as funny as my haha’s might suggest.\nYou’re a liar! Loyal only to your dear leader the president elon, I mean donny t.\nYou are and will continue to sell us out along with the rest of the United States.\nJust tell us the truth. I mean, why stop lying now? You have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.\nI’m sure you know and understand that our level of trust and confidence in our federal government is at an all-time low. I can only hope that your words in this message are true and that myself and other vets who have fought to preserve the Constitutional values of our country will not lose the benefits we have through the VA.\nWell one thing that needs improvement is benefits admin. They don’t seem to take the word of VA doctors regarding disabilities and instead contract out to outsiders who, no matter what VA doctors say, decide the disabilities don’t exist.\nThis would reduce outside contractors cost and better serve the veterans.\nMr. Collins, we are all for you and wish you a happy and productive tour.\nThis was a message from VA Secretary Collin’s to veterans addressing rumors about benefits cuts.\nHe succinctly stated there will be no cuts.\nYet some (obviously liberal) vets questioned his statement and went off on unrelated rants.\nIt embarrassing to witness such a lack of decorum from alleged vets who allegedly live this country.\nThank you DOGE for uncovering massive fraud—some likely at the VA—and thank you Secretary Collin’s for dispelling the rumors.\nHow about making the VA follow the law and allow us community care if we can’t get an appointment. Right now they are spitting in our face basically and not allowing it with like flat out NO if you request it. @!%^#@$#%\nYou’re cutting veterans out of the workforce? How does that help??????? Most vets are on a fixed income. I am glad II still have a job and extra insurance at age 64. This is a bunch of bull for our veterans!\nThis is all well and good. However, I will believe it when I see things change. I got out of the Air Force in November 1976 believing the VA was my Advocate. Being a Vietnam Era Veteran I know that is not the case. I am still fighting them. I fell and landed on my KNEES, they have called me a liar since the beginning because the doctor stated he was treating my right knee. I have had many surgeries since I got out. Almost all have been due to falls because of that Knee buckling. I have been honest and truthful the whole way. I cannot say that for the VA. I am at it again and see that I am at step 3 or 8. I figure that are going to delay until I am dead. They want us Vietnam ERA Vets to die and go away, and yet all we did was serve our Country while our Country spit in our faces. I will not be giving up until I am dead. Sadly The VA doesn’t really care. Mr Collins, let us see what you are doing, my Congressman never responded when I wrote him years ago.\nWe see what’s happening. Tread lightly.\nDoug, you sound like a used car salesman.\nI am a Veteran and a VA employee, and I am not buying what you seem to be trying to sell.\nWhen you start out your tenure by acting as if we at VA haven’t actually been working full speed ahead in order to serve Veterans, their survivors, and their caregivers, it shows that you do not understand how seriously we take our mission in performing the most noble job in the United States government.\nGet to know us. Get to know what we have been doing. Listen to us when we tell you what is or is not working, and what can work better. We know because we are the subject matter experts in what we do. We swore an oath because that is how much this job means to us. DOGE knows nothing about anything, and has loyalty to nobody, much less the American people.\nWe see you, Doug. I hope you’ll make the effort to see us, too.\nI have about 10+ remains in my file that’s been sitting there for years, I should be 100% but I’m not I’ve done everything in my power to get to 100% but for some reason or another and I don’t have an answer for this maybe you can answer my question why am I not not , at 100 percent::: Cancer survivor::: type two diabetes::: chronic kidney disease::: hypertension::: neuropathy::: exposure to ionizing radiation::: age range:::: And yet my file just sets there toxic water, Marine Corps base, Camp, Lejeune, kidney cancer::: kidney stones:::\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nMr. Secretary, Are you going to expand the act act to in clyde all exposures of toxic substances to include all of the the USA? Also anywhere in the European and Asia theater?\nMy claim was filed in 2020 and I am still waiting. All my evidence was submitted, I have already spoken with a judge and they are now just sitting on it and waiting. Years of waiting is not efficient and yet they are all still getting paid more than the average American to not help us vets. Do not even get me started on the horror show is supposed care at my local VA hospital. Those people would rather vets die than actually treat anyone.\nOn the campaign trail it was said that Project 25 was not in the plans for the government. And now we are seeing it coming into fruition.\nAnd the plans youre trying to ease our concerns about are in the CBO’s report.\nFrankly, I cannot trust that you will not push forward the agenda by the President’s Assistant to gut our government. You are lieing to us.\nUnfortunately this hold no weight. DOGE and President Trump have already fired hundreds in the VA including doctors and nurses. Appointments are getting canceled, services are not improving and can’t when you’re cutting staff. Trump said he wasn’t going to mess with Medicaid too, but now he’s all for gutting it as part of the latest bill put forth by the House. Project 2025 calls for privatization of services and reduction of disability and education benefits for veterans and that is the blueprint this administration is following.\nHow can I send you an email or contact you directly? My son who is an Army vet, is getting good service, but the VA Hospital in WPB, FL, 2 miles from the Presidents home in Mar a Lago is terrible. They treat staff like dirt and good doctors and staff leave. My son is suffering from PTSD and has been fighting the VA for 100% disability.\nYou don’t actually believe that load of horse manure do you? You can’t guarantee that VA services or benefits won’t be cut. Remember he hates the military and we are all suckers and losers. First time in my life that I’ve been embarrassed to be a disabled veteran.\nI am so happy that Doug Collins is the new VA Secretary. I am also so thankful that President Trump won the election. And most of all I am hoping that DOGE takes a wrecking ball to all the wasteful programs at the VA that take away from the mission to help Veterans. I think the DEI programs at VA were destructive and un American. I suspect that there are many more programs that are unnecessary. I also find it incredibly difficult to trust any therapist in a group setting or one on one that supports the delusion of a Veteran that thinks they are transgender. I think it is a crime to support the decision of a Veteran to “change” their gender. It was very hard for me to sit in a therapy session and be told to believe that a man is really a woman. How did that happen at the VA? I hope it ends.\nCan you address the gaining movement that President Trump is aware of to afford disabled veterans of a certain or higher disability percentage an exemption to federal income tax?\nI need immediate help with my va home loan. I’m being railroaded by the mortgage company even though I was under fema protection. I have called my senator and congressman in FL. I received letter stating they can only ask VA they can not influence even though we have been wronged. Please I tried to find your email address after you were confirmed but it just had your name no picture yet. Please help us. 22 years 3 wars 70 years old. Disabled veteran who filed for disability in 2019 and still waiting on it to get.off the administration desk. I’m totally deaf . My hearing loss was from working on aircraft and high frequency radiation same reason I could never have children but that’s only worth 10%.\nThank You Secretary Collins, Great to hear the truth as I truly believe with President Trump in Charge we will get that .Plus giving the VA What they need. Good luck GOD BLESS You and Yours ???Rev.Joe\nDear Sir, as a disabled combat veteran and a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America I do not believe you or the current administration when you say write this drivel. The Trump administration has made it clear that the VA will be targeted for reductions, and having many appointments every month for my disabilities I have heard from people within the VA of what is going on, that good people are being let go, and that more is to come. We had a saying in Army Special Operations, “don’t piss down my back and tell me it’s raining”. We know better, deserve better, and don’t believe words, only actions. We’ll see, I’ll check back in next year and we can really see what is going to happen.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECK A RASE IN OUR RETIRED PAYMENTS IT HAS BEEN SEVERL YEARS SINCE THEMILATERY HAS RECEIVE A PAY RASEL, EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP EXCEPT OUR PAY,\n.

In the late 1980s, Collins served two years in the US Navy as a chaplain. After the September 11 attacks, Collins joined the USAF Reserve Command, where he presently serves as a chaplain (Colonel). As a member of the 94th Airlift Wing at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, he was deployed to Balad Air Base for five months in 2008 during the Iraq War. He is a member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the U.S. representative for Georgia’s 9th congressional district from 2013 to 2021 and in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He lost his bid for the senate. He finished third.\nHe is a “shoe clerk”, FOBBIT & RE-F.\nTrump & Musk didn’t serve. And I can’t believe any vet supported or supports them.\nHello Mr. Collins,\nWell, you said come see you if I have issues. So here I am. I have a few and no I’m not going to Ask VA on your website. I’ve been there and done that. It’s no help because it limits you to issues it’s willing to help with. Never the issues we Vets really want help with. I won’t get into them here, but if you’re serious about helping. I’d like to mail you a letter or send you an email detailing them.\nThank you,\nDan\nSounds like you’re trying to keep YOUR job! Are you willing to bet nothing is going to be cut at the VA? Please contact me on how much you are willing to wager.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nWhat is taking so long to get back pay. It was submitted Nov ‘23 and authorized Oct ‘24 and till today still waiting on the VA to audit my back pay.\nMr. “I been here for about a week,” this statement of assurance is hard to believe. Media spin is one of the most infectious hallmarks of our current Executive admisistration. It appears you’ve also caught the sick.\nI hear no cuts then I hear find things to get rid of! That means cuts of some kind, $, programs, Doctors, privileges. There has already been cuts! Can’t trust my own Gov SMH. I served to honor my country with excellent work that keeps America free. In a month this duely paid for Government has separated the U.S. not uniting the U.S.\nGreat, I thank you for shar5ing this video\nKeep up the good work!\nWhat about the fact that ALL hiring is suspended for the next four months? What about critical VA positions that need to be filled to support Veterans in getting their benefits? What about the fact that all new hires who were on probationary status – yes, even those new hires in the VA – have been fired? What about the critical positions that they filled? The equation is clear – cutting positions equals fewer services. It’s been a slash and burn with no strategic thinking or management since January 21, 2025.\nI’m glad to see that the VA will still be able to meet our needs. Hearing aids are critical for a lot of us, we can hear our children talking, laughing and our spouses no longer have to raise their voice. It may seem trivial to others but it means the world to us to hear clearly.\nWords are cheap — let’s see what actions are taken. How secure is our personal and medical information once it’s shared with the kids from DOGE (probably none of whom ever served the people of the US or are veterans) whose loyalty seem to be to one man, who never served, and not to veterans or our country!\nYou’re a liar! Right now the cuts that have been proposed are going to take away the call centers for VA prescriptions. You’re going to set us back 20 years. Stop lying it’s so easy to fact check you.\nI’m sure there’s nothing to worry about here. It’s not like trump just replaced the VA secretary with a talking head who claims that there’s nothing insidious about a billionaire and his team making tax cuts within the US government. Don’t worry guys, everything’s ok because trumps talking heads say so, nothing to worry about!\nGiven that the current director is a Trump appointee, I have little fairh that the benefits I was promised will not be cut further. I am sure I speak for a large percentage of veterans when I say that I will believe it when I see it. Pres Musk and his sidekick, Trump have made their opinions on the military and veterans crystal clear; that they view us all as “suckers and losers”. Secretary, I want to believe you. However, the history speaks much louder than the “thoughts and prayers” speech.\nI have had 2 cases initial file 2017 – NOD Sept 2020 on docket Hearing July 2024 – still waiting to be sent to a Judge. Almost 8 yrs so far going through the system. Cannot find out how many cases are in front of me cannot see any indication how long it may take. All I hear is it will be awhile just be patient. Not sure about rest of veterans waiting to get their cases resolved but I am beyond “not” impressed .\nJust tired of the lip service.\nI would like to talk to someone about the\ncurrent problems in getting agent orange\nBenefits. It takes 2 years to get paperwork processed. To do this I had to hire an attorney who got 20 percent off top. Not all my paperwork was submitted at the same time I have been told I have to wait\nanother 2 years for the balance. I thought I paid all of this in 1968-69 in Vietnam.\nWhy don’t I believe you, Doug? What records are the DOGEies looking at? Are they looking at my service and medical records? Are they looking at my disability compensation?\nIf Trump/Musk plan DoD cuts why wouldn’t they cut veterans benefits? I just don’t trust them at all.\nI’m not worried about our benefits being cut or revamped. But I do have a problem, back in 2016 I was separated from Service because of Budget cuts. So when I was processing out, I received a check for my services of 26 yrs. I thought okay this is good since it stated that on my DD-214 that I was to receive it and nothing else was said or mentioned. Well when I went in to start the process of my disabilities from service, so when things were all graded and I was told what I would receive. Only after that I pay back the separation pay first. I was told that I never should have taken the separation pay. I was never told that in the beginning. So with that being said is that I should be able to receive that separation pay back.\nThank you sir ?? would it be possible to further assist with dental care for veterans that need dental help but can’t get it ? Living with dental pain is hard.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nWow. That was not biased AT ALL. I do not trust anything he said. Neither should you.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nYou’re going to do more, yet 1000 staffers were cut…I can do the math.\nDont send me this trump propaganda again!\nBullsh-t. Bullsh-t with a ” folksy drawl” is still bullshi-.\nSounds like a whole lotta my Republican fellow disabled vet friends are having some justifiable Buyer’s Remorse>\nWhy am I getting communication about Camp Lejeune when I’ve never been there. I just deleted them but they kept coming back.\n~7 years from start to finish to have 4 teeth implanted by the VA!! Pain clinic intern/student bends and lodges a computer controlled needle in my spine. VA sends me for an experimental surgery, effectively shortening my life span by no less than a decade. That is just a few examples of an endless list of how poor our care is. I have never had a good experience at the VA ! I’m no economic analyst but I fully believe our medical ” benefits” should become medical INSURANCE! The DOGE thing very well could save the country trillions by doing that. No buildings to buy, lease, upkeep etc. Reduced employees wages, and utility costs. Tons of savings from my point of view. I’m beyond disgusted with the fact we veterans sacrifice up to our lives for this country and we receive the worst healthcare this country has to offer. Rarely do we have a doctor for more than 1 1/2 years before a new one appears. no family doctor, no history, just a new face and start over at ground zero. Yes now all these colleges would lose the guinea pig practicing on the veterans to earn their degrees yet I thought this was for veterans not for colleges to train students on us. We veterans deserve insurance not medical “benefits” that don’t benefit us and guarantees us the worst healthcare we can get. Am I wrong or do we not deserve to have our own doctors that we and our family members build history and rapport with? Give us insurance instead of the word benefit, which truly means if we want professional healthcare, it will be paid for out of our pockets.\nWell, the VA is as full of bureaucracy and process that weigh down the VA from getting his/her benefits. They also have process that don’t make sense to get a referral that even the referral doctors at both ends don’t understand. They also have a system that doesn’t keep the Veterans involved and aware of the process of approving referrals aka request for services, that the vet has to keep calling and trying to find out where their request is and what is the issue, instead of an automated system that helps keep all involved in every step of the process. This avoids wasted time on both the Vet and customer service rep that doesn’t usually have the info, they are just a middleman/woman. Approving procedures, test, labs and consult in the community care process is very cumbersome on all involved (Community provider, the ancillary services, the specialist, and the Vet.\nMaking these processes more efficient would save money, time and headache for the VA, Vet and taxpayer.\nI’d like to know where the data is that Elon Musk and his team of unauthorized individuals took. Elon Musk has not been authorized by Congress nor the Senate but somehow has access to our records either directly through the VA or through the treasury which ties into the VA documents. I’d like to know what happened to my personal documents and I’ve a right to ask under The 1974 privacy act.\nWhat are you doing to protect veterans?\nWhat is the current status of my personal data and records?\nWhat is being done so that an individual who is not a naturalized citizen nor authorized by Congress or Senate will not have access to them in the future?\nWhy has the VA not put out messaging that says our data is safe and not in the hands of a third-party? Is it because it actually is in the hands of Elon Musk where they should not be.\nWhat has the VA done to make sure that there was proper vetting?\nAs you can see, I have lots of questions\nSince trump made the comment when visiting the allied cemetery in Normandy, about the soldiers buried there, I have been mad every time I think about HIS comment, ” THEY WERE FOOLS AND SUCKERS”. He BOUGHT his way out of Viet Nam. I did not and neither did the 53, 281 men and women who died there.\nGreat to hear. Maybe we can get a raise on out travel reimbursement.\nThen Why is my VA primary doctor after I lost my job my car my private health care telling me I am not paralyzed and the VA is not doing anything for me and to loose weight and good luck after I just lost everything!!! Good riddance in my book ????????????✊\nHallelujah! Information we can trust!\nPlease fix TriCare\nI trust flying on an airplane right now more than I trust your word. You’re a political appointee working for a serial liar who changes his mind daily and has no problem throwing you under the bus. Thank you for the reassurance, though, bud.\nAnyone who has to defend Trump and Musk is not an honest person. Mr. Collins is a politician who will say anything to stay in good grace with our first elected felon CINC. Disgraceful time for Americans.\n“DOGE” representatives at VA are neither qualified for forensic auditing, nor are their actions acceptable on any normal basis. As for the threat to veterans’ benefits, I don’t take the word of any Trump appointee any more than I would the word of Trump itself. Nor can you improve services by firing people wholesale. 1st thing I saw at the local facility Tuesday morning was a filthy bathroom, which probably used to be cleaned by a probationary janitor that was fired. I asked staff, and yes, probationary employees have been fired. I don’t know how many. “Improving services” is a LIE. “VA employees are reporting effects that include closures of operating rooms, reductions in the number of available intensive care unit beds, and cuts to inpatient mental health facilities. You’ve gutted the SUICIDE CRISIS LINE! If you have any self-respect you’ll resign.\nhttps://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/19/va-crisis-line-employees-among-those-fired-amid-federal-workforce-purge.html\nA GREAT choice for this position!!!\nOh wow, the new VA secretary is totally looking out for veterans—by gutting the workforce that actually processes their claims. Nothing says ‘supporting veterans’ like firing thousands of them and pretending that somehow speeds up their benefits. But don’t worry, folks! It’s all about ‘rooting out waste and abuse’—which, judging by the layoffs, apparently means veterans themselves. What a pathetic, bootlicking stoolie. You’re not streamlining anything, you’re just setting the stage for even longer wait times and more bureaucratic nightmares. Absolute disgrace.\nVets need a resource for issues and damages caused by VA providers, where the managers and chiefs cant protect them. That includes a way to get falsified medical records changed.\nMaybe, just maybe, the VA will finally approve benefits for my husband. He served in Vietnam and many years later was diagnosed with Cancer in his sinuses that grew and pushed up to his brain. He suffered severe nose bleeds and headaches so horrible he couldn’t even sleep. When we applied for benefits to help my husband, he was denied because the VA said we couldn’t prove it was due to Agent Orange and his type of Cancer was not on the “list” of covered Cancers associated with Agent Orange! Even though the doctor (ENT) stated it was most likely the cause of his Cancer, but how the hell does one prove that? The VA did tell him though, that if he was ever diagnosed with Type II diabetes, he would qualify for full benefits! The ONLY thing they approved him for was a cheap set of hearing aids. He lost his hearing and his teeth due to the Cancer treatments, but the VA still wouldn’t cover the costs of any of his treatments. Thank goodness we both had jobs that helped cover most of his treatments, but the VA definitely turned their backs on my husband.\nI don’t believe one word from a Trump appointee. I know damn well, that Trump/Musk want to cut everything possible to fund more tax cuts for the poor billionaires. I absolutely believe General Kelley and General Milley, that Trump thinks Veterans are suckers and losers. I remember everything Trump said about John McCain. So, how long before our medical care gets privatized? It’s a GOP dream come true. I get great care from the VA, as it is now, and I can tell you story after story about when the VA outsourced scheduling after the Phoenix VA scandal; I couldn’t get tests done, because the private company didn’t do their job.\nIt took 2 whole years after the awful private insurance company bowed out, for the VA to catch up on unscheduled appointments. My 2 ratings equal 100%, so of course I receive 80% disability. How long until these DOGE people come after it? I don’t believe that they don’t have access to our private information. How would you know? Musk has locked everyone out. There is zero oversight of DOGE.\nIf you believe anything they say, then I’ve got land in FL for you.\nAnd if you voted for that you are getting exactly what you deserve so stop whining.\nA couple of comments:\n1. I saw a report on CNN two days ago about a 10 year Marine Corps veteran who was working in a key administrative position in a VA clinic, cutting through red tape for patients, scheduling appointments, and ordering supplies, but was just fired. How is this suppossed to help veterans seeking or receiving care at this hospital. Who is taking over his duties? According to the Marine Corps vet, there was no time for a transition plan. If one expects the nurses and doctors to assume these duties, there is no doubt that access, availability, acceptability, continuity, cost-effectiveness, and quality of care will likely be adversely impacted.\n2. I am a 60 percent disabled vet and receive care in the community. I’m going on a month now waiting for VA Martinsburg to extend my community of care provider in endocrinology. Until this is accomplished, I can’t see the endocrinologist, nor order my insulin from the VA pharmacy. How many people were cut from the community of care offices?\nit’s too soon to tell, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, But I am incredibly skeptical with anything DOGE touches. I haven’t seen anything but wildly outlandish claims not backed by any substance and reflex actions taken without any understanding of the consequences. To be openly accepting of what they are doing before they’ve really done anything strikes me as disingenuous and dangerous.\nThank you for the informative message. The wait me and other veterans have endured is too long. Currently I have an appeal that I had a hearing in late October that was filed in 2019. Another Appeal was just awarded in November of last year. Waiting and going through the various hoops is frustrating to say the least! Thank you and please improve this process\nWhy in the world should we trust Doug Collins, noted Trump sycophant since 2016, to tell the truth? Trump thinks we are losers and suckers, he absolutely does not care about us.\nFellow Vets, do not listen to these mercenaries. CYA and guard your assets. They will absolutely cut our benefits if it benefits them.\nThank you so much for the video! This is why the “bad” extreme left media just needs to be shut down. They don’t know what to do with their narcissistic minds, so they keep putting out bad information. There is something seriously psychologically wrong with them. They are not listening to the millions of people to do what is right with common sense. Just a complete shame!!!\nAlso, for the Camp LeJeun cases. If you have an attorney, they wait until they have 500 cases or more and then go to court for the day. The attorney’s are taking 30, 40 and I have talked with some that are taking 50%. There should be some law on that one a senator should put a bill forth.\nAnyway, thank you Mr Collins\nThen why did I just get told by my primary care doctor that all of a sudden I’m not paralyzed and there is nothing the VA will do good luck and lose weight????\n???????\nAnd we’re supposed to believe maga? Yea, right. Magatards are famous for telling the truth and not for baiting and switching at all. Man, thank you so much for your assurance and for your unabashed integrity. We’ll see how the future goes but I have no faith in bad faith.\nFor all legal purposes, DOGE is not a legal Department and should not any business reviewing anything related to the American people.\nAs I recall, that’s what the Inspector General’s are for. Because no one wants to stand up to the person who occupies the WH, everyone has to suffer. The President continually lies to the American public and frankly, it’s embarrassing.\nThe American people deserve better and especially our military and veterans.\nWhy should we believe that our benefits are off the table? He would do and say anything to save himself.\nThank you Secretary Collins. As an Army veteran and supporter of President Trump, I know that President Trump is the best friend of we veterans and that you and him will do the right thing.\nI don’t care about the cuts maybe they should and maybe we’ll better service too many veterans died because of the va not helping them\nThe new VA Secretary is obviously an arse-kissing TRUMPTARD. Elon is not finding waste, he is simply cutting things he wants to cut in order to get himself (and his fellow billionaires) big tax cuts by screwing real Americans. Over 1000 VA workers have already been fired. So the idea that we are going to increase benefits and improve services is a complete lie. Our so-called president is a wartime Draft Dodger who calls veterans Losers and Suckers – and this is how he “honors” real heroes.\nAs a disabled veteran, it took a year and a half to get approved. I didn’t know the system and realized I left out hearing loss tinnitus and sleep apnea so I finally applied for these things and got approved for everything except for sleep apnea which makes no sense it’s all about money. And that took another year so now if I appeal, it’ll take another 200 days to get an answer from my appeal. I think they’re just hoping that we die so they don’t have to pay out. I hope you change my mind. Thank you.\nYou are saying this to keep your job knowing that any negativity about the President will put you on the chopping block. I do not have faith that this administration will protect our benefits as they are already following everything else in the Project 2025 manual. You cannot trust anything this administration says or does.\nAnd what is being done to protect veterans’ jobs in government service?\nAlthough the VA might be maintaining benefits for veterans, my wife was employed through the VR&E program with the VA, and fought hard through her probationary period with the VA. She only had a little over a month left to go and was cut despite outstanding performance reviews. Although I believe that there are individuals taking advantage of the federal employment system, a massive cut of just blanketing probationary employees was not the way to go.\nI don’t belive a single word that you said. You were appointed by Trump because you are loyal to him. You cannot be loyal to him and the country, including all of the Veterans you claim to represent. You represent an authoritarian regime that is trying to destroy our country and turn it over to Russia. My father and uncles fought facism in WWII but you are embracing it by being loyal to Trump. Trump and Musk have already fired over 1,000 VA employees, including doctors and nurses, but you don’t seem to care that our healthcare will suffer as a result. How is taking medical services away from us while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” How do we know that an unvetted billionaire or his unvetted teenagers haven’t already been at our medical records? After all, he’s aready received access to our Social Security numbers and tax information, so what’s to keep him from accessing our medical information and benefits? I know that you won’t, because you are loyal to Trump, which is why you were appointed. The plain and simple truth is that you cannot be trusted.\nYou are not telling the truth. Cuts will be made and the money will go to give tax cuts to the rich. You should be ashamed.\nI apologize, but, “Faster then ever?” I have had 2 claims in for almost 2 years… And another one in for 7 months, just to add my 18 yr old high school senior back on my dependent list, since he was taken off as soon as he turned 18…\nNot to mention, now my employer of 19 years, has recently made me fill out multiple questionnaires about my PTSD. Now I have been required to switch jobs and schedules within the Department !!! Hopefully whoever is in charge of the EEOC can make some appointments available within the time limits to file a charge for discrimination, but that doesn’t seem to be happening very quickly either. Although I WOULD NEVER, I’m really starting to understand why there are 22 a day that give up…\nThank you for the information,for the past four years the VA has been SILENT!!\nThank you, sir.\nI know the va has treated me great and will continue to do so my only concern is that it takes what seems to take forever to get paper work changed when you get a rating change just in my case I have been waiting for the va to add a dependent added sense July of 2024\nI hope its true you (Mr Collins) are here to help the Vet. Please, be honest with us the vets of the wonderful country\nThis bogus, of course doge is looking for CUTS going . All one needs to do is look at all the CUTS to varios federal agencies creating more danger for Country and devasting affect for families. Ask yourself why havrn’t programs paying the various contracts that Musk have with ANERICAN funding??\nI dunno man, the 1000+ layoffs at the VA that everyone is hearing about doesn’t give us a lot of confidence in what you’re saying. Frankly, no one, other than Trump and Musk can even say if VA benefits will be cut, because they are the ones in charge.\nThank you Secretary Collins for your reassurance that veterans benefits won’t be cut. It’s very difficult to understand why that would even be considered by our leadership. I am hopeful you will be successful ìn your thoughts for all veterans.\nI am a retired female Veteran. After reading most of these comments it saddens me that so many of us are waiting YEARS to get a reply concerning our disability claims. I ask you, why would anyone in their right mind ever consider joining any branch of service? We gave to our country and then the government just disregards us when we need help because of what we have experienced while serving our country.\nPresident Musk and his minion trump care NOTHING about the Veterans. He made that known when he called us, and I\nquote, “losers and suckers”\nI can tell you this, if anyone attempts to screw with our disability ratings you will have a war on your hands.\nThanks for tackling this mess at the VA. Ad a 100% disabled veteran I am willing to help out any way possible to get the VA back to a Premier agency. Sgt. Joseph Vary\nCollins is not being honest. They fired 1,000 employees. Just heard that they are rehiring 12 that were fired because they work on the Veteran crisis center.\nYou lost me at embedded subtitles. Back in the 80’s, TVs started including a button to turn on subtitles IF you want them. Online video sites like the one this is hosted on (YouTube) ran with that OPTIONAL subtitle button. And yet, so many places now force embed subtitles, completely eliminating people’s choice in favor of pandering to a subset of people who require or insist upon their ever presence. And yes I understand they help those with hearing issues or are in a loud workplace. That’s the target audience for the ON option of the subtitle button, give their freedom of choice back, and mine too. So no thanks, I will not watch your words dance in my peripheral vision while you speak. Write it in an article and save the bandwidth.\nAll you 2-4 year slackers can just relax. Stop bad mouthing our President and the efforts he is making to fix the damage the democrats have done. The cuts were long overdue to get rid of the lazy people at the VA that don’t want to do their fair share of the work. Once they get workers in those positions the care will improve. As a combat vet, I am embarrassed by some of the comments from the low life bad mouthing of the administration. Maybe that’s why you aren’t getting the care you think you deserve. Straighten up.\nThanks for giving the fact straight up. That’s how we like it\nAs a suggestion, I am a disabled veteran in Crawford county Pennsylvania, we got a new CBOC last year, just ten years after receiving a new one. When I asked about this I was told we will get another new one in ten more years, why? If upgrades are necessary, which I don’t really see any in this facility, but if they are, why not spend a quarter of the money improving the existing facility? How much could the VA save by doing this rather than constantly building new facilities? Use some of those savings to help improve the lives of vets decreasing medical costs, and thus creating even more savings? Just a thought\nANYBODY! that condones Trumps action is a LOSER! According to Trump, we, as Vets, are losers. This idiot, has to go.\nMr. Secretary, Trump and his minions have shown repeated disrespect to Veterans, both living and dead. For you to tell us that you envision no cuts to the VA programs, you are either a polyanna or you must be living in a cave. I look for them to cut some of the allowable meds, terminate the Community Care Program, to institute co-pays, and to make it more difficult for Vets to be granted disability. If I’m wrong, Mr. Secretary, I will apologize.\nThanks for that. I appreciate the “real” news straight from the source.\nUSA\nPlease respond to Sen. Warner’s and Sen. Kaine’s comments that veterans are the major work force in the federal government and will be the majority of those fired. Thank you.\nAs a retired Air Force vet with multiple VA claim denials, I’m so saddened and yet happy to see all the Vets on here posting their anger towards a department that is supposed to protect us and provide support.\nKnowing that my fellow veterans are angry and fed up with the current “administration” is a great first step and a group that can lead the way in clearing house. Please don’t lose momentum in this fight.\nYou don’t fire doctors, nurses, and hospital staff, thus causing appointments to be cancelled and ORs shutdown and then tell us it’s gonna be good. You are hurting us.\nI did not hear a denial that the CBO proposals are not going to be implemented. Paying for tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of veterans is just wrong! A folksy video that seemed devoid of facts is not convincing.\nSo thankful to have veterans in our family, that use the VA services. We go to Hines in IL….grate for good care there.\nI wouldn’t trust Doug Collins with the health car of a snail! He is an unqualified tRump appointee and his only loyalty is to tRump, not veterans!\nDisgusting. You’re a disgrace to the uniform, spreading these lies on behalf of a man who just today declared himself king. The veterans posting about DOGE illegally firing them aren’t fake, but you are. Again, you’re a disgrace and so is every other enabler of this budding dictatorship. Sic semper tyrannis.\nDid they cut the VR&E benefits during Biden Admin. I got declined twice, been out of work, asked for assistance a 3rd time, was put in VR&E Independent Living Services and they sent me all these little medical contraptions that don’t really help with big issues. Asked about ILS grants to modify bathroom and widen doorways and my VRC said they don’t have a contract with any Contractor to do that so I could not get help with that.\nI applied for VR&E employment education & training, but was put in ILS? I even asked if I could get help with starting my own small Veteran owned business since VRC opined to not send me to school, and got denied on that too. Just got letter from VRC that says 6 months into ILS now they closing VR&E ILS case. Will the new VA Secretary review recent VR&E program denials?\nI’ll just be sitting here for a couple years before anyone gives a response? Very used to that, months and years. This is why private health insurance is a better option, when someone can afford it, V.A. wait times are absolutely ridiculously too long. It’s a broken system, and a good reason to never let Congress promote nationwide government Healthcare, cause that means civilians would see how Vets die from service-connected issues while waiting to be seen by a V.A. doctor\nThe VA should not be giving credibility to DOGE. Transparency? Who’s in charge of Doge? Who are the employees of Doge? Where is their government contact and security clearance? Why don’t we have the names and faces of these people?\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors. Good Luck\nThanks to Sec. Collins for his support of all us Veterans\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors that are reviewing my claim. Good Luck\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say about not cutting veterans benefits. We already have a hard time getting appointments and they firing employees so how can we trust in this administration.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins ;\nThank you, Secretary Collins, for your message assuring us that our VA benefits are safe. While I did not believe the Democrat’s or the media’s claims to the contrary, your message confirms my belief in President Trump, the Republican party, and your support in America’s veterans.\nLouis W McClure\nVietnam Veteran\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say.\nIf DOGE is working on saving money, where are the forensic auditors, and why did they hire hackers?\nI want a REAL explanation of what’s going on without NONSENSE commentary about “media” or “mainstream media” bullcrap. Say it straight or I don’t care what you have to say.\nPlease look into VES, contract service, It is for the contractor to make a profit and have no way helping vets… They can make a appointment 30 days out, the vet has to live by a contractor’s schedule. Let’s make the VA about the Vet and not about a contractor making a profit.\nI’ve never seen a secretary veterans affairs sound like a snake oil salesman until now. WOW\nPlease allow dental care through the Care in the Community program. Dental insurance has limited coverage, minimal (50%) reimbursement and is very expensive (over $50 per month for Delta Dental). Allow veterans dignity and oral health via fillings, crowns, bridges and implants that can be provided by a local dentist. May God bless.\nThank you for the update Secretary Collins! I new you would do an excellent job! Can you cancel the new Gov ID program? It’s the same one the IRS uses and I don’t feel safe giving them that info. Besides the VA should take its own ID for me to log into my healthy vet to message my doc or order my meds.\nThe best way to stop this madness is to tell the men and women of the armed forces who volunteered and served honorably that they will not receive the VA benefits checks at the end of each month.\nAny way the docket can be moved along more readily for disability appeals? Retired in 2020 and still waiting.\nI have found VA Workers to be professional, kind. and hard working. Sometimes I am ashamed at the treatment they are given by other Veterans. While I did my duty to our country, It is you and the people serving under you we Vets need to thank “for your services” to us.\nIf you tie your performance and that of the agency to Trump and DOGE then you are immediately suspect\nWhat’s being done about appointments? I’ve been trying to get an appointment since September 2024 for my back pain and only get the run around when I call.\nThis guy is a bootlicking Trump syncophant. If you think for one second they’re not coming for your benefits you’re crazy.\nWhat about the VA employees that were fired? Most of them were veterans, I would appreciate it if you were hones and just stated the facts that Trump does not respect us. He has yet to apologize for stating that the CMH, id the same as the Presidential Medal Of Freedom\nWhen are you going to support the Service Dog Insurance Benefit? It’s time has come. Research proves the value of these special animals to veterans.\nWe all hope and pray that you are a man of your word. We have been wronged before.\nI want the real truth my husband has been gone going on 2 years I am trying to get his disability he was at 70% when he passed I guess they are wanting to wait and see if I pass away so they don’t have to deal with me I need help !\nWhat about my Health-E-Vet?\nHistorically, this President and his hand packed, unqualified stoogies, have a history of lying. Time will tell…same crap of blaming the media. The media so far has been correct on what they said a 2nd term of Trump would look like.\nAbsolutely thank you for clearing that up I’m a veteran receiving veteran benefits and it’s all I have think the good Lord and the government but this news is a bunch of bull crap so thank you for clearing that up and I appreciate everything you guys are doing thank you\nApparently, the VA is already cutting it’s own expenditures. I’ve had my classification and cut-off figure changed and for the second consecutive year, the VA is attempting to downgrade me to having to pay co-pays on my medications. With the meds I’m on, this would come to $400/month that would have to come out of my food budget, because that’s the only ‘budget’ we have. It seems that we manage to be just a few dollars over the adjusted cutoff every year. For over 20 years this has not been the case but now, with the budget shortfall, we’re suddenly being squeezed.\nIt has been two half years since the Camp Lejeune Pact Act was signed.I found\nout today my claim(lawsuit) will more than likely be the first of next year.I can not believe there are only four judges for 450,000 claims something needs to be done.All of these Veterans are waiting is the govt just waiting for them to die off?\nThe 10.8 million dollars of the Pact Act funds the higher up V.A. used for a raise 136 people I was told they did re coup 97% of the funds. Is there a new IG to contact?\nThey have no business being in any government computers. Is this the largest beach of data in US history.\nYou need to contact your congressional representatives and senators like I did. The problem with the PACT Act IRT Campaign LeJeune H2O contamination is it did little to set out the parameters for compensation. Whereas the VA established clear cut criteria for benefits and eligibility, the Dept of the Navy has not, and they are letting the courts establish those criteria. As you probably already know, this is going to take a long time, and frankly the evidence trail for people like my parents and myself who were exposed from the 50s to the 80s is ridiculously hard to come by. My dad already passed away. My mom’s in her 90s. Many like them, will pass on before these issues get resolved without additional legislation. Don’t wait on the VA.\nThe IGs have been fired\nNo! President Bone Spurs fired all the IGs. He wants free reign to disassemble democracy and not be accountable.\nThey being doing that for years. Why do you think Agent Orange took forever to be in lists for claimable things?\nThe money available is in the Billions, not millions. Payouts are anywhere from $25,000 to one million per veteran. I don’t know what determines the amount the veteran gets.\nI dont believe a damn word. Your wannabe orange king doesn’t give a damn about dead vets, hurt vets, captured vets… he said it himself.\nThe fact you even have to say anything about benefits is indication of bs.\nI agree 100% on them waiting on us to die. I’ve had my claim in since 1970 and can’t get anyone to do anything. Are they going to check on past claims? I certainly hope so!\nHate to burst your bubble but you need to know the truth. When Collins says they are clearing cases quickly, that means they are denying them. And then the appeals process begins. It’s been 10 years now for me with an 1151 case. (malpractice) You know what your case file looks like after several appeals (for bad info) looks like after a dozen of people have looked through your case and commented? You probably do if you’ve ever looked at the notes in your medical records after a visit. The amount of incorrect info is staggering. I haven’t given up but I’m assuming now this admin will deny it permanently. I doubt I live to see it. I pray all of you will eventually see positive results but it might be decades down the road, if ever under this administration. It absolutely is deny until death.\nI know it takes a great deal of time due to the fact that only 4 Judges hearing cases. I was finally approved after waiting more than a year. benefits were back dated and paid on when I filed. Once you are in the system it works great. I now have 100% of my health care taken care of at a VA facility and got a large lump sum settlement and my monthly tax free check is on my bank account on the 1 st of every month.\nIs there a way to contact your office directly with correspondence or is this the only 2 way communication?\nSir, will you ask Pres. Trump to please sign an Executive Order authorizing and directing the VA to finally recognize the harmful health effects from K2-Uzbekistan radiation as presumptive service-connected conditions? As you know, the serious issue of K2 radiation has remained unresolved now for over 23 years. Further, the 2022 PACT Act failed to adequately address K2 radiation. We, the disabled Veterans of K2 appreciate your and Pres Trump’s support in this critical healthcare matter Sir. We believe at this juncture that an Executive Order is the most appropriate and expedient means to finally address the K2 radiation issue. Thank you very much Sir for your time and consideration.\nI’m the spouse of a 100% service connected disable veteran that served 12 years and in the Persian Gulf War and they VA still has not added me as his dependant nor can I get my ChampVA until I’m recognized as his dependant. Who can I contact to help get this completed? I need medical insurance. It’s been almost 5 months!\nWhat I find disturbing is the constant praising of Trump and the dig at main stream media. That pretty much sums everything up. If it quacks like a duck… Say goodbye to your bennies, my fellow combat vets. This administration doesn’t care about us.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they guess the previous one..when they force good doctors to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they fired the previous one..when they force good doctors and nurses that brought the gap, to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nsomeone opened a can of worms. good luck\nCome on Mr Hochstetler, you know how this works. ONE way communication. You can try the Secretary’s hotline phone number, which goes right into an automated service and good luck to getting the right operator to connect you to the Secretary’s administrative assistant. Lots of SMOKE SCREEN and GASLIGHTING!\nWhen will the Camp LeJeune Case be funded? Many families have cases filed for years without any answers. Please make this a priority!\nThe Camp LeJeune funds are there. It is only four Judges hearing all of these cases.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nMany people support efforts to prevent fraud, but veterans with hiring preference working for the VA or other federal agencies—many with over 15 years of service—have been fired. These terminations were not due to poor performance, as claimed, but because they accepted promotions that placed them on a one-year probationary period. As a result, veterans who have sacrificed for their country are losing their jobs, despite the protections meant to support them. These actions are being taken without consideration of the long-term consequences.\nWhat? That’s stupid. I would almost bet that TRUMP don’t know that.\nI’m also concerned about the Camp Lejeune litigation. Delayed justice is denied justice. We deserve justice.\nI am so glad that we finally have a person with our best interest in mind. I’m looking forward new and improved VA and I know all my fellow veterans are too . Thank you Mr Collins .\nDo you know if Trump is committed to assisting more Veterans that have been convicted of felonies since he is also a convicted felon? Can federal employees now also be convicted felons?\nYeah, how about the transparency of firing veterans with double digit years of federal service just because Musk said do it. Is that helping your veterans who happen to be employees too? Stand up for your workforce Sec Collins. I fought for my country and a South African billionaire is making these decisions. So much for my exemplary 18 plus years of federal service with the VA.\nSincerely,\nDisappointed, unemployed disabled vet.\nNuts, as a famous general once said.\nNuts. How many VA staff have been cut?\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nI agreee with you one million percent!!! Thank you!\nEnough with the LGBTQ. Get out of here with that nonsense!\nOur Vet money and efficiency has nothing to do with displaying who you have sex with! we just need to focus on real issues not displaying our sexual preferences to all to see.\nHell yes.\n10/10\nWould protect above commenter in prison.\nTruth’s are better said than lies. With the transgender operations, constant medical attention, Mrs Cross are you going to pay for that medical expenses bill? In the military, at many commands, never cared who was gay, bi, lesbian, during the late 80’s. Don’t ask don’t tell, was a good idea. I do understand about marriage, same rights as a heterosexual would. Why, maybe you can answer this question. Why does the LGBT+ community have to advertise what is done behind their bedroom doors?\nThank you!\nRetired Navy Submariner. Heterosexual. I have a cousin who is gay n married, whom Since being my cousin with a tight knit family( aunts, uncles, cousins from both sides of my parents families.\nThey’re not going to fly my flag, why should they yours?\nWe don’t need to single out people for what goes on in their personal life.\nThe American Ensign and POW flags are the only flags that needs to be flown.\nThose two flags represent everybody.\nWhat about the firing of VA employees during their probationary period. Is this happening as we cut the government? How will this affect our care and services?\nAmen…I’m with you on this. All Veterans means all Veterans.\nLGBQTXYZ, get their recognition on Veterans Day just like the rest of us\nNobody cares about your sexual orientation (or anyone’s). Thank God President Trump (& Secretary Hegseth) has focused our military on doing the job of being a leathal fighting force – not some social engineering experiment on queers.\nLol mental illness\nExactly this. Thank you for saying it so clearly.\nCry me a river ! If you full inclusion why the Hell do you feel that you need a “SPECIAL” LGBTG PREVENTION NUMBER ???Use what all the rest of us use !\nThis is about veterans. Not your lifestyle preferences. You get as much respect as anyone else. Deal with it.\nNo person of sound, rational mind truthfully gives a s*it about the LGBTQ “family.” Have those persons nothing greater to celebrate in their lives than their sexual preferences? If that be the case, what a meaningless, unproductive life they live. Have they accomplished NOTHING greater than deciding who they decide to share orgasm’s with? The entire LGBTQ scene is a disgrace to humanity for celebrating a personal preference that absolutely NO ONE cares about. GMAFB, ms. cross. Bravo Zulu for getting rid of that disgraceful pride flag.\nThank you Mr. Collins for fighting for our right as veterans. We, the one that serve are very grateful to know that the benefits for the veterans are not going to be affected by this new presidential changes. A lots of us depend on the veteran’s benefits.\nThat sounds like fake news. Trump won’t cut veterans benefits unless one of those entities is skimming money off the top. I hope he finds it if it’s there!\nMichelle, #1 Mr Vought and OMB are Cutting waste not Funding where it is needed. #2, I am a Gay man my self.\nI am for What the Standard Norm Was before DEI, the LBGTQAI+++ alphabet that all but ruined the Military with its Demands.

Thank you for having the COURAGE to post your comment. Retired US Navy CDR.\nThe only flags that should be displayed are the U.S. flag, Military branch flags and the P.O.W. flag. No need for anything else.\nThe American flag represents them just like the rest of us veterans. Did these veterans fight for our country under the gay pride flag or the American flag? When I was in Vietnam I fought under the American flag.\nYou are a liar, there are no cuts.\nDear Mr. Secratary\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nMichael S Jordahl\nUSA, SFC Ret\nOver one thousand VA probationary employees were fired in the last week as part of DOGE ruining everything we have.\nDon’t sit there any say nothing is being cut. Cutting the workforce is harming veterans.\nAgree..many veterans concerned about means test & 30% getting eliminated. We all followed orders and have the scars visible or not. Contrary to popular opinion, VA disability is NOT an entitlement program.\nI’ve been trying to find more info about the means test. From what I understand capital gains could be counted as income. So if a vet bought stock and wanted to sell it to pay off a house or buy a fancy new car it could actually cancel their benefits! If the means test comes true they could use 2025 tax info.\nMilitary.com is owned and operated by Gannett. The same people who operate USAToday. They may have military in the name but they are no more reliable than USAToday. I would take anything there with a grain of salt. And if someone is appealing to my sense of fear? They are probably trying to con me.\nHard pass.\nDon’t believe you.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nInspectors General are how you root out fraud, waste, and abuse, not by having people with no concept of how the government works take a hammer to things they don’t understand. Audits are done with forensic accountants and subject matter experts. Elon has a bunch of JR tech bros, one of which was fired from a previous job for giving away company secrets. Btw, Trump fired all the IGs.\nI wish I could shake your hand. That was the best way to say what all us vets are thinking as I sit in a hospital bed right now due to my injuries.\nI think they should cut it all including the Vet benefits THIS IS WHAT WAS VOTED FOR! so let’s see it through.\nDo let us know how that goes. I expect him to swoop in at any time since he really will need your vote again.\nYou haven’t been paying attention: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nYou’re getting exactly what you voted for, and we tried to warn all of you this would happen. Congrats. You voted against yourselves.\nFine words – but why all the layoffs? Don’t be too surprised when they try to privatize the VA.\nSo, it’s ok for others’ income to be affected. Just not yours. Maybe they served their country honorably as well.\nIf you think DOGE is doing an excellent job then you shouldn’t be surprised when DOGE finds a lot of fraud at the VA that results in reduced or suspended payments, or worse, for veterans like yourself. DOGE has successfully eliminated programs and employees we once thought were indispensable. They’ve already fired 1000+ VA employees. They will be heading to the VBA with the same intent.\nThey need to revamp the disability requirements. Too much glorified welfare. It should be LOD only.\nYou need to send your letter (comment) to your senators and house rep. The head of the VA doesn’t vote on bills. That’s congress’s job.\nYou deserve to be cut off if you think they’re doing a “wonderful job.”\nSo veterans being fired in huge numbers from federal employment is fine because it doesn’t directly affect you?\nThese firings includes nurses and people at the veteran’s crisis hotline, which will affect vets using VA Health Care facilities and those suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues. We either care about vets or we don’t – it shouldn’t matter how it affects us individually.\nCollins is just another suck-up, yes man for Trump.\nYou support Trump and DOGE yet fear having your benefits cut. Get real man. It is your support of these guys that will enable the cuts.\nWow! Our personal information is at risk of being exposed to hostile actors, DOGE is, was, and continues to be a front used to create mistrust in our government agencies, and hard working ‘Mericans are losing their jobs as part of a failed attempt to balance a budget consistently and historically ruined by the GOP…and still there are those that support this type of nonsense. Except when it applies to them. Let’s see who continues to support what, as access to all of our traditional social services are slashed or elimated so those pesky tax cuts don’t expire.\nI’m with you my brother!\nAmen! My husband is a 100% Disabled USMC Vietnam Veteran. He’s been on the poisoned water national list since about 2007. He was told back then if there ever would be money, he would be entitled. When the lawsuit started, we contacted our present attorney. They know how long he’s been on this list.\nWow. Then you just care about your benefits and nothing else Trump and Musk are doing to destroy this country from within?\nElections have consequences, I’ll have to accept what comes with it.\nYes you want the cuts…but not to anything that will affect you. As a disabled vet I also do not, but you somehow think that as long as it does not affect you, its okay to cut them. Im sorry that you lack compassion and empathy for others….which is what the men in charge suffer from as well. You do not think that others losing their jobs are facing catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Shame on you. The man in charge will not be reading your comment….he has better things to do than care for veterans.\nHow is DOGE doing a good job? It’s not even an official federal agency. They are terminating essential workers on false pretenses and claims, causing chaos, destruction, anxiety, and hardship on regular working class people. This entire administration is a coup and whoever they elect to oversee programs, including the VA, they are only minions who follow every unconstitutional law given to them and disregard ethical policies that were put in place only to overturn them and eventually cut standard benefits to veterans and civilians alike. It’s only a matter of time when they start looking at va disability benefits and the recipients who are receiving those benefits. They definitely have access to our personal data and healthcare records. They don’t care about veterans. And why would they, especially Musk!\nThe Sec Def. Has no vote on anything. When Trump and muskrat come for our disability, there is nothing Clins can or will do about it.\nConsider than less than 1% of payments were erroneous in the last 7 years according to the IG, DOGE isn’t doing a good job: it’s a farce to distract from their egregious behavior\nYes, I’m STILL fighting this battle. It is absurd the amount of crap we have to navigate through, wait over a year just to be told no, didn’t happen in the military. Then, it is up to us to hire a lawyer to help fight it. This whole process works against the veterans.\nthere is a concerted attempt to privatize VA Healthcare; the vipers want to convert it into private and for-profit un-healthcare of the sort that exists in the private sector. VA Healthcare in my expereince is far superior to the private system and for a simple reason: inside the VA Healthcare system people are there to help people and not to make profits. I’ve heard that comment from many physicians and nurses who have worked in both.\nMr. Collins doesn’t give a tinkers damn about veterans. He works for Musk and Fat Donnie the Fascist King. I expect that by 2027 the new American King aided by the NAFP, New American Fascist Party will have so decimated our system of government that even our military and those who have suffered and died will become meaningless. In my opinion Trump and Musk plan on dividing the world up three ways. China, Russia, and the U.S. will each control 1/3 of the globe. My question to Collins is WHAT THE HELL are you going to do about it?? Do you even care? Are you simply overseeing the dismantling of the Agency designated to provide care and assistance for those of us who served our Nation? I believe that you’re the chosen sucker. After your mission is complete you WILL be tossed aside like a box of garbage. You Sir are a fool. May God save your soul…..if you have one.\nGood Man ! ?\nHis lips are moving, he’s a republican, he lying while some unelected billionaire technocrat robs us all blind. Faster case fliw? That means they are denying us.\nDear Secretary Collins, I am amazed that veterans are being let go from the VA. I see many of those veteran types working at the VA hospital in Decatur Georgia and I would hate to see them lose their jobs because of some fanatical, cutting efforts by this administration. I hope you will take action to preserve, the opportunities that veterans have to serve other veterans in our VA facilities.\nI agree Captain. When I worked at a VAMC, I saw more non-vets who were a waste of a position. Their attitude was, “after my years probation I cant be fired”. Many non-vet employees live by that code at VAs.\nBeen bothering me also.\nIt is too late. They have fired all probationary employees with no reason with a note in their termination letter saying they were fired due to underperformance, and that is just the beginning unfortunately. They are also making cuts to Medicare which all tricare for life recipients ultimately transfer over to. Anyone who thinks this will not hurt veterans are not thinking clearly and assuming this guy is being honest will be severely disappointed.\nLiars, all of you. Letting are constitution fail while you watch.\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback. The same thing is going on in Florida, VA regional in West Palm Beach. Right in the PODUS’s Winter White House backyard. You would think King Trump and the Secretary would preserve these low paying jobs since it is already extremely difficult to recruit qualified personnel that understands the unique administrative, physical, mental, spiritual, and financial needs required by our military personnel. Just try to explain your situation to a civilian network provider. They just want their money for services!\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback.

What about our Democracy, and all those Vets, including my grandfather, who fought and died for it, against Fascism in WWII. Now you embrace it. After all of the lies that Republicans have told to me in my lifetime, I would not believe anything more that you ever have to say. I became a United States Marine and I am still a Patriot but You support Billionaires over someone like me. Money is your God. So far there has been zero benefit for my service but then I chose honor\nand principle over money. A love of my Nation. Unlike you. I don’t count on you helping any of us. There has been no Justice for the loss of my child at Camp Lejuene. No Justice for anything. I hope that you believe in a Just God, I do. Men like you are going to answer for all of it at Judgement. You still believe in your lies and have zero repentance, no change from your sins. Cuddle with a dictator for worldly wealth and status out of fear. Refuse to help the least of your brothers. Play God in your decisions. No better than those who murderered the Jews. No better than those who condemned Christ to death. No forgiveness from the Lord God. Unforgiven.\nYou are a clown ?. Crawl back to your Circus\nUnlike the ungrateful comments that support the previous missing in chief, i feel its wonderful that we are rooting out fraud and waste. Even if that means laying off VA employees. In fact, it would be cheaper to issus us a card accepted by outside doctors and hospitals for community care.\nWhat did the last 4 years of Biden get you? Go ahead I’ll wait.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nI served in the US Army and am a 100% disabled Veteran. This is the most heartfelt, brutally honest, beautiful way I have heard someone describe what the unabashed sledgehammering of our Constition, our Democracy, our lack of ethics and compassion is doing to the very fabric of our existence. I beg of you to share this beyond here. It needs to be read by the people. And if you don’t want to do it or remain anonymous, I would be honored, as one battle buddy to another, to share this with others.\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nYour left wing liberalism hate is showing. President Trump and Mr. Musk, no matter how much money they have, are trying to save America. Do you live in a cave? Have you not seen all the wast that they have found? If they don’t fix it. You want have to worry about the VA, America will be broke and there won’t be a VA. The U.S. Government now employees over 50% or the working population. We can’t have that. The government was NEVER suppose to be that large. The government should never employ more than 38% MAX. I suggest you crack a book and learn the truth and get off of CNN and MSNBC.\nHear, hear! I’m surprised that the censor allowed your comment. They’re blocking mine. They’re afraid of “dangerous” ideas being seen by other, like Orwell’s 1984. Thanks, Big Brother!\nWow, this country was founded as a constitutional republic and the democracy you speak of was formed within the republic to turn the country into a corporation. So I will ask you take the blinders off and do little more research. Both parties have failed this country and some of the rotten leadership have been in office for decades. But don’t take a word I say to heart I just ask you to do you due diligence and research. Not everyone is bad or has bad intentions, and if these people don’t do good for us then I will join you in the tinfoil hats brigade and vote in some new that will more then like replace and repeal all that being done this time around. But there is moving to another country. I even have researched if this country fails US like I have experienced in the last 3 years cause I when from 70% in late 2020 to be to 90% in early 2021 to 60% in summer of 2022. So tell me how Mr. Collins is the problem\nPerfectly said!!! So very sorry for the loss of your child.\nThis is the same guy that said the VA “will not be cutting any employees.” So I agree with you 100%, I can’t trust this dude either.\nOh, really.\nWell Said. I couldn’t of said it better myself!\nFirst of all, thank you for your service. Secondly, your comments are so out of touch with reality. President Trump very much respects our servicemen and women, and if it weren’t for him and serving as our President 4 years ago, our VA health system would still be in dire straights. He fixed a broken system, and now our Veterans are receiving better care. Please do your research.\nDidn’t the Jews kill Jesus? You must be a troll op on the Internet, but cool story though, Bot.\nYes! I agree with everything you stated! Lip service as vets lose their jobs! Pathetic they will answer for all their stuff!\nHi J Medley. First I am so sorry for the loss of your child at Camp Lejuene. There have been a lot of injustices in our country, and long wait times to get claims finalized etc. but in all seriousness you can’t blame that on any one party. Your remarks about Trump and our new Secretary are so wrong on many levels. You are simply spewing what the liberal media have been dishing out for so many years trying to eliminate Trump from becoming President. Look back – two assassination attempts, two impeachments, endless lawsuits, special hearings etc. – All failed. Millions and maybe billions of taxpayer dollars spent on trying to derail the man. I’ve been in politics so I know the game. I have to close that you are in no place to think God is on your side and against Trump and the Republican party. Despite what you think Trump really wants to make this country great again. I get the fact his personality may rub you the wrong way but give the man a chance. Since you seem to be a Godly man, put him in your prayers that he does a great job for everyone. Have faith and hope he does the right thing!!!! Best to you and yours, a Vietnam Vet\nYou’ve bought into the propaganda, “Trump Bad” is the mantra. If there is any “fascism” it’s in the Democrat Party, the self proclaimed Socialist. I feel for you brother, please open your eyes to the truth –> “Trump GOOD.”\nAlthough you have a right to express your opinion, this rant does not possess one ounce of facts to support the accusations. This extremist approach does absolutely nothing but cause unfounded division. Stick to the facts, keep an open mind, and read a variety of news sources to create a more balanced viewpoint.\nBy the way, there are worse tyrants throughout history than the recent dictator in which was referred. At least try to spice it up a little with some ancient Roman, Chinese, Russian, or Mongolian oppressors. Continually comparing others with the same old name is unimaginative. ;)\nYou are blaming this administration, how about the previous administrations?\nYou are very misled, but I can tell you for certain that under the Biden administration my benefits went to hell. My prescription drug copay almost doubled, and I couldn’t/can’t even make an appointment with my primary care doctor without going through some stupid person that doesn’t even work in that office. I don’t know where you get your information, but you have no idea what you are talking about. You sound like an idiot with the crap you are spewing.\nYou’re just an America Hating Sheep that believes Everything the Lying Fake News Tells you !!\nAmen! My ancestors fought in the American Revolution and most wars since. This administration has no idea what they have done but they will soon. I don’t think there will be a civil war because this isn’t between civilians ( except the “cult”) but the oppressed will rise up and show the billionaires the error of their ways. History is on our side. 1776.\n“I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut,” Collins said. … “I’m happy to partner with DOGE [an un-elected organization that was not created by the US Congress as the VA or USAid was, just an arm of Elon Musk’s business empire] to find things we need to get rid of…” he said.”\nWhat BS, first Collins says he’s not cutting VA benefits…then he says, oh yes, by the way I am cutting benefits, we’re just calling it “efficiency”…literally on the same page!\nSecretary Collins is just a stooge for Musk, our N- co-president from South Africa. He is appointed ‘secretary’ to take an axe to the VA benefits we EARNED by our sacrifice. Trump, a Vietnam draft dodger, has never respected veterans and does not honor our service. To Trump and Musk, we are just “suckers” (Trump actually said this!). Wake up people, this is all in the project 2025 playbook. Musk-Trump wants to kill the VA dead so that we have to deal with their golfing buddies/ vultures who own the private health insurance industry. All while betraying our allies in NATO and selling Ukraine to the Soviets. RIP America 2025.\nJ Meadly Sir, Seems you’re looking to blame certain individuals for the loss of your child. Many lost loved ones concerning the Lejeune issues and or continue to suffer. There is never true Justice after suffering a loss as yours. We do need to heal and as in the Marines, continue to move forward.. I do strongly suggest you seek counseling. The VA has the means and am certain would like to speak with you. Good Luck.\nWell put my friend!\nI agree with you 100%. I was at LeJeune as well. I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Good lord above. ?\nAll of this feels like a full on tail spin. It takes cptsd to a whole entirely different level! And the Veteran’s suicide hotline has already had some operators cut! As if their jobs aren’t absolutely necessary. And they wonder why vets isolate. What a joke-what a slap in the face!! I WILL pray for you and your family.\nWell said My Brother, well said!\nI created the Desert Storm Battle Registry as a survey in 1997 to\nfind my fellow GWI veterans. More than 5,000 filled this out. Then\nI progressed to full advocacy by 1998. By then DOD knew me quite\nwell as I inventoried there servers and threw it back at them. I was tired\nof not knowing anything or why I was so damn sick.\nDSBR name tags, and name plates began to fill boxes from events that\nI was recognized at. Media was easy back then. No one turned me away.\nTill global media coverage in 2003 opposing troops going to Iraq. Even\nhad a DC PO Box for mail.\n2008, got my own VA federal advisory committee. VA went out of its way\nto shorten our tenure and muzzle us. Even threaten me, then pretty\nmuch hide our committee and its final report.\n2012 VA cut us all off. Played dirty with gulf war advocates. Ran off our\nadvocates in favor of ringers. All the while making things worse for Gulf\nwar vets and playing up Deployment Health. Who have been hiding 4\nsignificant disease trends from the veterans and the public.\nHere it is 2025 and Im still here. Out lived hundreds of advocates and\nfellow supporters. Still, DSBR hung on for 28 long years. Of which VA\nhas gotten very braisen. Not posting my letters to the RAC year after\nyear likes its a choice. Taking down all evidence I exist the last 3 years.\nI find it highly offensive 14 Secretaries of VA have ignored everything Gulf\nwar from a veterans stand point. That we have no real say in our care,\nbenefits, and healthcare. You will choose for us. None of you have done\nright by me, or the 697,289 other fellow GWI vets. Going all the way back to\nPL 105-368 that you twisted and abused.\nMust be very comforting to look down your nose, and act like DSBR does not\ndeserve professional courtesy. 28 years of work means nothing. What could I\npossibly offer versus you? Try 28 years of experience and dealing with 13 other\nSec of VA that like you felt veterans input is a joke. Every damn one of them was\na public servant and forgot that when it office. Your supposed to be available.\nTechnically, Im your boss. Not the other way.\nSo I will say to you what Ive been saying back in the Army to officers. How could\nyou loose what you never earned, my respect. You demand it, then you treat me\nlike a feral dog in back ally. You want my respect now, earn it by doing your job.\nWhich means answering phones and emails. So far, zip there. DSBR came along\nway before you, and Ive helped far more gulf war vets than you ever will.\nWe started out nice 2 weeks ago, and now I know 2025 is you cutting throats,\nhiding behind staff, pretending to care while you pretty much spit in my face.\nBlocking my browser access to VA.gov is also blocking me from MyHealthevet\nwebsite. Your denying me access to medical care. Real brave, real smart. So I\nthink Im justified to be grumpy with you. I only get this way reacting to others,\nI didnt start this. Just reached out to you and you blew me off..\nChange is coming either way.\nKirt P. Love\nDirector, DSBR\nFormer Member VA ACGWV\nDidn’t you hear? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nEat [redacted], fascist.\nThank you, what they don’t want us to know is the fact most Vets of Desert Storm are like myself. We were some how connected to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle or M1 ABRAMS, or some other mechanized source. The US Army conducted a study in 1981 on the two tanks mentioned. This study revealed that just firing of the weapons alone Carbon Monoxide was lethal at every position within those tanks. The DOD, and Army refused to do anything about it other than ignore it. Myself I have suffered from Rumathoid Arthritis every since Desert Storm I was 11M. I enlisted at 17 fresh out of High School healthy as an OX. Thru my own studies and research there is a known link to CO poisoning and Rumathoid Arthritis. I have a TERA MEMO attached to my file and conceded to by the VA, but none of that matters, it’s just a piece of paper. Come sit with me some times when it takes all I got to get out of bed because of the pain I am in. I have accepted the fact that RA is chronic and it will take my life someday if a cure is not f going. What I can’t accept is the very Government I defended and would do it again in a heart beat as most of us would, now I’m having to defend myself because nobody with Authority has the balls to stand up and do the right thing for us Vets. It’s always some other law it more red tape, I didn’t recall any of that when I was called to fight a War we really had no business fighting in the first place! Mad as hell at Army,DOD, and now the VA is falling right in step with those two. Grow a pair do right by the very people who gave you a job to begin with or resign and put me in that seat!\nThey may turn a blind eye, but we are still watching. Thank you for the advocacy over the years, Kirt. GWI (or whatever they want to call it) has been a nightmare for so many.\nYou have my undying respect and admiration Kirt. I also had to voice my displeasure to superiors while serving which didn’t serve me well. You seem to have the ability to voice your opinion and stop. My mind demands my adrenaline push me beyond that and display a much firmer view for my point of view.\nU.S. Army Vietnam Vet\nWell over 80% disabled and find the VA extremely lacking to the point I’m convinced I’m just a photo op.\nPlease focus on the Caring for Survivors Act as so many of us lost not only our loved one but also a substantial amount of our income\nYou want the VA to focus on the survivers moreso than the actual veterans? Many veterans are single and single with families and cannot work but yet you feel that its more importants for the non-veterans to get the disabilty that the actual veterans need? Im sorry you lost a substantial amount of your income but I lost the ability to have children because of military issues among other issues so Im not losing an additional income..Im losing most of my income, my home, and may be facing living on the streets if they cut the benefits. I WAS in the military, not just married to someone in it. PS…when I could not have kids my military husband left me to find someone that could.\nCurrently VA has over a quarter of a million pending rating cases, which is taking an average of 140 days to complete. Is that faster than ever? Historically, VA has staffed up during wartime periods but when those employees retire service suffers. Veterans’ needs for VA services do not go away after they are discharged. Many times as veterans age, their needs for disability benefits and health care increases. It angers me that Elon Musk and his wunderkind, none of whom served one day in the military, are attacking the VA. Shame!\nThis empire was built off of the blood of those who served in units like mine, and you better f***king know that we are not oblivious to you trying to f**k with our disability ratings and services. Keep that in mind. You can lie to the masses with the current administration’s lies, but you won’t pull that s**t with us vets. Remember that.\nLess w 0ke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with w 0ke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nA lot of vets voted for this admin. So the wool has been pulled over their eyes and quite easily, unfortunately.\nI second that!\nSadly, some of these Vets are delusional and have fallen into the cult.\n!!! You speak the truth, unfortunately\nIf one comment from here could get the attention of anyone in a position of authority at the VA, let it be Mr. Hirth’s.\nStick your hand in our cage and pull back a stump.\nHow is freezing hiring for the WARTAC program, and taking medical services away while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” You can’t BS us. We are what sustains this empire. Active or reserved… You’d do well to remember that.\nI don’t believe a word the Sec. is saying. He’s just another puppet of this administration & the so called “DOGE”. I’m very worried about the outcome of all this stupity and the future of our USA. Take care & carry on.\nSecretary Collins ,\nI don’t believe your going to read any of these emails. I’ve reached out to Congress the VA representative, and my Congressman in Texas with no results. I’ve had 3 botched surgery’s from incompetent surgeon’s. Now I have to suffer the rest of my life and I don’t trust the VA at all thank god for community care. As far as I’m concerned the Government has given up on us and has given everything to illegals and Fu$k us.\nI will continue to fight for my country and what I believe in\nDear Sir,\nThere are 182 comments on here.Are you going to answer any of them?\nLOL… Don’t hold your breath.\nHe’s not reading them-they don’t care, I promise they don’t. Tomorrow, thousands more will lose their jobs in America while the Felon in charge whines about when he’ll get his new Air Force One delivered—because that is government efficiency:)\nmy brother, he is not even going to read any of them.\nDo you actually think he is going to read them? Sorry your comment was pretty funny. Let me answer you as a disabled veteran. NO, he is not going to answer you. He is probably having his very expensive coffee with his amazing breakfast chatting about how hard his job is and cant decide what kind of furniture he needs for his new office.\nNo, no he is not. But you kinda knew that, didn’t you\nYou wanted this job, now do it\nPlease Exend the Blue Water Line to the original Vietnam Service Medal Line that was took away from Blue Water Navy off Vietnam in 2002. This was the agent orange 1991 Bill for all Vietnam Veterans. I been trying for almost 20 years to get my Benefits. I got a lot of Health Problems from Agent Orange and Toxins on my Ship. I am almost 78 years old.\nMy husband is like you. VA doctors told him to file because certain illnesses, like prostate cancer, he had would be automatic because of Agent Orange. When documentation was filed, weirdly, VA kept saying they didn’t get them. They seemed to get records that were not needed. they also close the case if they don’t get what they want by a certain date. We filed through Texas Vet who took the paperwork and handed it to the VA office and still they wouldn’t acknowledge they received them.\nHow can we possibly believe anything this fascist government says. The president just declared himself king! DOGE was given unrestricted access to records. We have a HHS that wants to put those with mental illness in camps. How can anyone believe this!?\nGreat. Just another bootlicker kissing POTUS butt.\nOne of the slowest entities on this planet is the VA . It takes an average of 6 months to 3 years to get an answer from the VA in disability claims. Molasses going uphill in the winter time on Mount Everest is faster than the VA. Such a disgusting way to treat veterans that literally give their lives for the defense of this great country. And you wonder suicide rates are so high. Veterans have no choice but to give up. It would be nice if one of the largest health care systems in this country could ACTUALLY take care of its veterans. Please pass this on to the VA boss and maybe for ONCE he will ACTUALLY listen to our concerns.\nPeople commenting like he gonna read it lmfao.\nAs I read I wa liked lol. Some are writing a yrs of what they did.\nWe know he’s not going to read them. We know no one on his staff will read them. We know he doesn’t care. The comments are for each other to hear the voices of their compatriots.\nThis is why I would never vote Republican. The sheer stupidity and depravity is an insult to those who served their country. I understand that you rich white scumbags feel that I as a black man can serve and die for my country but I do not deserve to be treated equally. We as black people have fought for this country since its founding and still are treated as second class citizens. Your recent cuts to the VA are yet another example of your disregard for our service. It is my hope that Karma shows how much of a bitch she is. You are led by a 5 time draft dodger who called us suckers and losers, however it is my belief that you are the suckers and losers and I will stand on that until I die…\nAbsolutely. They’re not gonna read any of this stuff, but I’m really enjoying reading what my fellow veterans are saying.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting\nAmen brother!\nAs a white veteran I have to tell you that they don’t care about any veterans no matter what color. I do understand that you may have faced prejudiced issues in the past…so have women, and its not right. About the rest of your comment…I agree totally. Im also nog a fan of old rich scumbags who are robbing us blind to their advantage. That’s why I am up all hours of the night filled with anxiety, depression and questioning if tomorrow they will be coming after us.\nlol shut up, all this garbage has been given to us from all the previous generations Dem and Rep combined working for their globalist overlords have crushed us veterans and made the VA one of the most corrupt institutions on earth, and now all of a sudden 30 days into Trump you’re gonna cry about Republicans and “waaah white people” when the VA has been an institution of death and depravity for the past several decades? Get lost, you’re nothing more than an anti white ideological hack.\nNow you know how my Irish ancestors felt when they were forced off their lands and taken into slavery to serve in the New World. My Celtic brethren were called and treated as sub-Human till 1830s. So been there, done that.\nUp to 20,000 Irish were worked to death to hand dig the New Basin Canal in New Orleans in the 1830s because African slaves were deemed too valuable to risk. In 1862, the US Army project to build a canal on the Mississippi River during the War to bypass Confederate Army batteries on the bluffs of Vicksburg. It was dubbed Grant’s Canal, but after the first failed attempt, that quickly changed to Grant’s Folly. Undeterred, General Grant secured President Lincoln’s approval to force recently “freed” African slaves to hand dig and dredge the adjacent wetlands. It is recorded that 200+ of these men lost their lives for this useless project that was always doomed to failure.\nIn the end, we are all cattle to the powers that be. Race and nationality have little to do with it. Democrats aren’t much different from Republicans. They both belong to the same Progressive Party.\nsounds like this one needs to be audited. Bet your claims are fraudulent\nYou can’t fire (without cause) over 1000 dedicated VA caregivers then pretend you actually give a dam about our health care or convince us that you won’t also come after our disability benefits so greedy never-served billionaires (like Musk) can shove even more billions into their pockets. Trump may hate us “suckers and losers” veterans because (being a pathetic coward) he ain’t us. But WE will outlast him!!\nMr. Secretary,\nSince there gas been a staffing shortage of doctors, nurses, and support staff. Why did you layoff 1000 workers? For transparency “Why are you afraid of Donald Trump? As for Elon and his SpaceX techs. No I highly disapprove of non- or improperly vetted civilians that has no clue whatsoever they are doing to have access to my records or any VA records. To be honest you, Trump, Elon, and Republicans in general are an embarrassment to this country. Elon is from South Africa and not from the US. Having access to all these records and making decisions hurting America’s workers.\nI hope they do away with this glorified welfare system. Unless your disability is LOD you shouldn’t get any. This could save the govt billions. I hope they take a hard look at this.\nwe HAVE to Make America Great Again. There will be pain for sime but I totally support the cuts. there us so much waste and fraud and faking. billions and billions\nHello, my name is Alfonso Perez. A Disabled Combat Veteran in South Texas. Since 2010 I have submitted documents in support of a claim. I was in combat as an Infantryman during the Gulf War. When I was discharged, a clerical error did not show my medals that I deserve and served for. Mainly, my Combat Infantry Badge. This is important to me. I can pass this on to my kids and grandchildren. Showing that I served my Country. For years, I have been fighting the US Army Vital Records Department and Board of Appeals. I have emailed and talked to several offices and departments, hoping to get help in this matter. Mr Collins is the only person that can help me at this point. I also been fighting the VA over my failing and declining health. I have pictures and my statement where I was exposed to the burning oil wells and burning material that we were tasked to do. I have been complaining of shortness of breath, bone and muscle pain from day one. When I filed a disability claim in 2007. Although I am 100% disabled due to combat, I suffer from several illnesses. The VA has helped me in getting an electric wheelchair and a lift for my home. I am bed ridden 90% of the time. My wife has been caring for me the past 3 years. This is when my health has worsened. I applied for the caregiver program, and have been denied several times. There’s been time I want to give up. But my wife motivates me to keep going. PS I also believe my injuries and illnesses should be awarded a Purple Heart. As it was a tactic used by the enemy. God Bless and Thank you!! Alfonso Perez (Mission,Texas) 18th Airborne Division/24th Infantry Division Aco 3rd/7th Ft Stewart Georgia\nBrother, your wife sounds like a saint. I had luck getting my dd214 updated through military awards section of manpower.\nI feel you brother! I did ask about the Purple Heart as well. NBC warfare was used against us on multiple occasions, M8 alarms, Khamisiyah bunker filled with sarin gas. I too, believe we deserve a Purple Heart. Your CIB should be easy to prove with your DD-214 showing your time in Desert Storm and your MOS. Send a copy to HRC to get it fixed. Oh yeah, file for Aid and Attendance instead of the caregiver program.\nGood Luck.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin’s , I was so happy to hear that you are now the New Secretary of the Va. Cherry Point Base had referred me to the VA in New Bern, NC. after seeing 5 Jag Attorneys at Cherry Point Base with President Trump placing my case Under Major Domestic Violence April 2018. Congressman Murphy office in Greenville stated they would be glad to help when I had a claim . Sir I do have a claim that Honorable Senator Dole, Craven county DSS had assisted with in 2008 with Winston Salem VA. I understand that you are a chaplain. Sir this situation is not God, it’s evil. Thirty years of the quality of my life and family is completely destroyed. The course of our lives have been changed unnaturally. Since President Trump had taken office I have had to notify the President. The only assurance that I have received is from Craven Community College, very little assistance from DSS , and one of the families from the college assisting with one of their familiy members temporarily, with staying with a elderly. I have also contacted Randy Forbes law office in Washington DC Greenberg Traugrig as they taken my consideration rights, civil rights, liberty rights, fundamental rights, with them not honoring the rule of law. I would definitely appreciate any assistance that would be given as they have me trapped financially. Thank you\nWe have no proof whatsoever that an unvetted non-federal employee working under the fake federal entity DOGE that was not even Congressionally created (as lawfully required)…has not illegally accessed our super sensitive military Veteran medical records, disability records and personal information contacting our SSN #s, birth dates, address, phone numbers, etc. I do not believe anyone hired by the current president, a convicted felon.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting . My feelings exactly! Where is the accountability?\nhave you ever been to the DMV????\nPlease – you are assuming that any other federal employee is honest and good. What we do know if our country is in deep financial trouble and DOGE has the smartest people on it to comb through waste, fraud and abuse to save our taxpayer money. So quit whining and realize how licky we are to have these 2 great men working feverishly to save America. They are plenty rich enough – they do not have to do it but they must for our kids. By the way, 58% of Americans approve of Trump and Elon’s DOGE. DOGE employees are employed by the federal government as hired by Trump/Elon.\nThis…right here. Absolutely.\nWe need to have our Vr@e. Benefits expedited.\nVeterans have to wait for 5-7 months for any sort of vocational rehabilitation. The offices of Greenville SC are completely closed and when I went in person to the physical office, there is a schedule sign and a government vehicle. The department of the Veterans affairs educational benefits needs and our health care benefits are slow and veterans are dying waiting for the proper care!\nPlease work with Doug Collins together so we can fix Greenville SC. CBOC and build another hospital for veteran in the Upstate south Carolina!!\nChatGPT said:\nCertainly! Here’s a revised version of your message with a clear and professional tone:\nSubject: Urgent Request for Expedited VR&E Benefits and Improved Veteran Services in Greenville, SC\nDear [Recipient’s Name],\nI am writing to bring urgent attention to the current state of Veterans’ services in Greenville, SC. Veterans in our community are facing excessive delays in accessing Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) benefits, with wait times of 5-7 months. This situation is unacceptable, as it severely impacts veterans’ ability to transition to civilian life and gain meaningful employment.\nIn addition, the Greenville SC offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are completely closed, leaving many veterans without support. During a recent visit to the physical office, I noticed a schedule sign and a government vehicle, but no available staff to assist. This lack of accessibility is only furthering the frustration of our local veterans.\nOur veterans are also facing delays in receiving educational and healthcare benefits, leading to serious concerns about their well-being. Tragically, some veterans are dying while waiting for the care they rightfully deserve. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.\nI urge you to collaborate with Congressman Doug Collins to address these issues and expedite the process for VR&E benefits. Additionally, I implore you to work towards establishing a new VA hospital in the Upstate of South Carolina to better serve the needs of our veteran population, particularly those in Greenville.\nThe time to act is now, and I trust you will prioritize the health and well-being of those who have served our country. Our veterans deserve better.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter. I look forward to your prompt response and action.\nYou Have 2 Senators And A Rep. Collectively they Will Be More Than Happy To Expedite All Concerns. Lindsey Graham/Tim Scott/Nancy Mace. They Are Dedicated In Helping Veterans Of All Military Campaigns. The Above Individuals Are Dedicated to Transparency. Good Luck!\ni think it wonderful that the military has decided to consider to right some of the wrong judgments unfair decisions handed down,most vetrans didnt join the military to fail or qut to get thrown out, , we sighn up in all honesty to succeed , for life careers , to lead productive lives , some unfortunate veterans may have fell short in some of there endeavors and encounters during there service , or for various other reasons , weather you couldnt get along with your higher ups, because of biases ,racism , mentel illnesses ignored ,harrassment/ mst ,ptsd, fraternizing , seen and judged by one person veterans not being given the chance to redeem or get medical help in some instances counseling, instead of just being thrown out most veterans dont want to leave fail go home failures ,the process were flawed mental health wasnt recognized., ptsd wasnt recognized untill 1980 , many veterans suffered mentaly it was ignored or went unnoticed there were no proccessin place ,this is not a hand out,, it is a hand up, to our fallen misfortunate stigmatize hidden wounded soliders ,there were discrepancies ,prejudices inconsistencies in the discharge process, so i think it was over do. good luck to those veterans who suffered for years carrying this hidden wound, being look down on frown upon, rejected, not able to get jobs, ,because of differences between two people from different backgrounds cultures etc , because of mentel conditions at the time of said events or a behavior sustained from trama ptsd mst ,harrassment, fraternization,\nAs a wife of a Veteran and I feel to just vent my feelings here. I wished that if my husband’s PSA level was thoroughly examined and monitored closely like yearly mandatory check up for males I believe that He would not start His Chemotherapy tomorrow, 2/18/25.\nIt was 7-1/2 years laps His VA doctor didn’t check his prostate until His PSA level became very high and cancer cells was present that ended him getting Prostatectomy surgery. My husband had several infusions, injections and oral meds but the cancer had metastasized to his bones. Now Chemotherapy is needed to hopefully stop the spread to his organs. I hope that this comment helps improve the dignity of patient care in our Virginia Veterans. I believed that negligence of care is present in my husband’s care. I’m very sad to see Him undergo many treatments.\nI thank You for allowing me to share. God Bless.\nFile a TORT CLAIM against the VA for negligence. It is not hard to do. Gather your evidence and submit your form.\nGood Luck\nI’m very sorry to read of your plight. For any veteran men here, just do what I did – doesnt cost a ton of money – go to Quest labs and pay for your own “PSA blood test” and if the result is oitnof range get that to your doctor and that will start the action going for diagnosis. Too many wait around or trust in the gloved finger test. Just pay for your own psa blood test. I did and thank God we caught my husband’s PSA was very high. That triggered a prostate biopsy which was a gleason score showing aggressive type, so then a staging nuclear medicine bine scan and visit to surgeon at City of Hope for robotic removal. And get this – the doctor at that initial medical annual physical was not going to give him anything because he looked so good and healthy and strong. But I was the one who pushed to write to get the blood test (more accurate than digital rectum exam). My hunch was because he was not having good solid urine streams – yes I heard a change in his urine stream “habits”.\nMay God bless your husband and you. I wish him the best. I too got Prostate cancer, possibly from Agent Orange exposure but who knows. I’m lucky it was caught early, treated with radiation/hormone therapy and is in remission. Even though I have a primary care doctor at my local VA Clinic, my civilian Urologist called out the cancer diagnosis early with my sudden high PSA level. Take care brother.\nI’m sad to say I really no longer trust the VA Administrations. No issues with the doctors, nurse at the facilities but the senior leadership.\nOnce again the senior leadership within the VA will need to earn my trust. Zero trust in DOGE\nDOGE found hundreds ( if not more by now) of upper level case managers working from home, using personal computers ( not DOD secure) to access VA account information and sensitive information… Along with the lack of security measures by these admins they were only working a few hours a week while still taking a full salary….\nCriminals running VAMC Caregiver authorization . If you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a. Problem..\nDOGE it out of Existance. Criminals that never approve a single Veteran for caregiver help. Absolutely anti-american, against Veterans that need caregivers that are blind, and have all the problems with activities of daily living..\nCall me\n1SG Combat Vet, Caregiver\nThe VAMC Caregiver program is criminal lengthy weights, obscenely long interviews just to say no.\nThey need the doge now and eradicate its staff completely. I help take care of Veterans. It is a salmon and swim upstream and you know what happens..\nThe rule is if you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a problem\nVA should loan on tiny Homes for Veterans on wheels. There are too many veterans that are homeless, and never could afford a five or $600,000 mortgage, but they may be able to afford $125,000 government sponsored Tiny home on wheels with their service connection.\nI was rated at 100% disabled (service connected) back in 2012 before I was discharged from the military. I had a major depressive episode due to bipolar disorder and TBI with mood disorder. Not to mention that my career was done due to my 2 lower back surgeries and 1 cervical surgery that led to a prosthetic disc and fusion in my neck. Dealing with the constant pain and the plethora of consistent changing medications, I had a suicide attempt that led to me smoking some pot. The Army violated Army Regulations and Command Policy as well as some other nefarious acts that led to me being taken to a special court martial to adjudicate a BCD as well as threatening me with 4 years in a military prison. Having a wife and two children, a home that we had bought, and watch many other soldiers get wrongfully disciplined by command and getting unfavorable discharges, I opted to take a chapter 10 in lieu of the court-martial. I found out later on after having the chance to actually look at my records, I found many mistakes and other discrepancies in my discharge that I can say with the utmost conviction, my discharge was wrongful. My DD214 is so messed up it will take forever just to fix that one document alone. After my exiting service with two terms of service, the first term of 3 years 4 and a half months under honorable conditions and a second term that was 3 years 2 months of service cut short and getting a characterization of OTH, I went to the VA 3 days after my discharge. I wanted to find out if I had any entitlement to benefits at all. I was told by the VA that I was entitled to no benefits at all. Not even unemployment. I went back to the VA in 2015 in another state, which was my home of record and found out that I could get medical benefits for any injuries or conditions being treated for while in service. In 2018 I entered the DOM to stop drinking and tried to apply for my GIBill. The college I was wanting to attend told me that I didn’t have any GIBill benefits because of my OTH discharge. In 2021 I found out that I did have my GIBill benefits through another education institution. However the VA wants to short me 10% of my GIBill benefit. I did a patient inquiry into my VA records in 2022 and could not believe what I found. The VA has me showing that I have no service connected disabilities and that I have had no surgeries what so ever. I started going through my medical records from my disability claim while in the service and am appalled by what I am finding. The incorrect information, the false statements by physicians, the refusal to use my tri-care paid off post mental health providers diagnosis that the VA at the time was treating me for, the policy violations from Army Regulations and Command Policy on soldiers that are in the MEB/PEB process and the VA IDES process, finding out that MEB/PEB and VA disability determinations were purposefully withheld from the General Court Martial Convening Authority when the disability processes were completed and before my court martial was even read to me. These disability finding are supposed to be taken into consideration when a soldier is taken to a court-martial not to mention that I had a daughter that was enrolled in the exceptional family member program for autism. The program I was in was a Joint DoD and VA program while going through the evaluation process. I have contacted the VA and DoD and they both wanna play “pass the buck” and not take responsibility for the indiscretions they have both committed. Let’s also add that during the time of my evaluations the Unit I was assigned to “a pilot program” was being investigated for multiple issues. I have ran into more issues for trying to do the right thing and point out these issues through my own personal experience as well as documentation that proves what indiscretions had been done against these soldiers. I have solid evidence of it and I can’t get a soul to look at it. I have been played so many times by my health care providers when they tell me to bring in any documents that I want put into my health records. I bring them in and no one looks at them. They had me believing that they didn’t have any record of my medical history from the Army. Then I find out that they can pull them up at any time. Why would they stress me out like that? I called the main VA in DC to get transfered 4 times, the person I spoke with told me they have no record of my claim filed back in 2011 or my ratings in 2012. I find that odd when I have all of my records to include the original claim filed in 2011 that is date stamped received by the VA in Winston – Salem plus the entire packet filed with the MEB/PEB and VA DES including my NARSUM, QTC exam reports, and MEB/PEB and VA Findings and Ratings, a signed DA199 that shows my paperwork was withheld by the signature date alone. Can we say, “denied due process” and “railroading”?\nDaniel are you living my life. I was Deserted by my command in March 1991 as other unit members witnessed this. Then it all got turned on me and mysteriously all the unit records vanish. Then comes the ol Chapter 10 OTH I would have been better off at Court Martial. I was straight out denied records by the DOD until I got my Congress rep involved in 2006, but they even have him the ol bait n switch move cause the records he got were nothing more than fire starter. Imagine my surprise in 2023 when yet again I request my Congress rep to get records and I think somebody made a boo boo for the first time in 33 years I learned the name of my accuser. Your not alone brother Chapter 10 OTH is no where remotely close to the bulls eye of Justice and that practice needs to cease immediately. any one that is facing these issues we are stronger together than apart hit my email so we can ban together and demand answers and change in this new Golden Age!\nAre more judges going to be appointed for the Camp Lejeune Claims and lawsuits which are at 450,000 and it has been two half years?\nThe 35 year time frame is it a law ? If so who ? Can you please reply or email me.\nOnce again Thank you for your time.\nGold Star Wife\nPlease don’t take my doctor away. Dr. Douglas Jones, VA hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. He is the best doctor I’ve ever had. I don’t know what I would do without him.\nThank you standing up for us vet\nNaw, only a few of them. Don’t forget there are also minority Vets who won’t get anything and will have to fight for the same rights as their fellow Vets.\nI have a concern for housing right now I’m pre-planning for move out and I urrentlg reside in the south bay area and would like to move to treasure Island I hear there are housing opportunities slved there and I wanna make sure I get placed where I wish to live. Any help answerijg this question would be greatly appreciated\nSir\nNobody notified to me to get tested ever after Desert Storm and now all these years later I find out I am sick from it. My driver has been 100% disabled for YEARS but now I am filing and have to fight tooth and nail for my family. I don’t have a positive outlook so I am filing more for\ntheir future. I have been sick for years and you need to do better notifying us before it’s to late like now. My health is in shambles and now I have to battle on my claim!!! I can’t believe this really was done to vets who would do it again for their country.\nCollins, you’re a liar like the rest of them. We don’t trust you. And all the overreach of DOGE that you’re allowing to happen? You’re a freaking disgrace. You must really think we’re stupid. You record a video with your cheery southern twang thinking you will win us over? You won’t. We aren’t sheep.\nOnce you were sick you should’ve started seeking treatment and follow up care. You waited until the PACT ACT was available for the bells to go off in your head. Like most GW Veterans we were sick almost immediately upon return. We noticed the changes and sought care only for Dr’s to tell us we were crazy and it was in our heads. It’s not too late for you as every condition is presumptive by providing your DD-214 showing your service in theater. It’s helpful to have those diagnoses’ but not required. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, IBS are all presumptive.\nSo why are you cutting doctors and nurse who are on probation? It is hard enough to get this group to apply for jobs in the VA. I am very concerned about the state of the VA for our veterans. I am a retired VA nurse who loved caring for Veterans. My late husband USMC/VN died in 2004 due to Agent Orange exposure: non Hoskins lymphoma. It seems that the current administration in DC is not listening to the “boots on the ground “ employees, those nurses and doctors and health techs who care daily for our veterans. The VA is not a business: it involves real people : who put their lives on the line for our country.\nI hope veterans will wake up to see how the VA has been privatized for decades. —with decreasing benefits. And that Congress for the 7th year will NOT cosponsor and pass a Dental bill (HR 210) for all veterans in the VA healthcare system. I am told “too expensive”. Check out who has signed onto this bill.\nDealing with a doctor that lost job because of the morphine he was writing, he left me no choice but to quit myself. I ordered CBD off Amazon & failed urinalysis from taking supplements. That was 2013 roughly? VA will not pay for pain medication because I’ve since got my Medical Cannabis Card & get in prescription. The VA hasn’t paid for my medication since I quit the morphine the doctor prescribed (180mg 4times a day) . If I hadn’t thrown away I would not be here. Was up to 370lbs. Please look into why Veterans get punished for pain medication because of the THC? The first thing I did joining the Navy was I had to get a waiver for using in high school for the government. My mother said always be honest & here’s a good reason why? I like a pain patch but it costs 90$ a month. Paying for my own medication has hurt me, also recovering from Storm. Being punished for CBD is outdated & another reason for the VA to say no? Would like to help other Vets as well. Very Respectfully Sir thank you\nPlease check on why the higher V.A higher up Admin used the Pact Act funds for a raise 10.9 million? Marsha Blackburn V.A.Admin website. Why are there only four judges overseeing the Pact Act claims lawsuit 450,000? Who made the ruling 35 year time frame when it was 1953-1980.Thank you so much for your time\nMusk would love to know about the 10.9 million..\nHow can we trust anyone appointed by Trump and his co-president Musk. There is no truth anymore. I doubt any of our data is safe.\nMany veterans who have injuries caused by their military service should be taken care of. From slipped discs to the most severe in which they lost limbs. Its the honorable thing to do. I don’t understand how non-veterans who dont risk their lives can even ask to take away any benefits from veterans. The way I see it…send those kinds of people into combat or have them unload heavy equipment all day year round which eventually breaks down their body. Once they have their injuries..I bet they dont want to be abandoned. Its not even just physical pain… as the years go by… veterans get so freaking angry their pain is non-stop and they can’t do what others can do. Get jealous of injury free people older then them jumping around. Can’t even stand without freaking muscle spasms/cramps or annoying headaches. And it gets worse as you get older. Filled with nothing but regret.\nSecretary Collins, first and foremost, congratulations on your appointment. I was hoping to send you an email, but that seems impossible. Not sure if this will reach you, but hopefully it is relay to the leadership team associated with the VA facility. I am a retired veteran, USMC. Looking through these posts, there definitely is some bellyaching, I am sure some is warranted. I just want you to know on how employees at the White River Junction VA in VT, go above and beyond. I had an appointment on Wednesday at occupational therapy, I also was scheduled the following day to get my hearing aids. There was a pretty good snowstorm rolling in the following day, and I knew if it was going to get as bad as predicted, I would not make my appointment. I took a chance and went to audiology and explained my concerns, the staff up front were professional and got an IM to my audiologist. She cut her lunch break short and saw me. Hearing aids issued. Accolades to the professionals at White River Junction VA in Vermont.\nPlease check on why the higher V.A higher up Admin used the Pact Act funds for a raise 10.9 million?

And her job will be eliminated by 2027.?\nGut VHA and give us insurance, community care is trash and the approval process is a nightmare for veterans and the providers who get paid $.27 on the dollar for services. As a provider I wouldn’t want to deal with that crap for a fraction of the pay. Just saying. ?♂️\nDear Mr. Collins,\nMy husband, Clifford Oliver Mealy, is undergoing treatment for service related bladder cancer. He served in the Navy during Vietnam. And applied for his benefits in 2023 after he was diagnosed.\nHe has not been able to work. His business as a photographer has faltered because he is unable to work.\nHe was told that his benefits would come in a year. Now it’s two years and he has yet to receive his promised benefits.\nThen, he received a letter that his benefits have been “deferred.”\nWe cannot get anyone in the VA to tells us what this means.\nNeedless to say, this is very upsetting as his diagnosis has destroyed his business. And we have no idea when this will be resolved.\nThis needs to stop we need all employees who work at VA with these cuts now we are going to wait longer for all dr. appointment, compensation reviews VA was already short hand now it’s even more if you want to make cuts look at the contract that the goverment has with vendors, look at Elon Musk and how many contract he has with the goverment and how much he made off the goverment.\nMental health “professionals” are just treating Veterans with legitimate issues with very little concern. They rush Veterans through these unhelpful programs rather than addressing the actual problems to fill their books. I would like to see a change where they take quality over quantity.\nTaking anything away from veterans is shameful especially when the military budget is so large. Cut that in half and give it to the veterans! We are being told that people working on the veterans crises line were laid off! You are lying to us Collins! During Trump’s last presidency he was found to have lied more than 35,000 times! Each lie has been documented. Stop believing what he says! There are people working the crises lines at the VA and they are saying that they were fired. I think I will believe them before I believe you or Trump. You don’ care about the veterans. Neither does Trump. I wonder how much he is paying you to misrepresent the truth.\n“The Trump administration is right now firing researchers at VA who do lifesaving work for our veterans—research to prevent veteran suicide, build lifechanging prosthetics, address opioid addiction, and more.\nLoved this! Straight forward right on target!\n… and have enough respect for the dignity of the office to put on a blazer!\nJane, get a life!!!\nPlease focus on Fraud Waste and Abuse. I guarantee there is tons of money spent on veterans who have passed away who are still being sent disability compensation.\nI’m a huge supporter of Pres. Trump, and I’ve been generally pleased with his agency/dept picks. However, in response to a veteran friend’s concerns about “cuts to veterans’ services and benefits,” I pulled up Sec. Collins’ video above, and I was wholly unimpressed and underwhelmed by the Secretary’s drive-by remarks and his folksy, gee whiz attitude. It struck me as arrogant (“I’m so smart I don’t need preparation”) and lazy, too lazy not to have developed SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIVE rebuttals to the left’s SPECIFIC allegations.\nMore directly: Mr. Secretary, Pres. Trump has given you this incredible honor and entrusted you with this grave responsibility to lead this august Department in serving our treasured veterans, women and men to whom we owe the highest debt to provide them and their families/caregivers the very highest quality healthcare and service. Lack of preparation and lack of seriousness is disrespectful and is not going to cut it! It might be fine to “wing it” or “phone it in” as a commentator on a news show, but it’s not appropriate for this position! Going forward, if you don’t actually KNOW the specific allegations leveled against the Department, then be smart enough to have your deputies brief you first. Then PREPARE your remarks WITH SPECIFICITY, before you go on camera. Your response was not only vapid, it was embarrassing. I was therefore forced to go elsewhere to address my veteran friend’s very real concerns, to which she was entitled to receive a responsive, quality, SUBSTANTIVE answer. Until your staff can bring you up to speed, here’s a simple response you could have given (though we should be able to expect far more from you, since you head the Department – you should be the resident EXPERT on all things V.A.!):\nhttps://youtu.be/1K9X4lHIFgE?si=z1Q-yC-7ctgUCaJx\nPlease relay all of my remarks to the Secretary.\n“At VA, we are focused on saving money so it can be better spent on Veteran care. We thank these employees for their service to VA. This was a tough decision, but ultimately it’s the right call to better support the Veterans, families, caregivers, and survivors the department exists to serve,” Doug Collins.\nAn Oxymoron statement to say the least…you’re a used car salesman (no offense meant to used car salesman) you will say anything to accomplish your ultimate objective just like your Commander and Chief ( Project 2025 ) Zero hope for a fair and impartial government and VA. And by the way cutting Veterans from their jobs is truly heartless. Dick move Doug! Why not start with the 10 million in bonuses for the upper echelon in the VA. I wonder!\nThe buck stops at Trump, he chose this guy. He should be held accountable for his poor choice. He also chose the OMB head, who is the real threat to Veteran’s benefits.\nI have one word. BULLSH-T\ngulf war veterans need a reform act in 2025/2026.\nis there feed back ?\nWe are in need of help from the top\nThere is a “Scam” on the disability claims on the veterans. I have been fighting it for over a year and a half with minimal outcome. My local VA veteran advocate is a Star, but the data input center in Janesville Wisconson is a constant “let down”. The failure is the VA hand-off to private 3rd parties for the “confirmation appointments.\nI’d be glad to share the details with a real Military Veteran in Secretary Collins office if someone can contact me …\nCollins is full of it and services will fall significantly. Our government leaders are liars, who maintain control by continual misrepresentation. Too bad the many believe others because of their own inability to control themselves. Do not expect anything from our government because it has become self evident that those leaders can only enrich themselves by screwing those they supposedly represent\nLies lies lies. People have never waited longer for their benefits to be approved, you won’t give them the services they need or medications, and make disabled people drive for hours to see a doctor that can’t do their job because of your policies. You should be ashamed to stand there and lie like that you monster\nSounds like someone with a Bad Chicken Dinner, eh?\nDishonorable discharges get nothing from American taxpayers.\nTrump administration begins mass firings across government\nFri, February 14, 2025 at 9:28 PM CST\n“more than 1,000 at the Department of Veterans Affairs,”\nHow does firing 1,000’s of people at the VA help improve services to us?\nConcerned with taxing VA disability that was proposed in Dec 2024 – this would greatly impact many disabled vets and their families. Spouses who get CHAMPVA due to their vet spouse having P&T 100% disability should be able to use the VA facilities. Meds by Mail under CHAMPVA take close to 3 weeks to fill prescriptions.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collins, Thank you for your service. I personally have had a hard time receiving assistance after going through major domestic violence with one of your Marines. Honorable President Trump with his administration April 2018 placed my case under Major Domestic Violence. Cherry Point Base referred me to the VA in New Bern a few years ago. Congressman Murphy office stated they would be glad to help when I have a VA claim. I do Sir that Honorable Senator Elizabeth Dole and the Department of Social Services assisted me with in 2008. They have a copy of my claim, yet nothing. I have lost my dad as a United States World War Two veteran, my mom, two Aunts and I was told I would never see my brother a live. They took many years of special occasions and holidays away from me. They changed the course of my life and family unnaturally. One of the biggest problems is they have my domestic violence money and compounding it and spending it their project with making thousands off myself and family every day. They continue to give my husband federal money and benefits after the Trump administration placed my case under major domestic violence. NC is a 50/50 state with out domestic violence issues. Major discrimination. I have been in and out of homelessness while owning property which there was a mistake on. They have taken away my constitutional rights, liberty rights, civil rights, fundamental rights and denied me attorney. I have contacted Randy Forbes with Green Traurig in Washington DC with notifying President Trump, With the United States Supreme Court as they continue to take my life and family for money. The only assistance that I have been receiving is from Craven Community College, while attending, DSS, and a family from the college to assist in care giving to one of their families. I have been staying with a elder for the last few months. Sir I have requested mercy and grace from President Trump as this has cost a total of 30 years of the quality of my life and family. A few years ago I had spoken to Diane from Winston Salem VA as they do know that this was major domestic violence with one of their marines. Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin I am requesting mercy and grace from the VA to have closure on my case. Thank you.\nI deal with the VA in Hampton I get my medication‘s by Mail from Hampton my doctor is in Hampton Dr. Chip route and I don’t have no issues with the VA I get 100% disability from the VA for ancient Orange Vietnam and now I got chronic bronchitis That I filed another claim for but when I get my medication I got all this paperwork with the medication‘s which I don’t think they need I always throw it in the garbage I think they should go paperless when they’re sending your medication’s to you just about every veteran knows what their Vedic medications are for I think they should cut back on the paperwork that goes in the mail that ends up in the garbage it’s costing the money to print it cost the money to buy the paper for packaging all the paperwork is in the package when you get it with your pills good luck to all veterans and the va .vetnam vet\nAbsolutely true! The reams of paper sent to me (with my name and address on every page) is completely unnecessary. Maybe only when the medication is first prescribed and perhaps once a year at renewal would suffice? As it is now, the bill for paper alone in the Pharmacy must be a big hit on the overall budget.\nYa’ll believe this if you want. Musk is running it all and is making millions a day on government contracts. They don’t care about vets or anyone that’s not elite. It’s all part of Project 2025 and put it out there. Ya’ll done F around And Found Out. People want to blame Trump, but he’s so far deep in, clueless and he’s lost control and only doing what’s he being told.\nThankyou for taking care of the Veterans.I am Vietnam Veteran.I was over there from earley 1968 to 1970.I had two tours with the 39th cav.The VA has been very good to me and still are.Thankyou very much for all the help they have given me.\nI don’t believe a word from you or the Traitor and his clowns.\nSo…you were pleased with the dementia patient in the Oval Office the past 4 years?\nDonald J. Trump and JD Vance are patriots.\nSo many on disability that musk or Trump don’t care about am afraid\nNeither served\nTru\nO called the dead losers and suckers\nBought his deferment from the draft. Bone spurs. Don’t let them hurt the veterans that suffer.\nToo bad the VA doesn’t treat TDS. Because you got it bad! Get help before you stroke out.\nWe need a New Greenville Clinic here in South Carolina in. There no Staff, No warm AC, NO cafeteria, not enough services. and Our Veteran cannot find any VR@E services available! the Negligence is above and beyond! The chief of staff and Medical Director of Columbia need to be replaced as of yesterday!!\nThank you for the update. We need to do something about the rating system for service connection. I’m currently rated at 70% for PTSD, 50% for my feet, 30% for my lung (gulf war veteran), 10% for hearing, and 10% for my back that I have had 3 surgeries on and will need another one within the year. This is crazy!!! I’m rated at 90% rather then 100% and only 10% for my back!!! I can barely walked and stand not able to work anymore but I’m 90% that has taken since 2011 to get this rating!!! We need to fix this!!! ASAP\nFile for your presumptive condition. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue and IBS. ASAP!\nWe the Veterans love to have a 9/11 post Veteran running this Gigantic Trojan Horse and making sure, he can Taim it well. the Horse has been acting while for many years and is time that our sheriff in town. keeps it well behaved!!\nThis is not true. Collins isn’t be honest. I have several friends that are Veteran Service Officer’s have been FIRED.\nMr. Collins,\nCan you please get rid of the mandate to take the COVID-19 (so called vaccine) and the flu shots as a VA healthcare worker. My family was mandated to take it and now have permanent side effects. This should be a personal decision not mandated by employers, or government agencies.\nNoone is required to take C19 anymore.\nYou are being a lying drama queen. It was never mandated in the first place.\nGood to see a real leader that has been where many of us have been,\nthanks for taking the rein’s Sir\nClearing cases quicker? I had a claim in since 6/2024 to add a dependent and it has been in step 1 of the process for 8 months. I checked the status today and the VA website says I now have no claims. I called the VA and they told me the VA closed the claim. No action taken! The VA rep had no clue as to why they would close it. This is adding a dependent back on. This should not be a difficult request and it certainly shouldn’t take 8 months then have your claim closed with no action taken.\nSame here since July 25, 2024. The claim is stuck in the “claim received “ stage. I’ve emailed AskVA several times and keep getting the same response about they identified a problem in their program and they are working on it as quickly as possible, blah, blah, blah.\nThe VA claims process is a joke at best! As far as firings go, I only have issues with the half illiterate DEI employees behind the office counters. They need to go and be replaced with competent employees who stay off of their personal phones and stop their personal conversations when someone is trying to check in/out, ask a question, etc. There was an incident at the VAMC that I go to where they were behind the sliding glass having story time. A Vet walked up, the girl at the counter turned around, saw him standing there, and then turned back around and continued story time. The Vet slid the glass window open and the girl went off on him in front of everyone. It did not end well for either. She got snatched through the window opening and he was detained by the VA rent-a-cops. I don’t know how much trouble he got into, but hopefully she learned that some Vets are easily triggered and you don’t talk to us like we’re off the streets.\nI’m just happy I can put names to faces.\nWe need a roundtable discussion about national issues related to our service connected disability’s. The VA staff and Doctors are not listening and we need a special exemption for presumption rules that are lacking from the Gulf War 1990/1991 War Zone. We should be treated the same way the OiF /OEF are getting. 1991 War Veterans are not getting the treatments they deserve. We need National Attention on this matter. The law needs to change post 1990 Veterans.\nAs the parent of a veteran who was wounded in battle, not given medical attention and then operated on because he had a growth coming out of the side of his head where he had been impacted and they “couldn’t send him back with that” and then had to wait until 2017 to receive full benefits, I don’t understand. I have within the last 8 months applied for his medical records again from NARA. They referred me to the Army and the Army has not responded to my request to have my son put on a Casualty list and be given the Purple Heart which he bled for. Please let me know who I can contact to get this processed and also get a car which a paraplegic can drive (applied on 3/2024). Also have the home modified, and his benefits listed as 100% service-connected instead of 90% 10% unemployability. This happened in 1/1991. Please help to resolve.\nContact Wounded Warrior Project.\nGood morning Doctor Bonafoux Rivera, I want to express my gratitude and respect for your courage and commitment to help your son. This forum here will not be able to resolve this issue. You may need to contact your local VBA or VHA and work with a patient advocate or a veteran organization like the legion or DVA. If you must you can also reach out to the congressman or senators from your state as they may be able to put assistance on this issue. I wish your son and the family health and strength, please stay focused and do not give up. The nation and all other veterans are with you.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nMr. Secretary, Pres.Trump & etc..Its hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThey were used eveyday in all base camps. Stiring everything they could burn in these pits, by our hands\nusing wooden poles and no mask or breathing , no eye protection, no hearing protection, no protective clothing you name it.\nAll done by the lowest ranking personnel.\nSo the VN vets file claims for Asthma, skin cancers and etc… all denied !\nSo what else can they do to us?\nThis is where the military got its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it! Correct the failures of last aministrations who have failed us.\nSecretary Collins and Presdient Trump administration\nThank you\nThe DOD has long maintained that there never was any Agent Orange on Okinawa. This is a lie. It was used to clear foliage along the Kadena AFB perimeter fence. In 1971 the DOD (under pressure from the Japanese Government) conducted “Operation Red Hat” where all poisonous gases and defoliants were transferred to Johnston Atoll aboard naval ships. Those sailors involved are eligible for Agent Orange treatment and compensation. Those Okinawan Marines who loaded these chemicals onto deuce and halvess and delivered them to the dock are not! I developed high level and profuse prostate cancer (classic result of Agent Orange exposure). It had to be removed. The VA wouldn’t cover it because “there was never any Agent Orange on Okinawa. I can deliver proof that there was. In fact, years later there were many barrels of AO found buried at Camp Foster where l was assugned.\nUnder Biden the pact act was passed to help veterans that was impacted from burn pits get your story right\nNot Vietnam burn pits sparky\nThe VA claims that the benefits are improving and the care is improving. When I needed a x-ray on my neck it took 3 months to get a order and by then I already had a ct scan at the hospital which the care wasn’t any better. I ended up going to Vanderbilt emergency surgery to remove a tumor off my spine. VA or any civilian care around where I live is hopeless.\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\n————————————————————-\nThere isnt enough room and they only allow 5,000 words here. So you will find the bulk of my remarks on the VA Facebook post of this article. Im a 28 year advocate, Disabled combat veteran, and served of a VA federal advisory committee – ACGWV in 2009. In 2003 I was world famous for opposing the deployment of troops to Iraq. Last 3 years Ive pummeled this public comments portion of New.va.gov over VA RAC meetings, and found VA ignores these public comment portions.\nIm a subject matter expert with a lot to offer. Im also a historian having participated in our plight since 1997. So Ive learned one thing about VA, unless your part of the wealthy in the executive branch – then they dont care. Ive looked out the Sec of VAs window long ago, and this is my 14th Sec of VA to deal with. As long as Im a poor disabled veteran, Im not worthy of there time. It didnt use to be this way.\nClearing cases faster? Over a year ago, l filed a 511 claim. It took a year to clear when the average clearance time was 14 months. My claim was rejected due to “not service connected”! 511 claims are for injuries sustained in VA hospitals. There is never a service connection in 511 claims!\nI’m fighting an 1151 claim going on 10 years. They are always denied. Then you go into the never ending appeals process. Get help from DAV or another VSO or organization. And keep an eye on them because some of them aren’t competent either.\nVA’s answer to my questions is to block my cell phone internet access to va.gov\nwhich says volumes. Sec of VA Doug Collins signed off on that for it to happen.\nHe has no intentions of helping anyone in my income bracket.\nPretty sure we have another coward Sec of VA that doesnt face veterans unless\nhe benefits from it some how. As Ive only written 4 emails and asked simple\nquestions. I think the biggest reason they are dodging me is I found there maybe\na 1 in 5 rate of ALS in those that served the last 34 years. At minimum 1 in 10.\nWell, Ive got my answer then. Snob Sec of VA. Religious zealot with a superiority\ncomplex. He is one of the chosen, and I am not. Seen enough of these. Its gods will\nmy life has been like this, and some of us are just unlucky. He only has time for\nhis fellow followers, believers, and the rest of us are wrong.\nGoing to be a very bad year for us veterans. Till folks catch on.\nI have been assigned a new VA clinic that recently opened. I have a new Doctor. How is the order to fire all new federal employees going to affect my new clinic and my Doctor? I have been exposed to Agent Orange and currently have a mass in my lung and also in my throat. I am scheduled for surgery in May, is that still going to happen? I put in a claim for my agent orange exposure, is that still going to be processed? When you say your clearing cases faster than ever, is that because your just saying NO quickly? What percentage of claims are you denying? The scuttlebutt is that all new claims will be denied. This stuff is giving me a lot of anxiety.\nThank you Mr. Collins. Not to shabby for your first week!\nAs a Government employee for 40 years (NAVY-VA combined), I see there is nothing easy or quick about applying for benefits. I have given up on reopening claims. I can relate to some of these comments.\nKeep the faith!\nMadam Collins,\nThank you for denying these allegations and simply telling us lies. The truth would be unbearable and make the administration look bad. Please refrain from telling the truth if it makes you look bad. Continue to lie to us and we will believe you as long as your lies are what we want to hear.\nMadam Collins? What are you, 10 yrs old. Grow up and act like a Veteran who served Honorably, but my guess is that you probably didn’t.\nHe’s probably from ME and has been writing to Susan Collins. Cut and paste. Your reply indicates more about your own values than his. You should be ashamed not him or her.\nYou know darn well he meant Secretary of VA Collins. You should be ashamed that your momma gave birth to you.\nHello Mr. Collins. If you want to see what is really going on in the VA that are supposed to be knowledgeable veteran raters, please sir contact me and I will give you the details to look at my case. I have called my congressman, called my senator, call the complaint line twice and my claim is a hardship claim, Going on eleven months and been to 16 C&P exams. I have done everything that I can think of. I know this comment won’t reach your eyes but you have staff that hates veterans. The more they can give you the run around and not rate your claim, the better the must feel about themselves. The VA is violating their own regulations and I will be happy to provide rules they set about medical evidence and exams. Everytime I complain too loud, they has VES set me up more appointments. Then they lie to you when you can see your file and have screen shots to prove they are not being honest. USMC 3/1972 – 11/1974\nDOGE has absolutely NO authority to access veteran’s personal information. It is NOT a legitimate organization and therefore needs to be blocked.\nI personally trust a multi Billionaire, more than the past dozen supposed leaders, we all need to face it our info is already out there , as many time as we have had medical record swappers, the streamlining of our services, out info has been jeopardized decades ago, let them find and let us all know what our tax dollars have been blown away on, when we had people in charge who didn’t even know which gender they are you were seriously comprised,\nHave faith in the powers that now be.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nspoken like am intelligent person. Good on you. too many here speak without knowing truth.\nWhy on earth would you trust a billionaire that fired the people who were investigating his companies within the first month of being placed in a position? Musk is literally only here for the money that he will earn. He does not care for us nor for any Democracy, hence why he was supporting the far-right parties of European countries.\nWhy would you trust a billionaire who is firing thousands of people so he can save more money on his taxes? Why would you trust a man who is destroying NASA so he can get his personal company more contracts from the government? Think about it for a moment, please. You don’t become a multi-billionaire without deciding money is the most important thing in your entire life, and he is going to sell us all down the river so he can become the world’s first trillionaire.\nI pray that you are not serious. People do not become billionaires because they are honest or trustworthy. If you are willing to toss away your constitutional rights to privacy, that is your choice. Real Americans are not built that way.\nFaith is believing what you know ain’t true. – Mark Twain\nI am posting to question your comment that no benefits are being cut back. I am an 80 year old 100% service connected total and permanent disabled Viet Nam veteran. I am homebound and unable to effectively perform most of the normal activities of daily life. For most of 2024 the VA Community Care Team in Dallas Texas awarded me 58 hours a week of Home Healthcare Aid. This allowed me to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and my quality of life was very good. In August of 2024 my weekly hours were reduced to 11 hours a week and after an appeal this was increased to 13 hours a week. When the time for review and renewal for this benefit arrived in 2025 I was again awarded 13 hours. Any reasonable person can do the math and see thar 13 hours for a 7 day week equals 1.8 hours/day. As most providers require a minimum of 4 hours/day this leaves me with help for three days out of a seven day week. On many occasions when I contacted the VA about this benefit I was told that all of the veterans in this area were being cut back. No reason was given.\nThe VA needs more people, not less. It took me 1 year to get a specialist approval in the Community Care system. They don’t have enough nurses to approve cases. It’s good my issue wasn’t life threatening. Also, cuts to benefits, including disability compensation have been proposed in Project 2025, the conservative playbook that the administration appears to be following.\nDear President Trump,\nI am writing to make you aware of an injustice that has been done to veterans across the country, I left active duty in 1994 after serving 11 years as an active-duty Army officer. I was offered a bonus of $61,201.91 based on time served and my rank. Congress authorized DoD to offer these bonuses so the military could reach Congressionally-mandated force levels without involuntarily dismissals.\nThat bonus, $61,201.91, was taxed by the Internal Revenue Service by 28% ($17,136.53.), leaving my net bonus $44,065.38 which I received May 31, 1994 and my family and I used to put money down on a home and to bridge the gap between the security of a military career and the insecurity of beginning another career, which was the purpose of the bonus.\nWithin a month of leaving the Army, I received a letter from the VA stating that I was authorized 10 percent disability payments of VA Disability Compensation, $87.00 monthly at the time. The same letter told me that I would not receive that amount because I had received a separation bonus and that they would recoup my VADC until they had recouped my bonus amount. 21 years later, in 2015, the VA let me know that they had recouped the net amount of my bonus, $44,065.38 and I started receiving VADC.\nI also continued my military career in the Army Reserve – ultimately qualifying for reserve component retirement which began for me at age 60 (February 15, 2021). The Defense Finance and Accounting Service told me that they were also required to also recoup my 1994 separation bonus, less what the VA recouped.\nDFAS, however made it clear that the law allowed them to recoup the “pre-tax amount,” less what the VA recouped. So DFAS told me that the balance I owed to them was $17,136.53; that’s precisely the amount the IRS withheld in 1994.\nThe first problem is that the law doesn’t really say what DFAS says it says. DFAS interprets the law to benefit the bureaucracy. The language in the law is NOT clear, but instead of giving the benefit of the doubt to the Soldier, they give the benefit of the doubt to the government. The second problem is that DFAS cites laws, rules and policy and they claim that they have no choice but to follow the “rules” but they do not follow the same rules and policies when it requires them to do certain things.\nEssentially, Congress, DoD, DFAS, and the VA played a massive decades-long shell game to move and shift money. Congress gave DoD the money to complete that post-Cold War, 1990s drawdown with the minimum amount of financial pain to the service-person. DoD and the VA then figured out ways to get that money back and use it for other purposes.\nMy bonus has been taxed three times – once in 1994 by 28% ($17,136.53.) a second time by the VA by $44,065.38 and again in 2021 by 28% ($17,136.53) by DFAS. I’ve had to pay back to the government $78,338.44 for a bonus of $61,201.91.\nThat’s a tax rate of 125 percent. DOGE needs to look into this\nI am seeking help on this, not so much for myself, but for other veterans who are in difficult financial situations and who could truly benefit.\nHere is an online petition with more comments\nhttps://www.ipetitions.com/petition/va-recoupment-of-disable-veterans-ssbvsi-payments\nA military retirement represents much more than the dollar figure involved; it represents an acknowledgement of the sacrifice made by the Serviceperson, their family and loved ones. It represents the covenant that Soldiers, Airmen, Marines, and Sailors underwrite, endorse and embrace as free citizens of a great nation. We sign that covenant with our own blood and with the blood of our families who sacrifice in ways that are inexplicable to those unfamiliar with military service. Bureaucratic rules and processes such as the ones I described diminish in tangible and palpable ways the reciprocal feelings of goodwill, devotion, and affection that servicepeople should feel toward their Nation\nIt seems that programs like the Veterans Transportation Network would be prime targets of Musk and the Muskrats.\nVeterans with 100per cent disability get free dental care at VA. Why can’t veterans with 90 per cent disability disability be given the same preference? Can one of our representatives in Washington proposes putting forward a bill before Congress to make this a law.? Many veterans cannot afford private insurance.\nMy husband died because it took a month or longer to set him up with doctors and approve them! After he died VA denied an ambulance bill of $5,000 just because of a 72 hour rule I had never heard of! When my husband was dying and needed an ambulance do you think I would think to contact you? I informed the ambulance service that he was a veteran they should have done something! Another Joe Biden/Kamala Harris F up! That last hospital visit I was finally told after a few trips there and they claimed flu and pneumonia; was actually the last stages of cancer in his lungs and mastesized through his esophagus and other areas and had gone to his liver and kidneys! VA NEEDS a complete overhaul of doctors, administrators and all! It has gone to crap!!!!\nThis crap is Biden Harris doing’s!!!!\nFile a TORT CLAIM. You are right the hospital is supposed to contact the VA. If I’m dying how can I call the VA? I can’t!\nI’m so sorry about your husband! The VA IS totally screwed up but it always has been. I’ve had my own issues with ambulance payments, incorrect diagnoses- repeatedly for different issues and was never as happy as when I aged into Medicare and could avoid the VA most of the time! That said, this has nothing to do with who is President. The VA does it’s own thing under the VA Sec and we have had a whole lot of losers over the last 20 years and before that. And the VA Sec is restrained by the amount of money allocated by Congress. Don’t blame Biden/Harris. They inherited the VA from the past 100+years and they only had a Democratic Congress for 2 years to try and make changes. They did allocate a lot of new money for a lot of programs including the VA. The last 2 years the GOP got nothing done. And now Trump is rolling back all that money, those programs, and making deep cuts of funds and personnel. This post by Sec Collins is a bunch of BS. You wait and see.\nI too, have a Biden/Harris story. I am now a widow. The VA’s failings began long before Trump and Musk. The VA and the DOJ (grant programs)both waste serious money.\nTrump and his administration is pro service member. I have every confidence they will honor the commitment to our veterans. I am a veteran and I am a former VA employee. There are thousands like me who will stand up to anyone who tries to undo the sacred services for our fellow veterans.\nWe know there is stuff that needs to be cut and procurement regulations improved. Perhaps even high paid upper management could need trimming but I hope they retain all the dedicated staff that is high performing and needed and cut only those who aren’t.\nI welcome this opportunity to reevaluate government that so many administrations have failed to do in the past. Let this process play out.\nIt amazes me that you, as a veteran who pledged allegiance to the Constitution, pledge fealty to an unelected billionaire sociopath and sitting, draft-dodging, puppet “president”. All this, despite the literal acts of treason on Jan 6th. The ability to be so committed and vested in sociopaths who do NOT have your best interest in mind and are solely motivated to make themselves richer and more powerful at the American people’s expense is baffling to me.\nMaking the government more efficient and eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse is a fantastic goal.\nWhat this administration is doing is NOT that and if you choose to actually evaluate their actions and consequences, maybe you will understand what is happening to our country.\nNo facts. That is what you offered. You would rather have Biden? Obama? Maybe Clinton. Fraud, waste and abuse must stop. You and I paid for others to defraud the United States and to fund terrorists. So, “and if you choose to actually evaluate their” (Dems) actions and consequences, maybe ytou will understand what is happening to our country”. Surely you do not believe that our country was better with 4 years of previous administration?\nJan of 2024 Biden signed an executive order that authorized the 24/7 surveillance of all American Citizens. That is actually called the most treasonous act of any American president in history. Just saying.\nYou are not a Patriot, this is an untruth at best and more likely a lie. It wasn’t an executive order, it was an extension of the previous bill after it was re-authorized by Congress. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It does NOT surveil ALL US citizens 24/7. I assume you have a reason to be concerned? I don’t.\nPlease do your research before posting incorrect information. In April 2024 President Biden signed a BILL that had bipartisan support (60-34 vote in Senate) EXTENDING a key US surveillance program (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) that was first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since. It targets non-Americans in other countries and communications of Americans in contact with those targeted foreigners. Google it for more truthfuland educational information.\nYes, would prefer any of them over a draft dodging convicted felon.\nAnybody spouting opposition to what Trump and DOGE are doing is simply uninformed. We could not have a better, more supportive leader for this nation and our military and veterans.\nMazel Tov Secretary Doug Collins! Is there a way that us senior Veterans receiving their medications (Not narcotics) can be automatically sent without having to remember to reorder them every month or every other month? Online, mail, phone call to pharmacy, message to the primary physician is sometimes diffucult to remember and sometimes confusing?\nAsk if you can get 90 day supply and If you have an online account, when you receive your medicine go online and check the box to order a refill. According to a technician in the in hospital pharmacy, when the refill is due, it will be mailed out automatically.\nSecVA Anthony J. Principi addressed waste in a 2005 op-ed for WaPo.\nHe outlined changes that could save the government 125 billion dollars without harming veteran quality of care.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/va-isnt-broken-but-its-in-desperate-need-of-change/2018/04/10/54cb1c0c-3c0a-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html\nSo the news media is making all of this story up out of whole cloth?\n“This executive order seeks to impose severe hiring restrictions and would disproportionately harm veterans, who make up one-third of the federal workforce. Requiring agencies to hire only one new employee for every four who leave will drastically reduce VA staffing levels. At a time when the veteran population is aging and the VA’s mission has expanded under Biden, this policy will lead to massive delays and outright denials in health care, benefits processing, and disability claims – the essential services veterans depend on to survive.”\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-and-musk-are-going-to-war-against-military-veterans/ar-AA1yZkRm\nYou obviously have not read the actual order. You must be listening to MSN’s version of the facts, which are very tainted (to Left Wing propaganda). Do not be a sheep. President Trump is doing the right things, and I see nothing that DOGE is doing that will impact veterans negatively. Quite the opposite. Waste and abuse are being eliminated, money will be going where it should be now.\nDear Honorable Secretary Collins,\nCongratulations on your new assignment as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am elated that you have encouraged veterans to come and see you for the truth of what is going on. In addition your promise to ensure and protect the VA from cuts with your heart and the God that you serve. According to the weekly report there are 953,078 pending VA disability claims as of February 8, 2025, and a Back Log of 254,679 claims. What is the plan to insure that there will be enough employees to continue adjuicating these claims, if many of the government employees opt out and leave Veterans Affairs or are fired? Hiring is not just a come to work, it is a long process to learn how to adjuicate claims.\nRespectfully,\nRochelle Crump,\nFormer VA Regional Office Employee, 23 years Government Service\nUnited States Womens Army Corps (WAC) Vietnam Era\nLet’s make sure that these said employees doing claims are even qualified to do so. I did a claim back in 2022 and then shortly after my claim came back with more red tape to slash, a newsletter came out from the VA stating that the personnel they had doing claims were not qualified to do them. You can find a lot of information about VA subject matter at the GAO website. Government Accountability Office.\nThank you for your service and this letter! 10 years and waiting.\nWhat’s Doug Collins’ email address?\nGreat to hear from you so candidly Honorable Collins! As a VA Nurse and a surviving Navy and Army Veteran spouse, I have some concerns and an initiative to share regarding a service members eligibility for state VA nursing home care. I would like to share some thoughts with you and or your staff. Please advise. Thank you for your service then and now!\nThank God and my Savior Jesus Christ for President Trump and Secretary Collins for their love and dedication to America and those who have and continue to serve Her and protect Her!\nCongratulations secretary Collins. You are a patriot and I know the VA will be in very capable hands under your leadership.\nI read yesterday that they may target veterans with service connected disability who also draw social security. That sounds about right for this crime family.\nCan you post the source you read this from?\nThank you Secretary Collins I hope to see you in person when you visit the Phoenix VA. Be safe and God Bless!\nMr. Collins,\nI would like to speak to you about the years of horrible healthcare I have received from the VA. This has included waiting three years and writing three different Georgia Senators to try to get help. Furthermore, I have lost coverage for six months numerous times and no one can tell me why. Please contact me at the email below to hear more. I also have an easy way to make VA Healthcare a lot better for Veterans.\nThank You Secretary Collins !!! I feel better every day now. God Bless you.\nhttps://veteranspolicy.org/post/project-2025s-war-on-veterans/\nProject 2025 plans to dismantle the VA. Read the article wake up. They are coming for veterans as well.\nMr Collins,\nI myself will hold your feet to the fire about our personal information, health records, treatments not being invaded by a non approved group(DOGE). Further, any cuts or changes to the VA benefits by the Project 2025 will fall on you! Any services that are taken away from Veterans is a complete insult by your boss! Keep your word as you would in deed!\nI don’t believe a word any of them say.

Our Veterans are in good hands! Thank you Doug Collin’s and by the way, my cousin, Jim Miller, is your doppelgänger. He is a retired Texas Ranger and he not only looks just like you, he talks just like you! It is uncanny! Hope all goes well with your new position and I know you will help our Veterans fairly and improve on Veteran’s care. Charlotte Naizer. Belton, Texas\nI don’t believe anything this administration Elon, Trump or VA director say. If their lips are moving their lying.\n100 percent agree. Project 2025 talks about dismantling the VA as well. This man is just giving us lip service.\nAmen to that!\nVa and the so called benefits is bs. First I was turned down for not serving 2 years when I was just short. And now vso supposedly put in claim for me but va never received it. Lies and corruption is all it is. Vets don’t get anything. You put your life on the line so ungrateful -ss people can deny you. Then you now see why vets kill them self or blow sh-t up or just run ungrateful -ss people down. Maybe you people should give vets the positions to help vet\nNot crooked -ss politicians who just pad their pockets and screw vets\nMaybe do some research. Don’t speak for those who actually served and actually defended this country by risking our lives. You said “maybe you people should give vets the positions and help vets”.. Glad you said that because Doug Collins is in the Air Force. haha.\nNo way these comments are coming from vets. The only whiny vets I’ve heard from was from the air force\nHey buddie, I’m not whining and I am AIR FORCE\nI’m a vet and nothing but hopeful and positive feeling of the way I hope things will be, think about another 4 years of what we just had.\nCongratulations your Honorable Doug Collins I have been an admirer of you for years and know the VA is going to be enhanced with your expertise. Your Honor I do not know the staff member to send my letter to so I am sending it to you. Thank you for your past service and from here on there is no past just a future of service. We look forward to the future success you will have in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nthis man sounds sincere.i am hoping he will do a good job..\nI am employee at a VA Hosp in California and my democrat colleagues can be disruptive to my workflow, making efficiency even worse. They cannot move on from the election result. I just want going to work and do my job. Leadership seems to tolerate since they probably have the same politics. Also, our local workers union is fear-mongering and misaligning your messages.\nI have Coumity Care and when my doctor request blood work i have to go to a private provider where the VA has a facility very close to my doctor and has a lab but will not accept me but they pay the private company $800 to do blood work\nTY Dec Collins! As a VA Hosp employee, I can say we really use some efficiency, restructuring and less woke culture.\nI agree! VA Nurse too.\nGood morning,\nIt would be nice if there was a way for us VA employees to make suggestions on ways to cut down on unnecessary procedures and wastefulness and see it followed through.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nAh, so just go get screwed to the women, black, LGBTQ, and other minority Vets that served then? If you are truly a VA Nurse, you need to get fired for not taking care of ALL of your Veterans. Woke means positive change and moving forward. Do you really want to go back into the past? Silly questions…of course, you and others like you want to. Leaning into hate is just…well, hateful and disgusting.\nCan we please get dental care for veterans using VA health care any medical problems can occur due to bad dental issues would be nice if we could use community care in my veterans get dental care as well as medical care!\nIf you go to your PCP and ask for a referral to dental due to health issues, the VA has to honor it and then dental becomes a health issue. Also check your DD214 and see if block 17 is checked yes or no. This has to do with a final dental exam upon discharge. If it is checked NO then the VA has to pick up any dental that was done in the service.\nI Coumity Care and TriWest should issue an insurance card to provider the medical staff on contact billing info\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult.

The Choice Program and For Ruining my FICO SCORES and CREDIT REPUTATION due to Collection Agencies and their Harrassment. ALONG WITH THE VA, I will also name Congressman Tom O’Halleran CD 1 AZ and his Veteran Representative in Casa Grande, AZ , for not acting for over 2 years on this issue as well as individuals in the Miami VA Hospital System, Lake City Florida VA Hospital System and Tucson VA Medical Center. Lawyer up folks ’cause the paperwork is being filed.\nI want to thank the Dept of Veterans Affairs for making me HOMELESS AGAIN…After deducting more than $800 USD from my unemployable Benefit, Due to Severe Hypertension and Heart attack/Stroke risk, of which I had a STROKE this past year, they do not give a sh-t that a Veteran is HOMELESS…\nI will probably be dead before the Dept of Veterans Affairs answers any questions that I have had regarding taking over $800 from my VA Benefits…\n<<<<< Do you see the avatar of me, I am 72 years old, plagued with severe HYPERTENSION, Covid, Bacterial Pneumonia, STROKE, and Dengue this past year, I was eligible for Unemployable benefits from the Veterans Administration, this month The VA slashed over $800USD from my benefit because of Social Security that I receive…Can someone explain to me how the VA can do this? Can anyone help me?\nContact me, Thanx…\nCarlo Mathiesen\nDecember 12, 2024\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nSt Petersburg, FL\nSubject: NEXUS Letter to Support Continued Disability Benefit Amount\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing this letter to support my request to maintain my previously approved unemployable disability benefit amount. I am a veteran and I have been experiencing multiple service-connected conditions that have significantly impaired my overall quality of life and ability to function.\nI currently suffer from the following which were not included in previous medical examinations, conditions:\n1. Tinnitus\n2. Anxiety and Depression\n3. Migraine Headaches, which cause severe symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously\n4. Shortness of Breath, a side effect of the medications prescribed by VA healthcare providers\nEach of these medical conditions has been well-documented by VA medical personnel and various specialists over the years. I have been under continuous treatment and care at the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, and I am currently prescribed multiple medications to manage these symptoms. Unfortunately, these medications have introduced new complications, such as shortness of breath, which I attribute directly to the prescribed treatments.\nMy migraine headaches, which result in intense vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, have significantly reduced my ability to engage in day-to-day activities and have made it difficult for me to maintain a stable routine. Additionally, my anxiety and depression continue to exacerbate these challenges, compounding my overall mental and physical health struggles.\nDue to these service-connected conditions, my ability to maintain consistent employment or perform routine tasks has been substantially impaired. I kindly request that the Department of Veterans Affairs reconsider and approve my continued disability benefit amount, as I rely on these benefits to manage ongoing healthcare costs, treatment, and support services.\nMy situation highlights the direct correlation between my connected disabilities and the challenges I face. Continued support will allow me access to critical medical care and ongoing treatment from VA healthcare providers who are familiar with my health history and specific needs.\nI am available to provide any additional medical documentation, treatment records, or statements from healthcare professionals who have treated me through the VA system. Please do not hesitate to contact me\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I sincerely appreciate your support in ensuring that I continue to receive the benefits that are crucial to my ongoing treatment and well-being.\nSincerely,\nCarlo Mathiesen\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult.\nwhy would u even say that?\nBecause it’s true. He’s part of the J6 insurrection and could care less about veterans. People need to wake up and pay attention\nBecause she is correct….\nI have a honorable discharge from the army reserve and I have been trying to get help with my veterans assistance in Meridian Ms and not to forget to mention I have disabilities while serving into the army reserve due to the fact that I was transferred to the regular army bases for my terms . I have have filed a timely claim for my benefits and compensation. But I believe archive lost all my DD214 during all my tours . It’s been 2 years old and I just been forgot about because during a peaceful term. Please let me know my status of the complaint I filed.\npissed off disabled veteran cant even post her name. thats why she can comfortably say crap. I am also a female vet. I get what I need; not more than I need. I hope all vets get what they need, not what they want.

He’s a puppet of the guy who called our fallen military “suckers and losers.” A puppet of the guy who told his entourage that disfigured military veterans should not be part of veteran ceremonies. The puppetmaster has already hit the understaffed VA by firing a bunch of employees and ending contracts.

We serve, retired, got injured while serving, earned VA benefits for those injuries, paid into SS for our entire lives. It’s hard to believe that anyone would even consider looking into cutting benefits for any of us. We have paid for these benefits in ways that are not imaginable to someone that hasnt served. Take away benefits when I turn 67 seriously? I paid for one my entire life and earned the other risking my life for this country.\nDamn.. page not found. They took the budget down. Hopefully someone copied it.\nSir,\nIs DOGE, vetted?, how many actual Veterans in DOGE, if zero, they should hit the f*cking door because penny counters don’t know the journey.\nAlso could you put up photos and qualifications of the DOGE inspectors.Let be leaders by doing what is promised “transparency” and not generic statements like “hitting the ground running” when we all know the clear destination of your running matters.\nThank you for asking these very important questions!! I fear dependent Chapter 35 benefits are on the table, too.\nThis is all just messaging, not factual information. Why don’t you answer the following, Dougie:\n1. Do you support means-testing for eligibility for VA disability compensation, as outlined in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915?\n2. Do you support ending VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security as found in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60916?\n3.

(See https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)\nVeterans…do not be fooled by these talking points. He wants to cut facilities and your benefits. Contact your Congressional members now to tell him cuts are a non-starter.\nExactly. So many Vets are convinced their benefits won’t be touched. Are they ok if their dependents lose Chapter 35?\nIs it possible for veterans who have retired from the military use other pharmacies than Walgreens,CVS, Walmart or Publix because they are not in the Veteran’s best interest.

We’ll be watching.\nRelevant and important information. Thanks for asking and addressing this propagandist BS\nWhat a bunch of malarkey. We’ve been lied to by this whole administration. We wanted a better economy, not this dog and pony show of renaming bodies of water and stopping benefits from other people. Every cabinet member lied bold faced to Congress, so I don’t think this secretary is any different. He’s a big fan of contracting out medical care to the public sector, which is not equipped to take on the entire veteran population. I don’t doubt he won’t start chopping out the low performing employees, but he sure won’t replace them either. You like waiting 8 months for a dependency claim? Try 2 years after they get done firing everyone. Want hour long wait time for a phone call where you get to talk to a heavy accent foreigner? Or a robot? This Secretary will be the one to do it.\nCall your Members of Congress and hold this guy’s feet to the fire.\nNotice how he first addressed the media and not veteran’s concerns?

Battles continue over the access to the Mueller files, the budget process drifts toward bitter showdowns in coming fiscal years, and President Donald J. Trump continues to taunt federal employees with fear-mongering about the deep state, pay freezes, and attacks on the merit system.\nNevertheless, the shutdown that lasted from late December 2018 through late January 2019 may yet produce a push for long-needed reforms, in part because Americans were reminded of the vital functions that government performs. Although a Gallup Poll reported that public trust in government to handle both foreign and domestic problems dropped sharply during the shutdown, the crisis that emerged from the shutdown creates opportunities to insulate the public service from the polarization that has increased the risk of breakdowns across the federal government and to address public concerns about keeping the government open.\nAmericans do not blame federal employees for the shutdown. According to one poll, more than half of the public thinks President Trump and the Republicans were to blame, while 29 percent point to Democrats and 13 percent say both sides. Furthermore, support for federal employees appears to have risen as Americans embraced the need for a strong public service as a ballast against partisanship. According to an NPR poll at the height of the shutdown, half of Americans followed the story closely, two-fifths said they agreed that “it’s never okay to shut down the government,” and large majorities said the shutdown was embarrassing for the country, threatened the country and economy, and was unfair to federal employees and contractors. Trust in government and politicians was already low the day before the shutdown, but it fell sharply in the five days immediately after the House and Senate adjourned without a compromise in hand.\nAmericans learned a great deal about bitter partisanship during the shutdown, but they also received a real-time introduction to the state of the federal service. Some of the lessons were troubling and others heartening. The overall takeaway was a warning about the need to address what former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker and his National Commission on the Public Service thirty years ago called the “quiet crisis” in public service. The Commission did not know when the crisis would hit, but it never imagined that a partisan shutdown would bring the quiet crisis to a roar decades after it concluded its work. Yet this is what happened.\nThe government shutdown yields six important lessons that, if enough policymakers heed them, can lead to a productive path forward to address the quiet crisis.\nFirst, the media put a human face on the shutdown and showed the nation what federal employees do to keep America going. Contrary to the caricature of overpaid and underworked federal employees often promoted in the President’s campaign rallies and Twitter feed, the federal workforce turned out to be composed of real people who clock in every day to make a difference for their communities and country. Americans saw the substantial effects of missed paychecks on people who are just like them. The shutdown produced iconic photos of furloughed employees standing in line at the food pantries, worrying about how to reconcile their checkbooks, and longing to get back to work.\nSecond, the media introduced the nation to the federal government’s blended workforce. The early shutdown coverage focused almost entirely on the 800,000 civil servants who were either called to work without pay or deemed “nonessential” and sent home for the duration. But the media eventually shifted the storyline to include the private and nonprofit sector employees who provide goods and services to the nation under federal contracts and grants. According to my late 2017 estimates of the true size of the federal workforce, the federal government employed about 7.2 million federal, contract, and grant employees at the start of the shutdown, of which 6 million worked for the nine departments that were directly affected by the shutdown. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisors, contract slowdowns accounted for about half of the shutdown’s economic impact, mostly because of a sharp decline in household spending on everything from food and transportation to home and automobile maintenance.\nThird, Americans were reminded that the nation relies on a blended workforce for a host of benefits that keep them safe. They learned about threats to food and drug safety, slowdowns in aircraft inspections and tax refunds, a weakening of data security and workplace inspections, and even delays in FBI investigations and small business loans.\nAs I argued in mid-January, the President and Congress were paying too much attention to delayed tax refunds, missing paychecks, and the 2020 election, and not enough attention to the economic risks of a significant government breakdown. My research on the most visible government failures since 2001 shows that the shutdown was pulling many of the same triggers—e.g., weak leadership, inadequate resources—that contributed to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2004 flu vaccine shortage, the 2007 Walter Reed veterans crisis, the 2012 Benghazi attacks, and last summer’s failed family-separation policy.\nAmericans have since learned that the shutdown might have contributed to the ongoing controversy surrounding the tragic crashes of two Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. The shutdown halted work on the 737 flight-control software fix following the first crash because it had not been designated as an “imminent concern.” But the beleaguered, under-funded Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had also been operating for more than a year without a Senate-confirmed administrator, as have dozens of agencies and units scattered across government, further eroding public confidence. The Administration sets records every day in the number and duration of executive vacancies even as it speeds judicial appointments through the Senate.\nFourth, Americans have learned that the shutdown put their communities at risk, whether by slowing down the permitting process for big companies, delaying the small business loans that keep their communities growing, injecting uncertainty into government aid programs, or provoking layoffs in the local economies that depend on federal spending. The government shutdown not only affected federal workers but it made it hard to keep the cooks and waiters busy at the Bickering Sisters Café just down the street from the James V. Hansen Federal Building in Ogden, Utah, and to sustain the small businesses who work for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\nFifth, Americans learned that the shutdown was damaging federal employee morale while giving young Americans good reason to ask whether they want to assume the risks associated with a career in government. A Prudential Financial survey of 350 furloughed or unpaid federal workers and contractors showed that almost half of federal employees fell behind paying their bills, 27 percent missed a mortgage or rent payment, 13 percent missed a student loan payment, and 10 percent fell behind on tuition payments.\nContrary to President Trump’s widely-reported claim that many federal employees supported the shutdown and border-wall funding, a mid-January Government Executive survey found that 72 percent of federal employees opposed the shutdown, and 56 percent opposed the President’s proposal for border wall funding. “In the 37+ years I’ve been with the FAA, I’ve never been so humiliated and disgraced by our President and the members of Congress,” noted one employee at the Federal Aviation Administration. “To make us a pawn in personal power-plays and agendas is shameful and nothing short of illegal. I’d retire today if it were not for the retirement personnel being furloughed.”\nSixth, Americans learned that the federal government was also breaking its promise to young Americans who joined the public service at all levels of government. In 2017, the federal government created a Public Service Loan Forgiveness program as called for by the 2007 College Cost Reduction and Access Act. But instead of encouraging young people to enter public service, the program has received a wave of negative press coverage because of the Administration’s effort to subvert payments. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis, more than 73,000 borrowers had applied for debt forgiveness as of March 2019, but only 864 had been approved.\nMore importantly for future federal performance, the shutdown has provoked urgent questions about a “brain drain” across government, as retirement-eligible federal employees ask whether it is a good time to retire. Last year’s spike in federal retirement rates may yet turn out to be the early warning of a long-feared retirement tsunami that will overwhelm the federal government’s sluggish hiring process. The Government Accountability Office has been writing about the demographic vulnerability since 2001, and personnel specialists readily acknowledge that the retirement surge is no longer a question of “if” but of “how soon.” The question now is whether the shutdown will be what some call the “earthquake” that triggers the wave.\nTogether, these six lessons have arrived at a moment of great challenge as the federal government confronts the need to rebuild the public service as a career destination of choice for the Millennials and Generation Z. Luckily, the public service community has been thinking about this generational shift for decades and has the research and expertise to help Congress finally confront the quiet crisis—if it should choose to do so.\nThat leads to the one potential silver lining to the long shutdown at the start of 2019: it cast a spotlight on a once-in-a-generation chance to remake the federal service. The nation has never needed a dedicated public service more than today. The quiet crisis is now at hand, louder than ever before.\nAccording to my most recent analysis, the percentage of Americans who favor very major government reform has risen from barely a third in 1997 to three-fifths today. Thus, support shows little variation across the political spectrum. Contemporary polarization has driven Americans into “red,” “blue,” and “purple” corners on issues such as immigration reform, health care access, and abortion rights, but it has not affected how many Americans understand the reality that the federal government does not work well.\nIt is difficult to know precisely what survey respondents mean when they endorse “very major reform.” It seems reasonable to assume that they want action on both the “how” and the “what” of government action—meaning, how government works and what it delivers by way of programs and benefits. Republicans tend to favor a smaller government that delivers fewer services, for example, while Democrats tend to favor a bigger government that delivers more. Either way, a competent, capable federal workforce is needed.\nIf candidates are clear in communicating their promises on the “what” of government action, the messaging behind the “how” is more diffuse. From my reading of trust-in-government survey data leading back to 1997, a “silver linings agenda” could include a mix of reforms to strengthen ethics in government, discipline the presidential appointments process, reduce campaign spending, improve fiscal efficiency and accountability, streamline the bureaucracy, and introduce a “dose of common sense”(as Philip K. Howard calls it) into the rulemaking process. Overarching these reforms, action will be needed to rebuild the civil service system to support the next generation of public servants.\nGood government groups such as the Partnership for Public Service, Volcker Alliance, and National Academy of Public Administration are ready to embrace this mission, but the Trump Administration is an unsteady partner at best. Trump has never missed an opportunity to stoke fears of the “deep state” in government, promote public distrust toward government, or embrace a federal pay freeze or benefit cut.\nTrump’s hostility to government makes the silver lining more difficult to see, but the nation is ready to engage when positive reformers take charge. The shutdown did more than prove that government is broken; it also showed how important government is to the nation’s future and why the public service needs help. The challenge is to take advantage of this silver lining and undertake the kind of broad reforms that are now long past due.\nThis essay is part of a five-part series, entitled What the Shutdown Revealed About the Value of Public Service.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Over the past six months, anti-immigrant rhetoric leading up to the mid-term election in November as well as before, during and after a month-long government shutdown over funding a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border was a test of whether people’s views on immigration would change.\nPositive views on immigration have proven to be resilient. Not only has it withstood the headwinds of fear and division of the past six months, but Americans have become somewhat more positive towards immigrants and immigration, according to public opinion surveys carried out since October of 2018. A majority of Americans told pollsters that they thought immigrants strengthened America, said immigrants have positive attributes such as “hard-working” and having strong family values, and that immigrants were good for America. The percentage of Americans who said they want immigration levels to be reduced is at the lowest level, in two different polls, since that question was first asked going back to 1965 (in Gallup’s poll).\nNevertheless, the divide in attitudes between Republicans and Democrats and Independents is growing. Republicans are trending more negative while Democrats and Independents more positive. This divide promises more gridlock in Congress.\nBelow is a discussion of many of the public opinion polls published by mainstream media or public opinion research organizations over the past six months.\nGeneral Views on Immigrants and Immigration\nSeveral of the polls since October 2018 had questions to gauge public opinion about immigrants, immigration and diversity. For the most part, majorities registered positive views about diversity and immigration. Some noted a long-term trend showing Americans have become more positive towards immigration and immigrants. Two surveys found the number of people saying they thought immigration levels should be kept the same or increased were at high points in the history of their surveys. Below is what several surveys found in this period.\nIn a CBS News poll released October 19, 2018, respondents were asked if they thought that “welcoming and accepting people from different cultures” was an important aspect of the American way of life. A strong majority of respondents (70 percent) said that the idea of being welcoming of people from different cultures was “very important” when thinking about what the American way of life represents. This response crossed party lines, with 54 percent of Republicans saying the concept was “very important” (an additional 34 percent said it was “somewhat important”) and 81 percent of Democrats saying so.[1]\nThe same poll asked whether respondents thought that immigrants coming to the U.S. made American society better in the long run or not. A majority of the public (53 percent) said they thought immigrants made America better. Just 14 percent said they thought immigrants made American worse in the long run. There was a significant partisan split on this question, with a plurality of Republicans (39 percent) saying immigrants made America better, but a strong majority of Democrats (71 percent) agreeing with that proposition. Independents were in the middle, with 48 percent saying they thought immigrants made America better, and only 12 percent of independents thinking immigrants made America worse in the long run.[2]\nThe Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) released their ninth annual American Values Survey on October 29, 2018. This large survey of American adults had several questions regarding diversity, immigration, and immigration policy. PRRI found that, in this survey compared to previous of their “values” surveys, the opinions of Republicans were more sharply divergent from those of Democrats and Independents.\nSpecifically, it found positive attitudes towards immigrants specifically, with 86 percent of Americans saying they are “hardworking,” 84 percent saying they have “strong family values,” and 56 percent saying that immigrants “make an effort to learn English.” However, about half (49 percent) think that immigrants “burden local communities by using more than their share of social services.” On this last point, 74 percent of Republicans think immigrants are a burden, while only 35 percent of Democrats do. The generational divide on this point is also significant, with 62 percent of seniors believing immigrants are a burden, but only 32 percent of young Americans.[3]\nAnother question on the PRRI survey asked whether or not immigrants strengthened American society. A majority (60 percent) said that, in general, the growing number of newcomers coming from other countries strengthen American society. Similarly, a majority (64 percent) said that immigrants today “strengthen our country because of their hard work.” On both of these questions, Republicans and Democrats took opposite views. Three-quarters of Democrats (76 percent) said that newcomers strengthen American society while 65 percent of Republicans believed that newcomers threaten American values. A majority of Republicans (62 percent) said that immigrants are a burden because they take jobs, housing, and health care, while 79 percent of Democrats said that immigrants strengthen our country with their hard work and talent.[4]\nA number of polls in this period asked respondents how much of a problem immigration was as an issue that should be tackled by the Congress and the president. In its first survey after the mid-term elections, released on December 18, Gallup found that the number of respondents who mentioned immigration, in an open-ended question, as the country’s top problem had declined to 16 percent — down from 21 percent in a November poll. The decline was primarily due to the decline in the percentage of Republicans who viewed the issue as the top priority from 37 percent prior to the election to 29 percent in December. Only 7 percent of Democrats viewed immigration as the top problem, and 14 percent of independents thought so.[5]\nA Quinnipiac University poll released December 18 had a similar question for respondents, asking them what they thought should be the top priority for the new Congress, in which immigration was one in a list of choices. Immigration was the top issue, at 24 percent, driven by the 52 percent of Republicans who thought it should be the top priority. Only 7 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of Independents thought so.[6]\nIn the middle of the government shutdown over the border wall, and in the aftermath of President Trump’s TV address about his border wall, Quinnipiac University released a poll on January 14, 2019 asking voters if they thought immigration was good or bad for the country. Nearly three-quarters of voters (73 percent) said they thought immigration was good for the country. Included were a majority of Republicans (57 percent) and a strong majority of Democrats (83 percent) and independents (76 percent).[7]\nAfter the shutdown was over — a month-long standoff during which the president (and the national media) focused on immigration, the southern border, and funding for a border wall — Quinnipiac University released another poll, on January 29, in which the response to the question of whether immigration was good or bad for the country was slightly more positive. Three-quarters (75 percent) of voters overall said immigration was good for the country, including 60 percent of Republicans, 90 percent of Democrats, and 79 percent of independents.[8]\nThe Pew Research Center released a survey on January 31, 2019, and noted that the public’s attitude about immigrants have been trending in a positive direction and now are nearly opposite from what they were in 1994 compared to only 31 percent in 1994. Today, 62 percent say that immigrants “strengthen our country because of their hard work and talent.” Only 28 percent say immigrants are a burden.[9]\nHowever, the Pew report found Democrats and Republicans had never been further apart in their views about immigrants. On the question of whether immigrants were a strength or a burden, 83 percent of Democrats say immigrants strengthen the country, while just 38 percent of Republicans say so. Younger generations had more favorable attitudes, with 75 percent of Millennials and 63 percent of Gen Xers believing immigrants strengthen our country. On the other end of the age spectrum, 53 percent of Baby Boomers and 44 percent of Americans in the Silent Generation believe that immigrants strengthen the U.S.[10]\nThe Pew Research Center released another survey on March 14 that compared attitudes towards immigrants in 18 mostly Western countries. In this comparative survey, majorities in 10 of the 18 countries believed that immigrants made their country stronger. Americans were a bit more positive: 59 percent said that immigrants made the country stronger.[11]\nViews on Immigration Levels\nThe October 2018 PRRI survey mentioned above found that Americans are divided on the question of placing stricter limits on the number of immigrants coming to the U.S. legally. More than half (51 percent) are in favor of passing a law placing stricter limits on legal immigration, while 47 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, 78 percent favor such a law, while only 36 percent of Democrats are supportive.[12]\nGallup released a poll on February 4, 2019, which found that, since the election of President Trump, the percentage of Americans who want to see immigration levels increased has grown from 21 percent in 2016 to 30 percent, a record high in Gallup polling. Thirty-seven percent said they thought immigration should be kept at present levels. While the percentage who wanted immigration decreased — 31 percent — is higher than the percentage who want an increase, the one-point gap between the two is the lowest since Gallup began asking the question in 1965. Before the election of Donald Trump, the percentage of Americans who wanted a decrease in immigration has been, on average, 31 points higher than the percentage who say they thought immigration levels should be increased. The increased favorability towards increasing immigration levels was largely driven by Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, at 41 percent (up from 31 percent in 2016). However, there was also an uptick in Republicans who said immigration levels should be increased (16 percent vs. 11 percent in 2016). Still, about half of Republicans (51 percent) said they favored decreased immigration levels.[13]\nSource: Gallup News Service,\nhttps://news.gallup.com/file/poll/246464/20190204Immigration.pdf\nOn March 20, 2019, the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released survey data from a 2018 General Social Survey (GSS, a survey conducted every two years by NORC at the University of Chicago). The survey results were similar to those of the Gallup poll released in early February measuring trends in American attitudes towards current immigration levels. Forty-one percent of Americans in the GSS survey said that they wanted immigration levels to stay the same. Thirty-four percent said that immigration levels should be reduced, and this was the first time since the question was asked beginning in 2004 that the percentage satisfied with current immigration levels was higher than the percentage who wanted a decrease in immigration. The percentage who said they wanted an increase in immigration was up 6 points since 2016 — from 17 to 23 percent.[14]\nThe GSS survey found partisan differences in attitudes towards immigration levels, a trend that began showing up in the survey beginning in 2010. Republicans were more than twice as likely (52 percent) as Democrats (20 percent) to want a decrease in immigration. Still, the percentage of Republicans who said they wanted a decrease in immigration levels dropped 10 points — from 62 percent to 52 percent — from the previous survey in 2016.[15]\nLegal Immigration\nA few surveys asked the public about what kind of immigration system the U.S. should have. While questions differed and answers were inconsistent, in general the public supports an immigration system that favors highly-skilled immigrants.\nIn the October 2018 PRRI survey mentioned above, a majority of Americans (63 percent) said they favored implementing a “merit-based” immigration system that would favor immigrants based on their skills, education and ability to speak English. Republicans favored this kind of system more than Democrats (86 percent vs. 50 percent).[16]\nA Quinnipiac University poll released November 21 asked respondents if they thought it should be harder or easier for people to immigrate legally to the U.S. A plurality, 47 percent, said easier, while 37 percent said harder. Republicans and Democrats had opposite views, with 65 percent of Democrats saying it should be easier and 59 percent of Republican saying harder. [17]\nPew Research Center released a survey on January 22, 2019, comparing public openness to high-skilled immigration in several countries. In the U.S., 78 percent of those surveyed said they support encouraging highly skilled people to immigrate and work in the U.S. (Median public support among the 12 countries surveyed was 73 percent.)[18]\nTreatment of Undocumented Immigrants\nMany opinion surveys over the past decade and more have asked the public how the country should treat immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization. Strong support for allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay and eventually become citizens under certain conditions continues. Even stronger support exists for providing a path to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. without authorization by their parents when they were children. In recent years, Republicans have become somewhat less supportive of a path to citizenship compared to Democrats and Independents.\nSource: Public Religion Research Institute,\nhttps://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AVS-2018-Topline-COMBINED.pdf\nThe September 26 Pew Research poll mentioned above asked respondents what they thought should be the priority for immigration policy. The consensus plurality was that both “better border security and stronger enforcement of our immigration laws,” and “creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain requirements” should be given equal priority (47 percent of the voters overall, including 48 percent of Republican voters, 45 percent of Democratic voters).[19]\nThe public has shifted modestly in favor of allowing undocumented immigrants to stay — with 29 percent saying that the priority should be finding a way for undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. in 2016, and 33 percent saying that in 2018. During the same period, Republicans have shifted modestly away from prioritizing enforcement to saying that enforcement and finding a path to legality for undocumented immigrants should be given equal priority. Meanwhile, 51 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prioritize a path to legality — the highest percentage since the question was first asked in 2010.[20]\nThe PRRI survey released in October 2018 found 62 percent of Americans support allowing immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children to remain in the U.S. — consistent with many other surveys taken over the last several years. However, a majority of Republicans (55 percent) opposed this policy, while 78 percent of Democrats support it.[21]\nRegarding immigration reform with a path to citizenship, the PRRI survey found that public support for this idea (62 percent) has not changed significantly since 2013. An additional 16 percent favored allowing undocumented immigrants to stay but not become citizens. However, among Republicans, support for a path to citizenship, at 39 percent, had declined since 2016 when it was 55 percent. Support for deportation had increased 14 points in that time period — from 28 percent to 42 percent. The views of Democrats have not shifted significantly, with 75 percent in support of allowing undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens under certain conditions.[22]\nA Harvard University/Harris poll released December 3 included a question asking if respondents would favor the new Congress taking up an immigration reform proposal that paired a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents with a border barrier, emphasizing “merit-based” immigration over family unification, and eliminating the diversity visa lottery. Overall, 63 percent of the public favored this proposal, with little difference among Republicans (63 percent), Democrats (69 percent) and independents (57 percent).[23]\nA Morning Consult/Politico poll released January 23, 2019, asked voters what they thought Congress’s top priorities should be. Of the immigration policies included in the poll, 26 percent of voters said that passing a bill to grant protection from deportation to young people brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children should be a “top priority” with an additional 28 percent saying it should be an “important, but lower priority.” Only 17 percent of registered voters said that such a bill should not be done. The percentage of Republican voters saying such a bill should not be done was nearly double, at 31 percent. In the same survey, 35 percent of voters said that passing an immigration reform bill should be a “top priority,” with an additional 34 percent saying it should be an important priority. Republicans were more inclined to say immigration reform should be a top priority (45 percent) compared to Democrats and independents (30 percent each). The question did not specify what immigration reform would look like.[24]\nAt the end of the government shutdown in January 2019, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 54 percent of the public thought the U.S. was doing “too little” to keep undocumented immigrants from coming into the country. (The same proportion, 54 percent, said they were opposed to the border wall.) A plurality of Democrats (36 percent) thought the U.S. was doing too little, while most Republicans (80 percent) thought so.[25]\nA Gallup poll released February 4, 2019, found overwhelming support (81 percent) for a proposal to allow immigrants “currently in the country illegally” the chance to become citizens over time if they meet certain requirements. This is down 3 percentage points from a poll taken in 2016, when support for a path to citizenship was at 84 percent in a Gallup poll. Opposition to a proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants was at 61 percent, also down from 2016 (66 percent).[26]\nA Morning Consult/Politico poll released February 20, contained questions to find out what voters thought should be top priorities for Congress to address. Forty-four percent of voters said that passing an “immigration reform bill” (with no content specified) should be a top priority for Congress. This was up from the 35 percent of voters who said this should be a top priority a month earlier. Passing a bill to grant protection from deportation to young people brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children was listed as a “top priority” by 31 percent of voters, slightly more than the 26 percent from a month earlier. An additional 28 percent said that such a bill should be an “important” priority. A bill to protect “Dreamers” was a top priority for 50 percent of Democrats, but only 14 percent of Republicans. On this question, as with many immigration-related questions, younger cohorts of voters are more likely to take the pro-immigrant position — 41 percent of the “Generation Z” cohort (18- to 21-year-olds) ranked this as a top priority.[27]\nThe multi-country Pew Research Center poll released mid-March (mentioned above) asked respondents whether they thought immigrants living in the country illegally should be deported. (This survey did not ask about providing a path to legal status.) In the U.S., respondents were split on this question, with 47 percent opposing deportation, and 46 percent supporting it.[28]\nFamily Separation\nWhile surveys about this issue decreased after the summer of 2018, a few surveys continued to ask about this policy as the handling of children separated from their parents continued to be covered by the press.\nThe October 2018 PRRI survey mentioned above found strong public opposition to the administration’s policy of separating children from their parents and charging the parents as criminals when they enter the U.S. Overall, 72 percent were opposed to this policy. Again, however, there were significant partisan differences, with 90 percent of Democrats opposed to this policy (72 percent strongly opposed) and about half (53 percent) of Republicans in favor of this policy.[29]\nAn NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll released on December 11 found that just 36 percent of U.S. adults polled approved of the way the president was handling the job of reuniting of children who had previously been separated from their parents at the border. However, Republicans approved by 64 to 19 percent, while Democrats (76 percent) and Independents (56 percent) disapproved of the way the president was handling the issue.[30]\nAsylum Seekers\nThe most prominent immigration news story this past winter and spring has been the Central American families fleeing violence in their home countries and coming to the U.S. seeking asylum. Some surveys asked the public how we should treat these asylum seekers.\nThe PRRI October survey found a majority of Americans (60 percent) were opposed to passing a law to keep refugees from coming to the U.S. However, nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of Republicans favored passing a law to keep out refugees while Independents (65 percent) and Democrats (75 percent) held the opposite view.[31]\nA Grinnell College national poll released December 3, 2018, also found overall support for refugees, with 55 percent of the poll’s respondents saying that the U.S. has a moral responsibility to grant asylum to refugees so they can live in the U.S. permanently. Only 32 percent of respondents thought there were “too many” refugees allowed into the U.S. Democrats (77 percent) and Independents (53 percent) thought the U.S. had a moral responsibility to grant asylum, while Republicans (57 percent) said the U.S. had no responsibility. A slight majority of Republicans (53 percent) thought there were “too many” refugees allowed into the U.S., while only 11 percent of Democrats and 30 percent of Independents thought so.[32]\nIn January 2019, at the end of the month-long government shutdown over the border wall, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released a survey which found that a plurality of respondents (44 percent) thought that people coming to our southern border with the intention of immigrating here would strengthen America’s values and character. Thirty-five percent thought the immigrants would weaken America’s values and character.[33]\n* Thank you to Maurice Belanger for his assistance with this article.\n[1] CBS News, “Partisans view the other side’s rallies, protests with suspicion – CBS News poll,” October 19, 2018, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/partisans-view-the-other-sides-rallies-protests-with-suspicion-cbs-news-poll/.

Globally, 56 percent said they were thinking about it daily or weekly.\nAdditionally, 53 percent of people worldwide are more worried about climate change now than they were a year earlier. This is most likely linked to the increasing number of climate change impacts that people hear about or have experienced themselves. More than two out of five people (43 percent) think extreme weather events were worse this year than last. Nearly eight in 10 people (78 percent) want more protection for people at risk from extreme weather.\nStrikingly, almost two thirds (63 percent) are starting to take climate change impacts into consideration when making decisions like where to live or work and what to buy. A third of people (33 percent) said climate change is affecting their big life decisions a lot.\nHow do people think leaders should respond to the climate crisis?\nFour out of five people around the world (80 percent) want more climate action from their country. They also seek global unity in responding to the crisis, with 86 percent agreeing that their countries should set aside geopolitical differences, such as those regarding trade and security, and work together on climate change.\nThere is a clear expectation that governments need to lead and strengthen their commitments to address climate change, with a resounding 89 percent of people wanting to see more climate action from their governments. At the same time, only 39 percent of people think big businesses are doing well in addressing climate change.\nWhen asked about different measures to respond to the climate crisis, 81 percent of people support the protection and restoration of nature, highlighting the importance of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems in limiting climate change. Climate education is another measure that received a lot of public support, with 80 percent of people backing the role of schools in increasing awareness.\nMost people agree that business-as-usual is no longer an option to keep the world on a safe path. Worldwide, 72 percent support a quick transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Even in the world’s biggest producers of fossil fuels, the majority of people support a quick transition away from coal, oil and gas.\nLast but not least, four in five people (79 percent) expressed support for climate justice, agreeing that rich countries should increase the help given to poorer countries to address climate change and its impacts.\nAre there any differences in the way people think about climate change based on their background?\nThere is a large consensus on the results of Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024. That is to say, the vast majority of people agree the climate crisis is here and that the world needs to act now.\nStill, there are a few exceptions.\nGiven that climate change impacts are most acutely felt in countries will less resilience – who are often the least responsible for causing the crisis – more people in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) think about climate change regularly (63 percent) than the global average (56 percent).\nFurthermore, as the climate crisis is an existential threat to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), it is not surprising that 71 percent of people in SIDS are more worried about climate change now than last year, a much higher percent than the global average (53 percent).\nThe survey revealed support for stronger climate action in 20 of the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters, but majorities range from 66 percent in the United States and Russia, to 67 percent in Germany, 73 percent in China, 77 percent in South Africa and India, 85 percent in Brazil, 88 percent in Iran and up to 93 percent in Italy.\nWhen it comes to differences based on gender, in five of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters (Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United States), women are more in favor of strengthening their country’s climate action commitments by 10 to 17 percentage points. This gap was biggest in Germany, where women were 17 percentage points more likely than men to want more climate action (75 percent compared to 58 percent).\nHow does understanding people’s views on climate change help in addressing it?\nThe results of Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 can help national decision-makers develop ambitious policies to address climate change and engage key stakeholders by helping them understand which challenges are affecting people and what is expected of them. As the survey shows, some of these expectations include acting fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, offering increased protection from extreme weather events, protecting and restoring nature, closing gaps in climate education and offering increased support for the world’s most vulnerable.\nThe results should serve as a resource for national and local leaders to develop inclusive and ambitious climate strategies and action plans tailored to the specific needs, concerns and challenges of their citizens – including through updating their national climate pledges (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs). International climate summits, such as the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are also great opportunities for governments to translate the survey results into pathways to climate action.\nIn many of the places surveyed by Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024, this type of data can be difficult to collect due to barriers such as conflict, limited access to technology or geographic inaccessibility. Many of the countries polled have never been asked for their views on climate change in such depth before, especially developing countries that have contributed the least emissions and are on the frontlines of the crisis.\nHow can you use Peoples’ Climate Vote?\nWhile government campaigns and initiatives are critical for enacting climate action at scale, citizen’s climate movements can pressure leaders to keep their ambitions high. The Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 is an important tool that you can use to urge climate action.\nHere are some suggestions on how you can make best use of Peoples’ Climate Vote:\n- Share the link to the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 with friends, family, faith and community members, professional networks and business leaders, so they can see the findings for themselves.\n- Start a conversation at the dinner table. See what people around you think and tell them how they compare to the rest of the world.\n- Inform and involve people on climate issues by using your social media channels as an amplifier for the results from the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024.\n- Incorporate the survey results in letters, petitions and other correspondence to urge elected officials to support and drive increased climate action.\n- Cite the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 data and results in your own campaigns and research.\nAbout Peoples’ Climate Vote\nThe Peoples’ Climate Vote is the world’s largest standalone public opinion survey on climate change, created to deliver people’s perspectives on climate change to world leaders. Launched in 2020, the first edition of the Peoples’ Climate Vote was developed as a pillar of UNDP’s Mission 1.5 campaign to connect people and their policymakers.\nThe Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 is the second edition of this global survey, bigger and more inclusive than before. More than 73,000 people speaking 87 different languages across 77 countries participated in the survey, which was conducted for UNDP by the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom and GeoPoll, a global leader in remote research.\nThe 2024 edition aimed to find out exactly how people are experiencing climate change in their day-to-day lives. The 15 questions were designed specifically so that they could be easily understood across different education levels and cultural backgrounds in 77 countries. They focused on people’s personal experiences with the impacts of climate change, what they would like the world to do about it, and how much further or faster they want leaders to go in responding to it.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}

That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2002.\nThe study, conducted at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, found that uninsured, working-age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts, up from a 25 percent excess death rate found in 1993.\n“The uninsured have a higher risk of death when compared to the privately insured, even after taking into account socioeconomics, health behaviors, and baseline health,” said lead author Andrew Wilper, M.D., who currently teaches at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “We doctors have many new ways to prevent deaths from hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease — but only if patients can get into our offices and afford their medications.”\nThe study, which analyzed data from national surveys carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), assessed death rates after taking into account education, income, and many other factors, including smoking, drinking, and obesity. It estimated that lack of health insurance causes 44,789 excess deaths annually.\nPrevious estimates from the IOM and others had put that figure near 18,000. The methods used in the current study were similar to those employed by the IOM in 2002, which in turn were based on a pioneering 1993 study of health insurance and mortality.\nDeaths associated with lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many common killers such as kidney disease. An increase in the number of uninsured and an eroding medical safety net for the disadvantaged likely explain the substantial increase in the number of deaths, as the uninsured are more likely to go without needed care. Another factor contributing to the widening gap in the risk of death between those who have insurance and those who do not is the improved quality of care for those who can get it.\nThe researchers analyzed U.S. adults under age 65 who participated in the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) between 1986 and 1994. Respondents first answered detailed questions about their socioeconomic status and health and were then examined by physicians. The CDC tracked study participants to see who died by 2000.\nThe study found a 40 percent increased risk of death among the uninsured. As expected, death rates were also higher for males (37 percent increase), current or former smokers (102 percent and 42 percent increases), people who said that their health was fair or poor (126 percent increase), and those who examining physicians said were in fair or poor health (222 percent increase).\nSteffie Woolhandler, study co-author, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance, noted: “Historically, every other developed nation has achieved universal health care through some form of nonprofit national health insurance. Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care costs, and 45,000 pay with their lives.”\n“The Institute of Medicine, using older studies, estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance,” remarked David Himmelstein, study co-author, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance.\n“Even this grim figure is an underestimate — now one dies every 12 minutes.”\nOther authors include Karen E. Lasser, Danny McCormick, David H. Bor, and David U. Himmelstein. The study was supported by a National Service Research Award.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        My Sunday column looks at health care reform through the prism of Nikki White, a young woman from Tennessee. She became too sick with Lupus to work — and then lost her health insurance, and then died because of lack of medical care. We may know intellectually that 18,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have insurance, but to confront one such person is still heartbreaking. And I just can’t believe that we will let this opportunity for health reform slip through our fingers, so that Americans like Nikki continue to die needlessly every 30 minutes.\nI came across Nikki’s case through T.R. Reid’s new book, “The Healing of America,” which I heartily recommend. (The case had earlier been reported in the WS Journal by Jane Zhang.) Reid’s book is a sobering look at the shortcomings of our health system but suggests that the most compelling argument for reform isn’t improved productivity or efficiency, but simply that the present system is morally offensive. President Obama or somebody around him had evidently read Reid’s book, because in his Wednesday speech he pivoted and made precisely this moral argument the centerpiece of his address to Congress.\nIn the past, a number of you have written about your own encounters with the health system, and I’ve been deeply moved by some of those stories.

There is no doubt that this has been a challenging year for LGBTQ+ young people. Yet despite these challenges, including the historic wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation that has targeted them, these young people remain powerful, optimistic, and resilient.\nThe Trevor Project remains unwavering in our commitment to support them, and we will continue fighting toward a world where all LGBTQ+ young people feel safe, accepted, and loved exactly as they are.\nThank you to all the LGBTQ+ young people who took this survey, honestly and bravely sharing their experiences with us. We hope these findings help to equip fellow researchers, policymakers, educators, and other youth-facing professionals and organizations with the data they need to protect and uplift LGBTQ+ young people in their communities and to help us end the public health crisis of suicide, once and for all.\n- The Trevor Project\nWant to help support The Trevor Project?\nYour donation helps to support future, meaningful research about LGBTQ+ youth and power the life-saving services we provide.\nDonateKey Findings\n39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year — including 46% of transgender and nonbinary young people.

Here were some of their responses:\n- You have millions of queer siblings across the world who would accept you for who you. It is the most rewarding experience to live sourrounded by people who love you for your whole, true self.\n- Finding a community, people you can be yourself aroud, is life changing\n- You aren't alone my friend. Remember, there's a whole wide world with people like you and me.\n- Be the role model you always needed.\n- Treat yourself as a friend.\n- You've come so far, and I am so, so proud of you.\n- You are so extremely valid and I am prod of you.\n- Keep on going, you're strong for existing.\n- You are enough.\n- The greatest act of rebellion is to go on living authentically and truthfully; find spaces where you can be yourself unapologetically.\n- Just remember no one else can decide who you are for you, you know yourself the best and nothing and no one can change that.\n- We deserve happiness. We're allowed to want a future of our own design, with the people we love. One day I'll get that and so will you.\n- Finding out who you truly are take time. You've got this.\n- You don't have to figure it out now, and you're allowed to not know. Figuring it out is for YOU first and foremost, so do it in your time and in your way.\n- Takes as much time as you need to figure things out. There's no time limit.\n- Nothing is better than living your authentic self, but you don't need to rush it. If the time isn't right, it just isn't right.\n- You are beatiful! You bring so much light into the world and there is so much joy out there waiting for you.\n- Queerness is glorious and essential and deeply human. It is poetry and starlight. Thank you for being here!\nMethodology\nThe content and methodology for The Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People were approved by an independent Institutional Review Board.\nA quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between September 13 and December 16, 2023. A sample of individuals ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States, including its territories, was recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project’s website or social media channels. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ+ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure a diverse sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 134 questions. The questionnaire was offered in English and Spanish. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past year were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey to allow for comparisons to their nationally representative sample. Each question related to mental health and suicide was preceded by a message stating, “If at any time you need to talk to someone about your mental health or thoughts of suicide, please call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or 988.”\nA total of 72,424 individuals began the survey. However, 17,078 did not consent and 5,259 did not pass demographic screening requirements (e.g., age, United States [U.S.] residency, being LGBTQ+). This resulted in an eligible sample of 50,087 LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 24 in the U.S. Of those, 29,768 did not pass completion requirements (i.e., spend at least 5 minutes on the survey and complete at least 50% of it), 468 did not pass attention or honesty checks, and 1,188 did not pass duplicate or bot checks (e.g., built-in Qualtrics checks, IP address matching). This resulted in a final analytic sample of 18,663 LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 24 in the U.S.\nChi-square tests were used to examine differences between groups. Unless otherwise noted, all reported comparisons are statistically significant at least at p<0.05. This means there is less than a 5% likelihood these results occurred by chance.\nThis report uses “transgender and nonbinary” as an umbrella term to encompass non-cisgender young people, which includes young people who identify as transgender and nonbinary as well as other labels outside of the cisgender binary, including genderqueer, agender, genderfluid, gender neutral, bigender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming, among others.\nComparability\nIn order to better understand how our sample compares to a national probabilistic sample, we included questions regarding considering and attempting suicide that were identical to those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS).\nAnalyses were conducted to compare rates of seriously considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past 12 months among young people ages 13 to 18 in our sample (n = 11,346) to the 2021 YRBS sample of high school students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or another non-heterosexual identity (LGBQ+; n = 3,850).\nThe YRBS rate among LGBQ+ young people for seriously considering suicide in the past year (45%) was similar to the rate among the same age range in our sample of LGBTQ+ young people (44%).\nAdditionally, 22% of LGBQ+ young people in the 2021 YRBS reported a suicide attempt in the past 12 months compared to 14% in our sample of LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 18.\nSample Breakdown of Respondents’ Demographics\nBy age\n-\n49% 13–17\n-\n51% 18–24\nBy sexual orientation\n-\n4% Straight or Heterosexual\n-\n13% Gay\n-\n16% Lesbian\n-\n28% Bisexual\n-\n16% Pansexual\n-\n12% Queer\n-\n1% Questioning\n-\n10% Asexual\nBy gender identity\n-\n33% Girl or Woman\n-\n28% Boy or man\n-\n33% Nonbinary, bigender, genderfluid, or genderqueer\n-\n6% Not sure or questioning\nBy transgender & nonbinary identity\n-\n41% Cisgender\n-\n6% Questioning if transgender or nonbinary\n-\n53% Transgender or nonbinary\nBy race/ethnicity\n-\n<1% Middle Eastern/Northern African\n-\n1% Native/Indigenous\n-\n6% Asian American/Pacific Islander\n-\n8% Black/African American\n-\n12% Hispanic/Latinx\n-\n12% More than one race/ethnicity\n-\n61% White\nBy socioeconomic status\n-\n73% More than meets basic needs\n-\n27% Just meets basic needs or less\nBy region\n-\n16% Northeast\n-\n35% South\n-\n23% Midwest\n-\n26% West\nBy intersex\n-\n98% No\n-\n2% Yes\nAcknowledgements:\nThe Trevor Project’s Research team expresses deep gratitude to all of the LGBTQ+ young people who participated in the survey and shared their insights.

His triumph capped the rise of the new right/conservative wing of the Republican Party and ushered in a new era of governing. Reagan served as arguably the first true conservative U.S. president in over 50 years. Reagan advanced domestic policies that featured a lessening of federal government responsibility in solving social problems, reducing restrictions on business, and implementing tax cuts. Internationally, Reagan demonstrated a fierce opposition to the spread of communism throughout the world and a strong distrust of the Soviet Union, which in 1983 he labeled an \"evil empire.\" He championed a rearmed and strong military and was especially supportive of the MX missile system and the Strategic Defense Initiative (\"Star Wars\") program.\nEconomic Policy\nWhen Reagan took office the economy was one of double-digit inflation and interest rates near 20%. During the campaign Reagan promised to restore the free market from excessive government regulation and encourage private initiative and enterprise.\nReagan's economic policies highlighted his long-standing dislike of high federal income taxes. Reagan embraced the theory of \"supply side economics,\" feeling that tax cuts encouraged economic expansion which would result in increases in federal government revenue at a lower tax rate. Higher revenues would then be used to increase defense spending and balance the federal budget. This overall approach became known as \"Reaganomics,\" or as Republican primary candidate Vice President George H.W. Bush once called it, \"voodoo economics.\" The President also vowed to protect certain entitlement programs (like Medicare and Social Security) while cutting the budgets for other social programs by targeting waste, fraud and abuse.\nDuring his first year in office, Reagan engineered the passage of $39 billion in budget cuts into law, as well as a massive 25 percent tax cut spread over three years for individuals, and faster write-offs for capital investment for business. At the same time, he insisted on, and for the most part, was successful in gaining increased funding for defense.\nAlthough inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 5.1% in 1982, a severe recession set in, with unemployment exceeding 10% in October, 1982 for the first time in forty years. The administration modified its economic policy after two years by proposing selected tax increases and budget cuts to control rising deficits and higher interest rates. After the 1982 downturn, the reduced inflation rate (under 5% for the remainder of the administration), lowering interest rates, and added discretionary income from tax cuts sparked record economic growth, and produced one of the lowest unemployment rates in modern U.S. history (unemployment hit a 14 year low in June of 1988). As Reagan left office, the nation was experiencing its sixth consecutive year of economic prosperity.\nThe economic gains, however, came at a cost of a record annual deficit and a ballooning national debt. The budget deficit was exacerbated by a trade deficit. Americans continued to buy more foreign-made goods than they were selling. Reagan, however adhered to his free trade stance, and was the primary proponent of the Free Trade Agreement with Canada, which evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He also signed, reluctantly, trade legislation designed to open foreign markets to U.S. goods.\nDomestic Affairs\nReagan's domestic policies had a major impact on the American people and have had for many years. He followed up the passage of the largest tax cut in U.S. history by supporting and signing into law the Tax Reform law of 1986. Reagan led the battle for a Social Security reform bill designed to ensure the long-term solvency of the system, and oversaw the passage of immigration reform legislation, as well as the expansion of the Medicare program to protect the elderly and disabled against \"catastrophic\" health costs.\nReagan elevated William Rehnquist to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and appointed three justices to the bench: Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and the first woman named to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. Part of the New Right's basic beliefs was that \"judicial activism\" was un-Constitutional and judges should be selected by an adherence to \"judicial restraint.\" Reagan's judicial selections were based on this principle.\nwhom did not benefit from the economic prosperity. In 1986, over 30 percent of the black population had an income below the official poverty level. While many labor leaders disliked Reagan, especially after he fired the air traffic controllers when they refused to end their strike (1981), he was popular with labor union members.\nReagan encouraged the development of \"private sector initiatives\" as well as federalism, with the objective of transferring from the federal government some of the responsibilities believed to be better served by private business or state and local government.\nAs the president called for international cooperation to stop the influx of illegal drugs, especially cocaine, into the U.S., First Lady Nancy Reagan led the campaign against drug abuse, urging the nation's youth to \"just say no.\"\nForeign Affairs\nAt the heart of Reagan's foreign policy was preventing communist expansion in the world. US actions throughout the world demonstrated this including strong financial and military support of the Contras against the communist Nicaraguan government, the aid given to the government of El Salvador in their fight against the communist guerrillas, the U.S invasion of Grenada when that nation was perceived as falling under Cuban domination in 1983, the support given to UNITA anti-communist fighters in the Angolan Civil War involving Cuban proxy troops, and the support given to rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan. These combined efforts were named \"The Reagan Doctrine.\" While efforts for peace in Central America faltered, the Soviets announced the withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan in 1988, and the Angola conflict was successfully negotiated with a withdrawal of Cuban troops.\nReagan believed that the nation should negotiate with the Soviet Union from a position of strength. To such an end, the administration embarked on a strategic modernization program which included the production of an intercontinental missile, a stengthened navy, and a feasibility study for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The increase in military spending, and the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Soviet Union at the beginning of Reagan's second term, opened a new era of relations between the two superpowers. After a number of meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev, the two men signed an Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty at the Washington Summit in December, 1987. The agreement promised to eliminate an entire class of intermediate-range nuclear missiles and was the first arms control agreement in history to reduce the nuclear arsenal. In addition, the administration began the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which would reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals by 50%, including large multiple warhead missiles.\nWhen pro-U.S. dictators in Haiti and the Philippines appeared on the verge of being toppled from power, Reagan engineered their safe removal from their countries, ensuring bloodless coups and new government which, he hoped, would be friendly to the U.S.\nIn Middle East affairs, Reagan reported in his inaugural address that the 52 American hostages held in Iran for 444 days were at that moment being released and would soon return to freedom. The President maintained a firm stance against terrorism, exemplified by the American retaliating against Libya for an air attack in 1981 and again in 1986 for the death of Americans in a Berlin discotheque. Reagan's peacekeeping force in war-torn Lebanon experienced tragedy in 1983 when a truck bomb killed 241 soldiers. Tragedy struck again in 1987 when a missile from an Iraqi warplane killed 37 sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark, part of a U.S. naval taskforce which had been sent to the Persian Gulf to keep that waterway open during the Iran-Iraq war.\nThe darkest hour of the Reagan administration would become known as the Iran-Contra affair. After lengthy, nationally televised hearings, a special congressional hearings review board reported that Reagan authorized the sale of arms to Iran in exchange for help in freeing U.S. hostages in Lebanon. Investigations revealed the money gained from the arms sale was illegally diverted to aid the Contras, opponents of the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. The congressional report criticized Reagan for his detached, hands-off style of management. In the aftermath of the affair, National Security Advisors Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter, as well as National Security Council aide Colonel Oliver North were indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted of various charges regarding the Iran-Contra operations. McFarlane was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush and both Poindexter and North's convictions were set aside on appeal for technical reasons.\nThe Reagan Legacy\nThe eight years of the Reagan presidency was one of the most dynamic periods, in recent U.S. history, resulting in a major refocusing of the nation's social, business, and international agenda. More importantly, his election changed the demographic composition of the Republican Party and built the core beliefs still practiced today: lower taxes, less government restrictions on businesses and individuals and a strong military.\nFew presidents have enjoyed the affection of so many of the American people. Support for Ronald Reagan grew when he was seriously wounded by an assassin's bullet in 1981 and during major surgical procedures in 1985 and 1987. Reagan was known as the \"Great Communicator,\" and often went on television to ask the viewers for their support for a particular piece of legislation. When he ran for a second term in 1984 against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan stood by his record and asked the voters if they were better off now than they were four years ago. At 73 years of age in 1984, Reagan became, at the time, the oldest man ever elected president, receiving 525 electoral votes, the most of any presidential candidate.\nAs his second term ended, polls showed that more than half of the American people gave him a favorable rating. When Ronald Reagan became president, he had a distinct vision of what the nation should be and spelled out the direction he hoped it would take during his administration. Reagan had a clear social, economic, and foreign policy agenda, and with political skill and personal persuasiveness he was able to achieve many of his goals. Early in his presidency, Reagan remarked: \"What I'd really like to do is go down in history as the President who made Americans believe in themselves again.\"\nA month before the election of his successor, Reagan looked back on his eight years in office: \"I am the same man I was when I came to Washington,\" he said, \"I believe the same things I believed when I came to Washington, and I think those beliefs have been vindicated by the success of the policies to which we hold fast.\"\nAbout his foreign policy, he said, \"At every point on the map that the Soviets have applied pressure, we've done all we can to apply pressure against them.\" He went on \"And now we are seeing a sight many believed they would never see in our lifetime: the receding of the tide of totalitarianism.\" Reagan lived to see the dismantling of the Soviet Union's communist empire and its retreat from surrounding neighboring countries which ultimately resulted in the toppling of the Berlin Wall in the fall of 1989.\nChronology of the Reagan Presidency, 1979-1989\n1979-1980\n- 11/13/1979 Announcement for Presidential Candidacy\n- 07/16/1980 Ronald Reagan Wins the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention, Detroit, MI\n- 10/28/1980 Reagan/Carter Presidential Debate\n- 11/04/1980 Ronald Reagan Wins the Presidential Election in a Landslide Victory (489-49 Electoral College Votes)\n1981\n- 01/20/1981 Inauguration Day\n- 01/20/1981 American Hostages in Iran Released\n- 01/22/1981 Establishment of Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief\n- 01/27/1981 White House Ceremony for Iran Hostages\n- 01/29/1981 First Press Conference\n- 02/05/1981 Address to Nation on the Economy\n- 02/18/1981 Address to Congress on Economic Recovery Program\n- 02/26/1981 Initial Formation of the Cabinet Councils\n- 03/26/1981 Signing of Executive Order 12301 establishing the Presidential Council on Integrity & Efficiency\n- 03/30/1981 Assassination Attempt on the President by John Hinckley, Jr.\n- 04/11/1981 Release from George Washington Hospital\n- 04/28/1981 Address to Congress on Economic Recovery Program\n- 05/17/1981 Honorary Degree from Notre Dame University\n- 07/07/1981 Nomination of Sandra Day O’Connor to Supreme Court\n- 07/19/1981-07/21/1981 Summit of Industrialized Nations (\"G7) Summit in Ottawa, Canada\n- 07/27/1981 Address to the Nation on Federal Tax Reduction Legislation\n- 07/29/1981 Tax Cut Bill Approved by House of Representatives\n- 08/03/1981 Air Traffic Controllers Strike Ultimatum Issued by President Reagan\n- 08/13/1981 President Reagan Signs Tax Cut Bill, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA)\n- 09/24/1981 Address to the Nation on Economic Recover & Social Security\n- 09/25/1981 Sandra Day O'Connor Sworn-In as First Female Supreme Court Justice\n- 09/29/1981 World Bank and IMF Address on Free Enterprise, Not Aid\n- 10/02/1981 US Strategic Weapons Program Announced\n- 10/05/1981 Voluntarism Initiative Launched\n- 10/06/1981 Assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\n- 10/07/1981 Fifty States Project for Women Launched\n- 10/15/1981 World Affairs Council Speech on Third World & Free Enterprise\n- 10/18/1981-10/19/1981 Celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown, with French President Francois Mitterand\n- 10/21/1981-10/24/1981 Cancun Summit on International Cooperation & Development\n- 10/28/1981 Airborne Warning & Control System (AWACS) Sale to Saudi Arabia Approved by the Senate\n- 11/10/1981 Director of the Office of Management & Budget David Stockman's Atlantic Monthly Article on Reaganomics Released\n- 11/18/1981 Arms Reduction Speech to the National Press Club\n- 11/23/1981 First Veto - 1982 Continuing Budget Resolution\n- 12/01/1981 White House Conference on Aging\n- 12/22/1981 Meeting with Defected Polish Ambassador Romuald Spasowski\n- 12/23/1981 Address to the Nation on the Situation in Poland\n1982\n- 01/26/1982 First State of the Union Address - Social Programs Transferred to States\n- 02/09/1982 Indianapolis Speech, One of Several Launching New Federalism\n- 02/22/1982 Ceremony on the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington\n- 02/24/1982 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) Announced at Organization of American States (OAS)\n- 03/03/1982 J.

Bush, President and Mrs. Reagan Return to California\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        October 13, 1982\nMy fellow Americans:\nIn recent days all of us have been swamped by a sea of economic statistics -- some good, some bad, and some just plain confusing. There are times when I think that the paper traffic that crosses my desk in a week could fill a big-city phone book, and then some.\nThe value of the dollar is up around the world. Interest rates are down by 40 percent. The stock and bond markets surge upward. Inflation is down 59 percent. Buying power is going up. Some economic indicators are down; others are up. But the dark cloud of unemployment hangs over the lives of 11 million of our friends, neighbors, and family.\nAt times, the sheer weight of all these facts and figures make them hard for anyone to understand. What do they really mean, and what can we do to make them better?\nWell, the first step is to understand what they mean in human terms -- how they're affecting the everyday lives of our people, because behind every one of those numbers are millions of individual lives -- young couples struggling to make ends meet, teenagers looking for work, older Americans threatened by inflation, small businessmen fighting for survival, and parents working for a better future for their children.\nAll of them have one thing in common. They're Americans who love this country of ours and want to make it a better place. They're brave, hard-working people who know that America today faces serious problems that were long years in the making. And they're desperately trying to make sense out of all the statistics, slogans, and political jargon filling the airwaves in this election year. Above all, they're concerned citizens who are looking for guideposts on the road to recovery -- for ways to help see our country through to better times.\nI know because I hear from hundreds of them every day -- in meetings here at the White House; on visits to schools, meeting halls, factories, and fairgrounds across the country; and in thousands of phone calls and letters. I only wish I could share with you tonight all that they have to say -- their hopes, their fears, their concerns, and most of all, their quiet, patient courage. But let me just give you one example that speaks for so many of you, a letter from a wife and mother named Judith, who lives in Selma, Alabama.\n``Dear Mr. President,'' she writes, ``It's 3:45 a.m., and for over an hour I've been unable to sleep . . . this morning I need very much to believe in something . . . I'm not writing so much as an individual, but as a representative of so many. We need to talk with you -- to believe that you hear us . . .\n``After years of training and experience, we can't find jobs. National unemployment figures sound almost healthy next to the almost 19 percent we're enduring in Selma.\n``The costs for basic survival are nearly beyond belief . . . there may never be a house -- home of our own -- that dream we've worked for for so many years . . . We have said `no' to so many things . . . we're afraid and confused. We've worked hard -- we conserved -- we planned -- we were frugal -- careful. We feel so out of control. We don't want a handout -- we just want to help make the system well again.\n``We must know that in the tons of bureaucracy . . . we've not been lost . . . we want to help. We want a better life, and we're willing to work for it. We believe. We must -- it's all we have.''\nWell, Judith, I hear you. And millions of other men and women like you stand for the values of hard work, thrift, commitment to family, and love of God that made this country so great and will make us great again. And you deserve to know what we're doing in these very difficult times to bring your dream, the American dream, back to life again, after so many years of mistakes and neglect.\nTonight, in homes across this country, unemployment is the problem uppermost on many people's minds. Getting Americans back to work is an urgent priority for all of us and especially for this administration. But remember, you can't solve unemployment without solving the things that caused it, the out-of-control government spending, the skyrocketing inflation and interest rates that led to unemployment in the first place. Unless you get at the root causes of the problem -- which is exactly what our economic program is doing -- you may be able to temporarily relieve the symptoms, but you'll never cure the disease. You may even make it worse.\nI have a special reason for wanting to solve this problem in a lasting way. I was 21 and looking for work in 1932, one of the worst years of the Great Depression. And I can remember one bleak night in the thirties when my father learned on Christmas Eve that he'd lost his job. To be young in my generation was to feel that your future had been mortgaged out from under you, and that's a tragic mistake we must never allow our leaders to make again. Today's young people must never be held hostage to the mistakes of the past. The only way to avoid making those mistakes again is to learn from them.\nThe pounding economic hangover America's suffering from didn't come about overnight. And there's no single instant cure. In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the ``blame game.'' The accusing finger has been pointed in every direction of the compass, and a lot of time and hot air have been spent looking for scapegoats. Well, there's plenty of blame to go around.\nThe problems we face are bigger than any one party or group of people. They're the result not of weeks or months, but of years, even decades of past mistakes. The problem isn't who to blame; it's what to blame. So, tonight, let's forget about party politics and take a look at how our country got into this fix and what we can do to get her out of it.\nWhen I said this problem was years in the making, I wasn't just using a figure of speech. This chart shows you what I mean. You see that red line? It represents the rate of unemployment from 1968 through the present, and it tells us two important things. First of all, it's a jagged line, representing rises and dips in unemployment as our economy passed through boom periods and bust periods over the past decade. This reminds us that the current recession is part of a long series -- a series that hasn't stopped, because in the past, when the crunch came, too many in government resorted to quick fixes instead of getting to the root cause.\nEach time they applied the quick fixes, unemployment dipped for a while, only to take off again. In that sense, you could say that we've been on a decade-long roller coaster ride. The only difference is that on a roller coaster you end up on solid ground once the ride is over. As you can see from the chart, while unemployment zig-zagged from year to year, its long-term direction kept notching upward. Notice that each so-called recovery left unemployment higher than before the recession.\nIn 1968 unemployment stood at 3.6 percent. In 1971 it shot up to 5.9 percent. Then it started coming down again, but instead of going all the way back to 3.6 percent, it bottomed out at 4.9 percent. In 1974 it started shooting up again, and the same thing happened. It bottomed out at a higher level than before. In other words, for all its short-term ups and downs, the unemployment roller coaster was really an escalator, edging its way up the charts throughout the last decade. Unless we reverse that trend, it can only get worse -- not just for us but for our children and grandchildren.\nNow let's look at what's behind this bad trend in unemployment. What's been causing it for over a decade? A second chart tells much of the story. But before we look at it, I'll bet many of you have already come up with the answer. It's a phenomenon that, last year, a majority of Americans correctly identified as our single most pressing long-term problem: inflation.\nInflation and the high interest rates it leads to are the real culprits. They create the economic climate that leads to unemployment.\nThis blue line represents inflation. Like unemployment, inflation has zig-zagged over the last decade, but you can see that, up to now, the long-term trend has been upwards. Again, as with unemployment, the old quick fixes simply did not work. Each time they were applied, they gave a little temporary relief to the patient, but left him weaker than he was before.\nIt's a consistent pattern. Each time inflation has shot up since 1969 there has been a deadly, delayed reaction of rising unemployment. Inflation is like a virus in the economic bloodstream, sometimes dormant and sometimes active, but leaving the patient weaker after every new attack.\nMy fellow Americans, we've got to stop these trendlines to disaster.\nTo do that, we have to understand what causes them. Well, for starters, our Federal Government has been living beyond its means for more than a generation. One of the wisest of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, warned that the public debt is ``the greatest of dangers to be feared.'' He believed that is was wrong for one generation to forever burden the generations yet to come, and for the first 150 years of our history, our leaders heeded Jefferson's warning.\nBut not lately. In our lifetimes we've seen government spending rage out of control. We've only had one balanced budget in the last 22 years. So, now we're staggering under a trillion-dollar debt. This year, before government can spend one dime to feed the hungry, care for the sick, or protect our freedom, it must plan to spend $110 billion just to pay interest on that debt. And still the big spenders wonder why the American people want what a stubborn minority in the House of Representatives denied them just 12 days ago: a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\nAll of this government spending and red ink can only spawn higher taxes and whopping deficits which for nearly two decades led to inflationary increases in the money supply. Inflation and massive government borrowing drive up interest rates. That makes it difficult or impossible for families to get the credit they need to buy homes, cars, and appliances or for businesses to invest in greater productivity. And ultimately inflation leads to recession and unemployment.\nWe've had eight recessions since World War II. At the bottom of it all is inflation, government-caused inflation. Over the years our leaders adopted something called the new economics based on a belief that a little inflation each year created prosperity. But each time the economic disruption caused by inflation triggered another round of recession and high unemployment. The government reacted not like your family would, by putting its own house in order, but by spending, borrowing, and printing more money.\nUnemployment would dip for a time, but the same quick fix that temporarily eased unemployment was sending inflation back through the ceiling. It was a vicious cycle. Too many people played politics with the economy for too long, and those twin disaster lines kept inching ominously upward, bringing our society closer and closer to catastrophe.\nIn a way I guess I can understand why so many of our political leaders fell into this trap. I'm sure they did it with the best of intentions. It's easy to lose touch with reality when it is other people's money that you're spending. And there are so many things you want to do for those or this or that special-interest group -- so many programs, many of them quite attractive and well-meaning, that can only be subsidized by more government taxing, spending, and borrowing. I can understand how it happened. Indeed, like many others, for a time I accepted government's claim that it was sound economics. But there came a day when I and millions of other Americans began to realize the terrible consequences of all those years of playing politics as usual while the economic disaster lines crept higher and higher.\nWell, at my age I didn't come to Washington to play politics as usual. I didn't come here to reward pressure groups by spending other people's money. And most of all, I didn't come here to further mortgage the future of the American people just to buy a little short-term political popularity. I came to Washington to try to solve problems, not to sweep them under the rug and leave them for those who will come later.\nA President's greatest responsibility is to protect all our people from enemies, foreign and domestic. Here at home the worst enemy we face is economic -- the creeping erosion of the American way of life and the American dream that has resulted in today's tragedy of economic stagnation and unemployment.\nNow, I don't pretend for a moment that, in 21 months, we've been able to undo all the damage to our economy that has built up over more than 20 years. The first part of our program has been in the books only 1 year and 13 days. Much of the legislation we need has still not been enacted. We've still got a long way to go before we restore our prosperity. But what I can report to you tonight, my fellow Americans, is that at long last your government has a program in place that faces our problems and has already started solving them.\nTwenty-one months ago, we faced five critical problems: high taxes, runaway government spending, inflation, high interest rates, and unemployment. Getting to the roots of unemployment meant fighting inflation and high interest rates caused by runaway government spending and taxing, because we know that when inflation shoots up, it triggers a delayed-action rise in unemployment. Now inflation is being driven back down, and lower unemployment will follow.\nSo, we started by winning the first real tax cut for the American people in nearly two decades. Our program brings down income tax rates 25 percent. At the same time, we've been cutting costly, wasteful government regulations and the rate of increase in government spending. We've reduced the rate of government spending growth by nearly two-thirds. Inflation, which registered 12.4 percent in 1980, is down to just 5.1 percent so far this year.\nInterest rates, which had climbed as high as 21\\1/2\\ percent before we took office, have this week fallen to 12 percent -- not low enough, but certainly heading in the right direction. Unemployment, always a lagging indicator in times of recession, has not yet stopped its upward drift.\nBut in 21 months, we've already brought tax rates down by a quarter, with the third installment coming next July, and brought down the rate of increase in government spending by nearly two-thirds. That's helped us to bring down the rate of inflation by more than half, and that's helped us to bring down interest rates by 40 percent.\nSo, on four out of five problems that faced us in 1980, we've made important progress. We haven't solved them all, but we're making headway.\nJust last week, the Federal Reserve Bank decided to lower its discount rate to 9.5 percent -- the first time this key interest rate has gone below two digits since 1979, and the fifth reduction in just 4 months. This demonstrates the Fed's confidence that inflation and market rates will continue coming down and its confidence that we can work together for a healthy, noninflationary recovery. All of this lays the goundwork for a recovery that will mean more jobs and more opportunity for all our people. But it's a delayed reaction.\nRemember the trendlines. Just as surely as skyrocketing inflation created a negative reaction that drove up unemployment, bringing down inflation and interest rates is creating a positive reaction that will boost employment. I wish there were a quicker, easier way -- some magic short-cut -- but unemployment is always one of the last things to turn around as an economy heads into recovery. And make no mistake, America is recovery bound. And the world knows it.\nThe American dollar, beaten down and distrusted in the late 1970's, is showing new strength. Recently, we've been seeing a surge of investment in our stock and bond markets. This is no flash in the pan. Markets will go up and they will come down, but the trend in the United States is up. What's more, this investment is coming from all over, from home, from abroad, from small investors on Main Street to those who manage billions of dollars, including our workers' pension funds.\nWhy aren't these people heeding the drumbeat of doom and gloom coming from Washington? Because they've been watching this country's inflation and interest rates dropping for months. They realize this administration means business in the battle against inflation. Their decision to put cash on the line is a strong vote of confidence in the foundation being laid for America's recovery -- healthy, stable growth that will bring new jobs and opportunity for our people without returning us to runaway inflation and interest rates. That's the one big difference between the recovery America is headed for today and the shaky, temporary recoveries of the recent past. This one is built to last.\nWith your support, we can show the world that we've learned our lesson and that this time we're going to get the job done and get it done right. This time, we're going to keep inflation, interest rates and government spending, taxing and borrowing down, and get Americans back on the job.\nMuch of the work that remains to be done requires congressional cooperation. As you know, Congress adjourned October 2d for the election campaign. But it left behind a lot of unfinished business. For this reason, I urge the Congress to reconvene after the elections so that it can do its part as quickly as possible to continue the work of recovery. We simply can't afford to wait until next year when something as vital as the economic health of America is at stake.\nThe Congress will return on November 29th. It will face five top economic priorities, priorities that must be addressed.\nFirst, the Congress must do its part to control government spending. Before adjourning, it sent me only two appropriation bills. Eleven more remain to be passed. And I will use the veto, if necessary, to keep them within the budget. When the Congress passed the tax package this summer, it pledged to save $3 in outlays for every $1 in new revenues. I intend to hold the Congress to its word.\nSecond, I urge the Congress to reconsider the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. This crucial measure was passed by the Senate and supported by a clear majority in the House of Representatives. It was only defeated because of the hard core opposition of a minority of Representatives who prefer continued big spending.\nThird, the Congress should act on regulatory reform to help make government more economical and efficient and the private sector more productive. Regulatory reform legislation was passed unanimously by the Senate but was bottled up in committee in the House.\nFourth, the time has come for passage of the enterprise zones initiative to revive declining inner city and rural communities by providing new incentives to develop business and jobs. This program was approved by the Senate Finance Committee, but still awaits action on the Senate floor and in the House.\nAnd, fifth, we need to pass the clean air bill which, while protecting the environment, will make it possible for industry to rebuild its productive base and create more jobs.\nBut it's not an easy job, this challenge to rebuild America and renew the American dream. And I know it can be tempting, listening to some who would go back to the old ways and the quick fix. But consider the choice. A return to the big spending and big taxing that left us with 21\\1/2\\-percent interest rates is no real alternative. A return to double-digit inflation is no alternative. A return to taxing and taxing the American people -- that's no alternative. That's what destroyed millions of American jobs.\nTogether we've chosen a new road for America. It's a far better road. We need only the courage to see it through. I know we can. Throughout our history, we Americans have proven again and again that no challenge is too big for a free, united people. Together, we can do it again. We can do it by slowly but surely working our way back to prosperity that will mean jobs for all who are willing to work, and fulfillment for all who still cherish the American dream.\nWe can do it, my fellow Americans, by staying the course.\nThank you, good night, and God bless you.\nNote: The President spoke at 7:30 p.m. from the Oval Office at the White House. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}}
