Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

To meet this requirement, we must investigate all eligibility issues which could suspend, reduce or cancel benefits, obtaining and recording the information necessary to determine the claimant's eligibility regardless of its source.\nThe department is unaware of eligibility issues unless someone brings them to our attention. The claimant is asked questions that would alert us to eligibility issues when (s)he makes an initial claim application and when (s)he files a weekly certification for benefits. However, we rely heavily on employers to verify information from the claimant and to bring other eligibility issues to our attention. The most common method that employers use to notify us about eligibility issues is completing and returning a required report which includes information about the eligibility issue (see Part 5). However, you may call or write to us at any time to raise an eligibility issue. The Employer Assistance Line and Help Center address is available online at https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/ui201/phone201.htm. Be sure to include the claimant's social security number and your UI account number in any correspondence.\nIt is important for you to bring eligibility issues to our attention in a timely manner, even when your account is not currently liable for benefits paid to the claimant. If you have submitted a required benefit report and neglected to raise an eligibility question on the report itself, you should contact the Help Center shown on the report as soon as you recognize your error. (If you did not keep a copy of the report, call the Employer Assistance Line at (414) 438-7705.) Provide all supporting facts which pertain to the issue you are raising. If you take action to notify us immediately, you will reduce the likelihood of our paying benefits erroneously to the claimant. (See Part 5 for information about the effect of raising a late eligibility issue on your UI account.)\nWhen an eligibility issue is raised, a fact-finding investigation is conducted and the claimant is always given an opportunity to give a statement about the issue. Usually we need additional information from employers to resolve the issue. If the issue being investigated is a discharge, we often send a letter to the employer before the claimants interview to find out why the claimant was discharged, what prior incidents, if any, were also a factor, if progressive discipline was used, etc. The adjudicator may also follow-up the letter with a telephone call for clarification. The claimant can then respond to the specific allegations the employer has made when (s)he gives a statement.\nIf you are contacted for information about an eligibility issue, respond by the deadline you are given. Your account will be charged for all benefits erroneously paid if you fail to provide correct and complete information requested during a fact-finding investigation, including erroneously paid benefits that were originally charged to other employers' accounts.\nOnce all the facts are gathered a written determination will be mailed to you if you are considered the party of interest. The employer party of interest is the employer whose interests may be adversely affected by an agency decision regarding the claimant's eligibility for benefits. It may be the employer who is a party to the issue or the currently liable employer.\nA copy of a written determination can be found in Part 9 of this section. If you or the claimant feel the determination is incorrect, you both have the right to appeal the determination and request a hearing. (See Section 3 for details about the appeal process.)\nThe following is an alphabetical listing of the most common eligibility issues that may result in a denial, suspension or reduction of benefits and the type of supporting facts needed for these issues. The appropriate statute section is cited. More than one eligibility issue may apply to a claimant. If so, when you are raising a question of eligibility, be sure to indicate all eligibility issues that apply and include supporting facts for each one.\nNo benefits are payable for any week in which a claimant earns wages, misses wages by missing work, and/or receives or will receive holiday, vacation, dismissal, sick pay, bonus pay, back pay, or temporary total, permanent total, or temporary partial disability payments exceeding $500 in the week.\nA claimant is ineligible for benefits for any week in which (s)he worked, missed work and/or received or will receive holiday, vacation, dismissal or sick pay totaling 32 or more hours from one or more employers.\nSection 108.04(5) & 108.04(5g)\nThere are two law sections that address discharges: 108.04(5) which disqualifies employees who are discharged for misconduct connected with their employment and 108.04(5g) which disqualifies employees who are discharged for substantial fault connected with their employment.\nAn employee's behavior may be misconduct when it shows a willful and substantial disregard of the employer's interests or is not within the standards of behavior employers have a right to expect of all employees. You may have valid reasons for discharging an employee, however, under UI law; the reason for the discharge may not be considered misconduct.\nWe consider several factors when deciding if a discharge was for misconduct:\nThe burden for establishing misconduct is on the employer.\nYour work rules play an important part in a discharge investigation. Rules must be reasonable, known to the employee and consistently enforced. A violation of a reasonable work rule is not automatically misconduct. For example, it is not misconduct when an employee is discharged for violating the employer’s attendance policy when the absences were with notice and for valid reasons such as illness.\nAn employee must be made aware that (s)he is in danger of losing his/her job. Warnings should be given even if the rule violation is obvious, such as being late or absent. The employee should be told 1) what rule was broken, 2) how it was broken, 3) what to do to correct the problem and 4) most importantly, the consequences if there is no correction or for repeating the behavior.\nWarnings may be written or verbal but should all be documented. Detailed records of violations and warnings should include:\nIf the employee refuses to sign a written warning saying (s)he acknowledges receiving the warning, have a witness document this refusal on the warning.\nIf you have a progressive discipline policy you should adhere to it. If an employee is discharged when the next step in the disciplinary process should have been a written warning or suspension, it will be more difficult for you to show that the employee knew (s)he was going to lose his/her job for the next violation.\nWhen an employee is discharged for misconduct, (s)he is not eligible to receive benefits until 7 weeks have elapsed after the week of the discharge and (s)he has earned wages in covered employment equal to at least 14 times the weekly benefit rate that would have been paid had the discharge not occurred.\nIn addition, wages earned from the discharging employer are permanently removed from the claim so you will not be liable for benefits even if the claimant requalifies.\nIf it cannot be determined that the employee was discharged for misconduct, a disqualification under substantial fault will be considered. An employee’s behavior may lead to a finding of substantial fault when the employee violates a requirement of the employer by acting or failing to act when the action or inaction was within the employee’s control and the violation does not rise to the level of misconduct.\nWe consider several factors when deciding if a discharge was for substantial fault:\nThe burden for establishing substantial fault is on the employer.\nCircumstances that cannot be considered substantial fault include:\nDisqualification for Discharges for Substantial Fault – The employee is not eligible to receive benefits until 7 weeks have elapsed after the week of the discharge AND (s)he has earned wages equal to at least 14 times the weekly benefit rate that would have been paid had the discharge not occurred.\nOnce the claimant has requalified, (s)he is eligible to receive benefits based on the work performed prior to the discharge. A contributing employer's (paying a quarterly UI tax), account is not charged for benefits paid based on work performed prior to the discharge. A reimbursable employer (billed monthly for UI benefits paid rather than paying a quarterly UI tax), is liable for benefits paid based on work performed prior to the discharge.\nSections 108.02(10m), (22m) & 108.04(17)(a)-(k); DWD 132.04\nBenefits are not payable to educational (school year) employees:\nSchool year employees are individuals who are not hired to work on a year-round basis AND who work for:\nAn educational institution is a school which provides education and/or training, maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and has a regular, organized body of students in attendance.\nReasonable assurance occurs if the terms and conditions of the work to be performed in the subsequent academic year or term, or in the period immediately following a vacation period or holiday recess, are reasonably similar to the terms and conditions of the work the employee performed in the prior academic year or term, or in the period immediately preceding a vacation period or holiday recess.\nWork is reasonably similar if:\nIn addition, for customary vacation periods and holiday recesses, the individual must have worked during the period immediately prior to the vacation period or holiday recess and have reasonable assurance of performing similar work in the period immediately following the vacation period or holiday recess.\nIf the individual who has filed a claim for unemployment insurance worked for you as a school year employee, enter the phrase \"school year employee\" on Form UCB-16 or Form UCB-23.\nIf an individual who was not given reasonable assurance is provided assurance of similar work on a later date, notify the department when that assurance is given.\nBe prepared to provide the following information:\nA school year employee who does not have reasonable assurance will be advised to contact the department as soon as he/she receives reasonable assurance of similar work. If the individual is offered work and refuses it, contact the Employer Assistance Line at (414) 438-7705.\nAny benefits paid beyond the week in which reasonable assurance is obtained will be considered to have been erroneously paid. If you did not identify the individual as a school year employee, your account will be charged for any erroneously paid benefits.\nBenefits are retroactively payable to any nonprofessional school year employee who was given reasonable assurance of similar work but then was not offered the opportunity to perform such work, if the individual is otherwise eligible.\nEmployment can be excluded for tax purposes and/or for benefit purposes. When work is excluded for tax purposes, it is also excluded for benefit purposes. However, there are some kinds of employment that are taxable yet excluded for benefit purposes. (See Section 2, Part 2 for more information about employment excluded for tax purposes.)\nWhen employment is excluded for benefit purposes, the wages from such employment cannot be included as base period wages to determine if the claimant has met the qualifying requirements, nor can they be used to compute the claimant's benefit entitlement. However, claimants must report work and wages from excluded employment on their weekly claim certifications and the partial wage formula is applied to these wages when determining the amount of benefits payable for a week of unemployment.\nBenefit exclusions are categorized by type of employer. Some apply only to governmental units, some apply only to private employers, others apply only to nonprofit employers, etc.\nThe following chart shows the types of employment that are potentially excluded for benefit purposes. In each case, certain conditions must be met before a finding can be made that the employment is excluded.\nAn asterisk indicates that the employment is taxable but excluded for benefit purposes. All types of employment without an asterisk are excluded for both tax and benefit purposes.\nEmployment:\nEmployment:\nEmployment:\nEmployment:\nEmployment:\nEmployment:\nEmployment:\nWhen an owner of a business or certain relatives of an owner file unemployment claims, the employer is required to report this information as an eligibility issue on Form UCB-16, Separation Notice, for each individual who files a claim. The following paragraphs explain how UI eligibility is determined for owners and specified family members employed by various types of family businesses.\nA single-member LLC will be treated as a sole proprietorship and a multimember LLC will be treated as a partnership. A LLC will be treated as a corporation only if: 1) the LLC has filed an election with the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be treated as a corporation for federal tax purposes; 2) the IRS has agreed to treat the LLC as a corporation; and 3) the department receives proof (Notice of Acceptance for IRS approving LLC status or letter from IRS that states \"Your filing requirement is Form 1120\"). For benefit purposes, the department will treat the LLC as a corporation for benefit years established on or after the date the IRS applies the treatment as long as that benefit year has not ended when the department first becomes aware of the eligibility issue related to treatment of the LLC.\nWork performed for a family corporation, by either the claimant or the claimant's family members, is covered employment. However, base period wages from a family corporation cannot exceed 10 times the weekly benefit rate (WBR) based solely on that employment when calculating the maximum benefit amount whenever:\nClaimant owns 30% of the corporation and was paid $20,000 in the base period, $5,000 in each quarter.\nClaimant's weekly benefit rate is 4% of high quarter wages ($5000) = $200\nClaimant's base period wages are reduced to $2000 (10XWBR).\nClaimant's monetary entitlement (duration) is lesser of:\nClaimant's spouse owns 60% of the corporation and the claimant was paid $24,000 in the base period, $6000 in each quarter.\nClaimant's weekly benefit rate is 4% of high quarter wages ($6000) = $240\nClaimant's base period wages are reduced to $2400 (10XWBR)\nClaimant's monetary entitlement (duration) is lesser of:\nIf the business involuntarily ceases operation, base period wages will not be reduced as long as one of the following actions have taken place before the claimant files an initial claim application for benefits:\nSee Part 2 of Section 2 (Tax) entitled \"Covered and Excluded Employment\"\nAn employee who is unemployed because of a strike or other bona fide labor dispute in the establishment in which (s)he is employed is not eligible for unemployment benefits based on wages for work performed before the labor dispute began. Benefits can be paid based on work performed after the start of labor dispute if the claimant meets the qualifying wage requirements based on wages for that work alone.\nIf a labor dispute occurs in your establishment, call the Employer Assistance Line at (414) 438-7705 as soon as possible. We will need to know:\nSee Unable/Unavailable for work.\nA claimant is not available for work in any week in which he/she is located in a country other than the US or Canada for more than 48 hours.\nSome employees must possess a valid license issued by the government to perform their jobs. If this license is suspended, revoked or not renewed and the employee is at fault for losing the license, (s)he may not be eligible for unemployment benefits if you suspend or terminate the employee because (s)he can no longer perform his/her customary work for you due to the lost license.\nWhen all of the required conditions exist for applying this section of law, the claimant is not eligible for any benefits as of the week in which the suspension/termination occurred. The disqualification continues for the next 5 weeks or until the license is reinstated or renewed, whichever occurs first.\nIf the claimants license is not reinstated or renewed before the 5-week disqualification period ends, the claimant can start receiving unemployment benefits only if (s)he has remaining entitlement from wages paid by other liable employers. Your pro-rated share of these benefits is charged to the funds balancing account.\nYour account will not be charged for benefits paid to the claimant until the license is restored.\nYour account will not be charged for benefits paid to the claimant even after the license is restored, benefits will be charged to the fund's balancing account. However, if the employee returns to work after the license is renewed/reinstated your account may be charged in the future.\nPension payments include periodic and lump sum payments from retirement accounts, pensions, annuities, some 401(k)s and railroad retirement payments. When certain criteria are met, weekly benefits are reduced by the percentage of the pension financed by the employer.\nPension payments result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the amount of benefits payable to the claimant for a given week. Pension payments are not treated the same as wages (see Part 6 for the treatment of \"wages\").\nSocial Security Benefits [Retirement and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)] and disability payments from the Veterans' Administration do not reduce UI benefits.\n108.04(8)(b), 108.133, DWD 131 and 108.04(9)(b)\nAn employing unit may submit to the department information that an individual has either tested positive or refused to submit to a test for the unlawful use of controlled substances as a conditional offer of employment:\nThe information must be submitted on form UCB-18102-E, Pre-Employment Drug Testing - Employer Reported Refusal to Submit or Positive Test Result, to the department within 3 business days of the employing unit receiving a positive test result for a controlled substance for which the individual did not have a valid prescription.\nForm UCB-18102-E must be fully completed, signed, required documentation attached and then mailed or faxed to the department. Forms submitted without complete information and required attachments will not be given consideration.\nThe information must be submitted on form UCB-18102-E, Pre-Employment Drug Testing - Employer Reported Refusal to Submit or Positive Test Result, to the department within 3 business days from the date the individual declined to submit to the test for the unlawful use of controlled substances.\nForm UCB-18102-E must be fully completed, signed, required documentation attached and then mailed or faxed to the department. Forms submitted without complete information and required attachments will not be given consideration.\nIf it is determined that a claimant declined to take a drug test or tested positive for the unlawful use of a controlled substance and the offer was rescinded, the department will presume that the claimant refused suitable work without good cause and benefits will be denied. The claimant may rebut the presumption that (s)he refused suitable work without good cause by, among other things, proving that the work was substantially less favorable to the claimant. The claimant is ineligible as of the week the job was to begin and until (s)he has earned wages in covered employment after the week of the refusal equal to at least 6 times the weekly benefit rate that would have been paid had the claimant not been disqualified. Once the claimant requalifies, (s)he is again eligible to receive benefits, but if you are a contributing (taxable) employer, your account is not charged for benefits paid that are based on work performed prior to the work refusal. A claimant who fails a pre-employment drug test may remain eligible for benefits if the claimant enrolls in and complies with a drug treatment program, completes a job skills assessment, and otherwise meets all program requirements.\nBenefits are not payable to a claimant who was paid a substantial portion of the base period wages for work performed as a professional athlete, if the claimant has reasonable assurance of work as a professional athlete in the next sports season.\nIf this provision applies, enter the phrase \"professional athlete - between seasons\" on the benefit report. Indicate the ending date of the last season and the estimated beginning date of the next season. Explain how the claimant has reasonable assurance for work in the next season. Reasonable assurance generally requires a contract for the next season.\nIf the claimant’s reason for quitting is “not within any of the exceptions” (s)he is not eligible to receive benefits until (s)he has earned wages in covered employment equal to at least 6 times the weekly benefit rate that would have paid had the quit not occurred.\nOnce the claimant has requalified, (s)he is eligible to receive benefits based on the work performed prior to the quit. However, if you are a contributing employer (paying a quarterly UI tax), your account is not charged for benefits paid based on work performed for you before the claimant quit. If you are a reimbursable employer (billed monthly for UI benefits paid rather than paying a quarterly UI tax), you are liable for your portion of the benefits paid after the claimant requalifies.\nOften, a claimant has already satisfied the work requalification requirement for quitting a job with you before an unemployment claim is filed. When this happens, you are sent this notice to let you know 1) that we are aware that the claimant quit, 2) that (s)he has satisfied the work requalification requirement and 3) whether or not you will be charged for benefits based on work performed before the quit. See Part 9 for more information about this form.\n(NOTE: Even if you are not charged for the benefits being paid to a claimant, you will continue to receive correspondence about the claim if benefits are being paid based on work performed for you. This correspondence does not mean that you are now going to be charged for benefits.)\nThere are a number of reasons for quitting where benefits can be paid without imposing the standard disqualification. Each exception requires certain conditions be met before it can be applied. The exceptions permit the immediate payment of benefits. You will be contacted before a decision is issued that applies an exception to the standard quit disqualification.\nMany of the exceptions relieve contributing employers of liability for benefits paid based on work performed before the quit. However, this relief of liability does not apply to reimbursable employers.\nThe following chart includes a brief description of all current exceptions, whether the exception imposes any disqualification and whether contributing employers will be charged for benefits.\n| EXCEPTIONS TO THE STANDARD QUIT DISQUALIFICATION | ||\n|---|---|---|\n| Conditions Required to Apply Each Exception | If the Exception Applies, is there Any Disqualification? | If the Exception Applies, are Contributing Employers Relieved of Charges? |\nAccepting a layoff:\n|\nNo | No |\nQuitting with good cause attributable to the employer.\n|\nNo | No |\nQuitting because:\n|\nNo | Yes |\nQuitting because:\n|\nNo | Yes |\nQuitting because:\n|\nNo | No |\n|\nQuitting a job:\n|\nNo | Yes |\nQuitting to take another job that:\n|\nNo, there is no required wage that must be earned with the new job | Yes |\nQuitting a job:\n|\nNo | Yes |\nQuitting a job:\n|\nNo | Yes |\nQuitting a job: To relocate with a spouse\n|\nNo | Yes |\nSexual Harassment\n|\nIf an employee requests to reduce his/her hours of work, this reduction may be considered a quit. If so, the wages that the employee earns from you while working the reduced hours cannot be used to satisfy the requalification for quitting as long as you notify the employee in writing that this may be the result of such a request before you grant the request. If after receiving this written notification the employee decides not to reduce his/her hours, the employee will not be considered to have quit, even if you do not allow him/her to continue working the original number of hours.\nThe following is suggested wording for the written notification to be given to employees who voluntarily request a reduction in hours:\n\"Because you have requested a voluntary reduction in the number of hours you are working, you are notified that for Wisconsin Unemployment Insurance purposes, your reduction in hours may be considered a quit. Any wages that you earn while you are working the reduced hours may not be used to satisfy the quit requalification provision.\"\nThe employment relationship in the temporary help industry is different from the employment relationship that exists in most other industries. In the temporary help industry, employees are generally assigned to a series of short-term assignments. Commonly, when an assignment ends, there will be a short delay before the next assignment begins. Because both parties acknowledge and accept this as a condition of the employment relationship, the short break between assignments may not terminate the employment relationship. The rules for the continuation of an employment relationship are found in the Administrative Code DWD 133.\nFor a temporary help employer, as would be true with any other employer, if at the time an assignment ends the employer does not have an additional assignment for the employee, the employment relationship ends. If the employer does have another assignment for the employee within the conditions of the written application, the employment relationship continues to exist, and an employee who refuses the assignment is then considered to have voluntarily quit. If the assignment is outside of the conditions under which the employee offered to work on the written application, the employment relationship ends and if refused, the issue is resolved as a failure to accept a new offer of work.\nDue to the unique nature of the temporary help industry, the following guidelines are applied:\nBe prepared to provide the following information:\nSee \"Quit: Voluntary Reduction of Hours\"\nThis section applies when a claimant fails to accept an offer of work which is made by a prospective employer. It also may apply when a claimant is recalled to work by a former employer but does not receive the notice of recall.\nThe job offer must be a bona fide attempt to secure the claimant's services. In most cases, it is an unconditional offer of work that the claimant has the opportunity to accept or reject and all the specifics of the job (wages, hours, duties and other conditions) must be explained or available to the claimant simply by requesting them of you.\nBenefits, by law, cannot be denied for refusing new work if the wages, hours or other conditions are less favorable than those prevailing for similar work in the locality. New work is:\n(Note: See application of \"new work\" to offers made by temporary help agencies.)\nThe claimant may have \"good cause\" for refusing a job. If so, and the claimant is able to work and available for suitable work in his/her labor market, benefits would be allowed.\nIf a claimant refuses an offer of work from you or fails to return to work for you after being duly recalled, notify the department immediately, providing:\nIf it is determined that a claimant refused a bona fide offer of suitable work from you without good cause and the wages, hours and other conditions of the job were not substantially less favorable than those prevailing for similar work in the locality, benefits will be denied. The claimant is ineligible as of the week the job was to begin and (s)he has earned wages in covered employment after the week of the refusal equal to at least 6 times the weekly benefit rate that would have been paid had the claimant not been disqualified. Once the claimant has requalified, (s)he is again eligible to receive benefits, but if you are a contributing (taxable) employer, your account is not charged for benefits paid that are based on work performed prior to the work refusal.\nSee \"Employees of Educational Institutions\"\nSelf-employment is defined as the formation, development or operation of a trade, a business, an enterprise or a profession for the purpose of producing income. It generally takes the form of a sole proprietorship or a partnership.\nBenefits are not payable to a self-employed individual if the self-employment activities substantially limit his/her availability for work with other employers.\nAll individuals claiming UI benefits, including self-employed claimants, must search for work unless specifically excused. (See Part 3.)\nSelf-employment income is not treated as wages which would reduce benefits paid for a week of unemployment nor is the self-employment income used as base period wages.\nSee \"Unable/Unavailable for Work\"\nIf an employee is placed on a suspension for good cause, benefits will not be paid for the week that the suspension began and the following 3 weeks OR for the duration of the suspension, whichever is shorter.\nA suspension is usually considered good cause when it is a reasonable response to inappropriate behavior or a rule violation. Your action is considered reasonable when you can establish that the inappropriate behavior was within the employee's ability to control or that the employee was responsible for the work rule violation. Generally, if another employer would suspend under the same circumstances and the behavior leading to the suspension was directly connected to the employee's work, the suspension is considered reasonable and for good cause.\nYou must be prepared to provide:\nIt is important to notify the department if:\nSections 108.04(2)(a), 108.04(1)(b) & (bm) & DWD 128\nAn individual who is totally unemployed must be able to work and available for work while filing for unemployment benefits. If the claimant has a restriction that prevents or restricts his/her ability or availability for work, the issue may affect his/her eligibility for benefits. A person filing for benefits makes a weekly certification and one of the questions asked is: \"Were you able to work full-time and available for full-time work?\" The individual is expected to answer this question \"no\" if his/her availability is restricted in any way.\nWhen a claimant has a work restriction and does not meet the above requirements, (s)he is not eligible to receive unemployment benefits until the able and available requirements are again met.\nThis disqualification is applicable when there is no employment relationship currently affected, but the claimant's availability for potential employment is reduced by the work restrictions.\nThis disqualification is also applicable when a claimant’s work is suspended or terminated because of work restrictions, or when a claimant is on a leave of absence. However, a partial benefit payment may be payable in the first week of a leave or the week the termination or suspension occurred if the employee misses 16 hours of work or less in that week. Be prepared to provide the starting and ending dates of the suspension, termination or leave, the date the claimant returned to work (if applicable), the amount of wages that could have been earned and the number of hours missed in the first week had the separation not occurred, and the amount of wages or other types of remuneration earned and the number of hours worked or paid in the first week of the suspension, termination or leave.\nIf the employee is able to work and available for work on the general labor market, there is no disqualification even though the employee can no longer work for you.\nNote: If you have an individual working for you who misses work during a given week, the issue is usually resolved under the \"work available\" statute. See work available provision.\nA student is generally considered unavailable for work while attending school, however there can be exceptions. A student attending a night course who is still available for full-time day shift work would normally be able and available for work. The law also makes an exception for someone who is in \"approved training\" [Section 108.04(16)]. Approved training is training through a vocational school or a school offering vocational training that has been approved by the department. Attendance at a college or university is not normally considered approved training.\nSection 108.05(3)(a), (4) & (5)\nWhen it is not clear or there is a dispute as to whether a payment should be considered benefit year wages, or when wages or other types of income are not reported by the claimant on a weekly certification for a benefit payment, an investigation is conducted. The department will issue a determination to establish whether or not the payment is to be considered wages and if so, what effect the wages have on the amount of benefits payable. (See Part 6 for detailed information about the definition of benefit year wages.)\nIf the investigation involves the claimant's failure to report the wages or payment, an investigation as to whether or not the claimant concealed the wages/pay is also conducted. (See Part 8 for more information about Fraudulent Claims.)\nSection 108.02(26m) and 108.04(3)\nWisconsin has a waiting week for Unemployment Insurance benefits. For every new benefit year, no benefits are payable for the first week a claimant would otherwise be eligible for benefits.\nWork available generally applies to the claimant who is filing claims for partial unemployment benefits while working for an employer and who misses work during a week (for example, absence during the week due to illness or personal business).\nFor this provision to be applied, the claimant must have received actual or implied notice of the work that could have been performed. An employee with a regular work schedule has sufficient notice of available work. \"Due notice\" for an employee whose schedule changes from week to week may or may not be satisfied, depending on when the schedule is received and the circumstances involved for the absence.\nWhen a decision is made that the claimant had due notice of additional work in a week, the additional gross wages the claimant could have earned are added to actual gross wages earned and other pay received for the week when determining the amount of partial unemployment benefits payable for the week.\nNo benefits are payable for any week in which a claimant earns wages, misses wages by missing work, and/or receives or will receive holiday, vacation, dismissal, sick pay, bonus pay, back pay or temporary total or temporary partial disability payments exceeding $500 in the week.\nSection 108.04(2)(a) & DWD 127\nSome claimants are not required to look for work because one of the waiver provisions applies to their claim. The most common waiver provisions are listed in Part 3.\nA claimant must conduct four work search actions each week to satisfy the work search requirements.\nA claimant required to look for work is asked to certify each week on the weekly certification for a payment. (S)he must answer a question regarding whether (s)he performed at least four work search actions in the week. If the claimant did not, (s)he is expected to answer \"no\" to this question. When a claimant answers \"no\" to this question, the department conducts an investigation.\nThe department can initiate an investigation regarding the claimant's work search efforts at any time.\nA claimant who is required to conduct work search actions but fails to do so is ineligible for benefits for the week(s) in which such failure occurred.\nIf a claimant worked for a temporary help company, (s)he may be required to contact the company for an assignment as one of the required four work search actions each week to satisfy the work search requirements.\nThe department will initiate an investigation regarding the claimant's failure to contact a temporary help company for an assignment if the temporary help company notifies the department of the issue, in writing, within 10 days after the week in which the claimant failed to contact it for an assignment.\nA claimant who is required to contact a temporary help company for an assignment as part of his or her work search requirement but fails to do so is ineligible for benefits for the week(s) in which such failure occurred.\nUpdated: October 6, 2025\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        As Prepared for Delivery on March 22, 2021\nGood morning everyone! And, thank you, Todd, for the introduction.\nI hope that 2021 is going well for you, your families, and your credit unions, and that you have all safely emerged from a truly unprecedented year. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a tremendous human toll on many of us, and it continues to pose many challenges for our country and the credit union system. And yet, during this unprecedented time, credit unions have pressed forward as financial first responders, doing their part to support their members and the communities they serve.\nToday, the credit union system sits at the intersection of several crossroads, and we each will likely face many difficult days and decisions ahead.\nState of the Credit Union Industry\nLet me start with the economy. The measures initially taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 all but ground economic activity to a halt, resulting in the loss of more than 22 million jobs and a soaring unemployment rate. But as quickly as the economy shut down, it rebounded as governments lifted restrictions on consumer and business activity and businesses began hiring again. By February, more than half of the jobs lost in March and April had been restored, and the unemployment rate declined from an 80-year high of 14.8 percent, to 6.2 percent, a sizable improvement, but still a high number.\nThe near-term outlook for the economy has improved a great deal in the last few weeks. The recently enacted $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act will help shore up household finances and is expected to give the economy a substantial boost. The return of warmer weather and rising number of Americans who have been vaccinated will also spur increased economic activity and job creation in the months ahead. Even so, it will take time for the economy to heal completely. Employment in some industries, especially the retail and travel sectors, is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon.\nUntil the labor market recovers fully, high unemployment will likely continue to impede loan demand, especially for non-mortgage consumer loans. And, it could affect the credit quality of loans already on the books. Credit unions also face a prolonged period of very low interest rates, and short-term interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future.\nLonger-term interest rates have increased recently and are expected to edge higher, but they will generally remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, suppressing already compressed net interest margins. In the year ahead, your credit union’s ability to manage interest-rate risk will play a crucial role in financial performance. In the final analysis, 2021 is likely to be a very consequential year for the credit union industry, and all of us must be prepared.\nThe NCUA’s Response to COVID-19\nGoing forward, the top priorities for the NCUA Board will be ensuring that the credit union system and the Share Insurance Fund are prepared to weather any economic fallout related to the pandemic. To protect the Fund, we are actively monitoring certain segments of the system, including credit unions closely connected to the oil and gas, travel and leisure, and agricultural sectors, among others. We are also focusing on credit unions with elevated risks, such as those with large concentrations of commercial real estate loans relative to assets.\nOne thing that seems likely is that, as during past recessions, credit union performance will trail any improvement in the unemployment rate by one to two years. Accordingly, your credit union should pay careful attention to capital, asset quality, earnings, and liquidity. You should also heed the age-old advice of a “stitch in time saving nine” by acting quickly to mitigate problems when they develop. And, as the pandemic evolves, the NCUA will continue to adjust its supervision and examination program to address potential risks to the Share Insurance Fund and the broader system.\nConsumer Financial Protection\nEqually vital to the members of credit unions is consumer financial protection and fair and equitable access to credit.\nIn 2020, NCUA examiners completed targeted reviews in all risk-focused and small credit union examinations to evaluate compliance with various consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Through quality control checks, we then observed several issues suggesting that some credit unions may not be paying close attention to consumer financial protection.\nIn some cases, NCUA’s examiners found weaknesses in credit unions’ management systems, which can lead to compliance issues, violations or harm to consumers if not adequately addressed. We also observed notable shortfalls in complying with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and the Truth in Lending Act.\nIf left unchecked, these problems could lower consumer credit scores, lead to expensive fees, and increase the cost of credit. To address these and other issues, especially as the industry grows in complexity, the NCUA must create a dedicated program to supervise for compliance with consumer financial protection and fair lending laws.\nIn doing so, we will better protect consumers’ interests, ensure that the credit union system lives up to its commitment to serve members, and provide a more comparable level of consumer protection oversight as federal bank regulators. The NCUA’s efforts to enhance oversight of consumer financial protection rules will not only protect credit union members, but also all credit unions from the reputational risks resulting from the missteps of others.\nGarnishment of Economic Stimulus Payments\nRecently, millions of credit union members also began receiving stimulus payments through the American Rescue Plan. Lawmakers intended for consumers to spend these checks on necessities like food, shelter, utilities, and medical care.\nHowever, because the new law lacks needed prohibitions, I am very concerned that some financial institutions may soon make shortsighted decisions to use these stimulus funds to instead pay for overdraft fees, outstanding debts, and other liabilities. Financially stressed American consumers deserve better treatment.\nAs financial first responders who support their members in times of need, many federally insured credit unions have already voluntarily decided to protect their members’ relief payments from collection, garnishment, and the right of offset. By demonstrating the cooperative philosophy at the heart of the credit union movement, these credit unions are doing the right thing. And, as American consumers — many of whom are disproportionately people of color — struggle through the economic shock inflicted by the COVID-19 crisis, all credit unions should strive to live up to this foundational principle.\nBut, a small number may chose a different course. Like a pickpocket on the subway, they may grab the stimulus money meant for daily living expenses from their members. Credit unions that do so should fear the reputational risk they will face by failing to accommodate the needs of their members during tough times. Such practices will sacrifice the long-term financial viability of their credit union and create negative publicity for the entire credit union system.\nWhen I spoke about this issue last year after the enactment of the CARES Act, I noted that it is time for all credit unions to heed the lyrics of Bill Withers who sang, “Lean on me, when you’re not strong, and I’ll be your friend. I’ll help you carry on.” Credit unions that follow this wise, timeless advice will serve their members, themselves, the credit union system, and our economy well in the long term.\nEconomic Equity and Justice\nLastly, I want to focus on economic equity and justice, which are vital to the continued health and success of the credit union system.\nBy enhancing support for minority depository institutions, enforcing fair lending laws, and advancing initiatives to close the wealth gap, we can address the disparities created by centuries of systemic discrimination and exacerbated by the pandemic. We can also ensure that the cooperative nature of the credit union system lives up to its mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, including those of modest means.\nResearch has also shown that there are three primary ways to close the wealth gap. One is to open and regularly fund a retirement account. Another way is to own a home. And the third way is to start a business. Given the cooperative philosophy at the heart of the credit union movement, your credit union has a moral obligation to step up and help communities of color recover and minority-owned businesses start anew in the months ahead.\nSo, I would like to challenge all of you to deliver more financial products and services – free of discrimination or unfair practices – to people of color and within communities of color. These efforts will be vital to ensuring a more equitable economic recovery and the health of our democracy.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed almost everything, from how we live, work, and socialize, to how we think about, and plan for, the future.\nIt has also changed the way in which many of you provide financial services and products to your members, and it has changed the way in which we conduct examinations and think about risk. But, if we, as a community, work together to smartly and safely navigate through the pandemic-induced economic crisis, we will emerge stronger from it.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

But right now, there's a real chance students will lose access to an important tax credit provides this level of assistance - unless we act quickly.\nThat’s why President Obama is calling on Congress to make the American Opportunity Tax Credit – a $2500 per year tax credit for working families and students attending college – permanent. To help bring attention to the issue, he's meeting with college students in the Oval Office today. You can help by spreading the word about this important issue as well.\nThis isn't just an issue for current students - it matters to all of us. Having more college educated workers in the American workforce is crucial to growing our economy. In order to compete in the 21st century global economy, we need to give all Americans the opportunity to pursue a college degree – and that’s exactly what this tax credit does:\nUnfortunately, some Congressional Republicans are proposing a 20% cut on education which would mean reducing financial aid for eight million college students and leaving community colleges without the resources they need to prepare students for the jobs of the future. At the same time, they’re proposing to borrow $700 billion to provide millionaires and billionaires with an average tax cut of $100,000.\nAt times like these, cutting back on investments that are directly related to our economic growth just doesn’t make sense. We can’t afford to shortchange American students, and that’s why the President will continue to fight to make the American Opportunity Tax Credits permanent and to strengthen our education system for all students.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        This week, the economists who officially decide when recessions start and end declared the recession of 2008 to be over. But if you're one of the millions of Americans who lost your home, your job, or your savings as a consequence of the recession, this news is of little comfort or value.\nYes, the economy is growing instead of shrinking, as it was in 2008 and the beginning of 2009. We're gaining private sector jobs each month instead of losing 800,000, as we did the month I took office.\nBut we have to keep pushing to promote growth that will generate the jobs we need and repair the terrible damage the recession has done. That's why I've proposed a series of additional steps: accelerated tax breaks for businesses who buy equipment now, a permanent research and development tax break to promote innovation by American companies, and a new initiative to rebuild America's roads, rails, and runways that will put folks to work and make our country more competitive.\nTaken together with the small-business tax cut and lending plan we passed through Congress last week, these steps will help spur jobs in the short run and strengthen our economy for the long run.\nNow, the Republicans who want to take over Congress offered their own ideas the other day. Many were the very same policies that led to the economic crisis in the first place, which isn't surprising, since many of their leaders were among the architects of that failed policy.\nIt's grounded in the same, wornout philosophy: cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, cut the rules for Wall Street and the special interests, and cut the middle class loose to fend for itself. That's not a prescription for a better future. It's an echo of a disastrous decade we can't afford to relive.\nThe Republicans in Washington claimed to draw their ideas from a web site called America Speaking Out. It turns out that one of the ideas that's drawn the most interest on their web site is ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. The funny thing is, when we recently closed one of the most egregious loopholes for companies creating jobs overseas, Republicans in Congress were almost unanimously opposed. The Republican leader, John Boehner, attacked us for it and stood up for outsourcing instead of American workers.\nSo America may be speaking out, but Republicans in Congress sure aren't listening. They want to put special interests back in the driver's seat in Washington. They want to roll back the law that will finally stop health insurance companies from denying you coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition. They want to repeal reforms that will finally protect hard-working families from hidden rates and penalties every time they use a credit card, make a mortgage payment, or take out a student loan.\nAnd for all their talk about reining in spending and getting our deficits under control, they want to borrow another $700 billion and use it to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires. On average, that's a tax cut of about $100,000 for millionaires.\nInstead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest few--tax breaks we cannot afford--I've called for tax cuts for middle class families who saw their incomes shrink by 5 percent during the last, lost decade. We've already cut eight different taxes for small-business owners to help them hire and grow, and we're going to cut eight more. We're challenging our States and schools to do a better job educating our kids and making college more affordable so America can once more lead the world in the proportion of our children graduating from college. And we're putting an end to the days of taxpayer-funded bailouts so Main Street never again has to pay for Wall Street's mistakes.\nAmerica is a great country. Our democracy is vibrant, our economy is dynamic, and our workers can outcompete the best of them. But the way for us to remain the greatest country on Earth isn't to turn back the clock and put the special interests back in charge. It's to make sure all our people are getting a fair shake. It's to make sure everyone who's willing to work for it still has a chance to reach for the American Dream. And that will remain my mission every single day so long as I have the honor of serving as President.\nHave a nice weekend, everybody.\nNOTE: The address was recorded at approximately 2:20 p.m. on September 22 in the Map Room at the White House for broadcast on September 25.

[applause]... along with my co-moderators, Brett Baier and Chris Wallace.\nTonight... [applause] Nice.\nTonight, thousands of people here in the Q, along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate, answering the questions you want answered.\nBAIER: Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination. [applause]\nTonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls. Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17. And now, the prime-time event, the top 10.\nWALLACE: Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight's debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook. Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.\nKELLY: As for the candidates who will be answering those questions? Here they are.\nPositioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump. [applause]\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause]\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [applause]\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. [applause]\nBAIER: Neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz. [applause]\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio. [applause]\nWALLACE: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. [applause]\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [applause] And your very own governor of Ohio... [applause] ... John Kasich. [applause]\nWALLACE: Brett -- Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.\nBAIER: It might be. It might be. We'll see.\n[UNKNOWN]: Is this in the rules? An objection's coming.\nBAIER: It might be. The rules for tonight are simple. One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups. And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this.\nPleasant, no?\nWe also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.\nAnd while we expect them... [applause] ... we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate. So, we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street. [laughter] Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight.\nWithout further ado, let's begin.\nBAIER: Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.\nAgain, we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.\nMr. Trump. [booing] Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.\nTRUMP: I fully understand.\nBAIER: The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.\nTRUMP: I fully understand.\nBAIER: And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.\nYou can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?\nTRUMP: I cannot say. I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee.\nBAIER: So tonight, you can't say if another one of these...\nPAUL: This is what's wrong!\nBAIER: OK.\nPAUL: I mean, this is what's wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he's already...\nBAIER: Dr. Paul.\nPAUL: Hey, look, look! He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? So if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent...\nBAIER: OK.\nPAUL: ...but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.\nTRUMP: Well, I've given him plenty of money.\nBAIER: Just to be clear, you can't make a -- we're gonna -- we're going to move on.\nYou're not gonna make the pledge tonight?\nTRUMP: I will not make the pledge at this time.\nBAIER: OK. Alright. [laughter and boing]\nKELLY: Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.\nYou are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn.\nYour critics say that your inexperience shows. You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.\nAren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?\nCARSON: Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don't have time.\nBut I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.\nSo, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: \"There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd.\"\nCould you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.\nRUBIO: Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.\nI would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.\nHere's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.\nThis country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.\nIf I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.\nIf I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor Bush, you have insisted that you're your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father's, not your brother's.\nBut there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, \"the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office.\"\nSo do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?\nBUSH: Absolutely, I do, and I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win.\nI'm gonna have to earn this. Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me. That's fine.\nI've got a record in Florida. I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.\nI cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion. We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves.\nWe were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.\nThey keep -- they called me Veto Corleone. Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget. [applause]\nI am my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively. And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up. [applause]\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.\nYou've called women you don't like \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\" [laughter] Your Twitter account...\nTRUMP: Only Rosie O'Donnell. [laughter]\nKELLY: No, it wasn't. [applause] Your Twitter account... [applause]\nTRUMP: Thank you.\nKELLY: For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.\nTRUMP: Yes, I'm sure it was.\nKELLY: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?\nTRUMP: I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. [applause]\nI've been challenged by so many people, and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.\nAnd frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn't do that. [applause]\nBut you know what, we -- we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That, I can tell you right now.\nWALLACE: Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. [applause]\nHow can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?\nCRUZ: Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. [applause]\nIf you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy.\nThere is a reason... [applause] .... that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state. On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.\nThis -- this may be why. Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state's 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?\nCHRISTIE: If you think it's bad now, you should've seen it when I got there. [laught and applause]\nThe fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.\nIn the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years.\nSo, what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place.\nAnd, what's happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we've brought our state back. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?\nWALKER: Well, I'm pro-life, I've always been pro-life, and I've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that... [applause] ...in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there, and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. That's been consistently proven.\nUnlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out... [applause] ...I've got a position that's in line with everyday America. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don't, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?\nHUCKABEE: Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That's a long and difficult process. I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that.\nA lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer. I think it's time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception.\nThe reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law.\nIt's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks. You later said that that statement, you could have said it better. But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, \"Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years.\"\nWhy are you so quick to blame your own party?\nPAUL: First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS?\nI've got a proposal. I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. [applause] I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It's a disgrace. We've got to stop -- we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes. So, we didn't create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.\nYou defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor.\nWhy should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?\nKASICH: Well, first of all... [applause] ...first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.\nSecondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what?\nTo treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year... [applause] ...to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life.\nSecondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families.\nSo we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.\nAnd do you know what?\nEverybody has a right to their God-given purpose.\nAnd finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We've cut $5 billion in taxes... [timer sounds] ...and we've grown 350,000 jobs. [applause]\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.\nGovernor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue.\nI want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here's what you said. \"They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family.\"\nDo you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?\nBUSH: I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family.\nBut we need to control our border. It's not -- it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I -- I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay.\nWe need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic...[applause]...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth.\nAnd there should be a path to earned legal status...[timer sounds] ...for those that are here. Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.\nWALLACE: Thank you, sir. [applause] Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border.\nGovernor Bush has called those remarks, quote, \"extraordinarily ugly.\"\nI'd like you -- you're right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share.\nWhy not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?\nTRUMP: So, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris. You wouldn't even be talking about it. [applause] This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement. And I said, Mexico is sending. Except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.\nThe fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.\nAnd I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out. [cheering and applause]\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds -- I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds.\nTRUMP: Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid.\nAnd the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them.\nWhy should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or not. [cheering and applause]\nWALLACE: All right. Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this. We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.\n[video clip begins]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'd like to know what the candidates are going to do so that I feel safe in my own country again.\n[video clip ends]\n[commercial break]\nWALLACE: Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night. We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let's continue the conversation.\nGovernor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump. But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?\nKASICH: Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake.\nNow, he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn't been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.\nWALLACE: Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?\nKASICH: But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.\nWALLACE: All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?\nRUBIO: Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.\nI also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.\nAnd let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally. [applause]\nAnd so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.\nWALLACE: Governor Walker. [applause]\nGovernor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind. Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?\nWALKER: Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year. [crosstalk] I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them.\nI talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America.\nI believe we need to secure the border. I've been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. [applause]\nWALLACE: Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal. Doug Bettencourt sent this question, \"will you support Kate Steinle's Law,\" which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? \"And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?\"\nCRUZ: Chris, absolutely yes. And not only will I support it...[applause]...I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law.\nYou know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It's not a question of stupidity. It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.\nPresident Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking.\nA majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.\nKELLY: Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.\nGovernor Christie. You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.\nDo you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?\nCHRISTIE: Yes, I do. And I'll tell you why: because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th.\nI was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.\nThis is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning.\nWhen you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland.\nAnd I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I'll do.\nPAUL: Megyn, may I respond? [applause] May I respond?\nKELLY: Go ahead, sir.\nPAUL: I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: And -- and, Megyn? Megyn, that's a -- that, you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer. \"I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.\" How are you supposed to know, Megyn?\nPAUL: Use the Fourth Amendment!\nCHRISTIE: What are you supposed to...\nPAUL: Use the Fourth Amendment!\nCHRISTIE: ...how are you supposed to -- no, I'll tell you how you, look...\nPAUL: Get a warrant!\nCHRISTIE: Let me tell you something, you go...\nPAUL: Get a judge to sign the warrant!\nCHRISTIE: When you -- you know, senator...\n[crosstalk]\nKELLY: Governor Christie, make your point.\nCHRISTIE: Listen, senator, you know, when you're sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. [applause]\nWhen you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure...\nPAUL: See, here's the problem.\nCHRISTIE: ...is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work.\nPAUL: Here's the problem, governor. Here's the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.\nEvery time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I'm talking about searches without warrants...\nCHRISTIE: There is no...\nPAUL: ...indiscriminately, of all Americans' records, and that's what I fought to end.\nI don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead. [applause]\nKELLY: Go ahead, governor.\nCHRISTIE: And you know -- you know, Senator Paul? Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.\nThose are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign...\nKELLY: Alright.\nCHRISTIE: ...and while still putting our country at risk.\n[crosstalk]\nKELLY: Alright, we've gotta cut it off there.\nWe have plenty more we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.\nCHRISTIE: You know what, Megyn, can I...\nKELLY: Well, I want to move on, because I have -- we're gonna get to you, governor, but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner. His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:\n[video clip begins]\nQUESTION:: My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS -- ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S., if they were to become president?\n[video clip ends]\nKELLY: Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.\nYou asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: \"What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?\" He told you \"IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide.\" And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.\nHow would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?\nCRUZ: Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, \"radical Islamic terrorism\". [applause]\nWhen I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense.\nIt's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.\nKELLY: You don't see it as... [applause] ...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one? [applause]\nCRUZ: Megyn, of course it's an ideological problem, that's one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. [applause]\nYes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, \"Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--\"[timer sounds]\nWe need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...\nBUSH: ...I remember...\nKELLY: ...we would've invaded Iraq...\nBUSH: ...I remember, Megyn. [laughter]\nKELLY: I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.\nYou finally said, \"No.\"\nTo the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?\nBUSH: Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do.\nAnd, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain.\nSo, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because [timer sounds] of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.\nTo honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?\nWALKER: I don't know about additional ones. We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important.\nYou look at the Saudis -- in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it's the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America's a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.\nKELLY: Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror. As president, would you bring back water boarding?\nCARSON: Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again. [applause]\nKELLY: We have a lot for you, don't worry. [laughter and applause] Fear not, you may rue that request.\nCARSON: Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do. [applause]\nWe. . .uh. . .we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. [applause]\nAnd, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars. And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars.\nAnd I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out.\nAnd if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...[timer sounds]...extremely effectively. [applause]\nBAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.\nMr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.\nTRUMP: A complete disaster, yes.\nBAIER: Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.\nTRUMP: Correct.\nBAIER: Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.\nWhy were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?\nTRUMP: First of all, I'd like to just go back to one. In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that's exactly what happened.\nBAIER: But on ObamaCare...\nTRUMP: And the Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say.\nAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.\nWhat I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid.\nYou know why?\nBecause the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.\nBut they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune.\nGet rid of the artificial lines and you will have...[timer sounds]...yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\n[crosstalk]\nBAIER: Mr. Trump, hold up one second.\nPAUL: I've got a news flash...\nBAIER: All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul...\nPAUL: News flash, the Republican Party's been fighting against a single-payer system...\nBAIER: OK.\nPAUL: -- for a decade. So I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system.\nTRUMP: I'm not -- I'm not are -- I don't think you heard me. You're having a hard time tonight.\nBAIER: All right, let me... [applause]\nMr. Trump, it's not just your past support for single- payer health care. You've also supported a host of other liberal policies. Use -- you've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.\nYou explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors.\nAnd you said recently, quote, \"When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\"\nTRUMP: You'd better believe it.\nBAIER: So what specifically did...\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's true.\nBAIER: -- they do?\nTRUMP: If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.\nRUBIO: Not me.\nHUCKABEE: Not me. [laughter] But you're welcome to give me a check, Donald if you'd like.\nTRUMP: Many of them.\nRUBIO: Actually, to be clear...[crosstalk]...he supported Charlie Crist.\nTRUMP: Not much.\nRUBIO: Hey, Charlie...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: But I...[crosstalk]\nKASICH: Donald, if you...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I have good...\nKASICH: -- this campaign, I hope you will give to me.\nTRUMP: Good.\nKASICH: OK.\nTRUMP: Sounds good. Sounds good to me, Governor.\nI will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give.\nAnd do you know what?\nWhen I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So what did you get?\nTRUMP: And that's a broken system.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi?\nTRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding.\nYou know why?\nShe didn't have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was.\nBut...[timer sounds] [crosstalk]\nBAIER: Hold on.\nWe're going to -- we're going to move on. [crosstalk] We'll come back to you, Governor Walker.\nWALKER: Just one second on this, though.\nWe -- we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and ---and pitting us back and forth.\nLet's be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president [inaudible].\nBAIER: We have many questions to come.\nWALKER: It's true.\nBAIER: Many questions to come. [applause] Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, \"Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?\"\nNow, broadly... [applause] ...broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.\nBut year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government. But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen.\nIn fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.\nSo the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?\nHUCKABEE: It's not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger.\nEvery person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn't even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for.\nAnd the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it's the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. [cheering and applause]\nAnd I'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.\nBAIER: Dr. Carson...\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bret, Bret, Bret...\nBAIER: Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?\nCARSON: What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.\nAnd he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made. If you've had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes. And if you've had no crops at all, you don't owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that.\nAnd that's why I've advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and...[timer sounds]\nBAIER: Governor Bush?\nCARSON: And I have a lot more to say about it.\nBAIER: We're going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.\nGovernor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math. A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally.\nPresident Obama's secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, \"fringe group of critics.\" Do you think that's accurate?\nBUSH: No, I don't. And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. It is clearly a state responsibility.\nI'm for higher standards... [applause] ...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country.\nAnd we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go.\nAnd Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That's what I'm for.\nBAIER: Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?\nRUBIO: Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That's. . . that's. . . that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.\nHere's the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate.\nIn fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states. [applause]\nBAIER: And do you agree with your old friend?\nBUSH: He is definitely my friend. And I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are high.\nBecause today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready.\nIf we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century. [applause]\nBAIER: We have many more questions coming on a host of topics, here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us.\n[video clip begins]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would make stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you intend to go about student loan reform?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States?\n[video clip ends]\n[commercial break]\nBAIER: We have many more questions coming on a host of topics. Here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us.\n[video clip begins]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would make you stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you intend to go about student loan reform?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States?\n[video clip ends]\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: It's just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls. And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked. We hope. [laughter]\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we're obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we're also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight.\nGovernor Kasich, let me start with you. Whoever the Republican nominee -- [applause]\nWhoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton. You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is. She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class. That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities. She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past.\nHow will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?\nKASICH: Let's start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus.\nEconomic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up.\nYou know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the \"Amiracle\" will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country who's watching tonight, lift everybody, [timer sounds] unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done.\nWALLACE: I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we're only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson.\nBasically, same question to you. If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?\nCARSON: If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. [laughter]\nBut you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.\nWell, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. [applause] And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems.\nYou know, you look at the -- the national debt and how it's being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that's what she's doing. [applause]\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you.\nYou have made a bold promise in your announcement. You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president.\nThat many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together. And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War. So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?\nBUSH: We've done it 27 times since World War II. I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours.\nThe new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs. [applause]\nYou embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left? Give me a break. Of course we're for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, [timer sounds] fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor Walker. [applause] Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years. In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth. Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream.\nGiven your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?\nWALKER: Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low.\nBefore I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent. It's now down to 4.6 percent. We've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession. And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally.\nYou know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. That's what I'll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform.\nYou say that you -- to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age -- have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying.\nGovernor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that. Is he lying?\nCHRISTIE: No, he's not lying, he's just wrong.\nI mean, so, there's a difference -- I'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense.\nNow, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. Yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives.\nSecondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. They don't need that Social Security check. Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America.\nIf we don't deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor Huckabee?\nYou say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption. Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?\nHUCKABEE: Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government.\nThe government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, they're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck.\nNow, here's the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.\nIt's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn't be doing it. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: Chris...\nWALLACE: ...Thirty seconds.\nCHRISTIE: Yeah, sure. And, I don't disagree with ending Congress' retirement program. I'm a governor, I don't have a retirement program in my state, and I don't disagree with that. But, here's the news to the American people, he's complaining about the lying and stealing. The lying and stealing has already occurred. The trust fund is filled with IOU's. We can't fix the problem just by ending Congress's retirement, that's worth about, \"this\" much.\nWe need to go at the fundamental problem, and the fundamental problem is that this system is broken. It has been stolen from. We have been lied to, [timer sounds] and we need a strong leader to tell the truth and fix...\nWALLACE: ...Alright, this is it. Thirty Seconds, finally.\nHUCKABEE: Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains.\nThe FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people [timer sounds] that are freeloading off the system now. [applause]\nThat's why it ought to be a transformed system. [applause]\nWALLACE: All right. Enough. [applause]\nMr. Trump.\nKELLY: [off mike] Sounds like somebody's a little R-rated. [applause]\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records. From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.\nUNKNOWN: ...In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: \"I've used the laws of the country to my advantage.\" But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.\nQuestion sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?\nTRUMP: Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.\nI have never gone bankrupt, by the way. I have never.\nBut out of hundreds of deals...\nWALLACE: No, but the concept sir...\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me.\nWALLACE: ... that's your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.\nTRUMP: Excuse me, what am I saying? Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people. I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the law.\nThe difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, \"Trump, Trump, Trump.\" The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I'm very proud of the job I did.\nAgain Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals. Four times, I've taken advantage of the laws. And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.\nWALLACE: Well sir, let's just talk about the latest example...[applause]...which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009. In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.\nTRUMP: Well, I...\nWALLACE: Is that the way that you'd run the country?\nTRUMP: Let me just tell you about the lenders. First of all, these lenders aren't babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK? [laughter and applause] You know, I mean you're living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, you want to know the truth. [applause] And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt. Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. [laughter] Every company.\nAnd let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I've gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I'm very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it.\nWALLACE: So...\nTRUMP: And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion. And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.[applause]\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook. And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia. Here she is.[begin video clip]\nQUESTION: Please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and anyone dreaming of opening their own business.\n[close video clip]\nRUBIO: That's a great question.\nWALLACE: Senator, how do you answer Tania?\nRUBIO: That's a great question.\nFirst of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.\nNow, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.\nThe first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.\nWe need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.\nAnd last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. [applause] 20 — over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the — since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, thank you. [applause]\nBAIER: Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.\nYesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant \"death to America\" were, quote, \"making common cause with the Republican caucus.\"\nHere's what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran.\n[video clip begins]\nPERRY: I will tell you one thing: I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.\nBut the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but hell no, to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror...\n[video clip ends]\n[video clip begins]\nFIORINA: When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation.\nYes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy.\n[video clip ends]\nBAIER: Now, I wanna ask a few of you this. First, Governor Walker.\nYou've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one. If this deal is undone, what then?\nWALKER: Well, first off, let's remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with.\nTo me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.\nThis is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it.\nIt's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?\nPAUL: I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it. I don't think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don't immediately discount negotiations.\nI'm a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early.\nIf there's going to be a negotiation, you're going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply. And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said \"do you believe they're trustworthy?\" and he said \"No.\"\nAnd I said, \"well, how are we gonna get them to comply?\" I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.\nBAIER: Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?\nHUCKABEE: Ronald Reagan said \"trust, but verify.\" President Obama is \"trust, but vilify.\" He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.\nAnd the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party. [applause]\n[crosstalk]\nHUCKABEE: It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing.\nWe didn't even get four hostages out. We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want.\nWe said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up. We said that we would make sure that they didn't have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up.\nThe president can't tell us what we got. I'll tell you what the world got. The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn't, as the Soviets, say \"we might defend ourselves in a war.\"\nWhat the Iranians have said is, \"we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America.\" When someone points a gun at your head [timer sounds] and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.\nBAIER: Thank you, gentlemen.\nKELLY: Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out. Stick around. Social issues, next.\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: Senator Rubio, you favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?\nRUBIO: Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all--\nKELLY: You don't favor a rape and incest exception?\nRUBIO: I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.\nIn fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nAnd let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live. [applause]\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, \"very pro- choice.\" Even supporting partial-birth abortion. You favored an assault weapons ban as well. In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat. Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets. When did you actually become a Republican? [ catcalls]\nTRUMP: I don't think they like me very much. I'll tell you what. I've evolved on many issues over the years. And you know who else has? Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.\nAnd I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice. And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. And then since then, I've very much evolved.\nAnd what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn't aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances.\nAnd I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.\nAs far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat. And I have really started to see some of the negatives -- as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of [timer sounds] his brother's administration were a catastrophe. And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama. And you can't be happy about that. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.\nBUSH: None of which is true.\nKELLY: Is it true?\nBUSH: No. It's not true. But I have said that Mr. Trump's language is divisive.\nI want to win. I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States.\nWe're not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That's how we're going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.\nTRUMP: First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much. He is a true gentleman. He really is.\nOne thing he did say, and I mean that. The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone. And I also understand that. But when you have people that are cutting Christians' heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we've never -- it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don't have time for tone. [timer sounds] We have to go out and get the job done. [applause]\nKELLY: The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty. Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage?\nKASICH: Well, look, I'm an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I've also said the court has ruled --\nKELLY: How would you -- how would you explain it to a child?\nKASICH: Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we'll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn't think the way I do, doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? [applause]\nThat's what we're taught when we have strong faith. [applause]\nSo the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I've been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I'm going to love my daughters, I'm going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, [timer sounds] God gives me unconditional love. I'm going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\nKELLY: Senator Paul, in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on same sex marriage, Carol Fox on Facebook want to know the following. Quote: what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs?\nPAUL: Look, I don't want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, it's a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them. One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that's when it's time to resist.\nKELLY: Governor Walker, many in the Black Lives Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overly-aggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time. Do you agree? And if so, how do you plan to address it? And if not, why not?\nWALKER: Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past -- it's about training. It's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.\nKELLY: Thank you.\nMODERATOR: Coming up more of our debate, including questions about President Obama's foreign policy and these guys and their better ideas. Coming up.\n[commercial break]\nBAIER: Welcome back to Cleveland. Our next topic is foreign policy. Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHis name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop's deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan. His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.\nSo, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?\nTRUMP: I would be so different from what you have right now. Like, the polar opposite. We have a president who doesn't have a clue. I would say he's incompetent, but I don't want to do that because that's not nice. [laughter]\nBut if you look at the deals we make, whether it's the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods -- and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system. You look at Sgt. Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want. We have people in Washington that don't know what they're doing. Now... [applause; scream from audience]\nI agree. [applause]\nNow, with Iran, we're making a deal, you would say, we want him. We want out our prisoners. We want all these things, and we don't get anything. We're giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be -- I'll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you'll quadruple -- this, what's happening [timer sounds] in Iran, is a disgrace, and it's going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world. [applause]\nBAIER: Another new development today, Senior Defense officials tell Fox they strongly suspect Russia was behind the cyber attack on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs office...\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: ...Please.\nBAIER: ...email. This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.\nSenator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?\nCRUZ: Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces.\nHe's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility... [applause]\nIt is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. [applause]\nBAIER: Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, \"that's a redline for us,\" and that there would be enormous consequences.\nOne year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.\nAs president, would you have used military force there?\nCARSON: Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.\nOur -- our friends can't trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won't even give them offensive weapons.\nYou know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?\nWALKER: Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. [laughter and applause]\nAnd -- and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won't think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop.\nUnder Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. [applause]\nWe find steel.\nBAIER: Governor -- Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing. Women are moving into combat roles. Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped. And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.\nAs commander in chief, how would you handle that?\nHUCKABEE: The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. [applause]\nIt's not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. I'm not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.\nWe've reduced the military by 25 percent... [applause] ... under President Obama. The disaster is that we've forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it's in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it.\nWe've not done that because we've decimated our military. We're flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s we're flying, we've only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And that's pretty scary.\n[laughter and applause]\nBAIER: Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel. You have since changed your view on that issue. What made you change your mind.\nPAUL: Well, let's be clear, I'm the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances. I've put pencil to paper...\nUNKNOWN: I do.\nPAUL: ... and I've said -- and I've said I would cut spending, and I've said exactly where. Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. [applause]\nI think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. Israel is not one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they're independent. My position is exactly the same.\nWe shouldn't borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don't we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.\nBAIER: OK. But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?\nPAUL: I still say exactly what my original opinion is. Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone? Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally. And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don't have.\nWe do not project power from bankruptcy court. We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. [applause]\nIt's got to stop somewhere.\nBAIER: Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen.\nYou know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense.\nI agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go.\nThose are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies. But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor, thank you.\nCRUZ: Brett, can I -- Brett, can I jump in on this one?\nBAIER: Senator, we're going to finish up with some more questions, thank you.\nKELLY: We have to stand you by, because after the break, we're going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and . . . God.\nStay tuned for that.\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: Welcome back.\nIn our final moments here together, we're going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts. But first, we want to ask them an interesting closing question from Chase Norton on Facebook, who wants to know this of the candidates: \"I want to know if any of them have received a word from God on what they should do and take care of first.\"\nSenator Cruz, start from you. Any word from God?\nCRUZ: Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. [applause]\nI'm the son of a pastor and evangelist and I've described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He wasn't a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old.\nAnd someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. [applause]\nI would also note that the scripture tells us, \"you shall know them by their fruit.\" We see lots of \"campaign conservatives.\" But if we're going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.\nThere are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.\nAnd I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.\n[cheering and applause]\nKELLY: Governor Kasich, same question.\nKASICH: Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mother's mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. [cheering and applause]\nI do believe in miracles. You know, I've had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind.\nYou know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We've got to unite our country again, because we're stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.\nAnd we've got to listen to other people's voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I've read in my lifetime, the Lord'is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong.\nHe wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends. [cheering and applause]\nKELLY: Governor Walker, same question.\nWALKER: Well, thanks, Megyn.\nI'm certainly an imperfect man. And it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I've been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesn't call me to do a specific thing, God hasn't given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day.\nWhat God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately that's what I'm going to try to do. And I hope people've seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.\nIt wasn't just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith. [applause]\nKELLY: Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question. But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans? I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation's veterans.\nSo I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.\nRUBIO: Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can't even find one. [laughter] [cheering and applause]\nAnd I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that's why God has continued to bless us.\nAnd he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.\nUnfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.\nAnd it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date. When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA. [cheering and applause]\nKELLY: Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now. And what, if anything, you can do -- you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.\nCARSON: Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done.\nWhat we need to think about instead -- you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often. I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say -- I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn't make them who they are. The hair doesn't make them who they are. And it's time for us to move beyond that. [applause]\nBecause...[applause]...our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn't let them do it. [applause]\nBAIER: Now each candidate will make a closing statement. You'll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this debate. We'll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich.\nKASICH: You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I've done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world.\nNo. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes.\nI spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now I'm the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink [timer sounds] of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Christie?\nCHRISTIE: Well, thank you, Megyn. Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey. Was the first person to graduate from college. He put himself through college at night. My mom was a secretary.\nI was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail.\nI'm a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought [timer sounds] the teacher's union.\nThis president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected. And that's exactly how I'll lead our country. [applause]\nWALLACE: Senator Paul, closing statement.\nPAUL: I'm a different kind of Republican. I've introduced a five-year balanced budget. I've introduced the largest tax cut in our history. I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. [applause]\nBut I've also gone to Chicago. I've gone to Detroit. I've been to Ferguson, I've been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and I'm the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. I'm a different kind of Republican. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Marco Rubio.\nRUBIO: Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.\nMy father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that's why I'm asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make of this century a new American century. [applause]\nBAIER: Thank you, Senator.\nKELLY: Senator Ted Cruz.\nCRUZ: If I'm elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. [applause]\nThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. [applause]\nThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. [applause]\nI will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it's like to lose it.\nWALLACE: Dr. Carson, closing statement.\nCARSON: Well, I haven't said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that.\nI'm the only one to separate Siamese twins...[laughter]\nThe -- the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother's womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. [laughter]\nBut I -- but I'm very hopeful that I'm not the only one who's willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because we're fighting for our children and the next generation. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.\nHUCKABEE: It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who's very high in the polls, that doesn't have a clue about how to govern.\nA person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton. [laughter]\nI think America...\nUNKNOWN: Thank you.\nHUCKABEE: ...is in trouble, but it's not beyond repair. But it's going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God.\nI'll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Scott Walker.\nWALKER: Thanks.\nI'm guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. One article called me \"aggressively normal.\"\nI ran for governor because I was worried about my kids' future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won.\nWe balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms.\nIt wasn't too late for Wisconsin, and it's not too late for America. That's why I ask for your vote.\nWALLACE: Governor Bush, closing statement, sir.\nBUSH: Here's what I believe. I believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world.\nBut Washington is holding us back. How we tax, how we regulate. We're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver.\nWe're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues.\nHere's my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America's leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you're gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much.\nBAIER: Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir.\nTRUMP: Our country is in serious trouble. We don't win anymore.\nWe don't beat China in trade. We don't beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade. We can't beat Mexico, at the border or in trade.\nWe can't do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that.\nThank you.\nBAIER: Gentlemen, thank you.\nKELLY: It's over!\nBAIER: That's it.\nKELLY: Are you relieved? You were nervous before, they -- they don't look relieved. They look \"get me outta here.\"\nThank you all very much, and that will do it for the first Republican primary debate night of the 2016 presidential race. Our thanks to the candidates, who will now be joined by their families on stage.\nNOTE: A candidate must rank in the top ten candidates in Fox News polls in order to appear in this main debate. The remaining candidates were invited to appear in the \"undercard\" debate.\nPresidential Candidate Debates, Republican Candidates Debate in Cleveland, Ohio Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/310229\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has quietly run a very interesting presidential campaign. He hasn’t held the spotlight much, but he’s raised a lot of money, laid the groundwork for a credible ground game, positioned himself to benefit if/when the Amateur Duo falters, and held his fire, waiting to see who his real rivals are going to be.\nLast night, however, Cruz offered a peek into his broader strategy.\n“Historically, there have been two major lanes in the Republican primary,” the Texas senator told CNN’s Jake Tapper last night. “There’s been a moderate lane and a conservative lane. And, in past cycles, there’s been a consensus moderate choice early on… Look, I think Marco is certainly formidable in that lane. I think the Jeb campaign seems to view Marco as his biggest threat in the moderate lane. And so I think they’re going to slug it out for a while.“But, when you look at the conservative lane, what I’m really encouraged by is that conservatives are consolidating behind our campaign… And once it gets down to a head-to-head contest between a conservative and a moderate … I think the conservative wins.”\nLet’s strip away the spin for a minute: Marco Rubio is breathtakingly conservative. He’s a climate denier who desperately wants to give billionaires a massive tax break the country can’t afford. The Florida Republican believes Medicare and Social Security have weakened Americans; he thinks the war in Iraq, even in hindsight, was a fine idea; he still opposes marriage equality; he doesn’t think the federal minimum wage should exist; and Rubio’s so hostile towards reproductive rights that he believes the government has the authority to force impregnated rape victims to take that pregnancy to term, even against her wishes. The guy voted against a bipartisan Violence Against Women Act, even when he knew it would pass easily anyway.\nIf Marco Rubio prevails in the 2016 race, he would be the most right-wing major-party nominee in generations. If he wins a general election, he’d be the most extreme president in modern American history. There is nothing “moderate” about him.\nBut that’s not quite what Ted Cruz is talking about.\nAs the Texas senator sees it, in every race for the Republican presidential nomination, candidates invariably find themselves in “lanes.” And under this framework, there’s always an establishment favorite who’s friendly with party insiders, picks up a lot of endorsements, generates a lot of positive media buzz, etc. For Cruz, this is the “moderate” lane — the label isn’t necessarily related to issue positions, per se, but it’s more about tone and relationships.\nIn the current GOP fight, the assumption has long been this “lane” would be occupied by Rubio, Jeb Bush, or perhaps John Kasich. But with Kasich struggling, and Jeb faltering, it seems increasingly likely that Rubio will be this establishment “moderate.”\nWe know — because he’s said so repeatedly — exactly what Ted Cruz is going to tell Republican voters: “You could pick the establishment ‘moderate’ and media darling, or you could choose the unapologetic conservative. Remember, Bob Dole, John McCain, and Mitt Romney were establishment ‘moderates,’ too, and look how the election turned out for us in those cycles.”\nA Cruz ally told the conservative Washington Examiner this week, “The difference is, who went to Washington and stood up, not just to Democrats, but to his own party, on issue after issue? The other fatal problem for Marco is ‘gang of eight’ support. People don’t trust him.”\nWant to know what the Republican race is going to look and sound like in January? This strikes me as a pretty explicit hint.\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MS NOW political contributor.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

Compare this to the figures of the early 1970s when this count was 360,000.3\nMass Incarceration’s Reach\nThe social, moral, and fiscal costs associated with the large-scale, decades-long investment in mass imprisonment cannot be justified by any evidence of its effectiveness. Misguided changes in sentencing law and policy –not crime– account for the majority of the increase in correctional supervision.4\nMass incarceration instigates numerous poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for the people who experience imprisonment, for their families, as well as for the broader community.5 Imprisonment leads to declining prospects for employment and results in lower earnings in the longer term.6 Food insecurity, housing instability, and reliance on public assistance are also associated with prior imprisonment.7 Children of incarcerated parents suffer tremendously; imprisonment of a parent leads to significant declines in academic and health outcomes for children.8 High levels of incarceration also destabilizes entire communities, leading to dissolution of informal networks that are known to serve as barriers to neighborhood crime.9 Trust in law enforcement deteriorates as community members experience elevated levels of victimization and the loss of community members, friends, and family members to incarceration.10\nThe Surge in Prison Growth\nIn 1972, the imprisonment rate was 93 per 100,000 people.11 The prison expansion that commenced in 1973 reached its peak in 2009, achieving a seven-fold increase over the intervening years. Between 1985 and 1995 alone, the total prison population grew an average of eight percent annually. And between 1990 and 1995, all states, with the exception of Maine, substantially increased their prison populations, from 13% in South Carolina to as high as 130% in Texas. The federal system grew 53% larger during this five-year period alone.12\nThe number of people in prison began a marginal decline beginning in 201013 and continued along this course for more than a decade, including a remarkable 14% decline in 2020 alone, which was principally caused by accelerated releases and reduced admissions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year 2022, however, marked the first year in more than a decade where the prison population rose again, by two percent, led by increases in 36 states and the federal government. 14 Mississippi alone raised its population of imprisoned persons 15% between 2021 and 2022.\nFigure 1.

Though a handful of countries incarcerate a higher proportion of their population, the U.S. rate of incarceration is significantly higher than the rest of the world, including its closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico.\nFigure 3. International Rates of Incarceration\nSource: World Prison Brief, compiled and hosted by the Institute of Crime and Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London.\nProbation and Parole\nProbation and parole have expanded both in the absolute number and length of supervision for the past several decades.15\nFigure 4.

Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities\nOne in five Black men born in 2001 is likely to be imprisoned at some point in their lifetime.16 People of color remain massively overrepresented in prisons, accounting for nearly 7 in 10 people in prison. Systemic causes range from a history of racial and ethnic subordination to ongoing police tactics that unfairly ensnare people of color into the system, and also include charging and sentencing practices that create stiffer punishments for people of color. Recent estimates find that one in 81 Black adults in the United States is serving time in state prison.17\nFigure 5. Racial and Ethnic Disparities in State and Federal Prisons, 2022\nSource: Carson, E. A. & Kluckow, R. (2023). Prisoners in 2022–Statistical tables. Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nOffense Types\nIn 2022, more than three in five people (63%) sentenced to state prison had been convicted of a violent crime,18 as compared with 1970 when 30% of people in prison had been convicted of violence.19\nOffense types among those convicted in the federal and state prison systems are presented below (Figures 6 and 7). Despite common misconceptions that federal prison is reserved for the most violent crimes, it is the case that roughly half (46%) of those sentenced to federal prison have been convicted of drug offenses.\nFigure 6. Federal Prison Population by Offense, 2022\nSource: Carson, E.A. & Kluckow, R. (2023). Prisoners in 2022-Statistical tables. Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nFigure 7.

Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nFederal Drug Laws\nSentencing policies enacted under the banner of the “War on Drugs” which began in the early 1970s and accelerated with the utilization of broadly punitive mandatory minimum and three-strikes policies, resulted in dramatic growth in incarceration for drug offenses. This is particularly evident at the federal level.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act of 198420 established the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) with the primary task of creating sentencing guidelines for the purpose of limiting the discretion of sentencing judges at the federal level.21 The guidelines went into effect in late 1987, at the same time that federal parole was eliminated, and federal prison sentences began their steep upward climb, especially for drug offenses.22 This climb was exacerbated by the passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986, which imposed stiff mandatory minimums for drug offenses, including a five-year mandatory minimum for the simple possession or sale of five grams of crack cocaine. In contrast, the mandatory minimum trigger for powder cocaine, a chemically identical drug to crack, required the sale of 100 times that amount. In 1986, people released after federal imprisonment for a drug conviction spent under two years in prison, but by 2005 people convicted of federal drug charges served an average of seven years.23 That increase was borne disproportionately by Black individuals: prior to the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the average federal drug sentence for Black individuals was 11% higher than for whites, four years after its passage, that figure increased to 49%.24\nIn 2010, the US Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act in an effort to ameliorate some of the damage done by the law, reducing the sentencing cocaine disparity from 100-1 to 18-1.25 In 2019, the First Step Act applied the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act retroactively, and reduced other sentences for drug offenses. Approximately 4,000 people benefited from retroactivity of the law.26\nFigure 8. Share of People in Federal Prison for Drug Offenses, 1980-2022\nSources: Bureau of Justice Statistics Prisoners Series; Albany University (n.d.) Sourcebook of criminal justice statistics online.\nWomen\nAt the start of the era of mass incarceration, fewer than 6,000 women were in state or federal prisons.27 As noted in Figure 9 below, this level reached a high of 105,000–more than 17 times the 1970 level–by 2015, followed by marginal but steady declines since. Still, 2022’s population figures are above those of the pre-mass incarceration era – more than 82,000 women were imprisoned in state and federal prison. The growth in women’s imprisonment from 2021 to 2022 was more than double (4%) that of men (1.5%).\nFigure 9. Women in State and Federal Prisons\nSource: Cahalan, M. W. (1986). Historical corrections statistics in the United States, 1850-1984. Bureau of Justice Statistics; BJS Prisoners Series (1985-2022).\nLife and Long-Term Imprisonment\nMass incarceration’s toll on human dignity is no more apparent than with the staggering proliferation of life sentences; today one in seven imprisoned people is serving a life sentence. Life sentences have consistently been included as a sentencing option, but their use expanded dramatically during the era of mass incarceration.28 Historically, life sentences came with the expectation of release; they were used to encourage good behavior among people who were incarcerated. Individuals were typically released in 10-15 years through parole or executive clemency.29\nFigure 10. The Growth of Life Sentences, 1992-2020\nSources: Figures for 1992 obtained from: Maguire, K., Pastore, A. L., & Flanagan, T. J. (Eds.) (1993). Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics 1992. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Figures for 2005 obtained from: Liptak, A. (2005, October 5). Serving life with no chance at redemption. The New York Times. Data for 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 were collected from each state’s department of corrections by The Sentencing Project.\nAs depicted in Figure 10 above, in 1992, just over 9,000 people were reportedly serving life without parole and another 58,000 people were serving parole-eligible life sentences. By 2003, the number of people serving LWOP had more than tripled and parole-eligible lifers had increased 62%. By 2020, six times as many people were serving LWOP, reaching an all-time high of 55,945; the total population of people serving LWP rose 82% over these years.\nEvidence shows that criminal careers are relatively short, in the range of 10 years,30 meaning that continued incarceration beyond this point produces diminishing returns on public safety, wasting limited resources that could be put toward effective crime prevention strategies. Long sentences also do little to deter criminal behavior because criminal engagement is often not rational and not carried out with a sophisticated understanding of the criminal code that determines punishment.31 Among youth and emerging adults, research finds that brain development impacts behavior. Sanctions that accommodate this reality incorporate reduced culpability for those who were young at the time of their offense.32\nThe growth of life imprisonment is echoed by the growth of long prison terms more broadly. Sentences of all lengths have expanded during the era of mass incarceration. The infamous “Rockefeller Drug Laws” (1973), which mandated 15 years for possession of small amounts of marijuana and other drugs, was the first in a broad range of state-level mandatory sentencing schemes. In 1984, Washington state adopted the nation’s first “truth-in-sentencing” law that required people to serve 85% of their sentences, and 27 states quickly adopted similar laws over the next 15 years. Fourteen states had eliminated parole altogether.33\nNearly one in five people in U.S. prisons—over 260,000 people—had already served at least 10 years as of 2019. This is an increase from 133,000 people in 2000—which represented 10% of the prison population in that year.34\nWhile Black Americans are vastly over-represented in the prison population, this disparity widens for those serving lengthy sentences. As depicted in Figure 11, in 2019, Black Americans represented 14% of the total U.S. population, 33% of the total prison population, and 46% of the prison population who had already served at least 10 years.35\nRacial disparities in the criminal legal system are at their most extreme among people serving life sentences; Black Americans comprise 55% of those serving life without the possibility of parole, the most extreme life sentence.36\nFigure 11.

The period of disenfranchisement varies by state, with some states restoring the vote upon completion of a prison term, and others effectively disenfranchising for life. As a result of the dramatic expansion of the criminal legal system over the past 50 years, restrictions on voting rights for persons with a felony have diminished the political voice of many communities. As of 2022, over 4.4 million Americans were unable to vote due to state laws restricting voting rights for those with felony convictions. Among African American adults, five percent are disenfranchised compared to two percent of the overall adult population. Three out of four people disenfranchised are living in their communities, having fully completed their sentences or remain supervised while on probation or parole.37\n| Race/Ethnicity | Rate |\n|---|---|\n| African American | 4.97% |\n| Latinx | 1.69% |\n| White | 1.91% |\nSource: Uggen, C., Larsen R., Shannon, S., & Pulido-Nava, A.

Please see the full report for explanation.)\nYouth\nChildren and youth, especially Black and Latinx children and youth, have also been swept up in mass incarceration’s harmful policies. Under the guise of concern over rising violent crime in the late 1980s and early 1990s, policymakers quickly adopted and spread the fabricated “superpredator” theory that described young Black boys as especially dangerous.38 Proponents of the theory believed that despite a young person’s age at the time of their offense, certain offenses should be handled in adult criminal court, rather than juvenile court. Lawmakers advanced policies that transferred tens of thousands of young people as young as 13 years old into adult court, jail, and prison systems that, by design, do not account for age.39\nWith two decades of experience it is now abundantly clear that these policies were counterproductive. In particular, holding youth in facilities with adults is associated with heighted physical and sexual abuse as well as higher rates of recidivism upon release40\nUnlike the trends in adult prison and jail, youth incarceration figures started to decline sooner and by the turn of the century the number of youth in prisons and jails was steadily declining, amounting to an 83% drop overall by 2021.41 As illustrated in Figure 13 below, the year 2022 marks the first point in more than a decade that youth incarceration in adult prisons rose: in fact, the number of youth held in adult prisons jumped 50% between 2021 and 2022, a remarkable departure from the steady decline since 2009. Though the number of youth in adult prisons rose sharply, the number of youth in adult jails continued its decline from 2021 to 2022.\nFigure 13.

The first is that adopting major policy shifts in an emotionally-driven political climate is never a wise course of action. Policymakers who promoted increased transfer of children to adult courts in the early 1990s, for example, did so at a time when youth (and adult) violence had risen precipitously. In retrospect, we know that the spike in violence was largely due to the emergence of crack cocaine drug markets, and was relatively short-lived.\nA second lesson is that revising how we think about people who commit crime changes how we respond to their actions. Taken with an understanding of structural disadvantages that permeate American society leading to disparate economic, education, housing and health outcomes should motivate policymakers to aggressively pursue reforms in these areas while also investing in evidence-based individual-level prevention and intervention programs.\nThe life history of individuals in prison shows that, more often than not, they committed their crimes after major setbacks — addiction, loss of jobs or housing — for which they received little support. There are few individuals in the prison system so dangerous that they can never be released back into the community. If we truly want to end mass incarceration and preserve community safety, we need to reprioritize public investments and policies with an emphasis on crime prevention and restoration of communities over punishment.\n| 1. | Fair, H. & Walmsley, R.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

And we have, again, drawn lots for their placement on the stage.\nAnd so let me introduce them from left to right. We have with us former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Senator Hillary Clinton from New York.\nAnd again, for the first 45 minutes of this debate, I will be posing questions in three rather broad categories. We'll do 15 minutes each, but with the hope that I can sort of stay out of the way to the extent possible and let the candidates discuss the issues among themselves.\nThere are no lights to limit -- time limits, at least for this part of the debate. But I will interrupt politely, I hope, if things seem to be going a little bit long.\nSo let me start with what is generally agreed to be, I think, the greatest threat to the United States today, and, somewhat to my surprise, has not been discussed as much in the presidential debates this year as I thought would be, and that is nuclear terrorism.\nAnd for some background, here's ABC's Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross.\nBRIAN ROSS, ABC CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: After more than six years of trying, the United States still does not have a reliable way to spot nuclear material that terrorists might smuggle into the country, much as ABC News twice did in demonstrations without being caught.\nAnd after six years of trying, the United States has yet to capture the man who says it is his religious duty to get nuclear weapons: Osama bin Laden.\nAnd in the last 18 months, U.S. officials say his Al Qaida has regrouped using safe havens along the Pakistani border to train and dispatch hundreds of new recruits.\nROSS: And just as troubling, amidst all the turmoil in Pakistan, the influence of bin Laden continues to grow there, a country with many nuclear weapons.\nCharlie?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nMR. GIBSON: Brian Ross there.\nWell, Osama bin Laden, as he pointed out, has said it is his duty to try to get nuclear weapons. Al Qaida has been reconstituted and re-energized in the western part of Pakistan.\nAnd so my general question is, how aggressively would you go after Al Qaida leadership there?\nAnd let me start with you, Senator Obama, because it was you who said in your foreign policy speech that you would go into western Pakistan if you had actionable intelligence to go after it, whether or not the Pakistani government agreed. Do you stand by that?\nSEN. OBAMA: I absolutely do stand by it, Charlie. What I said was that we should do everything in our power to push and cooperate with the Pakistani government in taking on Al Qaida, which is now based in northwest Pakistan. And what we know from our national intelligence estimates is that Al Qaida is stronger now than at any time since 2001.\nAnd so, back in August, I said we should work with the Pakistani government, first of all to encourage democracy in Pakistan so you've got a legitimate government that we're working with, and secondly that we have to press them to do more to take on Al Qaida in their territory.\nWhat I said was, if they could not or would not do so, and we had actionable intelligence, then I would strike.\nAnd I should add that Lee Hamilton and Tom Keaton, the heads of the 9/11 Commission, a few months later wrote an editorial saying the exact same thing.\nI think it's indisputable that that should be our course.\nLet me just add one thing, though. On the broader issue of nuclear proliferation, this is something that I've worked on since I've been in the Senate. I worked with Richard Lugar, then the Republican head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to pass the next stage of what was Nunn-Lugar so that we would have improved interdiction of potentially nuclear materials.\nAnd it is important for us to rebuild a nuclear nonproliferation strategy, something that this administration, frankly, has ignored, and has made us less safe as a consequence.\nIt would not cost us that much, for example, and would take about four years for us to lock down the loose nuclear weapons that are still floating out there, and we have not done the job.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to go the others in a moment, but what you just outlined is essentially the Bush doctrine. We can attack if we want to, no matter the sovereignty of the Pakistanis.\nSEN. OBAMA: No, that is not the same thing, because here we have a situation where Al Qaida, a sworn enemy of the United States, that killed 3,000 Americans and is currently plotting to do the same, is in the territory of Pakistan. We know that.\nAnd this is not speculation. This is not a situation where we anticipate a possible threat in the future.\nAnd my job as commander in chief will be to make sure that we strike anybody who would do America harm when we have actionable intelligence do to that.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Edwards, do you agree with him?\nSEN. EDWARDS: If I as president of the United States know where Osama bin Laden is, I would go get him, period.\nThis man is the mastermind of a mass murder in the United States of America. He is public enemy number one, as Al Qaida is.\nBut I would add, this has to be put into a bigger context of what should America be doing over the long term to deal with this whole issue of nuclear proliferation? Because if you look at Pakistan, it's a perfect vehicle for actually thinking about this issue.\nHere's an unstable leader, Musharraf, in a country with a serious radical -- violently radical element that could, under some circumstances, take over the government.\nIf they did, they would have control of a nuclear weapon. They could either use it, or they could turn it over to a terrorist organization to be used against America or some of our allies.\nI think the bigger picture on this is, what do we do over the long term?\nBecause what we're doing now is essentially an ad hoc, nation-by- nation, case-by-case basis of trying to control the spread of this nuclear technology.\nIn the short term, that is exactly what we should do and what I would do as president of the United States. But A.Q. Khan, who developed the nuclear weapon for Pakistan, we know has already spread some of this technology to other places.\nAnd I think this ad hoc policy does not work over the long term. And what I believe we should be doing over the long term and what I will do as president of the United States, besides dealing with these short-term threats -- which are very serious and should be taken seriously -- I, as president of the United States, want to do what some Republicans and some Democrats have said, which is to lead a long-term initiative -- international initiative -- to actually rid the world of nuclear weapons, because that is the only way to make the world safer and secure and to keep America safe.\nMR. GIBSON: Well, you led me right up to the point of what you'd do if the Islamic radicals actually took control of the Pakistani government and, therefore, were in control of nuclear weapons, and then you went away from that. But I'll come back to that in a moment.\nGovernor Richardson?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: In any foreign policy decision, I would use diplomacy first, in response to your question.\nAnd that basically means that the last thing we need in the Muslim world is another action like Iraq, which is going to inflame the Muslim world in a horrendous way.\nNow, here's what I would do.\nFirst, with Pakistan, here is an example of a country, a potentially failed nation-state with nuclear weapons. What a president must do is have a foreign policy of principles and realism.\nAnd the Bush foreign policy, with Musharraf, we get the worst of all worlds. We had a situation where he has not gone after Al Qaida in his own country, despite the fact that we've given him $11 billion. And he's also severely damaged the constitution. He's basically said that he is the supreme dictator. So we have the worst of all worlds.\nWhat I would specifically do as president is I would ask Musharraf to step aside. There is a provision in the Pakistani constitution...\nMR. GIBSON: Ask him to step aside?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Yes. For a caretaker...\n(CROSSTALK)\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Because we have the leverage to do that.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: We have the leverage to do that.\n(CROSSTALK)\nGOV. RICHARDSON: And I would send a high-level envoy to ask him to step aside.\nThere's a provision in the Pakistani constitution for a caretaker government of technocrats. This happened when a previous prime minister died. And I would make it unmistakably clear that he had to have elections.\nNow, elections are scheduled tentatively for February. A broadly based government, it's what's best for the United States.\nMR. GIBSON: I understand your point about diplomacy, but Senator Obama's postulate was, we have actionable intelligence, the Musharraf government won't move. Do we, should we go into western Pakistan and, essentially, try to take him out?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: If we have actionable intelligence that is real and if Musharraf is incapable, which he is -- because here's a man who has not stood up for his democracy, he is virtually in a situation where he's losing control -- then you do take that action.\nHowever, Charlie, first you use diplomacy.\nAnd diplomacy is to try to get what is best for the United States. And that is a democratic Pakistan with free and fair elections, and a concerted effort on the part of Musharraf or whoever is in the leadership in Pakistan to go after the terrorists in those safe havens which they have not done.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Clinton?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I think it's important to get back to your question, because obviously that's the most direct threat to the United States.\nWe did take action similar to what has been described about 10 years ago, based on what was thought to be actionable intelligence, sending in missiles to try to target bin Laden and his top leadership who were thought to be at a certain meeting place.\nThey were not taken out at the time.\nSo we have to be very conscious of all the consequences.\nNow, as far as I know, there are, like, five things quickly that we should be looking at.\nBin Laden has in large measure regrouped because we did not put in the troops and make the commitment to aggressively going after him inside Afghanistan when we had a chance. Therefore, we need more NATO troops and a faster effort to train the Afghan army so that we do have the personnel and the technology, including the Predators, to be able to be on the spot at the time to try to move as quickly as possible.\nSecondly, I think it's imperative that any actionable intelligence that would lead to a strike inside Pakistan's territory be given the most careful consideration.\nSEN. CLINTON: And at some point -- probably when the missiles have been launched -- the Pakistani government has to know they're on the way. Because one of the problems is the inherent paranoia about India in the region in Pakistan, so that we've got to have a plan to try to make sure we don't ignite some kind of reaction before we even know whether the action we took with the missiles has worked.\nReal quickly, thirdly, so far as we know right now, the nuclear technology is considered secure, but there isn't any guarantee, especially given the political turmoil going on inside Pakistan.\nI would work very hard to try to get Musharraf, who is the elected president -- these elections are about parliamentary positions. If you remove Musharraf and have elections, that's going to be very difficult for the United States to be able to control what comes next.\nI would try to get Musharraf to share the security responsibility of the nuclear weapons with a delegation from the United States and, perhaps, Great Britain, so that there is some fail- safe.\nAnd just, finally, I think that what we have to do is, Musharraf and Afghanistan, is to repair the failed policies of the Bush administration. And that's going to require intensive effort in the region. And Bill is right that we should be engaged in that diplomacy right away.\nBut this is the forgotten front line in the war against terrorism, because the Bush administration has walked away.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Charlie, I want us to just remember history. I want us to remember history.\nYears ago, we backed the shah of Iran, a dictator. We are paying for that policy today by having backed a tyrant who repressed his people -- unintended consequences.\nA president has to act.\nI believe that we have to be on the side of the Pakistani people, not on the side of the dictator.\nAnd what we have today is an opportunity to get Musharraf to step aside, to move toward this caretaker government, but also -- also -- to use the leverage of the assistance we've given him.\nMost of the assistance that we've given him -- $11 billion, he hasn't used to go after terrorists. He's put it in military assistance for his fight against India. The money has been stolen.\nWe get the worst of all worlds. If we stand on a foreign policy of principle, of human rights, along with protecting our security, that is the best direction for our foreign policy.\nSEN. OBAMA: Let me just pick up on a couple of things that have been said. And I think people are in broad agreement here. But I think one of the things that's been left out is Iraq. And part of the reason that we neglected Afghanistan, part of the reason that we didn't go after bin Laden as aggressively as we should have is we were distracted by a war of choice.\nAnd that's the flaw of the Bush doctrine. It wasn't that he went after those who attacked America. It was that he went after those who didn't.\nAnd as a consequence, we have been bogged down, paid extraordinary -- an extraordinary price in blood and treasure, and we have fanned the anti-American sentiment that actually makes it more difficult for us to act in Pakistan.\nJust one more point I want to make on this, Charlie. I think it is absolutely true that we have to, as much as possible, get Pakistan's agreement before we act. And that's always going to be the case.\nMR. GIBSON: I want to...\nSEN. OBAMA: But we have to make sure that we do not hesitate to act when it comes to Al Qaida. Because they are currently stronger than they were at any time since 2001, partly because we took our eye off the ball.\nMR. GIBSON: I want to go to another question. And it really is the central one in my mind in nuclear terrorism. The next president of the United States may have to deal with a nuclear attack on an American city.\nMR. GIBSON: I've read a lot about this in recent days. The best nuclear experts in the world say there's a 30 percent chance in the next 10 years.\nSome estimates are higher. Graham Allison (ph), at Harvard, says it's over 50 percent.\nSenator Sam Nunn, in 2005, who knows a lot about this, posed two questions that stick in my mind. And I want to put them to you here.\nOn the day after a nuclear weapon goes off in an American city, what would we wish we had done to prevent it? And what will we actually do on the day after?\nSenator?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Well...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. EDWARDS: Well, let me say first, this is the very point I was making a few minutes ago.\nIn the short term, we're faced with very, very serious threats about the possibility of these nuclear weapons getting in the hands of a terrorist group or somebody who wants to attack the United States of America.\nThe first thing is we have to immediately find out who's responsible and go after them. And that is the responsibility of the president of the United States.\nBecause if someone has attacked us with a nuclear weapon, it means they have nuclear technology, it means they could have gotten another nuclear weapon into the United States that we're unaware of. We have to find these people immediately and use every tool available to us to stop them.\nSecondly, it is the responsibility of the United States -- and by the way, what I'm about to say doesn't just apply to a nuclear attack. It applies to this crisis that exists in Pakistan right now with the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.\nIt is the responsibility of the president in times like this to be a force for strength, principled strength, but also calmness.\nIt is enormously important for the president of the United States not to take -- to react and to react strongly, but to do it in a way that is calming for the American people and calming for the world.\nBecause it would be an enormous mistake for the president of the United States to take a terrible, dangerous situation where millions of Americans or thousands of Americans could have lost their lives, and to ratchet up the rhetoric and make it worse than it already is.\nMR. GIBSON: Let me come to the two Sam Nunn questions to you, Senator.\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, as I said, I've already been working on this. And I think this is the most significant foreign policy issue that we confront.\nWe would obviously have to retaliate against anybody who struck American soil, whether it was nuclear or not. It would be a much more profound issue if it were nuclear weapons.\nThat's why it's so important for us to rebuild the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty that has fallen apart under this administration.\nWe have not made a commitment to work with the Russians to reduce our own nuclear stockpiles. That has weakened our capacity to pressure other countries to give up nuclear technology. We have not locked down the loose nuclear weapons that are out there right now.\nThese are all things that we should be taking leadership on. And part of what we need to do in changing our foreign policy is not just end the war in Iraq; we have to change the mindset that ignores long- term threats and engages in the sorts of actions that are not making us safe over the long term.\nMR. GIBSON: And I know, Senator Clinton, you've worked on this, as well.\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, I have.\nMR. GIBSON: But in terms of retaliation, this is not likely going to be a state that sets off a nuclear attack (inaudible), it's going to be a stateless group.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, the first part of your question was, what would we wish we had done. And I have worked on this in past legislation to move in the direction that I think we should go to have a very high level of commitment from the White House, including a person responsible in our government for marshaling our resources against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nSEN. CLINTON: There has to be a better organizing effort to make sure that every part of the United States government is working together. I don't think we've done what we need to do on homeland defense. You started that segment talking about the ease with which ABC smuggled things into this country. We haven't done enough on port security. We have not made the kind of commitment that is necessary to protect us from this kind of importation.\nBut let me just add that when you look at where we are, the stateless terrorists will operate from somewhere. I mean, part of our message has to be there is no safe haven.\nIf we can demonstrate that the people responsible for planning the nuclear attack on our country may not themselves be in a government or associated with a state, but have a haven within one, then every state in the world must know we will retaliate against those states.\nThere cannot be safe havens for stateless terrorists who are in these networks that are plotting to have the proliferation of nuclear weapons and be smuggling into our country or elsewhere the kind of suitcase device that could cause such havoc.\nSo I think we have to be very, very clear. You know, deterrence worked during the Cold War in large measure because the United States made it clear to the Soviet Union that there would be massive retaliation.\nWe have to make it clear to those states that would give safe haven to stateless terrorists, that would launch a nuclear attack against America that they would also face a very heavy retaliation.\nMR. GIBSON: Final word, Governor?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Charlie, when I was secretary of energy, that was one of my responsibilities: securing nuclear stockpiles, nuclear materials, mainly with the Soviet Union.\nI went there many times. We made progress.\nBut since then, there has been a proliferation of loose nuclear weapons, mainly in the hands of terrorists, that could cross, presumably, a border; that could be smuggled in in a cargo ship with our very weak port security.\nIf I'm elected president, I will do two things. First, I will seek immediate negotiations with the Soviet Union and other nuclear states to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, but also a treaty on fissionable material, where you have verification, where you try to secure those loose nuclear weapons from states like North Korea and others that could be drifting into the international community.\nBut most importantly, I think we have to realize that the challenges America faces internationally, they're transnational. They're stateless.\nIt's international terrorism. It's nuclear terrorism. It's environmental degradation. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Making us less dependent on fossil fuels. Those are the transnational challenges that are going to require international cooperation.\nAnd this president believes in unilateralism. This president believes in going military first. This president believes in preemption. You discussed this in the Republican debate. My foreign policy would be different.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to...\nGOV. RICHARDSON: There would be realism,...\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to move on.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: ... human rights and principles.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to move on.\nAnd I'm going to move on to domestic policy, how much the government is spending, how much you would spend with the programs you've proposed and the promises you've made.\nMR. GIBSON: And some of that is entitlements. For a little background, ABC's Betsy Stark.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nABC BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT BETSY STARK: Every hour of this new year, another 400 baby boomers will turn 60, swelling the ranks of those soon eligible to collect Social Security and Medicare. The forecasts are foreboding. By 2017, the Social Security surplus runs dry and the system begins taking in less tax revenue than it pays out in benefits.\nFor Medicare, the problems are even more severe. By 2013, the program's Hospital Insurance Fund is expected to fall into the red and the insurance premiums seniors pay for doctor's visits and prescription drugs are projected to keep rising.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nMS. STARK: Many young Americans simply assume there will be nothing left for them to guarantee the security of their old age.\nCharlie?\nMR. GIBSON: So I hope we have time to get to some of that, but before we get to it, talking about domestic policy, I want to get to the concept of change, because 60 percent of the people going into the Democratic caucuses in Iowa said they were going to go there for change, and that seemed to redound to your benefit, Senator Obama.\nMR. GIBSON: And arriving here in New Hampshire, Senator Clinton, you called into question, really, what that means.\nAnd you said, and I'm quoting you now, On a lot of issues, it's hard to know where he, referring to Senator Obama, stands. And people need to ask that. Everybody needs to be vetted.\nSo let me have a little dialogue between the two of you.\nWhat does he need to be vetted on? And what questions are there about Senator Obama that are unanswered?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, let me say, first, that I think we're all advocating for change. We all want to change the status quo, which is George W. Bush and the Republican domination of Washington for so many years.\nAnd we all are putting forth ideas about how best to deliver that change.\nBut I don't think you make change by, you know, calling for it or by demanding it; I think it is a result of very hard work, bringing people together, stating clearly what your goals are, what your principles are and then achieving them.\nAnd I do think that, you know, part of what this primary process is all about, and New Hampshire voters are, you know, famously independent in making their judgments, is to look at our records, to evaluate where we stand and what we stand for.\nAnd I think that there is a lot of, you know, room to ask all of us questions.\nYou know, Senator Obama has been -- as the Associated Press described it, he could have a pretty good debate with himself, because four years ago, he was for single-payer health care. Then he moved toward a rejection of that, a more incremental approach. Then he was for universal health care. Then he proposed a health care plan that doesn't cover everybody.\nSEN. CLINTON: I think that's relevant. I mean, I think that what we're looking for is a president we can count on, that you know where that president is yesterday, today and tomorrow. And I think that, you know, there are questions that should be asked and answered from each of us. And I certainly have no problem with whatever scrutiny comes my way.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Obama?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, you know, I think the Associated Press was quoting some of your folks, Hillary, so let's talk specifically about health care, since you mentioned that.\nI have been entirely consistent in my position on health care. What I said -- and I have said on the campaign trail this time -- is if I were designing a system from scratch, I would set up a single- payer system, because we could gain enormous efficiencies from it.\nSEN. OBAMA: Our medical care costs twice as much per capita as any other advanced nation.\nBut what I've also said is that, given that half of the people are getting, already, employer-based health care, that it would be impractical for us to do so, which is why I put forward a plan that says anybody can get health care that is the same as the health care that I have as a member of Congress -- similar to the plans that you and John have offered.\nWe do have a philosophical difference. John and yourself believe that, if we do not mandate care, if we don't force the government to get to -- if the government does not force taxpayers to buy health care, that we will penalize them in some fashion.\nI disagree with that because, as I go around town hall meetings, I don't meet people who are trying to avoid getting health care.\nThe problem is, they can't afford it. And the costs are too high. And so, as a consequence, we focus on reducing costs.\nNow, this is a legitimate argument for us to have, but it's not true that I leave them out.\nYour premise is, they won't buy it even if it's affordable. I disagree with that.\nNow, let me just make one last point, because you say that somehow I have not been specific. Social Security is a great example, something that you just raised, Charlie.\nAnd here's an area where John and myself were actually quite specific and said if we are going to deal with this problem specifically, what we need to do is to raise the cap on the payroll tax so that wealthy individuals are paying a little bit more into the system.\nSEN. OBAMA: Right now, somebody like Warren Buffet pays a fraction of 1 percent of his income in payroll tax, whereas the majority of the audience here pays payroll tax on 100 percent of their income.\nAnd I've said that was not fair. You criticized me for that, which is fine. We have a disagreement on that, but that's hardly because I wasn't specific on it. I was very specific on it, and...\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but I want to go back to health care and make another point. You have a mandate in your health care plan.\nSEN. OBAMA: For children.\nSEN. CLINTON: You mandate parents to have health care for children.\nSEN. OBAMA: That's exactly right.\nSEN. CLINTON: And, obviously, you did that because you want all children covered. So...\nSEN. OBAMA: Because they don't have a choice.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, they don't have a choice, and you're going to make sure that parents get health care for children. So, you know, you stopped short of going the distance to make sure that we had a system that could actually deliver health care for everyone.\nBut it's not only about health care. You know, I think that two weeks ago, you criticized Senator Edwards in saying that he was unelectable because he had changed positions over the course of four years, that four years ago he wasn't for universal health care; now, he is.\nWell, you've changed positions within three years on, you know, a range of issues that you put forth when you ran for the Senate, and now you have changed.\nYou know, you said you would vote against the Patriot Act. You came to the Senate; you voted for it. You said that you would vote against funding for the Iraq war. You came to the Senate, and you voted for $300 billion of it.\nSo I just think it's fair for people to understand that many of the charges that have been leveled, not just at me, but also at Senator Edwards, are not totally, you know, unrelated to the very record you have. And you've said records matter.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. CLINTON: And I think that we should get into examining everybody's record.\nSEN. OBAMA: I want John to be able to get in on this, but since this was directed at me, let me just make sure that I address this.\nFirst of all, I never said John was unelectable. Somebody asked me specifically what did I think was the difference between myself and John, and I pointed out some areas where I thought we had some differences.\nSEN. CLINTON: And you said that he had changed positions, did you not?\nSEN. OBAMA: And I did, because I thought that I'd been more consistent on those positions.\nI have no problem, Hillary, with you pointing out areas where you think we have differences. But on health care, for example, the reason that I mandate for children is because children do not have a choice; adults do. And it's my belief that they will choose to have health care, if it is affordable.\nNow, that's a perfectly legitimate policy difference for us to have. And that is different from saying that I will refuse to cover or leave out a bunch of individuals.\nAnd the last point I just want to make on this, Charlie, is, you know, these are all good public servants. And everybody has great qualifications and has done good things.\nBut what I think is important that we don't do is to try to distort each other's records as election day approaches here in New Hampshire. Because what I think the people of America are looking for are folks who are going to be straight about the issues and are going to be interested in solving problems and bringing people together.\nSEN. OBAMA: That's the reason, I think, we did so well in Iowa.\nMR. GIBSON: You've been very patient.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSEN. OBAMA: You were. And I appreciate it.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Thank you. No, you're welcome. You're more than welcome.\nLet me just say a quick word about this.\nYou know, Senator Obama and I have differences. We do. We have a difference about health care, which he and I have talked about before.\nWe have a fundamental difference about the way you bring about change. But both of us are powerful voices for change.\nAnd if I might add, we finished first and second in the Iowa caucus, I think in part as a result of that.\nNow, what I would say this: Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces of status quo attack. That's exactly what happens.\nIt's fine to have a disagreement about health care. To say that Senator Obama is having a debate with himself from some Associated Press story I think is just not -- that's not the kind of discussion we should be having.\nI think that every time this happens, what will occur -- every time he speaks out for change, every time I fight for change, the forces of status quo are going to attack -- every single time.\nSEN. EDWARDS: And what we have to remember -- and this is the overarching issue here, because what we really need in New Hampshire and in future state primaries, is we need an unfiltered debate between the agents of change about how we bring about that change. Because we have differences about that.\nBut the one thing I do not argue with him about is he believes deeply in change. And I believe deeply in change.\nAnd any time you're fighting for that -- I mean, I didn't hear these kind of attacks from Senator Clinton when she was ahead. Now that she's not, we hear them.\nAnd any time you speak out -- any time you speak out for change, this is what happens.\nMR. GIBSON: With apologies to Governor Richardson, I think (inaudible).\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, making change, making -- wait a minute. Now, wait a minute. I'm going to respond to this.\nBecause obviously -- obviously making change is not about what you believe. It's not about a speech you make. It is about working hard.\nThere are 7,000 kids in New Hampshire who have health care because I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. There are 2,700 National Guard and Reserve members who have access to health care because, on a bipartisan basis, I pushed legislation through over the objection of the Pentagon, over the threat of a veto from President Bush.\nSEN. CLINTON: I want to make change, but I've already made change. I will continue to make change. I'm not just running on a promise of change. I'm running on 35 years of change. I'm running on having taken on the drug companies and the health insurance companies, taking on the oil companies.\nSo, you know, I think it is clear that what we need is somebody who can deliver change. And we don't need to be raising the false hopes of our country about what can be delivered. The best way to know what change I will produce is to look at the changes that I've already made.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Can I respond briefly to that?\nMR. GIBSON: Let me -- I'll let you respond. Let me -- in all fairness to Governor Richardson.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, I've been in hostage negotiations that are a lot more civil than this.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nYou know, I think one of the things that we need to remember -- I'm going to say this again because I said it at a previous debate -- let's stay positive. You know, there will be plenty of time to get negative with the Republicans.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: You heard them earlier.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLet us talk about how we're going to make sure that we deliver health care for the American people, how we change America's foreign policy, how we make schools better and pay teachers better and get rid of No Child Left Behind.\nLook, what we need is change. There's no question. But, you know, whatever happened to experience? Is experience kind of a leper? What is wrong with, you know, what is wrong with having -- what is wrong with having been, like myself, 14 years in the Congress, two Cabinet positions?\nI mean, I've gone head-to-head with the North Koreans. We got the remains of soldiers back. We persuaded them to reduce their nuclear weapons.\nWhat is wrong with being a governor and going to a state and giving health care to kids under 12 and creating jobs and balancing budgets?\nWhat is wrong with being a secretary of energy who has made America, or tried to make America a land of clean energy (inaudible)?\nMy point is this: We want to change this country, but you have to have -- you have to know how to do it.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: And there's nothing wrong with having experience.\nSo, you know, I love change. We all are for change. But the question is, examine the record of those that, in the past, have produced change and that has taken responsibilities. We need somebody that has been tested.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to go to Senator Edwards and then Senator Obama, then we'll move on.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Thank you very much.\nWhat I would say in response to the discussion that just took place is we have to understand what's at stake. Nobody cares about hearing a bunch of politicians fight. They're not the slightest bit interested in that, and they shouldn't be interested in it.\nWhat's at stake here is a fight for the future of the middle class. And we do have different perspectives on how we fight for the middle class, how we fight for jobs, how we fight for health care.\nAnd I believe, and I believe it very strongly, that there are entrenched special interests very well-financed -- some examples are drug companies, insurance companies, oil companies, et cetera -- that stand between America and the change that we need.\nSEN. EDWARDS: And I think if you defend the way the system works, it's very hard to take those people on.\nI believe -- and it's -- I've fought these people. I'm 54 years old. I've been fighting these people, these irresponsible corporations -- and there are good corporations in America, Charlie, and I want to point that out, good corporations, good employers. Costco. AT&T, for example, is now working to help unionize some of their offices and to bring jobs back...\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. GIBSON: We'll get -- we'll get to the commercials later.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Let me finish this, though. I want to finish this.\nThe point is this: I think there are differences between us about how we fight for the future of the middle class. And I believe you have to be willing to take on these entrenched special interests. And I think if you're not willing to do it, it is impossible to bring about the change that the country needs.\nMR. GIBSON: Final words, Senator.\nSEN. OBAMA: And just to wrap up, part of the change that's desperately needed is to enlist the American people in the process of self-government.\nAnd one of the areas that I have constantly worked on is not only pushing aside the special interests -- this past year, passing the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate -- but also making sure that the government is transparent and accountable.\nSEN. OBAMA: And that's what I think people were responding to in Iowa. We saw it here in New Hampshire today. They want somebody who's talking straight to them about the choices that are ahead.\nAnd they want to make sure that government is responding to them directly, because folks out there feel the American dream is slipping away. They are working harder for less. They are paying more for health care, for college, for gas at the pump. And they are having a tougher time saving and retiring.\nAnd what they don't feel is that the government is listening to them and responding to them. That's the kind of change that I think we need.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to move on to our third subject before I run out of time. And I want to turn to Iraq.\nWe started the surge early this year. You all opposed it. But there are real signs it has worked. So from background, our man in Baghdad for ABC, Terry McCarthy.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTERRY MCCARTHY, ABC BAGHDAD CORRESPONDENT: It has been a tough 12 months in Iraq, with more U.S. troops killed than in any previous year of the war. But overall, the addition of an extra 30,000 troops has helped to reduce violence substantially. Civilian killings are down 65 percent in the last six months. U.S. deaths are down from 126 in May to 23 in December.\nGeneral Petraeus has repeatedly said the solution in Iraq must be political, not military. So far, political progress has been frustratingly slow.\nBut a year ago, many Americans, and the Iraqis, too, thought the country was a lost cause. Today, with improved security, life is returning to the streets of Baghdad.\nNobody yet says the war is over. But Iraqis are finally able to hope that things might be getting better.\nCharlie?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nMR. GIBSON: So, I want to ask all of you: Are any of you ready to say that the surge has worked?\nAnd Senator Clinton, let me start with you, because when General Petraeus was in Washington in September, you said it would take a willful suspension of disbelief to think that the surge could do any good.\nSEN. CLINTON: And that's right. Because, remember, the purpose behind the surge was to create the space and time for political reconciliation, for the Iraqi government to do what only it can do and trying to deal with the myriad of unresolved problems that confront it.\nAnd as your report said, you know, we have the greatest military in the world. We send in more of our troops, they will be able to dampen down the violence.\nBut there has not been a willingness on the part of the Iraqi government to do what the surge was intended to do, to push them to begin to make the tough decisions. And in the absence of that political action, 23 Americans dying in December is totally unacceptable.\nYou know, there is no more cause for us to be there if the Iraqis are just not going to do what they need to do to take care of their own country.\nSEN. CLINTON: So it's time to bring our troops home and to bring them home as quickly and responsibly as possible.\nAnd unfortunately, I don't see any reason why they should remain beyond, you know, today.\nI think George Bush doesn't intend to bring them home. But certainly I have said when I'm president I will. Within 60 days, I'll start that withdrawal.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: The policy's a massive failure.\nHere are the measurements that we should look at. Thirty-nine hundred Americans have lost their lives.\nThere are 60,000 Americans today that are wounded, mainly mentally wounded.\nTell that to the family that only 23 died in December.\nLook, here are the barometers that we need to look at.\nFirst, there is no military solution. There's a political solution.\nSecondly, has there been progress in any political compromises or reconciliation between the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds? Zero.\nHas there been progress in sharing oil revenues? Zero.\nHas there been any regional elections? Zero.\nIs the Maliki government intensifying its efforts to train the Iraqi security forces more than they have? No.\nIs there any end to Iran's efforts to bring terrorist activities to Iraq? No.\nIran, Syria -- no one has participated in a regional solution.\nThere...\n(CROSSTALK)\nGOV. RICHARDSON: No, Charlie, I mean, this is why I'm running for president. Because until we end this war, we cannot talk about the issues that need to be dealt with here: universal health care, improving schools, bringing people together.\nYou can't have change until you end the war, and that means bringing all of our troops home within a year and leaving none behind.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to take this to Senator Obama and to Senator Edwards.\nBut -- and I'm not here to debate -- the parliament meets, an oil law is under consideration, de-Baathification has progressed to some extent, and were it not for the surge, instead of counting votes, we'd be counting bodies in the streets.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: But this has been going on for years, Charlie.\nMR. GIBSON: And all of you -- all of you wanted the troops out last year.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: There is no serious progress.\nMR. GIBSON: Would you have seen this kind of greater security in Iraq if we had followed your recommendations to pull the troops out last year, Senator Obama?\nSEN. OBAMA: Let me respond.\nI think the bar of success has become so low that we've lost perspective on what should be our long-term national interests.\nIt was a mistake to go in from the start, and that's why I opposed this war from the start. It has cost us upwards of $1 trillion. It may get close to $2 trillion. We have lost young men and women on the battlefield, and we have not made ourself safer as a consequence.\nNow, I had no doubt, and I said at the time when I opposed the surge, that given how wonderfully our troops perform, if we place 30,000 more troops in there, then we would see an improvement in the security situation and we would see a reduction in the violence.\nBut understand, we started in 2006 with intolerable levels of violence and a dysfunctional government. We saw a spike in the violence. The surge reduced that violence, and we now are, two years later, back where we started two years ago. We have gone full circle at enormous cost to the American people.\nSEN. OBAMA: What we have to do is to begin a phased redeployment to send a clear signal to the Iraqi government that we are not going to be there in perpetuity. Now, it will -- we should be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in.\nI welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place, although I would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in Anbar province, Sunni tribes, who started to see, after the Democrats were elected in 2006, you know what? -- the Americans may be leaving soon. And we are going to be left very vulnerable to the Shias. We should start negotiating now.\nThat's how you change behavior. And that's why I will send a clear signal to the Iraqi government. They will have ample time to get their act together, to actually pass an oil law, which has been -- they've been talking about now for years. They will actually be able to conduct de-Baathification.\nWe will support them in all of those efforts.\nBut what we can't do is to continue to ignore the enormous strains that this has placed on the American taxpayer, as well as the anti-American sentiment that it is fanning, and the neglect that's happening in Afghanistan as a consequence.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to go to Senator Edwards. But all of you serve in Congress or did serve in Congress. You know how slow legislatures can move; you've all experienced it in the United States Congress.\nBut, Senator Edwards, let me go to you. Some of you -- Governor Richardson, Senator Obama -- you have talked about a timetable for withdrawal, getting all troops out by the end of 2009, 2010. If the generals in Iraq came to you as President Edwards and said, Mr. President -- on January 21, 2009 -- you're wrong, you can't do this. You're going to send Iraq back into the kind of chaos we had before, are you going to stick with it?\nSEN. EDWARDS: It is the responsibility of the president of the United States and the commander in chief to make policy decisions.\nIt is the responsibility -- of course, I would always listen to my uniformed military leadership -- directly. Not filtered through civilians -- directly.\nBut if you look at what happened in Iraq when the Brits began to pull their troops out, in the part of Iraq where those troops were located, there was a significant reduction in violence.\nWhat the whole purpose -- just to be clear with people -- the whole purpose for the surge was to create some environment where there could be political progress and political reconciliation between Sunni and Shia.\nEveryone believes -- even George Bush acknowledges that that's what we're trying to accomplish.\nThe question is, how do you get there?\nLook at the loss of American lives; $600 billion and counting; and there's been essentially no political progress.\nI don't believe -- and I think others would agree -- that there will be political progress until we make it clear that we're going to stop propping the Sunni and Shia up with American lives and with American taxpayer dollars.\nSo what we need to do -- and let me be very specific -- and this is what I will do as president: In the first year that I am president, I will pull 40,000 to 50,000 troops out very quickly.\nI will continue a steady redeployment of combat troops out of Iraq until they are all out within about nine to 10 months.\nIf my military leadership says we need some more time to make sure that we can do this in the most effective way and the most efficient way and the safest way for my troops, of course I'd be listening to what they have to say.\nBut I will end combat missions in Iraq in the first year, and there will be no permanent military bases.\nWe have to end this war, and the only way to end the war is to end the occupation, which is what I will do as president.\nMR. GIBSON: I've got one minute left, and I owe each of you 30 seconds.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, John, you can't end the war without -- you've got to get all the troops out to end the war because they become targets. And if you leave a small force behind, then you cannot bring the political reconciliation that is needed; you cannot bring a peacekeeping force by the United Nations or a donor conference to take over the $570 billion that we've spent on this war on resources that should be spent on health care and education for our own people.\nThis is where, with all due respect, we differ. I'd bring the troops back within a year. I don't want, in five years -- because I did, in another debate, some of you said you would keep troops, you wouldn't say you wouldn't get them out by 2013.\nI don't want, in five years, to have to look at an 8-year old today -- an eighth grader, an American eighth grader today who is serving, five years from now, in Iraq. I don't want to hear about the death of an American.\nYou know, as a governor, I fly the flags half-mast upon a death. I'm sick of doing that. We need to stop that. We need to think of our veterans that are coming back with PTSD, with traumatic brain injuries, with mental anguish. We have a crisis on our hands.\nAnd my whole point is that this whole campaign, everything we talk about -- universal health care, improving schools, helping kids -- cannot happen until we get out of this war, because the Congress and the president basically have a dysfunctional relationship where nothing gets done.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: And I can see that as a governor from my state as I try to deal with health care and education.\nSo this is why it's so fundamental, and this is why I'm running for president. End this war, and the way you do it is by getting all the troops out in one year.\nMR. GIBSON: I owed you 30 seconds. Now, you owe me 45, but that's...\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Clinton?\nSEN. CLINTON: I think we're in vigorous agreement about getting our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we possibly can, serving notice on the Maliki government that the blank check they've had from George Bush is no longer valid.\nWe're going to have to have intensive diplomatic efforts in the region. I don't think anyone can predict what the consequences will be.\nAnd I think we have to be ready for whatever they might be.\nWe have to figure out what we're going to do with the 100,000- plus American civilians who are there working at the embassy, working for not-for-profits or American businesses.\nWe have to figure out what we're going to do about all the Iraqis who sided with us, you know, like the translators who helped the Marines in Fallujah whom I met, who said they wouldn't have survived without them. Are we going to leave them?\nYou know, this is a complicated enterprise, so it has to be done right. And last spring, I began demanding that the Bush administration tell us whether they were undertaking the kind of planning that is necessary for the withdrawal.\nAnd, clearly, they're not. So as soon as I am elected, I will task the Joint Chiefs and the secretary of defense and the security advisers to provide such a plan and to begin to execute it within 60 days.\nMR. GIBSON: All right. Let me thank all of you. We're going to take a commercial break, three minutes. I'm going to bring Scott Spradling from WMUR up here, and we'll continue with some questions.\nThe Democratic debate from Manchester, New Hampshire, continues.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nI am joined, for the last half of this debate, as I was for the Republican debate, by the political director here in Manchester, New Hampshire, Scott Spradling.\nAnd I appreciate all of you, again, being with us. It's good to have the four leading Democratic candidates with us. Just to reintroduce them, Senator John Edwards -- former Senator John Edwards, Senator Barack Obama, Governor Bill Richardson, Senator Hillary Clinton.\nScott?\nMR. SPRADLING: Senator, I'd like to start with you.\nI was watching the exchange in the first half and saw what looked like a little bit of a double team that's probably going to have a lot of people talking tomorrow morning.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSEN. CLINTON: I'm glad you noticed.\nMR. SPRADLING: Yes, I did notice.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd I'd like to ask you this.\nThe University of New Hampshire Survey Center has been consistently trying to probe the minds of New Hampshire voters and get a sense of what they think about all of you. I'd be happy to report that the experience vs. change debate seems to be sinking it.\nAnd what I'd like to get is to this: New Hampshire voters seem to believe that, of those of you on this stage, you are the most experienced and the most electable. In terms of change, they see Senators Obama and Edwards as the agents of change, in New Hampshire mindset.\nMy question to you is simply this: What can you say to the voters of New Hampshire on this stage tonight who see a resume and like it, but are hesitating on the likability issue, where they seem to like Barack Obama more?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, that hurts my feelings.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. SPRADLING: I'm sorry, Senator. I'm sorry.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSEN. CLINTON: But I'll try to go on.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHe's very likable. I agree with that. I don't think I'm that bad.\nSEN. OBAMA: You're likable enough, Hillary.\nSEN. CLINTON: Thank you...\n(LAUGHTER)\nYou know, I think this is one of the most serious decisions that the voters of New Hampshire have ever had to make. And I really believe that the most important question is who is ready to be president on day one.\nYou know, the problems waiting, some of which we have talked about already, are huge and the stakes could not be higher.\nAnd, you know, in 2000 we, unfortunately, ended up with a president who people said they wanted to have a beer with; who said he wanted to be a uniter, not a divider; who said that he had his intuition and he was going to, you know, really come into the White House and transform the country. And, you know, at least I think there are the majority of Americans who think that was not the right choice.\nSo I am offering 35 years of experience making change, and the results to show for it.\nI, you know, respect and like both Senator Edwards and Senator Obama.\nSEN. CLINTON: But I think if you want to know what change each of us will bring about, look at what we've done. And there are a lot of differences that I think need to be aired for the voters of New Hampshire.\nBecause I stand on my record of experience, and I appreciate Governor Richardson's long history of serving our country.\nBut I think I am an agent of change. I embody change. I think having the first woman president is a huge change...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... with consequences across our country and the world. And that on the specific issues that I have worked on for a lifetime and the plans I have put forth, I believe I am more prepared and ready to actually deliver change.\nSEN. CLINTON: And I think that ultimately is what Americans want to know and believe.\nMR. SPRADLING: Senator, thank you.\nSenator Obama, I don't know if your ears were ringing during the first debate. I asked a question about you earlier, and am interested to hear your response to what the Republican candidates for president laid out in arguments for you not being elected president.\nI revved up the Republican attack machine. Please respond.\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, you know, I have to admit that I was going back and forth between the Republicans and football.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. GIBSON: How did the Redskins do?\nSEN. OBAMA: The Redskins lost.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut, look, I think there's no doubt that any of the candidates on this stage would represent significant change from George Bush. And we've seen a disaster, in both foreign policy and domestic policy, over the last seven years.\nBut what the people in Iowa were responding to, what I think that we're seeing here in New Hampshire, is a hunger for a different kind of politics that is very specific about pushing aside special interests that have come to dominate the agenda and the debate, reducing the power of lobbyists; something that I have done.\nI think people are very concerned about making sure that the American people are let back into their government.\nSo when I, for example, worked with a Republican to set up a searchable database, so that every dollar of federal spending -- we would know. If there was a bridge to nowhere, you'd know who was sponsoring it, and hopefully embarrassing them. If there was a no-bid contract to Halliburton, you'd know about that.\nThose are the kinds of steps that will actually lead to real changes in people's lives.\nAnd that's how I worked at the state level, bringing Republicans and Democrats together to provide health insurance to people who didn't have it.\nThat's how we were able to provide tax cuts to working families. And that is what I intend to do as president of the United States of America.\nMR. SPRADLING: Senator Thompson referred to your support as endorsements by some of the most liberal groups in the nation, trying to paint a picture that you would be way left of center.\nSEN. OBAMA: Of course. But Scott, that's what they're going to do to any Democrat. I mean, we've seen this movie before. We know the Republican playbook.\nHere's what I'm betting on, though, is that regardless of what the Republican candidates are talking about, I think that there are a whole host of Republicans, and certainly independents, who have lost trust in their government, who don't believe anybody is listening to them, who are staggering under rising costs of health care, college education, don't believe what politicians say.\nAnd we can draw those independents and some Republicans into a working coalition, a working majority for change.\nSEN. OBAMA: And the fact of the matter is I think that Senator Clinton has done some good work. I think Bill Richardson has done some good work, as has John Edwards.\nBut what we haven't seen over the last many years, even preceding George Bush, is tackling the big issues -- getting health care reform finally done, getting an energy policy that works.\nAnd that's going to require a working majority for change. We're starting to build that. We saw it in Iowa. We're going to build it here in New Hampshire. And I think we can build it across the country.\nMR. SPRADLING: Governor Richardson, I'm curious: Do you think to be president of the United States that prior executive experience is necessary? And is relative youth a detriment?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, I think prior executive experience is very important. I'm the only governor here. I'm the only person here who has actually balanced budgets.\nI've balanced five. I've created 80,000 new jobs. I've lowered taxes for everybody. I've insured kids under 12 in my state. I've improved education.\nYou know, you want somebody in this position that has had executive experience.\nAnd I will also say, Charlie, since, you know, I noticed Scott mentioned everybody else in the poll, he didn't mention me...\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut that's OK.\nMR. GIBSON: Did that hurt your feelings, too?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, a little bit.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. SPRADLING: Would you like to know?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: You know, let's face it -- the next president is going to have to have foreign policy experience. And of all the candidates here, I'm the only one that's negotiated with foreign governments, I'm the only one that has faced down the North Koreans and Saddam Hussein, I'm the only one that has had the highest national security clearance.\nYou know, so there's something about having experience and been tested and represented...\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. SPRADLING: Can I follow up on that, then...\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Sure.\nMR. SPRADLING: ... with your resume.\nI don't mean to interrupt, but I remember you as energy secretary coming to Boston for an energy summit way back in February of 2000, when the dialogue then was very similar to the dialogue that it is now: rising fuel prices, a struggling supply, frustration in the homes across New England and a call for some help.\nMR. SPRADLING: Here we are this past Thursday -- we've established it -- that it's $100 a barrel. Is it fair to say to you, in this experience argument, that you, as energy secretary, you didn't get it done then, so why believe you'd get it done now because we're having the same debate?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Look, both parties have been failures in dealing with energy policy, but you know -- and I remember meeting you there. Remember what I did, Scott. I went to OPEC countries and tried to get them to increase production so prices would go down.\nAt the time, there was a home heating oil crisis here in New England. I created reserves of home heating oil. Look at the price now in New Hampshire, $3.20, something like that. It's the highest ever.\nYou know, what we need is an energy revolution in this country, not some of the bills that the Congress has passed.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: We need to go to 50 miles per gallon fuel efficiency. We need to have 30 percent of all our electricity renewable. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by the year 2040.\nAnd we need the American people to sacrifice a little bit. I would ask the American people, when it comes to being more energy- conscious, to be cognizant of appliances, of fuel efficiency, the vehicles we drive, mass transit.\nYou know, I -- and I did when I was energy secretary, air conditioners 30 percent more efficient. I started the renewable portfolio. So, I did some things, Scott.\nThe problem -- you're right. We need a bipartisan approach. But we need to reduce fossil fuels by 50 percent by the year 2020, because our planet is getting damaged. And Al Gore has been right.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: He deserves the Nobel Prize. I'm glad he stayed out of the race.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to go to Senator Edwards for just a moment.\nYou answered the first part of my question about executive training. You didn't talk about whether relative youth is a detriment.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: I didn't hear that.\nMR. GIBSON: When I asked you the question, I said, is prior executive experience a key requirement for being president and is relative youth a detriment?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Relative youth? No. You know, John F. Kennedy was 42 years old when he was elected president. He's my hero, and I think he was one of our greatest presidents because -- because he inspired, because he said he'd go to the moon in 10 years, because he said that we all collectively have to do something for the common good.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Edwards?\nSEN. EDWARDS: What's my question?\n(LAUGHTER)\nNo, I'm glad that people like me, Hillary. I'm glad they like...\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. GIBSON: The prior executive experience. And is relative youth a detriment?\nSEN. EDWARDS: No, I think what matters -- we've had a lot of conversation about the first day in the White House. I think we ought to picture what that first day in the White House would be for each of us.\nI'll just speak for myself. You know, I'm the candidate up here who's never taken a dime from a Washington lobbyist in my entire time in public life or a dime from a special interest PAC.\nThe first day that I'm president of the United States, there will be no corporate lobbyists working in my White House. There will be no lobbyist who's lobbied for foreign governments.\nAnd this is a very personal cause for me, because I come from a family -- my father is in the audience tonight -- where my father worked for 37 years in the mills. He didn't get a chance, like I did, to have a college education.\nAnd this is a fight for the middle class and families just like the one I grew up with. My grandmother, who helped raise me, had a fifth or sixth grade education, came from a family of share-croppers, she worked in the mill every day so that I could have the chances that I've had.\nAnd this -- I spent 20 years fighting irresponsible corporations in courtrooms.\nSEN. EDWARDS: I know what it takes to fight these people and win.\nBut here's what I would want people to know. What I want people to know is, this battle is deep inside me and it is personal.\nAnd it matters whether it's personal or not, because is if it's either academic or political, when the tough fight comes, you'll walk away from it. You'll do what's political.\nThis fight is deeply personal to me. I've been engaged in it my whole life, to fight for the middle class, to fight against powerful special interests. And it is a fight I will wage on behalf of the American people as president of the United States and win, as I have for 54 years.\nMR. SPRADLING: Senator, I'd like to follow that up then.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Sure.\nMR. SPRADLING: You served six years in the U.S. Senate.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Yes.\nMR. SPRADLING: And on the campaign trail, it seems like you don't talk a lot about the six years. The people of New Hampshire probably remember you talking about your war vote and explaining later on why you weren't happy about that.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Yes.\nMR. SPRADLING: Can you give New Hampshire voters a guide of something significant that you accomplished in your six years as a U.S. senator...\nSEN. EDWARDS: Absolutely.\nMR. SPRADLING: ... that would give us some guide as to what kind of president you're going to be?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Absolutely. I could tell you exactly one -- I'll give you one very specific example, a big example.\nWhen the Democrats finally took over the United States Senate, the first issue that was brought to the table was the so-called patient's bill of rights, so that patients and families could make their own health care decisions.\nSEN. EDWARDS: What's happening now is insurance companies are running all over people. I mean, the case of Nataline Sarkisyan, which a lot of the audience will be familiar with -- 17-year-old girl who lost her life a couple of weeks ago because her insurance company would not pay for a liver transplant operation.\nShe had health insurance, but the insurance company wouldn't pay for it. They finally caved in a few hours before she died.\nWe need a president who will take these people on. What we did -- and I didn't do it alone, don't claim to have done it alone -- but I, Senator McCain, who was here earlier, Senator Kennedy, the three of us wrote the Patient's Bill of Rights. The three of us took on the powerful insurance industry and their lobby, every single day of the fight for the Patient's Bill of Rights. And we got that bill through the United States Senate and got it passed.\nAnd I'm proud of having done that.\nBut that's just an example of why this battle is personal for me. You know, we need a president who believes deeply -- in here -- believes deeply in this battle.\nAnd it is personal for me. When I see these lobbyists roaming around Washington, D.C., taking all the politicians to cocktail parties, I mean, the picture I get in my head is my father and my grandmother going in that mill every day so that I could have the chances I've had.\nWhere is their voice in this democracy? When are they going to get heard? They need a president who will stand up for them, and so does every American who's listening to this debate.\nSEN. OBAMA: I just want to add, I agree with John, which is why I prohibited lobbyists from buying meals for members of Congress...\nSEN. EDWARDS: Good idea.\nSEN. OBAMA: ... because -- and some of them complained. They said...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. OBAMA: They said, Where am I going to eat?\nMR. GIBSON: They can now buy food for members of Congress if the members of Congress are standing up. That's my understanding of what the rules have changed. You can't sit down and eat, but you can stand up and eat. Tell me why that's change.\nSEN. OBAMA: Here's what we did. They can't buy meals. They can't provide gifts. They can no longer lend corporate...\nMR. GIBSON: They can have huge parties for you as long as you're standing up.\nSEN. EDWARDS: They can't eat as much if they're standing up, Charlie.\nSEN. OBAMA: That's true.\nLook, we are now disclosing if they're bundling money for members of Congress. They've got to disclose who they're bundling money from and who they're giving it to.\nBut here's the critical point that I want to make. Not only does this have to be personal, John -- and I completely agree. When I think about health care, I think about my mother, who when she was dying of cancer had to read an insurance form because she had just gotten a new job and they were trying to figure out whether or not this was going to be treated as a preexisting condition, and whether or not they would pay her medical bills.\nSo I've seen the costs of a health care system that is broken in very personal terms.\nBut what I also believe, if we're going to bring about real change, then we have to bring in the American people. We have to bet on them.\nSEN. OBAMA: And that's what's been lost. People, I think, feel that they are not heard at all, they are not involved. And the only way we're going to muster enough power over the long term to actually get something done is if we've got a working majority, which is why it's so important...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. CLINTON: Can we just have a sort of a reality break for a minute? Because I think that it is important to make some kind of an assessment of these statements.\nYou know, Senator Edwards did work and get the patient bill of rights through the Senate -- it never got through the House. One of the reasons that Natalie may well have died is because there isn't a patient's bill of rights. We don't have a patient's bill of rights.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Because George Bush killed it.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, that's right. He killed it.\nSo, we've got to have a plan and a real push to get it through.\nYou know, when it comes to lobbyists, you know, Senator Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist. He lobbies for the drug companies.\nSo, I think it's important that all of us be held to the same standard -- that we're all held accountable.\nYou know, the energy bill that passed in 2005 was larded with all kinds of special interest breaks, giveaways to the oil companies. Senator Obama voted for it. I did not because I knew that it was going to be an absolute nightmare.\nNow we're all out on the campaign trail talking about taking the tax subsidies away from the oil companies, some of which were in that 2005 energy bill.\nSo, you know, words are not actions. And as beautifully presented and passionately felt as they are, they are not action.\nYou know, what we've got to do is translate talk into action and feeling into reality. I have a long record of doing that, of taking on the very interests that you have just rightly excoriated because of the over-due influence that they have in our government.\nAnd, you know, probably nobody up here has been the subject of more incoming fire from the Republicans and the special interests. So I think I know exactly what I'm walking into. And I am prepared to take them on.\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. SPRADLING: Senator, does that mean that you're further down the road than your opponents in this? Or are you saying that you can do things that these folks can't do, when it comes to being an agent of change?\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. Because I've been an agent of change. You know, you go back 35 years, you know, I worked to help make the case for the law that, thankfully, required that public schools give an education to children with special needs. I worked to reform education and health care in Arkansas against, you know, some pretty tough odds.\nIn the White House, I helped to create, you know, health care for kids and, you know, reform a lot of the other programs -- like taking on the drug companies.\nMR. SPRADLING: And to be clear, they can't. You're saying they can't.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I'm not saying that -- I'm only making my case, that this is what I have done.\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. GIBSON: I'll come to all of you.\nI didn't want to get into this, but I've covered Washington for a long time. And I know President Clinton came to Washington talking about change. President Bush came to Washington talking about change.\nSo many people in the administrations and in Congress say Washington is set up to resist change...\nSEN. EDWARDS: Absolutely.\nMR. GIBSON: And God love all of you for making this argument.\n(CROSSTALK)\n(LAUGHTER)\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. CLINTON: Can I just say, if you're going to mention President Clinton, I'm going to respond?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Let Hillary talk. Let her talk.\nSEN. CLINTON: President Clinton -- wait, President Clinton inherited a deficit, a debt that had been quadrupled in the previous 12 years.\nNow, anybody who doesn't think taking on the special interests to raise taxes on corporations, raise taxes on the wealthy, begin to whittle away at the deficit, to be able to leave with a balanced budget and a surplus -- if that didn't take a lot of change that actually produced results, then I think we've got amnesia.\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, change is hard, but change is possible...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSEN. EDWARDS: OK, can we speak to this? Can we speak to this?\nSEN. CLINTON: ... if you're prepared to work hard and follow through.\nSEN. EDWARDS: I want to say -- I just want to say a quick word about this.\nYou know, it is true that these entrenched interests -- whether you're talking about oil companies, drug companies, gas companies, whoever, these entrenched interests are literally stealing our children's future.\nThey have a stranglehold on this democracy. And they are having an incredibly destructive force on the middle class, on families being able to do what my family has done, and so many who are sitting here have been able to do.\nAnd the problem is you can't be with those people, take their money and then challenge them. It doesn't work.\nYou have to be willing to actually stand up and say no, no to lobbyists' money, no to PAC money, no corporate lobbyists working for me in the White House.\nSEN. EDWARDS: If you intend to take them on, and if it is personal for you -- and this is extraordinarily personal for me -- if it's personal for you, then you can be successful bringing about the change.\nTeddy Roosevelt -- just one quick example -- Teddy Roosevelt -- Teddy Roosevelt, a great American president: He didn't make deals with the monopolies and the trusts. Teddy Roosevelt took them on, busted the monopolies, busted the trusts. That's what it's going to take.\nWe have a battle in front of us. We do.\nI don't think we have a problem with politicians in Washington spending enough time with lobbyists and going to cocktail parties. They do it all the time. They do it every single day.\nAnd I'll tell you who's paying the price for those cocktail parties: Ed and Nataline Sarkisyan, every single American who doesn't have health care coverage, everybody who's going to the gas pump and paying so much for their gas.\nWhen are we going to have a president who actually takes these people on? That's what I'm going to do.\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. GIBSON: I'm going to go Senator Obama, and I'll come to you.\nSEN. OBAMA: Look, I think it's easy to be cynical and just say, You know what? It can't be done, because Washington is designed to resist change.\nBut in fact, there have been periods of time in our history where a president inspired the American people to do better.\nSEN. OBAMA: And I think we're in one of those moments right now. I think the American people are hungry for something different and can be mobilized around big changes; not incremental changes, not small changes.\nI actually give Bill Clinton enormous credit for having balanced those budgets during those years. It did take political courage for him to do that.\nBut we never built the majority and coalesced the American people around being able to get the other stuff done.\nAnd, you know, so, the truth is, actually, words do inspire, words do help people get involved, words do help members of Congress get into power so that they can be part of a coalition to deliver health-care reform, to deliver a bold energy policy.\nDon't discount that power.\nSEN. OBAMA: Because when the American people are determined that something is going to happen, then it happens. And if they are disaffected and cynical and fearful and told that it can't be done, then it doesn't.\nI'm running for president because I want to tell them, Yes, we can, and that's why I think they're responding in such large numbers.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: You know, this is the kind of Washington bickering that the public turns off to. And, you know, with all due respect, as a governor, I'm frustrated every time you guys and the president get nothing done because then the burden is on us.\nAnd, you know, John, I understand your frustration. I understand, you know, that it's personal. But, you know, to resolve problems, you got to bring people together. You got to heal this country.\nYou can't -- you know, it's great to say, We're going to take everybody on. But, you know, it's going to take coalitions of people backing us. It's going to take public financing to get the special interests out of politics. It's going to take bipartisanship.\nYou know, what I've said is that if I'm elected president, I'm going to have a Cabinet of Republicans, Democrats and independents.\nNow, I won't overdo the Republicans.\n(LAUGHTER)\nGOV. RICHARDSON: But my point is, it's how you govern. It's coalition-building. It's bringing the public -- a citizens corps of activists. It's asking the public to sacrifice, to do something for the country like being more energy efficient, like national service.\nYou know, I've got a program, two years the government pays for your college loans, your tuition, you give one year of national service to the country.\nIt's emboldering (ph) the electorate. You can't do it by just fighting and taking everybody on. You got to bring people together. And that's a frustration.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Give me 30 seconds on this, because you just said something...\nMR. GIBSON: I'll hold you to it.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. EDWARDS: I actually completely agree that it's the responsibility of the president to unite and galvanize the American people. It is also the responsibility of the president, and I will do it, to work with members of Congress to get things done.\nBut these entrenched monied interests that have a stranglehold on the middle class, that are doing incredibly destructive to American jobs and the health care system, energy, all taxes, trade, they're in everything -- absolutely everything, you cannot nice these people to death. It doesn't work.\nI have been in the trenches fighting them for my whole adult life. And it takes strength, backbone, fight and you have to take them on.\nYes, Barack, I agree with you completely that the best -- we need to unite America and we need to galvanize the American people.\nAnd, Bill, I completely agree with what you just said. This is not a fight with politicians. And this is certainly not a fight with the American people.\nIt is a fight for the American people against those people who are stopping the change.\nMR. GIBSON: All right. Let me turn to something else.\nReversing -- you invoked the name of Al Gore a few moments ago -- reversing or slowing global warming is going to take sacrifice.\nMR. GIBSON: I'm sort of sorry Chris Dodd isn't here because he's talked a lot about a carbon tax in this election. Al Gore favors a carbon tax.\nNone of you have favored a carbon tax. Is it a bad idea, or is it just so politically unpalatable that you guys don't want to propose it?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Can I answer?\nYou know, I was energy secretary. It's a bad idea. Because, when you have a carbon tax, first of all, it's not a mandate. What you want is a mandate on polluters, on coal companies, on those that pollute, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a certain target.\nUnder my plan: 30 percent by the year 2020; 80 percent by the year 2040. It takes international leadership. The better way to do it is through a cap-and-trade system which is a mandate.\nFurthermore, a carbon tax, that's passed on to consumers, that's passed on to the average person, that's money you take out of the economy.\nSo it's a bad idea.\nCap-and-trade is a mandate, but it's also going to take presidential leadership. It's going to take all of us here, every American, you know, to think more efficiently about how we transport ourself, what vehicles we purchase, appliances in our homes.\nIt's going to take a transportation policy that doesn't just build more highways. We have to have commuter rail, light rail, open spaces. We've got to have land-use policies where we improve people's quality of life.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Obama?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I agree with Bill that I think a cap-and-trade system makes more sense. That's why I proposed it: because you can be very specific in terms of how we're going to reduce the greenhouse gases by a particular level.\nNow, what you have to do is you have to combine it with a 100 percent auction. In other words, every little bit of pollution that is sent up into the atmosphere, that polluter is getting charged for it.\nSEN. OBAMA: Not only does that ensure that they don't game the system, but you're also generating billions of dollars that can be invested in solar and wind and biodiesel.\nI do disagree with one thing, though, that Bill said, and that is that on a carbon tax, the cost will be passed on to consumers, and that won't happen with a cap-and-trade.\nUnder a cap-and-trade, there will be a cost. Plants are going to have to retrofit their equipment. And that's going to cost money, and they will pass it onto consumers.\nWe have an obligation to use some of the money that we generate to shield low-income and fixed-income individuals from higher electricity prices.\nBut we're also going to have to ask the American people to change how they use energy. Everybody is going to have to change their light bulbs. Everybody is going to have to insulate their homes. And that will be a sacrifice. But it's a sacrifice that we can meet. Over the long term, it will generate jobs and businesses, and can drive our economy for many decades.\nSEN. CLINTON: Charlie, let me make a connection here that I think is really important.\nI think the economy is slipping toward a recession -- the unemployment figures on Friday hitting 5 percent, the $100 a barrel oil that we also hit this week, the fall of the dollar. There's a lot of pressures on middle-class families, and the kind of costs that they have to keep up with have all gone up astronomically.\nI mean, you know, the energy costs for the typical family in New Hampshire since George Bush has been president have tripled. And that's far beyond what the costs of the tax cut that they got from George Bush.\nSo, what we've got to do is use energy as an opportunity to actually jump-start economic recovery. We need to quickly move toward energy efficiency. We should require the utilities to begin to work for energy efficiency and conservation, costs that will be shared and decrease the pressure on families.\nWe need a weatherization and low-income heating emergency program that is out there now helping families in New Hampshire and elsewhere to cover their costs.\nAnd we need to look at how doing what is right about energy is not only good for our security and good for the fight against global warming, but it will be essential in dealing with the economic challenges that we face.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Edwards, I will take this question to you.\nBut you raised the issue of the economy right now. And we have a housing crisis in this country.\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, we do.\nMR. GIBSON: We have an energy problem -- in the cost of energy. And we now have a jobs problem.\nWe have, when we are -- and you raised R word, recession -- when we are approaching recession, it is consumers who have spent us out of recession in most cases.\nYou're all talking about letting some of the Bush tax cuts lapse. And yet...\nSEN. CLINTON: Yes, but, Charlie, the tax cuts on the wealthiest of Americans; not the middle-class tax cuts. One of the problems with George Bush's tax policy has been the way he has tilted it for the wealthy and the well-connected.\nMR. GIBSON: If you take a family of two professors, here at Saint Anselm, they're going to be in the $200,000 category that you're talking about lifting the taxes on.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. GIBSON: And...\n(CROSSTALK)\n(LAUGHTER)\nSEN. CLINTON: That may be NYU, Charlie. I don't think it's St. Anselm.\nMR. GIBSON: Two public school teachers in New York?\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut that is -- you're in a situation where you're taking money out of the economy, is what I'm saying.\nSEN. CLINTON: Look, if we set the cap where I'm saying, at $250,000 and above, that's a very small percentage.\nAnd what I want to do is fix the alternative minimum tax, create these new job opportunities primarily through clean renewable energy, but also get back to where middle class families get the kind of tax relief that they deserve, which they really haven't been getting under George Bush.\n(CROSSTALK)\nMR. GIBSON: Go ahead.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Thank you.\nWhat you see happening in America today, if you're president of the United States and as you are looking at this from altitude, is you see a very few Americans getting wealthier and wealthier; you see the biggest corporations in America's profits through the roof. ExxonMobil just made $40 billion -- record profits.\nAll of that happening at the same time that we have 47 million people with no health care; 37 million who will wake up in this country tomorrow worried about feeding and clothing their children. Tonight, 200,000 men and women who wore the uniform of the United States of America and served this country honorably will go to sleep under bridges and on grates.\nSEN. EDWARDS: It's time for us to say -- and it's time for the president to say -- enough is enough.\nThis is a battle for the future of our children. This is a battle for the middle class.\nLet's take jobs, which we haven't talked about. We've touched on a lot of other things; we haven't talked about jobs. We've had a trade and tax policy that is bleeding American jobs. And all it has done is pad the profits of the biggest multinational corporations in America.\nYou talk about professors here, at this college. Let me say a word...\nMR. GIBSON: Well, I shouldn't have done that, apparently.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Yes, it was a mistake.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut we are -- I saw a projection, just a week or so ago, suggesting that America could lose as many as 20 million to 30 million more jobs over the next decade.\nThink about that for a minute: 30 million.\nAnd who's the most at-risk group?\nSEN. EDWARDS: College graduates. This is not just people who are working in mills and working in factories who have been devastated by this -- completely devastated. These are middle class families. These are college graduates and their jobs at risk.\nWe need a different tax policy, a different trade policy where the first question is -- and this is what I will ask when I am president of the United States -- is this trade proposal, is this tax proposal, is it good for working, middle class Americans? That's the question.\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Obama?\nSEN. OBAMA: There is no doubt that the economy has been out of balance. It's been out of balance throughout George Bush's tenure. And some of the trends from globalization preceded George Bush.\nThat's why I have proposed specific tax relief now, immediately, so that we would offset some of the payroll tax, that we would immediately put some additional dollars in the pockets of American families, working families typically making $75,000 a year or less, to not only stimulate the economy, but also to balance out a tax code.\nAnd I would pay for it very specifically, by closing tax loopholes and tax havens. You've got a building in the Cayman Islands that supposedly houses 12,000 corporations.\nThat's either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record.\nBut the larger point is that we have to get back to a notion that opportunity and bottom-up economic growth is what the president should be fighting for.\nAnd what we've had is a top-down agenda that is skewed toward the wealthiest Americans. It is making worse some of the trends of globalization that are already out there.\nAnd one of the benefits of this campaign has been to listen and talk to the folks all throughout New Hampshire who are tired of it and want to see something change.\nMR. SPRADLING: Just very quickly, just for the governor -- I know we're running out of time. And I'd like to get this to you. You're going to say what you're going to say on this topic. But just, could you please address, as a governor, the small-business owners, in this tax talk, who may fit the category that we're talking about, but who are also providing the payrolls, proving the health insurance and are worried that if they lose out on this, that they could, too, be hurt?\nMR. SPRADLING: That's 75 percent of New Hampshire's economy we're talking about.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, also, like Governor Lynch here, I'm the only one that's actually run a state economy. I'm the only one that's balanced budgets and created jobs.\nSo, here's my response. You asked about how we improve the economy.\nOne, you got to balance the budget. I mean, this is $9 trillion debt to China, to commercial banks.\nWe got to have line-item veto authority for the president.\nWe've got to get rid of $73 billion in corporate welfare.\nThe second thing we need to do is, what ever happened to the Democratic Party? We used to be the party of jobs and economic growth. We should be investing in science and innovation and in green energy.\nTax incentives -- if a company pays over prevailing wage, give them a tax incentive.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: And, lastly, we have not talked about education in this whole debate. We've got to improve our schools. We've got to pay our teachers better. Invest in science and math. Get rid of No Child Left Behind. We've got to have arts in the schools.\nWe have to be an America that recognizes we're 29th in the world in science and math, and countries like China and India are graduating many more times engineers than we are. That's competitiveness.\nMR. GIBSON: We have just a couple of minutes left. And it's been a very interesting evening, I would say. And I've been fascinated. I hope people who have watched have been, as well.\nThere have been an awful lot of debates. I think is debate 681. You guys may have counted. I've lost.\nSEN. EDWARDS: At least.\nMR. GIBSON: Tell me one thing you've said in those debates that you wish you hadn't said. And it's your chance to take...\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. GIBSON: ... and it's your chance to take it back.\nSEN. CLINTON: Oh, you're going to start with me?\n(LAUGHTER)\nMR. GIBSON: Sure.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, you know, we've had -- I don't exactly know how many -- 13, 14. And I've lost count.\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, I feel like they've been good exchanges among us. You know, there have been one or two moments that I would have taken back.\nBut what's really most important about these debates is that the Democratic Party stands in such contrast to the Republicans.\nYou know, the Republicans have a totally different approach to what we need to be doing. They're not talking about the mortgage crisis and trying to solve it. They're not talking about what I fear to be a slide into recession.\nThey're not talking about global warming. They're not talking about science and innovation. They're not talking about what really is going to face the next president.\nSo, I think that we've done in our debates a much better job in actually getting out the issues that are going to be on the desk in the Oval Office when the president walks in.\nAnd, beyond that, I will leave it to the pundits to decide what I might or might not have said at any one of the debates.\nMR. GIBSON: I will let you off on specificity of take-backs...\nSEN. CLINTON: Thank you.\nMR. GIBSON: ... since we're running out of time.\nGovernor Richardson?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, I made a lot of them. One that I particularly remember -- I think it was here in New Hampshire, the first debate. I was asked who my favorite Supreme Court justice was. And I said, dead or alive?\n(LAUGHTER)\nI said -- I should've stuck to the alive, because I then said Whizzer White because I idolized John F. Kennedy, and I figured if he appointed Whizzer White, this was a great Supreme Court justice.\nWell, then I find out that Whizzer White was against Roe v. Wade, against civil rights. You know, so that's -- that wasn't -- that wasn't a good one.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nMR. GIBSON: Senator Edwards, I'll go to you, just with the passing comment that you haven't talked about Mrs. Clinton's attire recently.\nSEN. EDWARDS: I was about to say...\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. EDWARDS: I already figured this out...\nOBAMA (?): That was a good (inaudible).\n(LAUGHTER)\nSEN. EDWARDS: If you're going to pick the one for me, it was when I made the horrendous mistake of teasing Hillary about her jacket.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd I want her to know, I think you look terrific tonight.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nMR. GIBSON: And Senator Obama?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I -- you know, there have been all kinds of aspects to my debate performance that I'd love to correct or sharpen.\nBut, overall, actually, here's an area where I agree with Hillary: that there has been a stark contrast, generally, between the four of us and those who aren't debating with us now but were previously.\nThere is going to be a fundamental difference between the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee: ending the politics of fear that has so dominated our political debate, making certain that we're actually listening to the American people and the struggles and hardships that they're going through.\nSEN. OBAMA: And I think the opportunity to bring the American people together and to push back those special interests, to actually deliver on meaningful differences in their lives, that's something -- that's a prospect that I think all Democrats should be excited about.\nMR. GIBSON: I want to thank all four of you for being here. And I want to thank the six Republicans who preceded you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNo matter who people across the country are supporting, whether it's in this party or the other, we wish all of you well and we thank you for being here.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

We use the taxable wages, earned in Texas, your employer(s) have reported paying you during your base period to calculate your benefits. If you worked in more than one state, see If You Earned Wages in More than One State below.\nBase Period\nYour base period is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the effective date of your initial claim. We do not use the quarter in which you file or the quarter before that; we use the one-year period before those two quarters. The effective date is the Sunday of the week in which you apply. The chart below can help you determine your base period. If you do not have enough wages from employment in the base period, TWC cannot pay you benefits.\nTo have a payable claim, you must meet all of the following requirements:\n- You have wages in more than one of the four base period calendar quarters.\n- Your total base period wages are at least 37 times your weekly benefit amount.\n- If you qualified for benefits on a prior claim, you must have earned six times your new weekly benefit amount since that time.\nAlternate Base Period\nYou may be able to use an alternate base period (APB) if you were out of work for at least seven weeks in one base-period quarter because of a medically verifiable illness, injury, disability, or pregnancy. The ABP uses wages paid before the illness or injury. To be eligible, you must have filed your initial claim no later than 24 months after the date that the illness, injury, disability, or pregnancy began. Call a TWC Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 to ask if you qualify for an ABP.\nYou will need to provide documentation to substantiate:\n- The date and nature of your illness, injury, disability, or pregnancy. It must be medically verifiable, i.e., substantiated by a health care practitioner, a health professional, or evidenced by sufficiently strong physical facts.\n- You were unable to work for a period of seven weeks in one or more quarters during your regular base period.\n- You had more work in your alternative base period than in your regular base period. This may require employment and wage history.\nTypes of Job Separation\nTo be eligible for benefits based on your job separation, you must be either unemployed or working reduced hours through no fault of your own. Examples include layoff, reduction in hours or wages not related to misconduct, being fired for reasons other than misconduct, or quitting with good cause related to work.\nLaid Off\nLayoffs are due to lack of work, not your work performance, so you may be eligible for benefits. For example, the employer has no more work available, has eliminated your position, or has closed the business.\nWorking Reduced Hours\nIf you are working but your employer reduced your hours, you may be eligible for benefits. Your reduction in hours must not be the result of a disciplinary action or due to your request.\nFired\nIf the employer ended your employment but you were not laid off as defined above, then you were fired. If the employer demanded your resignation, you were fired.\nYou may be eligible for benefits if you were fired for reasons other than misconduct. Examples of misconduct that could make you ineligible include violation of company policy, violation of law, neglect or mismanagement of your position, or failure to perform your work adequately if you are capable of doing so.\nQuit\nIf you chose to end your employment, then you quit. Most people who quit their jobs do not receive unemployment benefits. For example, if you quit your job for personal reasons, such as lack of transportation or stay home with your children, we cannot pay you benefits.\nYou may be eligible for benefits if you quit for one of the reasons listed below:\n- Quit for good cause connected with the work, which means a work-related reason that would make an individual who wants to remain employed leave employment. You should be able to present evidence that you tried to correct work-related problems before you quit.\nExamples of quitting for good work-related reason are well-documented instances of:- Unsafe working conditions\n- Significant changes in hiring agreement\n- Not getting paid or difficulty getting your agreed-upon pay\n- Quit for a good reason not related to work, under limited circumstances. Examples include leaving work because:\n- A personal medical illness or injury prevented you from working\n- You are caring for a minor child who has a medical illness\n- You are caring for a terminally ill spouse\n- You have documented cases of sexual assault, family violence or stalking\n- You entered Commission-Approved Training and the job is not considered suitable under Section 20\n- You moved with your military spouse\n- Quit to move with your spouse when the move is not part of a qualifying military permanent change of station (PCS). You may be eligible for benefits but you will be disqualified for 6 to 25 weeks, depending on the situation. Your maximum benefit amount is also reduced by the number of disqualified weeks.\nLabor Dispute\nIf you are involved in a labor dispute or strike, see more information at If You are Involved in a Labor Dispute or Strike below.\nOngoing Eligibility Requirements\nIn addition to the past wages and job separation eligibility requirements, there are requirements you must continue to meet to stay eligible. See Ongoing Eligibility Requirements for Receiving Unemployment Benefits.\nBenefit Amounts\nWe will mail you a statement with your potential benefit amounts after you file your claim. You may use the TWC Benefits Estimator to estimate your potential benefit amounts. The estimator cannot tell you whether you qualify for unemployment benefits.\nYour benefit amounts are based on your past wages. How we calculate benefits is explained below.\nWeekly Benefit Amount\nYour weekly benefit amount (WBA) is the amount you receive for weeks you are eligible for benefits. Your WBA will be between $75 and $605 (minimum and maximum weekly benefit amounts in Texas) depending on your past wages.\nTo calculate your WBA, we divide your base period quarter with the highest wages by 25 and round to the nearest dollar.\nIf you work during a week for which you are requesting payment, you must report your work. Wages earned may affect your benefit amounts.\nMaximum Benefit Amount\nYour maximum benefit amount (MBA) is the total amount you can receive during your benefit year. Your MBA is 26 times your weekly benefit amount or 27 percent of all your wages in the base period, whichever is less. To receive benefits, you must be totally or partially unemployed and meet the eligibility requirements.\nYour benefit year begins on the Sunday of the week in which you applied for benefits and remains in effect for 52 weeks. Your benefit year stays in effect for those dates even if TWC disqualifies you or you receive all of your benefits. You may run out of benefits before your benefit year expires.\nMinimum and Maximum Weekly Benefit Amounts from 2010 to Present\n| Start Date | Minimum WBA | Maximum WBA |\n|---|---|---|\n| October 5, 2025 | $75 | $605 |\n| October 6, 2024 | $74 | $591 |\n| October 2, 2023 | $73 | $577 |\n| October 2, 2022 | $72 | $563 |\n| October 3, 2021 | $71 | $549 |\n| October 4, 2020 | $70 | $535 |\n| October 6, 2019 | $69 | $521 |\n| October 7, 2018 | $68 | $507 |\n| October 1, 2017 | $67 | $494 |\n| October 2, 2016 | $66 | $493 |\n| October 4, 2015 | $65 | $479 |\n| October 5, 2014 | $64 | $465 |\n| October 6, 2013 | $63 | $454 |\n| October 7, 2012 | $62 | $440 |\n| October 2, 2011 | $61 | $426 |\n| October 3, 2010 | $60 | $415 |\nSpecial Sources of Wages or Types of Employment\nThe following sections include details for special situations.\nBenefit Options for Wages in More than One State\nIf you worked in more than one state during your base period as defined in Eligibility & Benefit Amounts above:\n- You can apply for benefits in any state where you have base period wages. The state you choose will become your paying state. See Potential Benefit Amounts and Contact Information by State below.\n- You may either:\n- Ask the paying state to combine all of your wages in a single unemployment benefits claim. If you combine wages, you can only receive benefits from one state. If you earned enough wages in your paying state to qualify for the maximum benefit amount, then the paying state will not combine wages from other states on your claim.\n- Use only the wages earned in the paying state. Then based upon the law and base period provisions of the other states where you have wages, you may be able to use those other state wages to apply for benefits in the future.\nThe paying state will process your unemployment benefits application according to the rules of that state. The paying state asks the other state(s) to transfer your wage records. The paying state can then determine if you earned enough wages after combining wages from other states to qualify for benefits under that state’s laws.\nTo be eligible for benefits, you must register and search for work in the state you live in and comply with ALL of its requirements. TWC will verify that you registered in the state you live in. Find your state’s job bank here.\nPotential Benefit Amounts and Contact Information by State\nThe following table shows the minimum and maximum weekly unemployment benefit amounts and contact information for unemployment benefits in each state. States may change their benefit amounts at any time, so amounts included here may not be current.\nTo apply for unemployment benefits, find the state(s) where you worked, then go to that state’s website or call the number listed in the table.\nTo apply for benefits from the Virgin Islands, call us at 800-939-6631. We will take your application by phone and send it on your behalf.\n*Last update: October 27, 2025\nSee Also\nIf you worked in Texas during your base period as defined in Eligibility & Benefit Amounts above, but you are now living in another state or Canada, you apply for unemployment benefits in Texas.\nApply for benefits in one of two ways:\n- Apply online at Unemployment Benefit Services by selecting Apply for Benefits. Read the Applying for Unemployment Benefits Tutorial (Español) for help applying online.\n- Call a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak to a customer service representative.\nTWC makes the determinations about payment and pays any eligible benefits.\nYou must register for work search assistance with the One-Stop Career Center in the state where you reside within three days of applying for benefits and meet your required weekly work search activities. You can find workforce services near you using America’s Service Locator. We will verify that you registered with your state of residence.\nSee Also\nClaim Requirements\nIf you worked as a federal employee during your base period as defined in Eligibility & Benefit Amounts above, you need to estimate your federal wages when you apply for unemployment benefits. The federal government does not report wages to TWC each quarter as other employers do, so we must get wage information from you before we can calculate your benefit amounts.\nMost people who worked for the federal government can use federal wages to establish their benefit amounts.\n- If you worked as a federal civilian employee, you can use federal wages on your claim.\n- If you worked as a contract worker, and received an IRS Form 1099 instead of a W-2, you may not be able to use those wages on your claim. The federal agency you worked for will tell us whether the work you did was considered federal civilian employment and can be used for unemployment claim purposes.\nApply for benefits in one of two ways:\n- Apply online at Unemployment Benefit Services by selecting Apply for Benefits. Read the Applying for Unemployment Benefits Tutorial (Español) for help applying online.\n- Call a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak to a customer service representative.\nRequest for Proof of Federal Employment\nAfter you apply for benefits, TWC mails you a Request for Proof of Federal Employment form (pictured below) showing the federal wages you estimated.\nYou must do all of the following before we can use your federal wages to calculate your benefit amount:\n- Review the wages and make necessary corrections.\n- Sign the form.\n- Attach proof of federal employment or federal wages.\n- Return the form and proof of employment/wages to TWC.\nAcceptable Proof of Federal Employment\nThe most common proof of federal employment is a Standard Form SF-50 Notice of Personnel Action, or equivalent. A W-2 form or pay stub is also acceptable. Proof should have your name, Social Security number, the employing agency name and clearly indicate you were an employee. You cannot use Standard Form SF-8 as your only proof of employment, because it does not include personal identification.\nWe also request wage information directly from your former federal employer. When we receive wage information from your employer, we update your wage estimate with the information from the federal government.\nIf You Disagree with Wage or Separation Information\nIf you disagree with the information we receive from the federal government, call our Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak with a customer service representative. We will ask the federal agency to reconsider their findings about your wages or reason for separation. If you disagree with the federal agency’s reconsideration report, you may file an appeal with TWC. The TWC hearing officer will make an independent ruling on your wages and reason for separation.\nSee Also\nClaim Requirements\nIf you served in the military during your base period as defined in Eligibility & Benefit Amounts above, your military wages qualify you for benefits if:\n- You are physically in Texas when filing the claim.\n- You received a DD Form 214 when separated.\n- You separated under honorable conditions and completed your first full term of service.\n- You did not complete your first full term of service, but you separated early for a reason specified by Congress as an exception to the full-term requirement on your claim.\n- You served at least 180 days of continuous active service as a reservist or member of the National Guard.\nApply for benefits in one of two ways:\n- Apply online at Unemployment Benefit Services by selecting Apply for Benefits. Read the Applying for Unemployment Benefits Tutorial (Español) for help applying online.\n- Call a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak to a customer service representative.\nProof of Military Service\nThe following sections are about the military information that TWC requests.\nProvide TWC with DD Form 214\nTWC requests your military information from the Federal Claims Control Center (FCCC). If there is no DD Form 214 on file with the FCCC, they will notify TWC. TWC will then send you a notice asking you to send us a copy of your DD Form 214. We also request separation information directly from the military. We must have either your DD Form 214 or separation information from the military to use your military wages to calculate your benefit amounts.\nOnly send your DD Form 214 to us if we ask for it. If we send you a notice asking you to send a copy of your DD Form 214, submit it using our online UI Submission Upload portal (Portal de UI). The DD Form 214 must be a valid copy, not a worksheet. The copy must also be marked as Member 2 through 8 or Service copy. We cannot use Member 1 (or short version) because it does not have all the required facts. If you do not have your copy of DD Form 214, you can request a copy by following the instructions on the National Archives website.\nAfter we receive the DD Form 214 from you or separation information from the military, we determine if we can use your military wages to calculate your benefit amounts.\n- We calculate military wages using information on your pay grade at the time of your separation.\n- We also use information such as the term of service, character of service, or narrative reason for separation.\n- We will send a decision stating if we can use your military wages.\nIf You Disagree with DD Form 214\nInformation on your DD Form 214 can prevent us from using your military wages to qualify for benefits. If you disagree with the information on your DD Form 214, you can apply to your branch of service to change the DD Form 214 information. To request changes, submit a Department of Defense DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record, to the appropriate address on the back of the form. You can download DD Form 149 from the National Archives website or get one from your local Workforce Solutions office.\nWhile you are waiting for a decision from the military, you must continue to request payment as long as you are unemployed. If you have questions about a military appeal, contact your branch of service.\nIf You Receive Military Retirement or Disability Pay\nYou must report any military retirement pension or disability pay to TWC when you apply for benefits or by calling a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631. We may be required to deduct your retirement or disability pay from your unemployment benefits. We will mail you a decision on whether that pay affects your unemployment benefits.\n- Military retirement pensions that are paid as periodic payments are deducted from your benefit payments if you have military wages in the base period.\n- Disability pay is deducted from your benefit payments if it is paid by the military branch. It is not deducted if it is paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n- If you receive a disability pension, you must be able to work full time to be eligible.\nIf your military retirement or disability pay is deducted from your benefit payments, we convert the amount of your monthly pension into a weekly amount and reduce your weekly benefit payment by the resulting amount.\nSee Also\nClaim Requirements\nIf you are a teacher or a school employee working in a non-instructional position, there are two primary factors affecting eligibility:\n- Whether you are on a scheduled break:\nIf you have wages from an educational institution in the base period of your claim, are on a scheduled break in the school year and you have a contract or reasonable assurance of a job as defined below in the next academic term or after the break, you generally would not qualify for unemployment benefits because we cannot use your school wages to calculate your benefit amount. - Type of job separation:\nIf you lose your job through no fault of your own, you might qualify for unemployment benefits. TWC determines eligibility for benefits is determined on a case-by-case basis.\nApply for benefits in one of two ways:\n- Apply online at Unemployment Benefit Services by selecting Apply for Benefits. Read the Applying for Unemployment Benefits Tutorial (Español) for help applying online.\n- Call a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak to a customer service representative.\nReasonable Assurance\nReasonable assurance is a commitment, either written or verbal, that you will have a job after scheduled breaks or in the next academic term at your school or any other school.\nWe cannot use your school wages in your base period, as defined in Eligibility & Benefit Amounts above, to calculate your benefit amounts if you are on a scheduled break and any of the following apply:\n- You have reasonable assurance of a school job\n- You sign up as a substitute teacher with any school\n- You accept a job with any educational institution\nIf you have sufficient wages from a non-school job to qualify for benefits, we may be able to pay benefits based on the non-school wages.\nIf you receive reasonable assurance or get a school job after you apply for benefits, call a TWC Tele-Center immediately at 800-939-6631.\nResignation or Retirement\nKeep in mind the following regarding resignations and retirements.\nIncentives to Resign or Retire\nSome schools offer financial incentives to persuade employees to resign or retire. If you voluntarily accept these incentives, you might not qualify for benefits. However, if your employer would have laid you off anyway, you might qualify even though you resigned or retired.\nResign Rather than Accept Layoff\nIf you sign a resignation letter rather than accept a layoff, it may affect your benefits. Leaving a job voluntarily might disqualify you from receiving benefits. However, you may receive benefits if your employer would have let you go because of budget cuts, regardless of whether you signed the letter of resignation.\nReceiving Retirement Pension\nIf you qualify for unemployment benefits, we will reduce your weekly benefits by any pension amount you received from an employer whose wages we used to calculate your benefits.\nSee Also\nLast Worked for a Temporary Help Agency\nTo be eligible for benefits, each time you complete an assignment for a temporary help agency, you must:\n- Contact the agency according to their guidelines no later than the next business day.\n- Allow the agency three business days after your last assignment ends to offer you a new assignment before you apply for benefits. Waiting three days does not apply if you have an active claim and are submitting payment requests.\nTemporary help agencies are required to tell you the following:\n- You must contact the agency immediately after the completion of each assignment to receive another assignment.\n- You may not qualify for benefits if you do not follow all the agency’s procedures.\nApply for benefits in one of two ways:\n- Apply online at Unemployment Benefit Services by selecting Apply for Benefits. Read the Applying for Unemployment Benefits Tutorial (Español) for help applying online.\n- Call a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak to a customer service representative.\nLast Worked for a Professional Employer Organization\nWhen a company pays you through a professional employer organization (PEO, also known as a staff leasing company), the PEO’s name is on your paycheck or pay stub. The PEO is your employer. You must follow the PEO’s rules, including those on requesting and completing assignments.\nTo be eligible for benefits, each time you complete an assignment for a PEO, you must contact the PEO no later than the next business day for a new assignment. The PEO, or the business for which you completed the assignment, must give you a written notice advising you of this requirement after each assignment ends.\nApply for benefits in one of two ways:\n- Apply online at Unemployment Benefit Services by selecting Apply for Benefits. Read the Applying for Unemployment Benefits Tutorial (Español) for help applying online.\n- Call a Tele-Center at 800-939-6631 and speak to a customer service representative.\nSee Also\nIf Work Stopped Due to a Strike\nIf you or your class of workers are financing, participating in or directly involved in a strike, we cannot pay you benefits during the strike.\n- Class of Worker: The grade or class of worker is based on the type of work you performed. For example: If electricians are on strike and you are an electrician then you can be considered the same grade or class of worker that is on strike and will benefit from the strike.\nIf you are in a supervisory, non-manual classification and electricians are on strike, then you would not be considered in the same grade or class as the electricians. - Financing a Strike: Any payment such as union dues that are used to finance a strike or other payments made to a strike fund that assists striking members.\nIf you or your class of workers are not financing, participating in or directly involved in the strike, you may be eligible for benefits.\nIf Work Stopped Due to a Lockout\nIf your employer stops you from working due to a lockout (for example, the workers want to work but the employer will not let them), then you may be eligible for benefits.\nWhen Disqualification Ends\nThe disqualification for a strike continues until you no longer have any part in the dispute. It does not matter if you are a member of a labor union. It is not possible to requalify for benefits by working elsewhere. A labor dispute disqualification continues until:\n- The dispute is settled, and you report to work. Labor dispute disqualifications do not automatically end when the labor dispute ends. They end when you report to work.\n- You make an unconditional offer to return to work during the labor dispute, even if it involves crossing a picket line. If the employer does not put you back to work, you are no longer involved in the labor dispute.\nIf You Resign\nIf you officially resign during the labor dispute, we can end your unemployment benefits disqualification for the labor dispute. However, we may have to disqualify you for quitting your last work without good cause. This does not apply to a lockout.\nSee Also\nIf you lost your job because of increased foreign imports or shifts in production to foreign countries, you may be eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). You should ask your local Workforce Solutions office staff about eligibility for TAA as soon as possible because there are time limits on eligibility, training, and benefits.\nTo receive benefits under the TAA program, you must have been laid off from a job covered under a TAA certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). A petition for that TAA certification may be submitted to DOL by your former employer, a group of at least three affected workers, or Workforce Solutions office staff.\nStaff at your local Workforce Solutions office can tell you whether your company is covered by a TAA certification, and if so, give you the petition number, or provide you with petition forms. The petition number is important because eligibility and benefits are tied to that specific petition, which reflects applicable law and rule.\nTrade-affected workers covered by a DOL-certified petition may participate in TAA programs. Benefit eligibility information described below on this page is listed by petition number range.\nPossible Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits for eligible workers include:\n- Reemployment services\n- Job search and relocation allowances\n- TAA-paid training to prepare for new jobs\n- Weekly benefits called a Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA), which pays supplemental benefits similar to unemployment benefits.\n- Alternative/Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance\n- Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC)\nUnder the current law governing the TAA program, the program expired on July 1, 2022, and phase-out activities began. However, TWC will continue to determine eligibility and provide services to workers covered under certified petitions.\nThe following sections provide details on the program.\nTrade Adjustment Assistance Benefits & Requirements\nThe following are benefits and requirements of the TAA program.\nReemployment Services\nTrade-certified workers are eligible for services including job search assistance, skills assessments, and advanced vocational skills training to meet the needs of Texas employers as well as other assistance, such as transportation reimbursements and child care while in training provided through Workforce Solutions offices.\nJob Search & Relocation Allowances\nIf your Workforce Solutions office counselor confirms that there is no suitable work for you in your local area, then you may be eligible for job search and relocation allowances. This may mean we can pay for allowable expenses for your out-of-town job search trips and/or moving expenses when you relocate for a job.\nJob Search Allowances\n- Have at least one scheduled job interview with someone with hiring authority in the area of the job search trip.\n- Before each job search trip, submit a written Request for Job Search Allowance form.\n- Get the form at the local Workforce Solutions office and submit to the TAA State Unit by email at: TAA@twc.texas.gov or fax to 512-936-0331.\n- Make your written request no later than 365 calendar days after the date of your trade certification or after your most recent trade-affected layoff, whichever is later, or no later than 182 calendar days after completing TAA approved training.\n- Keep your receipts from the job search trip and fill out your Daily Record/Itinerary we gave you when your request was approved. You both get the form and submit it through your Workforce Solutions counselor.\nRelocation Allowance\n- Have a suitable, long-term, verifiable job or have a valid offer of a job where you want to move.\n- Before you begin the move, submit a written Request for Relocation Allowance. Get the form at the local Workforce Solutions office and submit to the TAA State Unit by email at: TAA@twc.texas.gov or fax to 512-936-0331.\n- Make your written request no later than 425 calendar days after the date of your petition certification or after your most recent trade-affected layoff, whichever is later, or no later than 182 calendar days after completing TAA-approved training.\n- TAA pays to move only your household goods and personal property as defined in federal regulations. For details, contact the Trade Services Unit by email at: TAA@twc.texas.gov before you begin moving.\n- TAA does not pay for moving expenses paid by other sources, such as your employer.\nTAA-Paid Training\nIf your Workforce Solutions counselor determines that there is no suitable work available to you, you may be eligible for training to prepare for a new job through Trade Adjustment Assistance. You should apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance-approved training as soon as possible in order to meet TAA deadlines.\nHow to Apply for TAA Training\nVisit your nearest Workforce Solutions office to apply for TAA-approved training. Identify yourself as a trade-affected worker and ask to speak to a TAA counselor.\nWorkforce Solutions staff will assess your job skills and discuss benefits available for TAA participants and talk with you about your options. If you need training to obtain suitable work, you may be eligible for training with costs for tuition, fees and books covered by TAA funds.\nThe Workforce Solutions office staff will notify you when your training application has been approved and the training institution notifies the Workforce Solutions office that it has accepted you into an approved training program. You must start training within 30 calendar days of the enrollment date.\nTypes of TAA Training Available\nTraining covered under the Trade acts include classroom training, on the-job training, customized training designed to meet the needs of a specific employer or group of employers, apprenticeship programs, post-secondary education, prerequisite education or coursework and remedial education, which may include GED (Graduate Equivalency Degree) preparation, literacy training, basic math or ESL (English as a Second Language). The state of Texas uses TAA funds to pay the training provider.\nTo be supported under TAA, training must be fully completed and all certificates or degrees secured within the maximum timeline permitted under your petition number.\n- 80,000 or greater: 130 weeks\n- 70,000 through 79,999: 156 weeks\n- 50,000 through 69,999: 130 weeks\n- Less than 50,000: 104 weeks\nDepending on your petition number, you may be approved to receive part-time or full-time training. Your eligibility for other types of TAA benefits may depend upon whether you are in full-time or part-time training; see the specific eligibility requirements for each type of TAA benefits.\nIf your petition number is 70,000 or higher and you are working but threatened with layoff, you may be eligible to enroll in a TAA-approved training program.\nEligibility for TAA Training\nIf your Workforce Solutions counselor determines that you meet the following requirements, you may be eligible for a TAA-approved training program:\n- No suitable employment is available.\n- You would benefit from appropriate training.\n- There is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of training.\n- Training is reasonably available.\n- You are qualified to undertake and complete such training.\n- Training is available at a reasonable cost.\nTrade Readjustment Allowance\nTrade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) benefits are similar to regular unemployment benefits. You must apply for and exhaust regular and any available extended unemployment benefits to receive TRA benefits.\nTo receive TRA benefits you must participate in TAA-approved training or have a waiver of the training requirement. Some TRA benefits can only be paid while you are in TAA-approved training. It is important to start and complete your training quickly, while you have TRA benefits to help cover your living expenses during training.\nTo learn more, see Trade Readjustment Allowance Benefits.\nResources\n- Workforce Solutions offices\n- Trade Readjustment Allowance Application (English)\n- Trade Readjustment Allowance Application (Español)\n- TAA Handbook (English)\n- TAA Handbook (Español)\n- U.S. DOL Trade Adjustment Assistance Program\nSee Also\nChild Support Obligation\nIf you owe court-ordered child support, we will reduce your weekly payment by up to 50 percent to pay your child support. The Office of Attorney General (OAG) notifies TWC if you owe child support. We deduct the amount directly from your payment and send the funds to OAG, who will give the money to the custodial parent.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        An official website of the United States government\nHere's how you know\nOfficial websites use .gov\nA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS\nA lock (\n) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

Chair Nadler. The House Committee on the Judiciary will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time. We welcome everyone to this morning's hearing on Revoking your Rights: The Ongoing Crisis in Abortion Care Access. Before we begin, I would like to remind Members that we have established an email address and distribution list dedicated to circulating exhibits, motions, or other materials that Members might want to offer as part of our hearing today. If you would like to submit materials, please send them to the email address that has been previously distributed to your offices and we will circulate the materials to Members and staff as quickly as we can. I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. Two weeks ago, in a leak of a draft opinion from the Supreme Court, we learned that for the first time in its history the Court may be on the precipice of overturning precedent to take away a constitutional right. In so doing it would revoke the constitutional right to abortion, a fundamental right it first recognized almost 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade and on that millions of Americans have relied on for half a century. I want to state at the outset that I do not condone such leaks and to whoever was responsible must be held accountable. Now, that we have this information, we cannot ignore the reality and the magnitude of what the Court seems poised to do and what congressional Republicans have said they will do once they are in power to enact a ban on abortion nationwide. The decision to become a parent belongs to that individual. She may consult with her doctor or her loved ones to inform that decision, and I hope that she has such people in her life to help her make that decision, but the decision belongs to her, period. Overturning Roe would remove from women the power to decide the fundamental question of whether to carry or terminate a pregnancy and instead would give that power to the State. It is both timely and appropriate for the Judiciary Committee to educate the American people about the devastating impact that such a decision would have and to examine the ongoing crisis in abortion care access that already affects people all across the nation. Before continuing I want to say something to those--to all those who are currently considering abortion care. Despite these very real concerns about the State of access to abortion care or its continuing legality, let me be clear: Abortion remains legal and your right to get an abortion continuous-- continues to be constitutionally protected, at least for now. Making decisions about when and how to start a family is central to women's lives. The right to decide whether to carry or terminate a pregnancy is central to life, liberty, and equality. It is the very essence of what it means to have bodily autonomy, which is a prerequisite for freedom. Again, to say it simply, the decision to become a parent belongs to that individual, period. No court decision is more essential to protecting a woman's individual autonomy than Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that recognized a constitutional right to abortion. Roe represented a watershed moment in our nation's history. Recognizing the right of women to make reproductive decisions is a fundamental right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and a pillar of women's equality. In doing so, the Supreme Court continued a series of rulings that rejected government interference in America's most intimate life decisions. To the Court, ``Few decisions were more personal and intimate, properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy than a woman's decision whether to end a pregnancy.'' Almost 20 years later, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the right to abortion finding it central to a woman's dignity, autonomy, and status as an equal citizen. Indeed, if Americans cannot make decisions about their reproductive health, they cannot make decisions about starting a career, going to school, opening a business, and planning their lives. Unfortunately, Roe and Casey remain under constant threat resulting in an ongoing crisis in abortion and other vital healthcare services. Over the last decade, State legislatures have passed hundreds of bills designed to block individuals from accessing abortion care. Under the disingenuous claim that these laws protect women's health, these States are deliberately attempting to put abortion out of reach. This is so in spite of the fact that numerous studies have concluded that giving birth involves more serious health complications than having an abortion. Meanwhile, according to the recently-leaked draft majority opinion in the pending case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization authored by Justice Samuel Alito, an emboldened right-wing majority in the Supreme Court appears poised to revoke the right to abortion altogether. To be clear, this draft remains just that: A draft opinion, and we await the Court's actual decision expected to be handed down in the next several weeks. Nonetheless, we cannot simply ignore the fact that the nation now appears to stand at a constitutional turning point. If the Supreme Court overturns or severely curtails Roe, a precedent that women have relied on for almost a half-century to make decisions about how best to order their lives, generations to come will have fewer rights than those that preceded them. At least 23 States have laws in place to limit abortions including 13 that have trigger laws that would automatically ban all abortions if Roe were to fall and at least eight States that have pre-Roe bans that would be--once again become enforceable should Roe be overturned. Practically overnight, whether the government protects the essential individual right to make reproductive healthcare decisions will depend entirely upon where in this country a person lives. Furthermore, if the leaked draft opinion becomes the Court's actual decision, it would exacerbate an already dire crisis in abortion care access. The consequences will be devastating. Women who cannot afford to travel, women of color, and women in rural communities will be disproportionately affected by State abortion bans and restrictions. People who work hourly jobs, already have children, or live many miles away from an abortion provider face impossible decisions and often unsurmountable obstacles in finding the time, money, and support to access the care that they need, the care that is integral to their dignity and their fundamental freedom to live their lives on their own terms. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will try desperately to change the subject in the hope that no one notices, but if Justice Alito's draft opinion holds, millions of Americans will lose their fundamental constitutional right overnight. Do not let them get away with it. They will try to muddy the waters today by accusing Democrats of bullying the Court as if the wealthy conservative justices poised to hand down this decision have it worse than the women and healthcare providers who risk imprisonment if they seek or perform an abortion after this decision takes effect. They will try to distract you from their ultimate goal, a ban on abortion nationwide without exception. Republican voices in the media have tried to downplay the consequences of all this by arguing that the leak itself is the problem and that it threatens the integrity of the Court. As I said from the start, the leak is a problem, but I will not be lectured on how best to protect democratic institutions from the crowd that cheered on the mob on January 6 of last year and continues to perpetuate a gross lie about the last election. As they accuse the leaker of undermining democracy keep in mind the most stunning aspect of this draft decision: Justice Alito's words and logic used today to undermine the right to abortion provide a road map for the erosion of other fundamental rights including the rights to marriage, to contraception, and to make decisions about raising our own children. Justice Alito's assurances to the contrary in this draft opinion are cold comfort. He used the same logic to argue against the right to marriage in Obergefell and there is no reason to believe that the same five justices will not engage in a similar raw exercise of power to overturn other basic rights should the opportunity arise. Ladies and gentlemen, at base, safe, legal, and accessible abortion continues to be fundamental to individual equality, autonomy, and personal liberty. The decision to become a parent belongs to that individual. We cannot go backward. Congressmen must now stand up with Americans around the country and refuse to turn back the clock. Republican leadership has already told us what they want Congress to do. For all their talk about returning power to the States, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said that a national ban on abortion will be under consideration should Roe be overturned. When that happens, living in a blue State will not save you from their attempt to take your decision about becoming a parent away from you. Nationwide means nationwide. Without exception means without exception. We cannot let that happen. Instead, Congress must Act to ensure that every woman, regardless of geographic location, income, race, or any other fact, retains her constitutional right to access abortion. We will fight for legislation at every level of government to protect women's health, to protect access to contraception, to protect access to IVF, and to protect abortion rights. Women must have the freedom to make decisions about their reproductive health without anyone questioning their intellect, morals, or honesty. I stand with the Members of this Committee and millions of Americans around this country ready to fight for reproductive freedom. I thank our Witnesses for being here and I look forward to this testimony. I now recognize the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, for his opening statement. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. It is about intimidation. It started in 2018 when the left and Democrats lied about Justice Kavanaugh, treated that individual in such a savage way. I don't know if I have ever seen anything like it. Two years later in 2020 we saw Senator Schumer stand on the steps of the Supreme Court and threaten sitting justices. Here is what he said: ``I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you've released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.'' It is about intimidation. Thirteen months ago, President Biden launched a Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court to explore packing the Court. It was no accident that that same month, the Chair of this Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation to pack the Supreme Court. Four weeks ago, this Committee held a hearing in a Subcommittee laying the groundwork to impeach Justice Thomas. Of course, three weeks ago, the draft Dobbs opinion was leaked, leaked for the first time it has ever happened, draft opinion leaked. Last week this Committee the Democrats passed legislation requiring, among other things, that people who want to submit amicus briefs to the Supreme Court would be required to disclose all their donors in an attempt to chill First Amendment protected free speech. The latest attempt to intimidate the Court started 10 minutes ago when this hearing was gaveled into order. This hearing is about the very issue in front of the Court as we speak. While this is happening, the Democrats in the House have blocked us from considering legislation passed unanimously by the Senate to give the Supreme Court justices more security. They need more security now more than ever. There are protestors outside their homes protesting each and every day. Protestors showed up at justices' place of worship on Mother's Day. You know why they are trying to bully and intimidate the Court? You know why? Because the evidence for overturning Roe is overwhelming and the reasoning and the logic in the draft Dobbs majority opinion is so strong. Here is what it said: ``Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided and Casey perpetuated its errors, and the errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of little importance to the American people.'' Further stated: ``We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes not reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.'' Finally, the opinion states: ``It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.'' To the people's elected representatives. Those representatives in the State of Mississippi passed legislation. That legislation was signed by the governor of Mississippi, also elected by the people of Mississippi. What did that legislation, adopted by the duly-elected representatives of the people of that State say? If an unborn child is 15 weeks or older, you can't take their life. You can't do it. Specifically, it said this: ``Except in a medical emergency a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of that unborn human being has been determined to be greater than 15 weeks.'' Why? Why did they pick that time frame? At five weeks an unborn child's heart begins beating. At eight weeks the child begins to move in the womb. At 10 weeks vital organs begin to function. At 11 weeks the diaphragm is developing. At 12 weeks the child has taken on human form in all relevant respects. People of Mississippi's legislature passed the law in question because they understand that life is precious, and it should be protected. They understand that life is a gift from our Creator. They understand that you can't pursue happiness if you first don't have liberty and you never have real liberty, you never have true freedom if government won't protect your most fundamental right, your right to live. I hope the draft opinion is the final opinion because it is a win for logic, it is a win for the Constitution, and most importantly it is a win for the sanctity of human life. Finally, I hope the attempt to intimidate the Court ends now. Mr. Chair, I yield back. Chair Nadler. Without objection, all other opening statements will be included in the record.

Good morning, Chair Nadler, Ranking Member Jordan, and distinguished Members of the Committee. My name is Dr. Yashica Robinson. I use she/her pronouns. I'm a board- certified OB/GYN, a board member with Physicians for Reproductive Health, and I am the Medical Director of Alabama Women's Center, one of Alabama's last clinics that provides abortion care. As a full-spectrum obstetrician/gynecologist, I have a busy obstetrics practice where I provide prenatal care, deliver babies, and treat people after they give birth. I also provide abortion care because I know patients deserve access to the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare options. As of today, abortion remains legal in Alabama and States across the country, but it is not likely to remain that way. This has never been a theoretical exercise. We're talking about the real health and lives of our neighbors, family Members, and friends. I came to this work not only because I believe all people deserve to make decisions about their lives, health, and bodies, but also because of my passion for young people, one that is deeply rooted in my personal experience with becoming pregnant as a young adult. Prior to finishing high school, I learned that I was pregnant. As a result of fear and lack of resources, by the time I confided in my mother and grandmother I had no choice. I was going to be a mother. Becoming a teen mother came with many harsh realities. I love my children with all my heart, but I know that everyone should be able to make the decision to parent for themselves. I have been in the shoes of many of the young people that I see in my clinic, and it is important for them to know that regardless of their decision that I'm here to support them. Access to care should not look different based on your ZIP Code. Because of medically unnecessary abortion restrictions I see patients forced to travel up to 12 hours from as far away as Louisiana, Florida, and now Texas because of the ripple effect of abortion bans, stigma, and targeted harassment all leading to other providers being forced to shut their doors. I know of patients who have slept in their cars overnight as a result of mandatory delay periods because they had no other choice. These restrictions add needless cost and delays. The effects on the patients I care for are painful for me to see and things are only going to get worse as States move to ban abortions should the protections of Roe and Casey, which are already illusory for far too many people in this country, be overturned. As someone who cares for people throughout pregnancy, maternal health is of the utmost importance to me. In Alabama, Black women are nearly five times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women. This is higher than the national average which is quoted to be three times more likely, and this will continue to worsen as more States limit access to abortion care. Systemic barriers, racism, and White supremacy are at the root of both our maternal health crisis and our abortion access crisis. It is undeniable that without access to abortion, maternal mortality rates will continue to rise. I cannot emphasize enough that abortion is essential healthcare. Receiving or providing this care should not be criminalized. By attempting to criminalize practitioners who provide abortion care, the bans that we have seen pass in Alabama and in other States threaten people and communities that are already suffering from a lack of healthcare resources and it compounds the complex scenarios that obstetricians like me routinely balance as we make the best decisions we can in managing complicated pregnancies. Restrictions on abortion affect everyone yet fall hardest on those who are marginalized and likely facing financial and logistical barriers to care. Often these are the same people who are disproportionately surveilled and targeted by law enforcement. Some States have already begun to increase investigation and criminalization of pregnancy outcomes. This is not speculation. This is happening today. People have unjustly been arrested, prosecuted, and jailed for their pregnancy loss and had their search histories and digital footprints used as evidence to prosecute and sentence them. Patients' well-founded fear of surveillance and criminalization leaves them to distrust the healthcare system ultimately harming our collective health and well-being. The truth is as more States enact abortion restrictions and attempt to ban abortion entirely, patients and providers will be put in untenable situations. Patients will be forced to leave their communities, providers forced to relocate to continue providing care to medical students, and residents unable to receive education or training in abortion care, patients and providers fearing criminal charges for seeking or receiving care, providing essential and normal healthcare. This is a future that is filled with control, fear, and coercion, but the bottom line is this: Abortion is healthcare and this is essential care that we must protect. The patients I care for in my community deserve dignity, autonomy, and agency. I urge the Members of this Committee to do everything they can in this moment to protect access to abortion care. Our lives depend on it. Thank you for holding this important hearing and I look forward to your questions. [The statement of Dr. Robinson follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chair Nadler. Thank you very much. Ms. Arrambide, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF AIMEE ARRAMBIDE Ms. Arrambide. Good morning and thank you to the House Judiciary Committee for inviting me to provide testimony today. My name is Aimee Arrambide. I use she/her pronouns and I'm a We Testify Abortion Storyteller and the Executive Director of Avow, an organization that strives for unrestricted abortion care and reproductive rights for all Texans through community building, education, and political advocacy. One in four of us will have an abortion, one in five of us experience mental health issues in a given year, and one in twenty-five Americans live with a serious mental health illness such as bipolar disorder. I live at the intersection of all three. I'm a first-generation Filipina American and second- generation Mexican American and I'm here to speak on behalf of everyone whose abortions allowed them to care for their mental health and enable them to thrive as a result. My story is not uncommon, but with the stigma surrounding both abortion and mental health disabilities it is rarely discussed. From my late teens into my mid-20s I suffered from undiagnosed bipolar disorder, but because I was a good student, I hid it well. In college it was harder to identify. For months at a time, I would be highly energetic, hyper-productive followed by periods of extreme depression. Just existing was too hard. I tried to self-medicate and attempted to end my life. In 2003 when I was 25 years old, I learned I was 12 weeks pregnant. I had been with my boyfriend for a year. We agreed almost immediately that I would have an abortion. This was before many of the abortion bans in Texas, so I was able to access care fairly easily despite the cost of $500. I was empowered to have an abortion because reproductive freedom was always a part of our family's values. My father was an abortion provider in Central and South Texas from the 1970- 1990s. He switched his specialty from anesthesiology to obstetrics and gynecology in the 1970s and after witnessing the repercussions of unsafe abortions before legalization, decided to provide abortions. When I was a child, he took me to a clinic in Laredo where he provided abortions twice a month. I witnessed the gratitude on the faces of those waiting in the clinic. My dad was a hero. In the year following my abortion my father was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor, and as I spent more time with him and as he spiraled into depression, we both realized that I was not well. I concluded that to help him get through this ordeal, I needed to get help. When I finally found the medication that worked, I was a whole new person. Treating my bipolar disorder enabled me to take care of my father after his brain surgery resulted in a stroke. I was mentally healthy for the first time in my adult life. I could be a full partner to my boyfriend who is now my husband of 16 years. During law school when I was ready, I had two miscarriages and then two children and my pregnancies were physically and mentally very difficult. After being a parent for the past 11 years, I have no doubt that if I had an abortion when I--if I hadn't had an abortion when I did, I would not have survived. My chosen pregnancies were not easy, but they were exactly that, chosen, and my children are my whole world. By 2019, Texans would encounter over 26 different abortion restrictions. It was then after my husband's vasectomy that I became pregnant for the sixth time. I had a medication abortion, a series of two safe and simple medications. While the abortion was safe and straightforward, the hurdles I had to go through were exponentially more difficult, and that's still with all the privileges and resources I had at my disposal. If this had happened any time in the last eight months after S.B. 8, the six-week ban, went into effect, I would have had to take off work, find childcare for my children, and travel out of State. If this had happened any time in the last decade before S.B. 8 went into effect, I would be able to get care in Texas, but I would also have encountered a 24-hour government-mandated delay, a forced sonogram, the legislatively-mandated, medically-inaccurate ``Women's Right to Know'' booklet, and anti-abortion counseling. When S.B. 8 went into effect, the impact was immediate. People were confused about whether abortion was legal, afraid to ask their friends and family for help, and unsure if they could call abortion clinics or funds because they were afraid of being sued or putting their loved ones at risk. The wait for care has increased at clinics in our four neighboring States because they care for the influx of patients from Texas, as well as some of their own communities. Texans have been forced to self-manage their abortion or continue their pregnancy against their wishes. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, Texas' trigger ban would go into effect 30 days after, banning abortion completely with barely any exceptions. This is real and it's terrifying. Everyone loves someone who had an abortion. [The statement of Ms. Arrambide follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chair Nadler. The Witness's time has expired. Thank you. Ms. Foster, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF CATHERINE GLENN FOSTER Ms. Foster. We're here today because there is an ongoing crisis in America. The crisis we're confronting is abortion, not abortion care, not abortion access, not abortion choice. No, we're here today because there is a crisis in America concerning abortion itself, full stop. We're approaching 65 million Americans dead from abortion. I know this firsthand. At 19 I aborted my first child. I felt emotional and psychological pressure to end my child's life. I was alone. So many voices in the culture lied to me. So many told me abortion was okay, was normal, was good even. I've lived with the regret of abortion every day of my life since. Abortion was damaging to me and deadly for my child. The truth is abortion is always damaging and deadly. I understand that the other women on this panel today believe differently. I know their stories and I've read their testimony. What is never addressed in their testimony is the simple reality of abortion violence. Abortion activism always requires euphemism and misdirection. Why? Because of the violent nature of abortion. Because it is frankly inconvenient. Human persons from their earliest days poisoned in the womb and dismembered, torn limb from limb, bodies thrown in medical waste bins, and in places like Washington, DC, burned to power the lights of the city's homes and streets. Let that image sink with you for a moment. The next time you turn on the light think of the incinerators, think of what we're doing to ourselves so callously and so numbly. Always and everywhere, the convictions of pro-abortion activists are damaging, are deadly, and are devastating to the fabric of American democracy. To speak for the violence of abortion is to speak for injustice. There's no other way to put it. We once had allegedly serious citizens in America speak for slavery. Many fought and even died to perpetuate that injustice. It seems incredible to us today, but Americans can and will overcome the injustice of abortion just as Americans did finally overcome the injustice of slavery. Indeed, we're here today because the U.S. Supreme Court appears to be finally on the verge of reversing Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Roe and Casey are widely regarded by legal scholars on the left and the right as the Court's greatest and most profound mistakes since Dred Scott or Plessy. The future of America, a post-Roe America, is a future full of hope. Roe's reversal will make it possible for America's lawmakers to once again affirmatively to protect the human right to life and to enshrine law and policy that makes abortion unthinkable for even those most vulnerable to abortion propaganda. Now, despite this historic moment, pro-abortion Members of Congress recently voted to enshrine abortion in a more systemically unjust way even than Roe. Codifying Roe would threaten to invalidate State informed consent protections. Codifying Roe would threaten to invalidate reflection periods, consumer tele-med protections, State prohibitions against race or sex or genetic discrimination, and State laws protecting human persons at or before the point of viability. Nowhere do efforts to codify Roe into Federal law mention either the child or the democratic will of the American people. Everything real about the mother and child evaporates into thin air. The American people, through their elected officials, recognize the need for basic oversight, for genuine informed consent, and for the interests of the child to matter. It is pro-abortion Members of Congress who are out of step with the American people. It is a biological reality that a preborn child is a member of the human family. We want a true constitutional order that equally protects all Members of the human family. Even President Biden, despite being bought and paid for by corporate abortion money, acknowledged the truth earlier this month that at the center of every abortion is, and this is his word, ``a child.'' Abortion is fundamentally unjust. Abortion deprives our brothers and sisters of the equal protection of the laws. Abortion turns equals into unequals, it empowers the strong at the expense of the vulnerable, and it makes us all less human and less humane along the way. We must confront the violence of abortion and learn to live and thrive together. We are Americans; we are up to the challenge. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Foster follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chair Nadler. Okay. Thank you. Professor Goodwin, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF MICHELE BRATCHER GOODWIN Ms. Goodwin. Good morning, Chair Nadler, Ranking Member Jordan, and distinguished Members of the House Judiciary Committee. Thank you for inviting me to participate in today's hearing. My name is Michele Bratcher Goodwin. I am a Chancellor's Professor at the University of California Irvine, a senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School. I write and teach in the areas of constitutional law, bioethics, and health law. My scholarship is published in the Harvard Law Review and the Yale Law Journal, among others, and in books, most recently ``Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood.'' Over the past 50 years that have been nearly 50 bombings of abortion clinics with doctors, nurses, and security guards having been killed. There have been threats and mass shootings at our clinics in the United States where they are performing constitutionally-protected healthcare. Now soon, the Supreme Court will issue a ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case that involves a Mississippi abortion ban at 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the Supreme Court allows Mississippi's ban to go into effect, it will be endorsing Mississippi's solicitation to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, two cases underpinning the constitutional right to abortion in the United States. For many women of means who can travel and pay for childcare, the loss of Roe will be devastating. For poor women, particularly poor women of color, the loss will be deadly. This is the coming of the new Jane Crow. In this term, the Supreme Court demonstrated its willingness to selectively read and ignore its own jurisprudence when it allowed a draconian Texas abortion ban, S.B. 8, to go into effect. S.B. 8 bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy before which many women, girls, and pregnant-capable people even realize that they are pregnant. Ripping a page from the darkest annals of American history, the Texas law includes a bounty provision that allows local residents to sue individuals who aid, abet, or assist individuals seeking to terminate a pregnancy. As its shameful predecessor, the Fugitive Slave Act showed the bounty incentivizes private individuals to spy upon, surveil, and interfere with the individuals asserting fundamental human and constitutional rights such as bodily autonomy, privacy, and freedom. Revoking abortion rights is the very subject of Justice Alito's leaked draft opinion, which is disturbing for many reasons including troubling inaccuracies, unsupported assertions, and flawed reasoning such as the notion that constitutional rights do not exist unless explicitly articulated or enumerated in the Constitution. This novel principal casts doubt on the legitimacy of corporate religious personhood and artful contrivance of law innovated in 2014 by Justice Alito himself in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, a case that bestowed religious liberties on for-profit corporations that sought to limit contraceptive access to female employees. Nowhere in the Constitution or statute is it mentioned that for-profit corporations shall have religious identities and liberties, nevertheless this was crafted by Justice Alito less than a decade ago. If the draft opinion derives from a purported neutral view of the law, as Justice Alito argues, its technical errors and omissions are stunningly apparent. Not once does the opinion address rape or incest even though the newly styled abortion bans, including the Mississippi law, the subject of the draft opinion, and Texas' S.B. 8 law, provide no exceptions for survivors. Sadly, the draft opinion eschews inconvenient facts calling them irrelevant, yet facts matter. Moreover, one of the most substantive omissions in Justice Alito's draft is that the Constitution establishes that, ``All persons born or naturalized are citizens of the United States.'' The Constitution does not mention embryos, fetuses, or unborn children. Now, stripping away these exceptions and forcing abortion providers to close their doors exposes the illogic and cruel political nature of these bans which showcase the dismantling of democratic norms and principles. Justice Alito writes about Blackstone, Coke, and Hale, and in fact he cites these legal authorities, legal authorities who condemned women to the status of property and suggested that women could be subjected to physical punishment and even rape by their husbands. According to Blackstone, this was for her protection and benefit. Now, notably, it was the 13th and 14th Amendments in which women, not just men, were freed from the bondages of slavery. It is very clear that the 13th and 14th Amendments were intended to apply to Black women, not just Black men, that they should not be subjected to involuntary servitude. Now, as I conclude, history reveals the cruelties of racism, sexism, and White supremacy in labor and reproduction. It is undeniable history reported by this very Congress. Should the Supreme Court dismantle Roe v. Wade, its decision will be the modern-day corollary and appendage to Plessy v. Ferguson, anchoring separate but equal legal discourse in matters of reproductive health rights and justice. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Goodwin follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chair Nadler. I thank all the Witnesses for their testimony. We will now proceed under the five-minute rule with questions. I will recognize myself for five minutes. Ms. Arrambide, for nearly a year, abortion care has effectively been banned in your home State of Texas since S.B. 8 went into effect in September of 2021. The leaked draft majority opinion in Dobbs is deeply troubling, but the truth is there has been a multi-year assault by a hostile State legislature that has severely impacted abortion care access in your State. How has this multi-year attack in Texas' draconian six-week abortion ban affected the lives of pregnant people in Texas today? Ms. Arrambide. Thank you. In Texas, currently, we're living in a post-Roe world will--where people can't access the abortion care they need or they want despite the fact that the majority of Texans support access to abortion care. People have had to--they're too afraid to look for information for fear of being sued. They're too afraid to call clinics for fear of being sued. They're too afraid to even access resources from abortion funds because they don't know what the repercussions might be for their loved ones and themselves. In addition to that once they're able to find out the information, their care is delayed. They had to find childcare accommodations, the ability to travel out of State. They have to make appointments at clinics that are already at capacity serving their own communities. Many times, people are forced either to forego care altogether or--and be forced to carry their pregnancy to term or they're self-managing their abortion. Abortion is essential healthcare and it should be available to everyone. In Texas, we've been living as if we're already in a post-Roe world, and it's only going to get worse. If the decision stands, over 26 States are poised to ban abortion and the impact will be exponential across the country. Texas is home to over 30 million people. Seven million in 2019 were of reproductive age and ability. Those people won't be able to access the care they need. That's a travesty. Thank you. Chair Nadler. Thank you. Professor Goodwin, as of today the right to access abortion care is constitutionally protected. If the Alito draft opinion is handed down tomorrow and Roe and Casey were overturned, we would face a situation where the Court will have taken away a long-recognized constitutional right. A person will have had a constitutional right today, gone to bed and woken up tomorrow to find that she no longer has such a right. What is your reaction to such a scenario? Ms. Goodwin. It is incredibly unusual in our American democracy and the Supreme Court's jurisprudence that the Supreme Court would actually take away the expansion of a right which is fundamental. That is not something that we've seen the Court do. Instead, what the Court has done has been to reject draconian laws such as those that enslaved American Black people or laws that denied women rights such as to become attorneys, or when there were laws that denied women to be able to have credit cards in their own names. The Supreme Court has struck down such laws and has expanded freedoms. The Supreme Court has never gone back to, in fact, revoke what have been freedoms that have been well-articulated and established in the Constitution and also by the Supreme Court is highly unusual. Chair Nadler. Dr. Robinson, States have been chipping away at the right to abortion for years by restricting access to abortion care. Nonetheless, for two generations of Americans, Roe v. Wade has been the legal cornerstone of women's equality by assuring that they have access to safe, legal, and lifesaving medical care. If the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe, how would it further exacerbate the current crisis in abortion care access and what would it mean for the patients and communities you serve? Dr. Robinson. As I mentioned in my testimony, access to abortion care is very essential for patients in my community and throughout the U.S. It would be quite devastating. Alabama is already poised to have a complete ban on abortion. We already have a law on the books. So, if this is overturned, that means that patients in my community and the surrounding communities who have depended on us for care will no longer have access to the healthcare that they need. It also means that providers of care to people who are pregnant like me will have their hands tied when it comes to talking to patients about options when it comes to their healthcare. I know that many legislators have talked about writing in restrictions or allowances for the health of the mother, but in a situation where we already have--where Roe is already in place, as an obstetrician I already have difficulties obtaining the permission to proceed with abortion care for patients who are in my hospital. If these patients are hospitalized and they're hospitalized because they are very ill, we already require two physicians to be able to sign off on this. Unfortunately, when a person is pregnant and is prior to 20 weeks, 22 weeks gestational age, that means that if we end that pregnancy, that means that the pregnancy will not come to term. So, as hard as it is to hear, that is still called an abortion and it is medical care that some patients need. We have difficulty obtaining permission to proceed with that right now. Chair Nadler. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr. Gaetz? Mr. Gaetz. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield to Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you. The very subject of this hearing is an outrage. Abortion care, the stated topic today, is, of course, an oxymoron. The timing and the obvious purpose of this hearing today are unconscionable, and they are profoundly damaging to our institutions. Democrats are engaging in a brazen attempt here to intimidate and bully the justices of Supreme Court as they consider a challenge to Mississippi's pro-life law. As soon as the draft opinion was leaked, their activists on the left began to picket and harass the justices and their families in their homes. Democrats have threatened the justices by name in the press, on the steps of the Supreme Court, and in recent briefs to the Court, and now in this and previous Judiciary Committee hearings. We have jurisdiction of the American system of justice and the fact that we would be here trying to influence a pending opinion is unprecedented and dangerous to our institutions. So much for the Constitution, our system of justice, and our critical foundations and the principle of judicial independence. There is no right to abortion in the Constitution, period. Never was. It is not in its text, it is not in its structure, not in its meaning. Roe invented the right out of thin air and it was highly criticized from the moment that it was published. This has imposed a tragically consequential and a court-created social policy on the people of our country. As a result, as was said a moment ago, almost 65 million of America's unborn children have perished because of it. Because there is no right to an abortion in the Constitution, that question is left to the States for the people to decide. This is long overdue and after nearly a half- century we are very hopeful and grateful that might finally happen. Ms. Goodwin reminded us just a moment ago that facts matter so let's talk about the underlying facts, because the facts and the law and the logic and the advancements in medical technology are clearly on the side of life. As the Susan B. Anthony list summarizes it well, ``The humanity of the unborn child is undeniable now thanks to advances in modern medicine and science.'' At six weeks, an unborn child has a beating heart and by 15 weeks unborn children can suck their thumbs, they have fully-formed noses and lips, eyes and eyebrows, and they can feel excruciating pain. These children deserve a voice in the American democratic process. In the recent Dobbs argument before the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts pointed to the fact that the U.S. is an outlier to the vast majority of other countries' viability standards. He said, ``When you get to the viability standard, we share that standard with the People's Republic of China and North Korea.'' It is unconscionable to think that the United States is one of only seven countries that allows for abortions for any reason after 20 weeks. In our nation's birth certificate, we boldly declared that it is a self-evident truth that human beings are made by their Creator, and they are endowed by Him with certain unalienable rights. The first listed is the right to life for obvious reasons. All three of the Democrat Witnesses here today support and advocate for what they say is unrestricted abortion on demand. Let me ask Dr. Robinson. I could go to any of them, but you are the medical doctor. Based on your website and your testimony today you clearly support the right to abort a 20-week-old unborn child, so I would love for you to explain to us in your medical opinion at what point in pregnancy should having an abortion no longer be an option? Dr. Robinson. Thank you for the question. As a medical doctor, I understand that every pregnancy is unique and different. I also understand that patients need to have access to care, pregnant people, as the pregnancy progresses, and that may be for various reasons. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Okay. Dr. Robinson. So, I-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Let me ask you, do you support the right of a woman who is just seconds away from birthing a healthy child to have an abortion? Dr. Robinson. I think that the question that you're asking does not realistically reflect abortion care in the United States. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. In that scenario, would you support her right to abort that child? Dr. Robinson. I won't entertain theoreticals. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. It is not a theoretical, ma'am. Dr. Robinson. That's not reality. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. You are a medical doctor. Dr. Robinson. I am medical doctor and that has never happened in any healthcare-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Never happened in your practice, ma'am, but it happens. How about if a child is halfway out of the birth canal? Is an abortion permissible then? Dr. Robinson. Can you repeat your question? Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. If a child is halfway delivered out of the birth canal, is it permissible to have an abortion? Would you support the right for an abortion then? Dr. Robinson. I can't even fathom that ever-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. I am not asking you if you can fathom it. If it occurred, would you support that abortion or not? That is unrestricted abortion, right? Dr. Robinson. I can't answer a question that I can't imagine I--just like you probably can't imagine what you would do if your daughter was raped. If that hasn't happened, it may be difficult for you to-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Okay. You are not going to answer this question, but how about this one? How does one qualify as fully human? What makes a human being? Dr. Robinson. What makes a person a human being-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. That is right. Dr. Robinson. --is them being born, number one. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Oh. Dr. Robinson. That's why we have birthdays. Then, also, their individual DNA, them having autonomy, being able to Act and think autonomously-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Okay, but wait a minute. A newborn child lacks the immediate capacity-- Dr. Robinson. --being able to breathe and live outside of the womb. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. A newborn child lacks the immediate capacity to make conscious deliberate choices, so is infanticide, okay? Dr. Robinson. I think what we're here to talk about is abortion care. What you're describing is something that is already illegal and there are laws on the books for that, so I'm not a proponent of restrictions. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. You understand if Dobbs is handed down, the States will be able to make that decision, and there are some that will go that far. You need to be aware of what we are talking about today. I am out of time. I yield back. Dr. Robinson. There are laws on the books for that. Chair Nadler. The gentleman's time is expired. The Witness may answer the question. Dr. Robinson. I'm sorry? Chair Nadler. I said the gentleman's time is expired. The Witness may answer the question. Dr. Robinson. Okay. In the instance that he's describing, there are already laws on the books for that. Those are criminals acts and so I'm not a proponent of any additional restrictions on people being able to access abortion care. I'm a proponent of us just enforcing the laws that are already on the books. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. What if the law is changed to allow for that? Chair Nadler. The gentleman's time has expired. Ms. Lofgren? Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am mindful that the--Senator McConnell has already discussed publicly the concept of prohibiting abortion in every case, in every State, should the Court allow that to occur. So, really what we are talking about is the potential of politicians making decisions, taking the decisions away from individuals and really criminalizing healthcare for women. You have given an interesting testimony, but my question really goes to the other potential impacts of what is being discussed. Professor Goodwin, what impact would such a decision, if the draft were to become the Court's decision--what impact could that have on in vitro fertilization or contraception in your view? Could that become criminalized as well? Ms. Goodwin. It certainly could. So, I want to speak to two impacts: The first that we have to speak to is maternal mortality. The United States ranks 55th in the world in terms of maternal mortality-- Ms. Lofgren. Correct. Ms. Goodwin. --not among its peer nations, but it is--ranks among Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, and Russia, places that allow for the stoning and lashing of women. More specifically to your question, yes, we could see in fact a dismantling of contraception access, access to being able to have IUDs, access to Plan B, which is used after a rape. Ms. Lofgren. Well, let me follow up with--if I may with you on that, because in the draft opinion, Justice Alito really says there is no privacy right and also that there is no deeply-rooted, in this nation's history and tradition, right to abortion. Now, I look at the Constitution. Does not mention women. Certainly, the right of gay people to marry or for people of different races to marry is not deeply-rooted in the nation's history. Do you think that by extension that draft opinion could be used to take other rights away? Ms. Goodwin. Well, it certainly could be. It sends a very strong signal to States that are already inclined to do that, where State lawmakers and governors have already indicated that that's their interest, to impose civil punishments, criminal punishments, and begin stripping away rights that we've seen emerge over time. We've already seen this in Texas with regard to the governor pushing forward an Executive Order that would essentially punish parents who are providing affirmative care to their children who are trans. So, gay marriage is at stake. The ability to adopt if you are gay at stake. Interracial marriage at stake. It only takes one local county clerk to say I disagree. Ms. Lofgren. Let me go to some of the other issues. I have long been a proponent of preserving privacy rights of Americans, and I even am a founder of the bipartisan Fourth Amendment Caucus, which I chair. I am thinking about some of the other implications of the draft decision should that happen. If Roe is overturned, it seems that there is a risk that personal data could be more or less weaponized against women seeking basic healthcare. The media is full of stories, news stories identifying new risks to women's data privacy in a post-Roe world. For example, here is a headline sample from the Washington Post: ``Law enforcement may fully unleash its data collection tools on abortion'' or ``Without Roe, data will become a company headache and user nightmare. What police could find out about your illegal abortion.'' Vox points out that period apps and data privacy in the pro- or post-Roe v. Wade climate could actually be utilized to prosecute women. How could information gathered by such apps, Dr. Robinson, be used to target women who seek reproductive care in States with laws that criminalize care and could these apps track location, for example, to Planned Parenthood and be weaponized against clinics? You have to turn on your mic. Dr. Robinson. Oh, I apologize. It's hard to imagine how these apps that people are using to track their menstrual cycles and to try to control their fertility, how this will be used against people in a post-Roe world. I could not imagine us going back to the day where abortion access wouldn't be available, so that's just difficult for me to fathom at this time. Ms. Lofgren. My time is expired, Mr. Chair. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Chabot? Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, the American people are facing real issues that need real solutions. Yesterday, gas prices hit an all-time high for the eighth day in a row. They are actually over $4 a gallon in all 50 States now. They are $4.39 back in my district in Cincinnati. I paid $5.19 here in DC, when I flew up Monday at a gas station right outside of Washington, DC. I understand out in California they are over $6 a gallon now. That is the equivalent of a massively-regressive tax hike. It is going to cost the American people thousands of dollars per year. That is just in the price of gas. Gas prices impact every other aspect of the economy, which means higher prices for everything. Perhaps even more concerning is the supply chain issues that continue to plague our nation. Now, young families can't even find baby formula to feed their newborn children. These shortages and the resulting price hikes have gone far beyond just being an inconvenience. They have become a desperate reality to American families across the country. Make no mistake, these are real problems, problems that the Biden Administration policies have caused and for which seemingly they have no workable solutions. Instead of working toward solutions to solve these and so many other problems that are adversely impacting so many Americans, this Committee is once again spending valuable time debating a hypothetical issue, a Supreme Court case which has not even come out now, rather than to try to solve real problems and come up with real solutions. This hearing is yet another attempt to distract the American people from the failures of the Biden Administration to address the problems they face right now, today, by instead scaring people with a hypothetical case, concerns that might happen down the road in the future. Today it is a hypothetical Supreme Court decision which has not even been rendered yet, but which was illegally leaked. It is pretty clear that the leaked opinion is being used to blatantly intimidate the United States Supreme Court. We have never had a draft Supreme Court people leaked like this before, at least not to my knowledge, and for good reason. The Court relies on the good faith of its Members to work through complex legal questions, sharing draft opinions so they can respond to each other's concerns. Through that process, opinions can evolve and develop and improve and sometimes change. In the end, the American people get a better understanding and a reasoned result, even when they may not ultimately agree with the outcome, as obviously in this country--on abortion, this country has been in dramatic disagreement for some time now. At least that is the way it has worked for the last 233 years up until now. One has to wonder how the Court will even function going forward. Will the justices be able to trust one another? Will they be able to overcome this historic breach and resume anything close to normal operations? Or is the Court, much like Congress, now condemned to hyper-partisanship? This dangerous unprecedented situation is what we should be discussing at this hearing. After all, this Committee has oversight over the Supreme Court and we are charged with making sure that it functions properly. Instead, this Committee is feeding the fire that may ultimately consume the United States Supreme Court's independence, and that is not a good day for America. Ms. Foster, as well as being a strong pro-life advocate, you are also an attorney, and I would like to ask, can you think of another example of a breach like this, certainly of this magnitude, in the history of the Supreme Court where a draft opinion has illegally leaked to the media and how damaging do you view such a breach to the functionality and reputation of the Court? Ms. Foster. I cannot think of one and that's because there hasn't been one. That leak and even this hearing, it really threatens the integrity of the Court. Today is wild speculation about what the Court may do, not what it has done. The leaker intended to bring chaos and public pressure to the reasoned deliberations of the Court as they attempted to determine the outcome of the case. It's simply wrong. Mr. Chabot. I know you and many pro-life advocates would like this to mean no more abortions in the country, but in reality, what actually happens? Ms. Foster. What actually happens if-- Mr. Chabot. If this decision comes out and Roe would be overturned by the Supreme Court. Ms. Foster. If Roe is overturned, then the issue returns to the States. As Ron Paul has written, the federalization of abortion law is based not on constitutional principles, but rather on a social and political construct created out of thin air by the Roe Court. This Dobbs opinion, should this be the final opinion, it would reverse that damage and return the issue to the people and to our elected representatives. Mr. Chabot. Thank you. My time is expired, Mr. Chair. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Jackson Lee? Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank the Chair very much. I view this hearing as probably one of the most important hearings in my lifetime dealing with the absolute question of the survival of the Constitution. First, let me acknowledge the very weak distraction of a leak. I have absolutely no concern about a leak where a duly- constituted body such as the Supreme Court would be prevented from doing its work. There is no question that the Republicans want a total nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions for incest, no exceptions for rape, an intolerable inhuman posture that they would put America in. I think today I come claiming for women freedom, justice, equity, equality, and an absolute ban on politicians telling women what to do with their body. The CDC found in 2020 that non-Hispanic Black women suffered 55.3 percent deaths per 100,000 live births, a number 2.9 times the rate of non-Hispanic White women, which means that in many instances, as loving as pregnancy can be for those who choose it, it can also mean death to women who happen to be African American and other minorities. So, let me ask questions to Dr. Goodwin first--Professor Goodwin as it relates to constitutional rights. We heard the question that abortion is not in the Constitution. For those who understand that the document is a living document, would you assess the question of the idea of ignoring the First Amendment because church services are not specifically mentioned in the--or synagogue services are not specifically mentioned, ignoring the Eighth Amendment, or ignoring the Fourth Amendment? Professor, could you analyze the importance of recognizing that Roe v. Wade is precedent in the Ninth Amendment dealing with privacy? Ms. Goodwin. Thank you very much for that question. First, over 233 years of the Supreme Court's existence, the Supreme Court has fashioned rights because the Ninth Amendment provides for, that is to say that not all rights have to be explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. The Supreme Court has the discretion through its interpretation of the Constitution to speak to matters that are not explicitly delineated. The drafters of the Constitution anticipated that they had not thought of all matters that would be important to America as it developed, but that there would be a Ninth Amendment that would allow for the Court to be able to further interpret as society emerged. At the time in which the Constitution was drafted, we didn't have trains, we didn't have planes, we did not have cars, we had no electric cars. We had none of the machineries of war that we currently have. So, as we look at other amendments too, from a Second Amendment perspective, there are certain artillery that we have today that has not anticipated at the time of the Second Amendment drafting. To the point that you made, when the First Amendment was drafted as well, there were certain articulations that we appreciate today that were not explicitly delineated within the context of the Constitution. It is also worth noting what the Constitution says. The Constitution says that people who are people in the United States are people that are born. It makes no mention of embryos or fetuses. It is also worth noting what the 13th Amendment says, and the 14th Amendment. If we appreciate that Members of Congress were free, not only Black men but also Black women, it said that there shall be no involuntary servitude. It explicitly also mentions that Black people shall have, and this includes women, liberty and freedom. This is incredibly important when one looks at-- Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. Ms. Arrambide, you lived under the horrors of the Texas S.B. 8. Thank you for your father's life and legacy. Tell me what it means to have a stalking provision, meaning that women can be exposed, and a bounty can be given to them under the Texas law, and that law spreading across America, along with an absolute ban on abortion. Ms. Arrambide, are you there? Ms. Arrambide. Yes, thank you for that question. Since S.B. 8 went into effect, people have been terrified because extremists have been essentially deputized as bounty hunters to come after people that they think might have been aiding, abetting, or providing abortion care. That's had a chilling effect for people trying to access abortion care. People can't exercise their constitutional right to have abortions. That's not okay, and it's about to spread throughout the country if this decision goes into effect. So, it's terrifying. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady's time has expired. Mr. Gohmert. Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank, and I yield back. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the Witnesses here today. Ms. Foster, we've heard a great deal about it's my body, it's my choice. The same people that said that seem to feel like if it comes to a vaccination, it's not your body and it's not your choice. We get to tell you whether you have vaccinations or not, regardless of what the risks are. Do you believe people have the right to choose what happens to their own bodies? Ms. Foster. I believe in protecting every human being, no matter who they are, where they are, any other aspect about them. Whatever you call that is what I'm for. That absolutely includes human beings in the womb. Mr. Gohmert. Yeah, well, it's interesting. Are you familiar with the law? State and Federal law does not recognize a child's being mature enough to enter in legally binding contracts, so that normally it is a parent that is required to make decisions in the best interest of the child's body, correct? Ms. Foster. Correct, yes. Mr. Gohmert. So, you've obviously been working in the pro- life movement for a long time. Do you think it's an appropriate presumption that a parent will choose to do what's in the best interests of a baby's own body, since they can't make the choice for themselves? Ms. Foster. Absolutely, we should be protecting every human being. Mr. Gohmert. Do you believe there should be a presumption that a parent will make a decision for the best interests of the child's body? Ms. Foster. Yes. Mr. Gohmert. We've seen lots of problems. We've heard a testimony about the mental duress of carrying a child. Of course, I'm sure you're aware of what's called postpartum depression. Some have it very severely. I'm wondering if a mother is suffering severe depression as a result of having a child that she's not mentally and physically able to take care of, do you believe that the mother should have the right, like to drown a child, to get rid of the child because of the mental stress and duress and problems that the mother is having? Ms. Foster. Of course not, that would be horrifying. That's why we have safe haven laws to provide support and resources and an outlet for women in difficult situations. Mr. Gohmert. From what you've said already, you seem to feel like the child's body does belong to the child, but relies on the parent to make decisions for the child's best wellbeing, correct? Ms. Foster. I trust that people are looking out for the best interest of all human beings and are supporting their right to life. Mr. Gohmert. Are you--well, are you familiar with premature babies, preemies? Ms. Foster. Of course, yes. Mr. Gohmert. Do you find that it seems they have an inherent desire to live? Ms. Foster. Absolutely. When you visit a NICU you see them fighting for their ability to live, for every breath. Mr. Gohmert. Yeah, and that's a good term, fighting for the ability to live. From our own daughter that was born eight to ten weeks prematurely, we were sent to a higher-level ICU, neonatal ICU, because they had a higher survival rate. When I got there my wife had to stay at the hospital where she had been and encouraged me to go do anything I could. I began to see why the survival rate was so high there, because the doctor said you got to sit down right here. That baby can't see you properly, but she knows your voice. You stroke her little face, her hands. She grabbed the end of my finger, and I couldn't move for eight hours because, as the doctor said, she's drawing strength, she's drawing life from you. Chair Nadler. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Gohmert. That's the role of a parent, and I thank you for your being here. Chair Nadler. Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Foster, let me ask you a question: Are you in favor of outlawing abortion in all 50 States? Ms. Foster. I believe in protecting every human person, no matter who or where they are. So, whatever you call that is what I'm for. Mr. Cohen. So, you're in favor of outlawing abortion in all 50 States. Do you think that should be done by the Federal government in protecting all those individuals, as you call them? Ms. Foster. I don't think that we have gotten to that point necessarily. We haven't--what we've put it on the Women's Health Protection Act. So, we've seen the converse, the codification of-- Mr. Cohen. If Senator McConnell was able to go forward and have a bill to outlaw abortion federally, which is not prohibited from this Congress from doing such, would you be in favor of Congress prohibiting abortion in all 50 States? Ms. Foster. I would be in favor of protecting every human being no matter where they are. Mr. Cohen. Thank you. What if a person was impregnated by rape or incest. Would you be in favor of an abortion then, or still against abortion? Ms. Foster. I would say that every human being is inherently valuable. Mr. Cohen. You've said that many times. So, basically, what you're saying is you are against an exception for rape or incest. So, if somebody is raped, you are saying they would have to bear that child because you consider that fetus a human being. So, that child would be brought into this world even though the woman was forced into sex by possibly and probably somebody who she had no affinity towards whatsoever. I find that abhorrent to think that's where we are. We are--many States are requiring and concerned about forcing young people to wear masks to protect--which protects others, not them. They want them to bear children, they want to force them to bear children even if they're raped. Even they are having sex or raped by a family member, which is incest, which can be problems genealogically if they have the child and the child would develop, the fetus. So, this is what we've got. We've got an effort to outlaw abortion in all 50 States and to do it by congressional law if possible. If that Senate and the House become Republican, that will happen. It will be outlawed here in all 50 States. Not just Mississippi, not just Louisiana, not just Arkansas and Texas and Oklahoma, and all those other red States, everywhere. That is pre-Roe v. Wade. I'll tell you what happened pre-Roe v. Wade. I was only about 14 or 15 years old. I lived in California. I had a relative who lived in New York State, and she became pregnant. She was not ready to have a family. She made that decision, the decision she made, which she could afford because she had wealthy parents and wealthy family, was to fly from New York to California and then to go down to Mexico and get an abortion. It turned out to be safe and fine and good. The only reason she could do it is she had money and the resources to do it. People in small rural areas in the South and other places without wealth could not afford it. They had to go back-alley abortionists and sometimes lose their life because it wasn't legal. They had to possibly raise a lot of money to get somewhere. They didn't have the money to get to California and to go to Mexico. We will have abortion by financial status if this happens. It'll happen in Mexico or it'll happen back alley. If you've got enough money, you'll probably find somebody that could do it. In Memphis, you'll have to go to Illinois, which is also expensive and time-consuming. You don't know what the laws will be in Tennessee, whether they follow Texas and put a bounty on people's heads for helping to finance folks to go and get an abortion. That is anathema. It is wrong what happened in this country in the sixties when abortion was illegal, and the wealthy could afford it but the non-wealthy couldn't. It's wrong to try to protect and care about people's rights to wear a mask or not wear a mask but not the right to have and bear a child or not get a family, even if you might be 12 or 13 years old. Now, abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution. Fetus is not mentioned in the Constitution either. The Constitution doesn't say anything about when life starts. That is something the Courts have to decide, because it's not mentioned in the Constitution. For the Courts to absolve themselves of it and get away from it is wrong. Three justices said Roe is settled law, Roe is the law, it's settled, it is stare decisis. It was not, and some on the other side have said terrible decision, wrong from the beginning and just terribly wrong. It was right, said Kavanaugh. It was right, said Gorsuch. It was right, said Barrett. It's right then, and it's right now. I yield back the balance of my time. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Issa. Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Professor Goodwin, is a 20-week pregnancy, unborn child, a human being under the Constitution? Ms. Goodwin. Under the Constitution and the 14th Amendment, it recognizes foreign individuals as being citizens of the United States. Mr. Issa. No, no, okay. Born. So, is it your testimony that constitutionally prior to the term ``born'' being exercised, the unborn have no rights and they are not human beings? Ms. Goodwin. According to the Constitution-- Mr. Issa. No, not-- Ms. Goodwin. Born individuals are citizens of the United States. According to American-- Mr. Issa. I'm asking for the conclusion, as a constitutional scholar, the unborn, prior to their delivery, are not persons under the Constitution. The Constitution itself or the 14th Amendment which specifically says born, is that your testimony? Ms. Goodwin. That is what the Constitution says and that is what this Congress-- Mr. Issa. Thank you. Ms. Goodwin. Adopted in the 14th Amendment. Mr. Issa. Thank you, Professor. Ms. Foster, in your opinion, is a child sucking its thumb, knowing if it's left- or right-handed, able to feel pain, but not yet delivered from the mother, does that child to you represent a human being? Ms. Foster. To me and to every embryology textbook out there, yes. If they're not human, what are they? It's not courts that determine reality. The reality of human life is that a child is a human being. Mr. Issa. Now, under existing law, if someone were to kill that 22-24-week gestation, pregnancy, is that a crime in virtually every State, including under Federal law? Ms. Foster. In virtually every State, thanks to Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, abortion can be-- Mr. Issa. No, no, I said if let's say the father of a child kills that child. In other words, not the mother's decision. If an outsider kills the unborn, is it a crime, not just battery, but a crime in Federal law in most States? Ms. Foster. Yes, that's a crime in virtually every State. Mr. Issa. Okay, so notwithstanding the Constitution, if you kill the unborn, you've killed a human being under State law, even though abortion is legal. Well, let's just go through, since we're on the subject of law for a moment, Ms. Foster, behind me under 18 U.S.C. 1507, is it a Federal crime to protest near a residence occupied by a judge, a jury with the intent--or jury--with the intent to influence the decision of a pending case? Ms. Foster. It certainly is. Mr. Issa. Isn't it also, even if you went to the prosecutor or defense attorneys, also a crime? Ms. Foster. Yes. Mr. Issa. So, behind me, I'm trying to understand this, here's a picture, and it's--and they're using a megaphone in front of Justice Alito's home, and they're clearly trying to influence it. So, is that a crime? Ms. Foster. It is. Mr. Issa. So, under 18 U.S.C. 1507, people are committing crimes. Why is it we're not hearing it denounced by the pro- choice movement, who say that they respect this decision as long it goes their way? Ms. Foster. Because it fits the narrative. The leaker intended to bring chaos and public pressure into the Dobbs case. This hearing shows that they succeeded, and those photos demonstrate that the public is, in fact, responding to that leak as was planned. Mr. Issa. Now, these protesters in front of Justice Barrett, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Alito, they don't appear to be having the opposite in any way trying to influence the pro- choice, if you will, Members of the Court. Is that correct that there's no similar intimidation is going on? Ms. Foster. That's correct. Mr. Issa. Okay. I want you to hear a quote and give me your comment on it. When someone says, I think it is reprehensible. Stay away from homes and families of elected officials and Members of the Court. You could express yourself, exercise your First Amendment rights. But to go after them in their homes, to do anything of a threatening nature, certainly anything violent, is absolutely reprehensible. Would you agree with that? Ms. Foster. I certainly would. Mr. Issa. Senator Dick Durbin agrees with it, but he's been one of the lone voices willing to denounce it. I have not heard it denounced even by one member on this dais on the other side of the aisle. So, Ms. Foster, a senior correspondent for Vox.com and a former Federal judge clerk tweeted the following: Seriously, shout-out to whoever the hero was within the Supreme Court who said, f-bomb, using a term, it, let's burn the place down. Is that a crime in your estimation? Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman expired, so a brief answer from the Witness. Ms. Foster. Absolutely. Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Chair, yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Professor Goodwin, Georgia has a six-week ban on abortions. It's also a State that is the most dangerous State in the nation for pregnant women. Approximately half of the counties in Georgia have no OB physicians or no OB/GYN, no family physician providing obstetrical care. No midwives. Half of the State. Furthermore, hospital labor and delivery units have been closing across Georgia for the last several decades. In 2015, only 46 of 159 counties had such units. Professor Goodwin, isn't it ironic that States like Georgia want to force women to remain pregnant but seem unwilling to help women stay alive during pregnancy? Ms. Goodwin. That's right, it's one of the most egregious aspects of what we see today in our country. The States that have been most active in crafting anti-abortion bans, abortion bans, have been the States with the highest rates of maternal mortality. Disproportionately, those who have been most affected have been Black women. It's really been a death sentence for them. For that reason, if nothing more, it's important that this hearing is being held, because there's been so little attention to the fact that Black women have suffered in grave and inhumane ways in those States with abortion bans. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Dr. Robinson, is it fair to say there is a link between abortion access and maternal health? Dr. Robinson. Yes, that is fair to say. There's a supporting documentation that shows that without access to abortion care, that the maternal mortality rate will continue to rise. I'm glad that you pointed out the fact that many States are--they have decreased access to midwifery care, decreased access to healthcare resources, labor and delivery units that are closing down, people having to travel further and further to access maternity care. Particularly in Alabama, we also criminalize women who do not present for maternity care. It's considered a form of neglect. In a community where you don't have access to those resources and you cannot travel to meet the physician, it is not fair to punish those women but then to try to force to carry pregnancies to term when they don't have the resources to support that. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Ms. Foster, you've seemed reticent to answer the question whether or not you were in favor of a State--I mean a Federal ban on abortions passed by the Congress. I've looked at your Twitter account. You do have a Twitter account, right? Correct? Ms. Foster. Correct. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. On May 2, the day that the decision was leaked about the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, you posted a video--an audio message on your Twitter account, did you not? Ms. Foster. Yes. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You put forward the question, ``What does a post-Roe America look like? What comes after Roe?'' Right? Ms. Foster. Correct. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You answered your own question by saying, ``We never really wanted Roe's reversal to make abortion a State issue where some States protect life and other States continue to kill and dismember.'' That's what you said, right? Ms. Foster. That's correct, and I don't believe I was reticent in answering the question. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You also said that Roe--you said, ``After Roe, we don't want more victims, we want abortion abolition.'' Ms. Foster. That is correct. I believe I'm protecting every human being no matter where they are, so I'm not reticent at all. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You also said that your end goal was for the United States Supreme Court to declare that abortion was against the Constitution. Ms. Foster. I believe it was former President Clinton who called for abortion to be rare-- Mr. Johnson of Georgia. That's what you said. Ms. Foster. So, I-- Mr. Johnson of Georgia. That's what you said. Ms. Foster. Absolutely, yes. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Okay. You are a Republican who supports Republicans. They called you as a Witness, and that is the Republican plan, for women in American to not have a right to an abortion, whether or not it be the first, the second, or in one percent of those cases that happen in the--beyond the 20th week. You don't women to have that right for any reason whatsoever, to protect or save the life of the mother. Or, too, in the cases of rape and incest. Isn't that a fact? Ms. Foster. A more humane and more just America would provide protection and resources for all human beings. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman--the time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Buck. Mr. Buck. Ms. Foster, I'm going to direct my questions to you. What I'm wondering is how will America be judged by future generations, future societies? When we learn about the great empires and cultures in school and in world history, we think of the ancient Greeks and Romans and the--Great Britain, the Mongols, the Mayans, the various Chinese dynasties. We study the art and architecture, we celebrate the science, technical, and medical advances of the people, and we marvel at the military power of the great empires. There seems like the great cultures all have an asterisk. The Greeks and Romans had slaves. The Mayans and the Qin Dynasty performed human sacrifice as to appease their gods. When America is evaluated in the future, certainly scholars will see us as an exceptional nation, a country with great scientific and technological advances, beautiful art and architecture, the most powerful military in the world, tremendous advances in civil rights for minorities, great universities, amazing agricultural accomplishments, space travel, and energy production. What will the asterisk be for America? Did we do enough to help those with physical handicaps, mental handicaps, and mental diseases? Did we provide a pathway to prosperity for the poor? How did we address homelessness and crime? What do we do for the most vulnerable in our society, for those who don't have a voice, can't vote, and don't have an advocate? We know, for example, that an unborn baby has a heartbeat at six weeks, develops pain receptors at seven weeks, has arms, legs, fingers, and toes at ten weeks. Can kick and will jump if startled at ten weeks. Will respond to touch throughout almost the entire body at 13-14 weeks. Has fully developed heart at 15 weeks. Ms. Foster, how will future generations and future cultures judge how we treated the most vulnerable in our society? Ms. Foster. I'm ashamed to think of it. I am hopeful that the eventual Dobbs decision will be the first step in the right direction towards some kind of reckoning. Mr. Buck. I appreciate your answer. I think that we could go into more detail, quite frankly, because those that don't have a voice, those that don't have political power are often ignored. When we are judged, I think we will be examined for how we treated the unborn in this country. Not the unborn that were caused by rape or incest, but millions on millions, since 1973, that have been killed as a result of abortion policies in this country. Millions far exceed the historical accounts of other cultures. I think that we will be judged harshly for how we treated the most vulnerable, how we treated folks who didn't have political power. I think it's unfortunate. I think it's unfortunate that we can't just for a moment reflect on those that need our protection. Any last comments before my time runs out? Ms. Foster. Absolutely. It may not appear that way from the other side of the aisle here, but this really is a unifying issue for most Americans. Fifty-one percent, according to a 2021 Gallup poll, believe that abortion should be either illegal in all circumstances or illegal in all, but the rarest circumstances. Less than a third believe that abortion should be legal under all circumstances. Most Americans agree. In fact, as a proud member of the board of Democrats for Life of America as well, I know that, in fact, a third of Democrats call themselves pro-life, and the number swings more and more pro-life the more radical bills are put forward by the other side of the aisle. So, when we see the New York Reproductive Health Act, for example, we see Democrats more and more calling themselves pro- life because they look at that kind of bill and they say if that's what pro-choice is, I want no part of it. So, we welcome that. We welcome them into the pro-life side. I see that there's so much hope for an America that pursues more humane solutions for all human beings. Mr. Buck. Other than China and North Korea and some of those countries, how do we compare to countries in other parts of the world? Ms. Foster. We have among the most radical abortion policy in the world. Our company is Canada, China, and North Korea. Of course, Canada does not have a national law on the subject at all. We are dramatically more radical than any country in Europe, for example, to which we so often compare ourselves. Our abortion law is so far beyond what other countries have chosen through their elected officials, and what the American people would choose and what we elect our elected officials to do as they represent us. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Deutch. Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to talk about three issues that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have brought up today, political power, intimidation, and real problems. I want to start by asking Ms. Goodwin, is there any amount of political power that a 12-year-old could wage to stop her from being raped by a relative? Ms. Goodwin. No, there isn't. Mr. Deutch. Ms. Goodwin, is there any amount of political power that a young woman walking down the street, raped on the street violently and impregnated, is there any political power that woman has that she can wield to prevent that pregnancy from happening? Ms. Goodwin. No. Mr. Deutch. Finally, Dr. Robinson, is there any amount of political power that a woman who comes to see you who has desperately wanted to get pregnant, only to learn that the problem with her pregnancy and the development of the fetus may mean either that the fetus will be born with perhaps organs or develop outside of the body, or that her life may be at risk for delivering that child, or both? Is there any amount of political power that woman who so desperately wanted to be pregnant and finds herself in this situation, is there political power that could have prevented that from happening? Dr. Robinson. Absolutely not. Mr. Deutch. So, this is about power. Let me just ask, it's the power for women to be able to make these decisions that are protected by the Constitution. Let me ask, and I'm sorry, is it Arrambide? Ms. Arrambide. Arrambide. Mr. Deutch. Arrambide, sorry. Let me ask you about intimidation, Ms. Arrambide. Tell me about the intimidation that your father felt doing his job helping women. Ms. Arrambide. Sure. So, my father provided abortions in the seventies, eighties, and nineties. One of the things that was prevalent at that time was the wanted dead abortion providers posters. So, he was a target of a lot of harassment and terrorism. He wore a Kevlar vest to work every day. We lived in gated communities. He had an FBI agent assigned to him. He kept this pretty under wraps so that I wouldn't be exposed to it. When I went to college, I was called by someone that was harassing me and trying to get his home address, despite the fact that he'd had the same office for years. The FBI agent was sure that he was going to target my father. That's what he lived with. He did his work and he provided care for so many Texans across central and South Texas because he was a hero. He provided healthcare that they so desperately needed and wanted. Mr. Deutch. There are so many women and their families who are grateful for that. Dr. David Gunn, who was gunned down outside of an abortion clinic where he worked doing that work. Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was shot by a sniper through his kitchen window because of the work that he did. The two receptionists who were killed, the security guard who was killed. These aren't theoretical conversations about intimidation. There are people whose jobs have been to help women take action that's been protected by the Constitution who are dead because of it. That's intimidation. I want to finish with this. Real problems. It is true, the price of gas is a real problem. It is in my community and so many others. Shortage of baby food a real problem, baby formula. Dr. Robinson, let me let you finish. What's the real problem a woman faces when we slam the door on them and tell them rape, incest, they may die of pregnancy, none of that matters anymore? What's that real problem? Dr. Robinson. Thank you. First, I just wanted to mention, when you talk about the harassment, and I think you for highlighting that. When they put the pictures up there, I actually thought those were pictures outside of my office. That's the harassment that abortion providers and our patients face on a daily basis. It's not nearly as appalling to the other side when it's happening to us. When you talk about what the real problems that people face the Turnaway Study, it clearly highlights the implications people not being able to access abortion care. Many of these people are going to fall into poverty. They have difficulty caring for the children that they already have. That's what the real problem is. Mr. Deutch. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I seek unanimous consent to enter into a record a statement for the record by Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Legal Fellow with the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation. Chair Nadler. Without objection. [The information follows:] MR. JOHNSON OF LOUISIANA FOR THE RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you. Dr. Robinson, I asked you earlier how one qualifies as being fully human, and you responded by saying that no one becomes a human, or that someone does become a human at the moment of birth. I found that absolutely stunning since you are not a political activist or an advocate, but you present yourself and purport to be a medical doctor. Your answers deny the plain truth of science and medical technology that anyone can see and understand, even if they don't have a medical degree. Obviously, I don't need to cite volumes of medical journals to prove the fact that an unborn child is a human being. As the Life Training Institute summarizes, From the earliest stages of development, the unborn are distinct, living, and whole human beings. They are not mere parts of larger human beings, like skin cells are, but whole human entities capable of directing their own internal growth and development. This is not just a religious view, but a matter of the science of embryology. In its 1859 report on criminal abortion, the American Medical Association, no less, acknowledged that, ``The independent and actual existence of the child before birth as a living being was a scientific truth.'' Nothing has changed since that time. For more than 150 years doctors have known that life begins at conception. A 1981 report to the United States Senate states, Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being. And a being that is alive is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings. So, there's a picture up here. This is not a mere clump of cells. This is not an animal or some unknown species. Ma'am, that's a human being. All of you here are confusing human value with human function. You are defining personhood by what somebody does rather than what they are. Scott Klusendorf summarized it this way, he said, ``Although human beings differ immensely with respect to talents, accomplishments, and degrees of development, they are nonetheless equal because they share a common human nature.'' Humans have value simply because they are human. If you deny this, it's difficult to say why objective human rights should apply to anyone. As I noted earlier, it is a self-evident truth that all human beings are made by their creator and endowed by him with certain inalienable rights. The first listed in our declaration is the right to life. Since the medical doctor here wants to deny the facts and reality, let me ask the abortion advocate, Ms. Arrambide, to answer my questions on this subject. Ma'am, you testified that you are, ``Unapologetic in seeking in unrestricted abortion access.'' So, I'm wondering at what point is it not okay to abort a child, what age of gestation? Ms. Arrambide. I trust all people to determine what they can and can't do with their bodies. Full stop. I also believe that human rights, including access to medical care that they need within their communities, is something that should be afforded everyone. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Great, okay, so you support late- term abortion? Ms. Arrambide. I support all people and trust all-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. That means late-term abortion. Do you support partial birth abortion? In other words, the child is half-delivered, and then the woman says, my right, I want to take that one out. You support that? Ms. Arrambide. I trust people to make decisions about their body. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Wow, wow. Okay. What about--so abortion should be allowed then, by your definition, for any reason, for any purpose, at any stage, right? Ms. Arrambide. I trust people to make decisions about their body. Then when relevant, I think that they need to consult their medical practitioners-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Okay. Ms. Arrambide. Not Congress. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Okay, if it is--listen, let me just ask you this question. If it is not lawful and morally acceptable to take the life of a 10-year-old child, I assume you agree with that, right? That would be wrong, correct? Ms. Arrambide. I believe that is wrong. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Okay, and a two-year-old child, same thing, that would be murder, we would all agree that's wrong. Then what is the principal distinction between the human being that is two-years-old, or nine-months-old, or one-week- old, or one-hour-old, and one that is eight inches further up the birth canal in the utero? What's the difference? Why is it okay in the latter case and not the former cases? Ms. Arrambide. I trust people to determine what to do with their own bodies. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Wow. Ms. Arrambide. Full stop. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Wow. Full stop indeed. That describes right there exactly what this is about. There is a legal issue here, but underneath that is a moral issue. It's about reality, it's about science, the advancement of medical technology. You're talking about unborn children, and your full stop is that you will support the termination of that child at any time, and that is frightening. This is why this decision should be turned to the popular will of the people, and hopefully they'll protect the sanctity of every single human life and live up to the standards of our Declaration of Independence. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Bass. Ms. Bass. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for holding this hearing. Professor Goodwin, I know that some scholars, including yourself, have pointed out that some of the States, most eager to ban abortion are those with a history of Jim Crow and voter suppression. Can you speak to this relationship and what this could mean for other civil rights and liberties, including for people who live in blue States such as myself, California? Ms. Goodwin. So, historically, during the period of slavery, we had Confederate slave States, many of those are States that today seek to ban abortion, that denied African Americans fundamental human rights. This Congress provided those rights through the 13th Amendment and 14th Amendment, upheld by the United States Supreme Court. We've seen the dismantling of those rights through voter suppression. Historically we've seen African American women suffer in inordinate ways, and that suffering continues. In the State of Mississippi, the subject of the Dobbs opinion, 80 percent of cardiac deaths in that State during pregnancy are Black women. In the State of Mississippi, Black women are 118 times more likely to die by carrying to term a pregnancy than by having an abortion. In those States, we still see disparities in terms of pay for Black women. These histories are something that are undeniable and that place us in the space of a new Jane Crow, a system that from slavery through Jim Crow has resulted in the unequal treatment of Black women. I thank you for the question. Ms. Bass. Sure, and just along those--along that line, what do you think if the Roe decision is overturned, which is where we believe it's going, how do you think, though, that relates or puts in jeopardy other civil rights and liberties? Ms. Goodwin. Well, other civil rights and liberties are at stake, even though in the leaked draft opinion, Justice Alito suggested there are some guardrails around those, such as contraceptive access. That's actually hard to credit and will be more illusory than real since Justice Alito himself authored the opinion in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which itself fought to dismantle part of the Affordable Care Act provision that companies would provide comprehensive contraceptive care to their employees. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby provided exception in that case for companies that identified themselves as having religious rights, something that had never existed before Justice Alito's opinion. So, we see LGBTQ equality on the line, contraceptive access on the line, including IUDs, which are not abortifacients but that are popular forms of contraception. There are already State lawmakers that are saying they're seeking to do away with those fundamental rights associated with contraception. Next, we will see also sex education targeted as well by these individuals in these legislatures. Ms. Bass. Thank you. It's an incredible place we find ourselves in now. Ms. Arrambide, one, I apologize for the line of questioning you just experienced by my colleague on the other side of the aisle. I would like to ask you your opinion. Justice Coney Barrett suggested that because adoption exists, there really is no need for abortion. I wanted to know what you thought of that statement, and I also want to know what Professor Goodwin thinks of that statement. Ms. Arrambide. I don't believe adoption is an alternative to an abortion. It's an alternative to, after giving birth, giving the child up for adoption or keeping the child. It's not an alternative to abortion. Ms. Bass. Let me just ask, I asked you that question especially because I heard your testimony about where you were in your life at that time. Ms. Arrambide. Sure. Ms. Bass. So, I'm just, that's how I wanted you to think about it from that perspective and listening to your very impactful testimony. Ms. Arrambide. Sure. If at 25, I had been forced to carry a pregnancy to term, I would not have survived. I have no doubt that I would not be alive today. I would not have been alive to continue or to start my medical treatment for my mental health issues. I wouldn't have been alive to have two pregnancies, two health pregnancies, despite how difficult those pregnancies were. I wouldn't be the mother that I am today and have the two wonderful children that are my whole world. Because pregnancy-- Ms. Bass. Do you say that because of your mental health status at the time, that you were not well? Ms. Arrambide. Absolutely. My mental health status, I wasn't able to get up out of my bed. I wasn't able to walk my dog, take a shower. That happened for months and months at a time. As someone that's gone through two complete pregnancies and carried two pregnancies to term who had placenta previa, who had a breech birth, who had an emergency C-section that could have taken the life of my child or myself, I absolutely, like, unequivocally believe that if I had been forced to carry a pregnancy to term when I was 25, I would not have survived. Not only because of my mental health, but because pregnancy is more dangerous. When you don't want to be pregnant, you don't want to continue your pregnancy, there are so many things that can affect you and cannot have a good outcome. So, yes, I believe that I am so lucky that I was able to access the abortion care I needed within my community without many obstacles. I wish that for anybody who's pregnant and doesn't want to be. Chair Nadler. The time of gentlelady has expired. Mrs. Spartz. Mrs. Spartz. Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is an important issue, but we are Judiciary Committee. So, even though this issue is say life and death issue, we'll talk about judicial implications and we'll talk law a little bit. So, I want to talk to Professor Goodwin a little bit. What's happened if Casey and Roe are overturned? Can you still have abortion? Ms. Goodwin. If Casey and Roe are overturned, then it means that there will be laws that are triggered throughout the United States where in some States, there will not be access to abortion because it will be criminally punished. In some other States there will be access to abortion. So, people who will need those services will have to travel, if they can, to get to those States where they can be able to terminate their pregnancies. Mrs. Spartz. Right, so there is still going to be States will have to decide, and will have a situation, we'll have some more liberal States, some more conservative States. Ultimately the States will make these decisions at the State level, which is really how we were founded as a country. The States have making decisions and the Court is going to make a decision that, constitutionality decision. So, who do you think should make a final decision on something where it is your constitutional rights, which entity at our Federal level? Ms. Goodwin. Well, to be clear, there was actually a civil war about fundamental rights in the United States that were not just about some States being able to carry on whatever they wanted to do. That was the very point of the Civil War, where the lives of Black people were actually at stake. So, if you would then repeat because I thought that was important to clarify. Mrs. Spartz. So, what is decision, we have a constitutional amendment, right. If the States decide to do that, then we can fight wars, but ultimately which power, which branch of our Federal government has an ultimate decision to decide what is protected by our constitution, which branch? Ms. Goodwin. Well, the Supreme Court is the supreme arbiter of the land, but-- Mrs. Spartz. So, the Supreme Court. So, do you believe that we have Supreme Court as an authority? Please answer, do you believe that Supreme Court authority to rule? I might maybe didn't like some other rulings, and I don't, but do you think that is really the decision of the Supreme Court? We're giving them that authority. Do you believe every time we don't like, we should start packing the Court? What do you think it will lead to? Because you don't like decisions, I might not like decisions. So, what is going to create our country with every time that we do not like some decisions, we start mangling the Supreme Court. Do you think it's dangerous? Ms. Goodwin. Well, with all due respect, so that I can answer your question. Mrs. Spartz. Yes, please. Ms. Goodwin. I would say that it has been this Congress that has played a very important role in American law. It was this Congress, for example, that ratified the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. It was this Congress that ratified and drafted the 14th Amendment, which provided citizenship and equal protection under law and substantive due process to people who were then freed from human enslavement. It was this Congress that then struck down Jim Crow laws in the State that basically tethered Black people to second class citizenship through thousands of laws that denied them significant personhood. It was this Congress through the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act-- Mrs. Spartz. That's right, I completely agree with you, so we have a process, right. We have a process of Supreme Court rulings, and we have constitutional amendments, right, that have been ratified by the State. Do you think this is still a valid process? Do you support that this is the valid process of our constitutional republic? Ms. Goodwin. Thank you so much for that question. That is the process of this republic, and this has been important that the Supreme Court and this Congress has stepped in where there have been States that have wanted to enforce human enslavement, kidnap, and trafficking of African Americans. It has been this Congress that has played a pivotal role-- Mrs. Spartz. No doubt, but it has to go through the constitutional amendment. Do you think Congress should be exercising pressure by packing the Court and putting pressure on the judges and activists on the Court? Or do you think it's important to have a strength of that institution to hold us to the constitutional republic? Do you believe that political pressure on the Court is a good idea, regardless of what it is? Because it can come from both sides. Ms. Goodwin. Well, it's a very important question that you asked about these institutions being able to operate independently, and that is critically important, such as this hearing today, which is directly connected to urgent healthcare matters in the United States. So, I'm glad that you and your colleagues are hosting this particular hearing-- Mrs. Spartz. Thank you. My time has expired, but yeah, yeah, I appreciate, my time has expired. I appreciate. I hope we have constructive conversations. Because we have a separation of power, and it's important for us to hold our institutions strong and not politicize the Courts. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Cicilline. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for convening this group of experts for today's hearing to discuss the ongoing crisis in our country. Abortion is healthcare, plain and simple. A person's decision on whether to become a parent is one of the most important that they can make in their life. A woman's decision on whether or not to have an abortion should be hers alone, period. Across America every day, this fundamental right to healthcare is being dismantled by politicians, usually men, pushing false narratives to control women's bodies. Their ultimate goal is a national ban on abortion in America. The world they're pushing for is deeply terrifying, a world without any abortion even for rape or incest, a world where women are criminalized not only for getting an abortion, but potentially for miscarriage or IVF treatment. A world where healthcare providers are hunted down and arrested and the vigilantes that hunt them are rewarded. It's incredible to me this fundamental constitutional right, enshrined more than 50 years ago, is again up for debate. It's unbelievable that we're even having this debate after we've seen the disastrous effects when women lose access to abortion care. So, thank you to our Witnesses for coming forth today to explain why access to abortion services is so vital, something you shouldn't have to do, but apparently still needs to be done. With that, I'd like to move on to a couple of questions. First, Professor Goodwin, can you discuss when one considers that miscarriage happens in 10-15 percent of known pregnancies, can you discuss that if States criminalize abortions, whether you have concerns that people may be investigated or prosecuted for miscarriages? Maybe speak more broadly about the dangers that exist from criminalizing pregnancy across America and how the Courts have begun to do that. Ms. Goodwin. Thank you very much for that question. This is urgently important. We saw aspects of this in the late 1980s and 1990s. Black women and Brown women were euphemistically the canaries in the coal mine in cases in Mississippi, such as the case of Rennie Gibbs, a 16-year-old who was charged with depraved murder, a Black 16-year-old, because she had a still birth. The case of Regina McKnight, the first woman in this country to be charged with murder for having a still birth, a young, African American woman in her early 20s. This will chill individuals wanting to even receive prenatal care. For individuals who want to, women who want to carry their pregnancies to term, but live in hostile environments, suffering communities where there are toxins that might make their pregnancies vulnerable, they will be people afraid to actually go to seek medical care because of the possibility of being criminally punished. It also creates pressures on doctors and nurses to spy and surveil and turn in information on their patients. Patients want to be able to get good quality healthcare, and they don't need being policed by their doctors and nurses, and we certainly don't need to seek criminally punishing them when they have miscarriages and still births. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, thank you very much. Dr. Robinson, you were being asked some pretty wild theoretical questions earlier about abortions being committed as the baby is halfway out of the birth canal, which of course is not how abortion happens in this country. It's not a thing. It's good television, it's just not true. Your time was cut short. Can you please give us a more accurate picture of when abortions typically happen during a pregnancy. Do you they happen--what percentage happen in the first 12 weeks? Then, finally, can you explain some of the scenarios that may lead a woman to seek an abortion later in the pregnancy. Dr. Robinson. Yes, thank you for the question. The majority of abortions take place in the first trimester, early in the pregnancy. It is very few pregnancies that require or may need an abortion later in the pregnancy. It's important for us to keep in mind that we have to consider viability being more than gestational age. So, sometimes pregnancies that have progressed later, but are later determined to have a lethal anomaly, they may--those are the ones in that rare instance where a pregnant person may opt to terminate that pregnancy as opposed to continuing it until she goes into labor or into--or to term in those instance where it may not be viable outside of the womb, despite the gestation age, and continue to carry the pregnancy. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. I'm going to try to be the first person who gets the correct pronunciation, Arrambide. During the process that you described to us in your testimony, which was really important and moving, did you feel that your judgment was trusted? What should we learn from your experience about the importance of trusting women and individuals who seek abortion care in terms of being in the best position to make those judgments? Ms. Arrambide. Thank you. I believe I was trusted to make that decision because there weren't as many onerous restrictions put upon my access to care at the time. I think people are not trusted now, and that's what's happening as a result of all these restrictions being in place. I want to address my response to Mr. Johnson's question. I trust people to make decisions about their body. Just because he asked the question over and over again implying medical inaccuracies about the way abortion works, that doesn't change my answer. I trust people implicitly to make decisions about their body. In regard to later abortion, like Dr. Robinson referenced, that can be determined in consultation with their doctor, and not a Congressman. Thank you. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. Fischbach. Mrs. Fischbach. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I absolutely welcome the opportunity to speak about the humanity of the unborn child and the science that proves it. The unborn baby has a heartbeat, a separate DNA, its own blood type, fingerprints, arms, legs, hands, and toes. Ultrasound technology continues to advance and provides us with a window into the world of the unborn. This hearing is not about the unborn child. This hearing appears to have been called to exert improper influence over the Supreme Court on an unfinished, leaked opinion draft. The title of the hearing is ``Revoking Your Rights, The Ongoing Crisis in Abortion Care Access.'' The supposed right to abortion is not found anywhere in the text of the Constitution. It was created by raw judicial power when the Supreme Court usurped the power of the elected officials at the State and Federal level to--and created a right that did not exist. We are a nation of laws. Rule of law only works when we follow the actual text of both the Constitution and the laws made by elected officials, not when the Courts create laws out of thin air. If someone thinks there is a law needed, then they use the political process and allow elected officials, who represent the voices of the people that elected them, to determine what should be in law. This is how the rule of law works. Unfortunately, the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court abruptly ended the political process. They created a right that did not exist, and they ended the ability of elected officials to make the decision. Roe was bad jurisprudence and should be overturned. Power to legislate on abortion should go back to elected officials. I was glad to hear the Chair denounce the leak. Too many Democrats have been silent on the leak, despite lecturing us in this Committee and elsewhere about institutional norms and the importance of following regular order. The leak was a break of institutional norms, trust, and confidentiality. The Democrats did not immediately denounce that leak, and most still have not done so shows that their words are hollow. They are for institutional norms only when it suits them. Take this hearing, for example. As Ms. Foster so rightly put it in her written testimony, by holding this hearing before the Dobbs decision comes out, this Committee risks the appearance of exerting improper influence over our judiciary by critiquing an unfinished draft the public was not meant to see. Thank you for that. Institutional norms and regular order would mean that we should not be having this hearing at all. The majority is clearly hoping to pressure the Supreme Court to influence their decision. If you care about the rule of law and institutional norms, stop attacking the Supreme Court, denounce the leak as the despicable Act that it is, denounce the bullying of Supreme Court justices at their homes and in public, stop--support the overturning of Roe v. Wade so that elected officials can once again make our laws instead of the Courts. With that, Ms. Foster, I just wanted to ask you if there was anything with the questions and the answers you've been hearing, is there anything that you would like to add to the discussion? Ms. Foster. Absolutely. I would point out that no one on the other side of the aisle has seemed to say a word about increasing resources for pregnant and parenting women, for getting women out of bad situations. I think every abortion story, there's a common thread there, and that's every woman who's had an abortion has been let down in some way, myself included. We were given a one-size-fits-all solution. We weren't given individualized care. We weren't given resources and support and life-affirming options. We were pushed toward abortion. That's why I appreciate what you and your colleagues are doing here and I'm just so grateful that you're here standing for the human rights of all human beings. Ms. Fischbach. Well, and thank you for being here, too, Ms. Foster. I just did want to add in my last few seconds, for 50 years, pro-lifers have been standing with the mothers and their children. You talk about pregnancy centers where pro-lifers wrap their arms around those women and those babies before and after birth. So, for many years we have been doing that, and we hope to continue to do that, but after Roe v. Wade. So, thank you very much for being here. With that, I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Jeffries. Mr. Jeffries. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, for convening this incredibly important hearing. I thank the Witnesses for your presence, and I want to direct my questions to Ms. Goodwin. I thank you for your virtual presence here, as well as for your legal expertise. This seems to me to be a conflict between those of us who want to make sure that a woman has the freedom to make her own healthcare decisions and those who want to criminalize healthcare, jam the women of this country with government- mandated pregnancies, even in the case of rape or incest. Now, this draft opinion by Justice Alito regarding Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization calls for the removal of a constitutional right for more than 100 million American women, I believe 167 million to be exact. Ms. Goodwin, if Justice Alito's draft becomes the final majority opinion of the Court, how many years of judicial precedent would the Supreme Court be overturning? Ms. Goodwin. Well, if we're talking about Roe v. Wade specifically, it would be 49 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. I would even suggest that we look back to Skinner v. Oklahoma, 1942, where the United States Supreme Court made clear that reproductive freedom and autonomy was a human right in the United States. So, we actually miss the mark by just looking to Roe v. Wade. If we actually look for a case that involves a man who was being denied reproductive autonomy in 1942, the Supreme Court said that was unconstitutional. Mr. Jeffries. This is an extraordinary step that the Court may take, a runaway, right-wing, radical majority of the Supreme Court. To justify his opinion in the draft, Justice Alito quotes and refers to Sir Matthew Hale, I believe approximately 98 times. Is that correct? Ms. Goodwin. A number of times. I can't express that's exactly the number of times that he does. It is alarming nonetheless that he does, considering that Sir Matthew Hale was one who wrote about coverture, meaning that women had no independent identity apart from their husband, and that also meant that women could legally beaten by their husbands and legally raped by their husbands too. Mr. Jeffries. Trust me, trust me, Ms. Goodwin, we're going to get there. Now, Justice Alito described Sir Matthew Hale as a great and eminent legal authority, is that correct? Ms. Goodwin. That is correct. Mr. Jeffries. A great and eminent legal authority. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a piece in the Washington Post on Roe. Alito cites a judge who treated women as witches and property. Chair Nadler. Without objection. [The information follows:] MR. JEFFRIES FOR THE RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Jeffries. Now, Sir Hale, an English judge from the mid- 1600s, actually sentenced two women to death who he deemed as witches, is that correct? Ms. Goodwin. That may very well be correct. I would say that he cites several other legal scholars as well who supported those ideas and views. Mr. Jeffries. This so-called legal scholar, Sir Hale, is the one who actually was the foundation for the most frequently cited defense of the infamous marital rape exception. Is that true? Ms. Goodwin. That's correct. Mr. Jeffries. Sir Hale once wrote that, ``The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife for their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given of herself in this kind unto her husband which she can retract.'' So essentially-- Ms. Goodwin. That's right. Mr. Jeffries. --Justice Hale or Sir Hale viewed women as property that could be violently raped and abused without consequence. Is that true? Ms. Goodwin. That is true. Mr. Jeffries. So, most of the legal basis for Justice Alito's draft opinion and his doctrine stems from a misogynistic so-called scholar from the 17th century who died before a single word of the Constitution was written. Is that true? Ms. Goodwin. That is correct. He was not from the United States. Mr. Jeffries. The notion that these are individuals who want to speak about original intent and would discard 49 years of settled precedent here is outrageous. It's problematic. That is what will undermine the confidence of the American people in our judiciary. We're going to continue to stand for the freedom of a woman to make her own healthcare decisions. Thank you for your testimony. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Biggs. Mr. Biggs. Thanks, Mr. Chair. On one hand, the focus of this hearing seems to be on the draft opinion as we just heard from the last gentleman and from several of the questioners on the other side. The timing of this hearing makes it suspect in and of itself, the line of questioning. What it seems to be is putting--or attempting to intimidate the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and actually, probably in some ways is going to encourage the continued advocacy in front judges' homes. As DHS says, it's going to anticipate increased violence. In a way, that whole aspect of this is merely distraction because this isn't about that necessarily and it isn't about saving a mom's life. That arises in less than one-tenth of one percent of all pregnancies related to abortion. Advances in medical technology have developed so far that it's almost always possible to save the lives of both mom and baby. This isn't about pregnant men or how you define women. This isn't about personal autonomy because science has progressed so far to tell us about the individuality of that baby, the development, what the baby looks like, how it grows, whether it feels pain, recognizes sounds and voices, et cetera. No, what this is really about is merely 65 million little persons who've been aborted, killed since the Roe v. Wade decision. This is about killing babies. That's what this hearing is about today. Comedian Laurie Kilmartin appeared on MSNBC to fantasize about having sex with the person who leaked the Supreme Court's draft opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson, then joyfully aborting the baby out of spite if it turned out the leaker was a conservative. This is about an Arizona State Senator, a Democrat State Senator arguing that his own foster children should've been aborted. This is about Pennsylvania's Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman saying abortion without any limit is sacred. This is about a change in the cultural attitude about abortions. This marks a significant shift, a significant shift in what we have discussed over time about abortion where even Hilary Rodham Clinton said in 2008 that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. That isn't the debate anymore from the left. This is about shouting that taking a life--this is from Michael Knowles I'm quoting here. This is about shouting that taking a life of the innocent in a womb is not a big deal. Quote, ``the late great Norm Macdonald once mocked a friend's suggestion at the time a common refrain that the worst aspect of disgraced comedian Bill Cosby's sexual crimes was,'' quote, ``the hypocrisy.'' ``No,'' Norm responded. ``I actually think it was the raping. It's my feeling most rapists are hypocrites.'' A man willing to commit enormous sins will more easily commit lesser sins. One struggles to imagine a more egregious sin than killing an innocent little baby. This is about the left telling pro-life Americans they should shut up when pro- life advocates protest Roe v. Wade and pray for it to be overturned but advocating for groups to violate Federal law and protest at Supreme Court justices' homes to intimidate them. When some have failed to condemn violence like the arson at a crisis pregnancy center in Wisconsin or Oregon. Attacking churches and houses of worship who preach the sanctity of life. Remaining silent when the Virginia Attorney General who warns pro-abortion protestors that they must refrain from harassing worshipers gets his window shot at. When the Secretary of the Treasury testifies that abortion is actually good for the economy apparently forgetting the economy of the life of the unborn in the womb child. The left will stop at nothing to advance this radical agenda. Last week during our markup, one of our colleagues said, nothing will be enough to protect our democracy and our fundamental right short of sending this far right majority on the Court to its rightful place in the minority and into the dustbin of history by expanding the Supreme Court. We have heard--let's just ask Ms. Foster. Is abortion an Act of love? Ms. Foster. Never. Mr. Biggs. Are pro-life policies racist? Ms. Foster. Absolutely not. Mr. Biggs. The reason I ask that is at a House Oversight Committee hearing, ``A State of Crisis: Examining the Urgent Need to Protect and Expand Abortion Rights,'' one of the Witnesses there, who also testified previously in this Committee, said abortion is a blessing, abortion is love, abortion is freedom. Is it any of those things, Ms. Foster? Ms. Foster. It is not. How many times you repeat a lie does not make it true. Mr. Biggs. So, we had a Member of the House testify that abortion restrictions are part of the intertwining systems of oppression that deny Black, Indigenous, and people of color their constitutional rights. Is that accurate, Ms. Foster? Ms. Foster. Absolutely not. Pro-life policies are meant to protect all human beings. Mr. Biggs. Thank you. My time is up. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Swalwell. Thank you, Chair. We are talking about a decision that is so personal and one that families and individuals with their families and their friends make oftentimes at the kitchen table. It's one of those few decisions in your life that will require you to consult with your friends and your family. It's like deciding what career you're going to pursue, whether you want to have a family, who you're going to marry. It's a decision for our family that we don't want the government to be a part of at all. For my wife, the decision to have three children was her decision, a decision that she made in consultation with her husband, her friends, and her family. For every woman in America who has to make this decision, it's a decision that they have the right to make with their friends, their family, the individuals they choose to consult. In no way should these guys over here be a part of her decision. These guys have no right to be at that kitchen table as she makes that very personal decision about whether she wants to be a parent or not. That's what they're asking for. They want to be at the kitchen table. They want to tell her whether she should or should not be able to be a parent. They don't want to be at the kitchen table for anything else after the baby is born. They don't want to be there at all. They don't want to be there to help her finance that family and walk away from every piece of legislation that we have that would help mothers feed their kids. They don't want to be there to help the mother educate their children. They don't want to be there to help her get a childcare tax credit or child tax credit that could be permanent. They don't want to be there to fund the education and good schools in the neighborhood. They certainly don't want to be there to take the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous people that could kill that kid at their elementary school. They don't want to be there to make college more affordable. They just want to be there to tell her she has to have a government mandated pregnancy. If she doesn't do it, she's a criminal. That's what they want to be there for. Ms. Goodwin, if this leaked opinion is finalized, will this open the floodgates to allow States to criminalize a woman's personal healthcare decisions? Ms. Goodwin. Yes, it will. We've already seen signs of that coming from the State legislatures that has been the most active in drafting various kinds of abortion bans even before now. Mr. Swalwell. Ms. Goodwin, would this opinion invite States to pass even more restrictive laws that would provide more rights to a rapist than to his victim? Ms. Goodwin. That's right. We've already seen that where States have wanted to empower and embolden rapists and even their family Members to be able to sue a woman who has been sexually assaulted and raped. Mr. Swalwell. Ms. Goodwin, from this opinion, does it also flow that you could ban contraception? Ms. Goodwin. Absolutely. From this decision, which criticizes justices who supported Roe v. Wade, those are the same justices in Griswold v. Connecticut. So, this particular draft opinion, if made a reality in June, it would mean potentially that even contraception could be something that could be outlawed or that's safe to seek to outlaw that and that this is a Court that might allow that. Mr. Swalwell. Chair, I thank you again for holding this hearing. These guys do not belong at the kitchen table of any woman in American as she makes this very personal decision. We know that if they force this decision on somebody, they're not going to be there for anything else and I yield back. Chair Nadler. Gentleman yields back. At this time, the Committee will stand in recess for five minutes. The Committee stands in recess. [Recess.] Chair Nadler. The Committee will come to order. Mr. McClintock. Mr. McClintock. Thank you. Mr. Chair, there are really two issues that are before us. One is the judicial issue over the role of the Court in our constitutional framework which we should be defending and the policy question of abortion which we should be debating. I think it's alright to vigorously debate or protest a Supreme Court decision. I think it's alright to change laws or amend the Constitution in response to a Supreme Court decision. It is not alright to intimidate the justices during their deliberations. The judiciary is supposed to be focused on the law and the Constitution. It's the one branch of government that's insulated from politics and political pressures for that very reason. Justice is often depicted as blindfolded because it's supposed to take no note of the politics or personalities before them or their favoritism or bias that's attached to them. One exception in that depiction, by the way, can be found in our old Supreme Court chamber in the Capitol. Justice is not blindfolded when she's looking to the Constitution. The Supreme Court fulfills this function by an extensive process of exchanging arguments and testing various reasons and opinions among the nine justices in the sanctity and security of knowing that as they hone and form and modify and perfect their positions, that process will remain confidential so they can feel free to alter their opinions as facts and reason dictates. This process is essential to the role of the Court. The unprecedented breach of that confidentiality by the leaking of a draft opinion is catastrophic to that process. For the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee to minimize this development is a distraction I personally find appalling and alarming. It is, I'm afraid, a very dangerous milestone in the left's attacks on our Constitution and its fundamental institutions. There's no blanking the fact that the Supreme Court is under sustained attack by the left. They refuse to protect the deliberations of the Court from political pressure and influence. Indeed, they've launched a concerted effort to apply political pressure by threats such as those as we heard from Senator Schumer recently, by intimidation such as assembling mobs in front of justices' homes and refusing to prosecute those crimes under our law, and by using the legislative branch to attack a draft opinion while it's being considered by the Court along with explicit threats to pack the Court if they don't get their way. That is the judicial crisis that we face. The Judiciary Committee not only is not standing in defense of our judiciary. It's leading the attacks. Conservatives for 50 years have abhorred the Roe decision. We never employed such tactics as we see from the left today. Now, if the Dobbs draft becomes the decision of the Court, the decision over abortion becomes a policy matter again that rightly belongs to the people through their elected representatives here in this branch or more precisely the legislative branches of the 50 States. This debate is appropriate in this body before this Committee. By the way, that's all the Dobbs decision says. I agree with the Chair that the decision to become a parent is a uniquely personal one which the government has no right to intrude upon. The fine point of the question is, when does one become a parent? That's really the center of this debate. Ms. Arrambide, you said that--and it really struck home. You said you trust people to decide what to do with their own bodies. Is that an accurate depiction of what you said? Ms. Arrambide. Yes. Mr. McClintock. I'd go a step further. I'd say that nobody has a right to tell you what to do with your own body. Would you agree? Ms. Arrambide. Yes. Mr. McClintock. Okay. Well, then we have the perfect agreement on that. Before we go on, I also have to ask the question, if this is solely about your body, does this process stop your heart from beating? Does it suck your brains out of your skull? Does it tear your limbs from your body? If you can't answer that question, then we have to entertain the possibility that maybe we're talking about another human being as well who has rights that have to be balanced through the laws that need to be talked about in forums like this, forums that represent all the people which is precisely where the Dobbs draft would place that decision. Ms. Foster, as a society, we've got a clear consensus that if a human being has a brain wave and a heartbeat, they have an indisputable right to life. They cannot be legally harmed. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. McClintock. Let me just ask, is that a standard we should be--that is a standard we apply to end of life. Is that also a standard we should apply to the beginning of life? Ms. Foster. It absolutely is, yes. Mr. McClintock. Thank you. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Abe Lincoln once wrote a beautiful passage in which he compared the Constitution and the Declaration. He said, ``the Constitution is like a silver picture framing the apple of gold.'' The apple of gold he said is liberty, liberty for each and every person in the country. The silver frame exists to protect the apple, he said. The Constitution exists to protect freedom. The apple does not exist to protect the frame. Well, today both democracy and freedom are under siege in our country. There are right wing extremists and fanatics who want to destroy both the silver frame of our constitutional democracy, and they came here to show us that they mean business on January the 6th of last year, and also the golden apple of personal freedom to make our own decisions about the most intimate and personal decisions that we could make. They have brought mob violence to the Congress of the United States, threatening to hang the Vice President to overthrow a democratic election. Now, they are about to do violence to the Constitution and the doctrine of a right to privacy, a freedom that tens of millions of Americans and women have considered central to their ability to lead their lives and to conduct their business as citizens of the country. Well, this is an illuminating hearing, Mr. Chair. The Republicans' own Witness, the Witness they called, is candidly and openly calling for a nationwide ban on all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. If I've got that wrong, I would invite Ms. Foster to correct me. Do I have it wrong, yes or no? Ms. Foster. If we added rape and incest exceptions, would you vote for it? Mr. Raskin. Okay. I reclaim my time, of course. This is a position for government compelled childbirth in all cases so extreme that it excludes the vast majority of Americans of all political persuasions. Talk, for example, to our Republican colleague, Nancy Mace, who has written movingly of her own rape at age 16. She refused to stand down before anti-choice extremists in South Carolina who wanted to criminalize abortion as this Witness does in every single case, in all the cases. The MAGA party wants to turn what is today and what has been for 50 years a constitutional right into a Federal crime. They want to do it before the 4th of July. I want America to reflect on what's going on here. My wife, Sarah, and I have been parents for 30 years. There's nothing I'm prouder of than raising three human beings of great decency and character. I've only been in public office for 15 years, half of that time. I venture to say I've come to known politicians pretty well. I hope it offends none of my colleagues here. I must say I trust my 29-year-old and 25-year-old daughters infinitely more to make the personal life planning decisions about when, where, and how to start their families and all the related attendant personal healthcare decisions about their bodies and their lives than I would ever trust the class of politicians to make those decisions for them. That's what this is about. I've served with great public officials from both parties, people like John Lewis, people like Liz Cheney, people like Nancy Pelosi. I would not trust even the best politicians to make those judgments for my daughters, much less would I trust the politicians who are fighting to criminalize abortion in all cases with no exceptions even for violent rape or incest across all of America. Why would we put this decision in the hands of those people? Abraham Lincoln was right about something else. He said, ``government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.'' Ultimately, I am sure that Abe Lincoln is as right about the 21st century as he was about the 19th century. We are not going to be able to endure half free and half controlled by the government. I tremble for my country when I contemplate what this five-justice majority is about to do to our country. I yield back to you, Mr. Chair. Chair Nadler. Gentleman yields back. Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. There have been a number of statements made by the other side this morning and now this afternoon that I just don't think are accurate. One was the Court and Republicans want to go after other rights. I just want to read from the draft decision, page 62. Majority rights and the draft opinion, . . . and to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or not mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedence that do not concern abortion. They've said that there's no question what Republicans want. They want a Federal law, that Republicans are radical. Is respecting the sanctity of life, Ms. Foster, is understanding that all life is precious, that we are endowed with that life by our creator, the special right to life we have mentioned in the document that started this whole thing we call America, is there anything real radical about that? Ms. Foster. Not at all. Mr. Jordan. Life is precious, isn't it? Ms. Foster. Life is the most precious thing. Without life, we can't exercise any other right. Mr. Jordan. Here's what the Court said. The Court said we're not even going to make an ultimate decision. We're just going to leave it to the respective States. The State in question in the decision that was in front of the Court that they wrote about in the draft opinion, State of Mississippi, they said this. They said 15 weeks. They said at five weeks, an unborn child's heart begins beating. At eight weeks, the child begins to move in the womb. At 10 weeks, vital organs begin to function. At 11 weeks, the diaphragm is developing. At 12 weeks, the child has taken on human form in all relevant respects. That all happens even before the deadline they set. We could disagree with that, but that's the case in front of the Court. They're saying, we're going to let States make this decision. The State of Mississippi, through their elected officials, passed a law that said that. They now say that's radical. What is radical in my mind is the position they take. We just asked a question of one of our colleagues who wouldn't answer the question. What is radical is the position they take because they say, no limits. Is that right, Ms. Foster? Ms. Foster. Absolutely accurate. You look at New York's Reproductive Health Act. You look at the Women's Health Protection Act. They go so far beyond codifying Roe, so to speak, they expand Roe. They do so much-- Mr. Jordan. I was thinking about what they passed last week or what they tried to pass last week in the United States Senate, right? You want to talk about radical. Tell the Members of this Committee and the American people what they tried to pass in the Senate last week. Ms. Foster. The Women's Health Protection Act would wipe out more than 500 protective laws. It would invalidate informed consent provisions, waiting periods, parental notification, much less consent. Anything that you-- Mr. Jordan. Go back to that one. So, a minor is going to have this surgery done, this procedure done. Some legislatures elected by the people at respective States say, you know what? We think it may make some sense to tell their mom and dad that they know what's going on. The bill that the Senate tried to pass last week got rid of that? Ms. Foster. My teenager couldn't get an aspirin in school without parental permission and consent but apparently can go get an abortion without even notification under the Women's Health Protection Act. Mr. Jordan. That sounds pretty radical. That would include all the way. I don't even like to talk about this because it seems just so wrong. All the way up until just moments before that little child is about to be born, is that right, Ms. Foster? Ms. Foster. On their birthday. Mr. Jordan. Yeah. Frankly, it's even worse because we had a former Democrat governor in a State not too far from here who said it shouldn't stop there. Shouldn't stop there. Governor Northam said actually, no, no, it's not even up to that point which is just unbelievable. It's even past that when someone, the strong, could end the life of the weak. Is that right? Ms. Foster. He did. He was on public radio and said that after the child was born, then the child would be kept comfortable while a debate ensued about whether or not the child would be given any kind of medical care. Mr. Jordan. Yeah. As Mr. McClintock pointed out, that child certainly would have a beating heart, certainly have a functioning brain, everything else. We had a democratic governor in a State not too far from here who said what he-- unbelievable. That's the radical--that's the position that the American people say, wait a minute. We don't want to go there. We don't want that. We would much prefer, I believe, to let the legislatures in the respective States put something together that makes sense for their State. I know where you and I are. We think all life is precious and should be protected. That's not what Mississippi said. They don't want to let that happen because they want the radical bill that they tried to pass in the United States Senate last week that would allow all kinds of things happen that the American people know instinctively is wrong. I yield back. Chair Nadler. Gentleman yields back. Ms. Jayapal. Ms. Jayapal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. In 2019, I was compelled to share my abortion story as States pursued abortion ban legislation. You want to know what's radical? A radical and politicized Supreme Court majority now stands poised to take away the basic freedom that women and pregnant people must have to make choices about our own bodies and instead to have the government force pregnancy. Here's the thing that really galls me. The hypocrisy of an anti-freedom, anti-abortion movement that claims to support life and freedom. Our Republican Witness and our Republican colleagues today spoke about the so-called violence of abortion when they are the very people who have opposed funding for contraception to prevent pregnancy or oppose the child tax credit which clearly reduced hunger or even advocated to separate thousands of immigrant kids from their parents or withhold baby formula for babies, babies at the border. In fact, States with the most draconian abortion restrictions also have the highest maternal mortality rates. That's the real violence here. That's the hypocrisy I want to examine. So, Dr. Robinson, maternal and infant mortality is a raging epidemic. Black women and children are especially at risk. What is the anti-abortion, anti-freedom advocates doing to protect the lives of Black mothers and infants? I have a number of questions. So, if you could keep your answers short. Dr. Robinson. Yes, they're not doing anything to protect the lives of mothers and infants. I appreciate you asking the question. The things that our patients need right now is effective contraception. We need access to healthcare before you become pregnant. We need access to care beyond 60 days postpartum. We need to be able to send our children to childcare if we do choose to parent. We need access to effective abortion and abortion in your own community if you choose not to be a parent. Ms. Jayapal. At every turn, this anti-freedom movement as you said that is opposing abortion and reproductive health access are the same people who don't want to provide healthcare to people and want to tear down the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid. Ms. Arrambide, how much will abortion bans strain our already overburdened healthcare system and harm the health of pregnant people and children of color? Ms. Arrambide. Thank you for your question. I mean, we're already seeing what it looks like for about 50,000 Texans to go into other States trying to access the care they need. When we see that 26 other States are going to ban abortion if this draft opinion goes into effect, it's going to be exponential. People will be forced to carry their pregnancies longer. That's only if they can access the care, if they can travel, if they can find childcare, if they can take off work to access the care they need, if they can afford to pay for their procedure. Then the regular, like, health system, especially in Texas, we've already seen how overrun it is. We're a State that has cut family planning, cut access to prenatal care. We don't pay attention to the high maternal mortality rates. In addition to that, we have not expanded Medicare. Like, we don't take care of the people that are in our communities now. We've seen the devastating effects of these types of bans, in Texas especially. Ms. Jayapal. Thank you so much for the work you do. Even though the data is clear that the abortion rate has fallen thanks to better contraceptive use and fewer unintended pregnancies, Ms. Glenn Foster's organization has written articles and amicus briefs in opposition to a wide array of reproductive healthcare services, including intrauterine devices, Plan B, in vitro fertilization. So, they're clearly not interested in preventing unintended pregnancies. In fact, Justice Alito in his draft decision also does note that the Supreme Court established many other modern rights based on the same reasoning as abortion rights and specifically includes precedence around contraception and by the way, other things like interracial or same sex marriage. Professor Goodwin, does this so-called pro-life movement solely focused on revoking abortion rights? Or are they also working to revoke other rights as well? Ms. Goodwin. Other rights. Other rights within the reproductive health space and rights that are associated with the right to birth. So that when Justice Alito in this draft opinion says, ``turn to your States and go vote,'' how does one do that effectively when this Supreme Court has dismantled parts of the Voting Rights Act and where it has become very difficult for poor people and people of color to be able to vote in these States. Ms. Jayapal. So, in response to Mr. Jordan, my colleague across the aisle's question about the fact that the Supreme Court is not aiming to take away other rights, in that same draft decision, didn't Justice Alito make reference to several other rights that follow essentially the same logic as this decision? Ms. Goodwin. That's right. Ms. Jayapal. Thank you. In the wake of this opinion, it is clear that the anti-abortion movement is not pro-life. They are anti-freedom, and they support abortion bans that would mandate government mandated pregnancy and disproportionately harm pregnant people and children of color. It's on us to ensure that these rights remain. Thank you, and I yield back. Ms. Scanlon. [Presiding.] The gentlewoman's time has expired. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube, for five minutes. Mr. Steube. Thank you, Madam Chair. More than 63 million unborn children have been murdered by abortion in the United States since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Between 1975 and 2012, it was more than a million a year. That equates to more than 2,700 children a day whose life was taken during that period. In my State of Florida, it's approximately 70,000 a year. Now, let me put those numbers in perspective for you. Sixty-three million is more than the number of deaths in the Holocaust, Stalin's forced famine, the Cambodian genocide, and the Armenian genocide combined. Twenty-seven hundred per day is more than the death toll at Pearl Harbor and just shy of September 11th. That happens every single day in this country. The 70,000 per year in Florida is more than the combined populations of the cities of Punta Gorda, Venice, Sebring, and Arcadia that are in my district every single year in Florida alone. Sixty-three million unborn babies since Roe v. Wade, many of them would be adults now. They would be contributing to our communities, to our economy, and making our world a better place. They never had a chance because a court created a right where none existed in the law. At some point in the 20th century, liberals developed a bizarre obsession with a sinister misuse of medical science. They ignored the text of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, the will of the electorate, and nearly two centuries of Supreme Court precedent to mandate that each State legalize abortion in an infamous decision that even its ideological supporters have a hard time defending on legal grounds. Roe v. Wade took discretion away from elected officials and required every State in the union to allow the killing of the unborn. Congress has never passed a bill legalizing the killing of unborn children in our country. Recent attempts in this Congress to do so have, thankfully, been stopped by a member of their own party. The Supreme Court in Roe inventing a right to abort despite no law allowing it and the Court ignored that such a right had never been recognized in the 184-year history of the Court. Today we may stand on the verge of righting that wrong. Instead of accepting this fact and turning their attention to the border crisis, inflation, gas prices, or the crime epidemic, Democrats are doubling down on their obsession with killing the unborn. For instance, in legislation this Congress, which has been alluded to here lately, Democrats have sought to legalize abortion up to the point of birth. Some Democrats have famously now explained how they would euthanize children outside the womb shortly after they are born and then explained the procedure that they would take to accomplish it. Democrats biggest focus right now is making sure that no jurisdiction in America can do anything to stop the killing of a nine-month baby in the womb. Their infatuation with and admiration for abortion is one of the most shameful occurrences in American political history. You want to talk about genocide. Look no further than United States where over 63 million and counting children have been killed in the name of choice. Of course, Democrats can't let pure hypocrisy get in the way of their accomplished stated mission. Even the Chair couldn't help himself in bringing the issues up in his opening statement. There's been another Member that's alluded to it. The same people who called January 6th protestors domestic terrorists and insurrectionists are now cheering on protestors violating Federal laws. They attempt to intimidate the Supreme Court justices at their homes. Of course, Biden's weaponized and politicized Department of Justice, who would rather investigate parents protesting at school boards turned a blind eye to clear violations of Federal law that is happening right now at the justices' homes. I'm sure if we had Trump supporters at the homes of liberal judges, it would be the next existential threat to democracy. FBI swat teams with what Democrats now call weapons of mass destruction would be raiding their homes at night, swiftly locking them up into solitary confinement with no bail while they awaited trial for over a year, full stop. So, Ms. Foster, in my limited time I have left, can you speak further about the sale of child tissue, in other words, the sale of body parts of aborted children by Planned Parenthood and other abortionists? Ms. Foster. Absolutely. Yeah, that is just another way that the abortion industry makes money. It's interesting. This hearing called by your colleagues on the other side, it's about grandstand- ing, fear mongering, misinformation, falsehoods, and intimidation. What's true is that we are in favor of supporting life and protecting all human beings. We did that for pregnant and parenting human beings when we filed a brief in Young v. UPS. We do that for children in the womb. We shine a light on exactly what Planned Parenthood is doing with the bodies of these children that it aborts and other abortion industry players. All too frequently, they're selling these body parts for research, for examination. We have heard even that it's been exposed that they are often even burned, incinerated to power our streetlamps. That is simply inhumane. That is the core of the abortion industry, is treating people like things and stripping away the humanity of human beings that science has known have been human beings for many, many decades, long before Roe, that we saw even in the 1960s on the cover of Time. Ms. Scanlon. The gentleman's time as expired. Thank you. Mr. Steube. Thank you. Ms. Scanlon. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for five minutes. Ms. Demings. Thank you so much, Madam Chair, and thank you to all our Witnesses for being here today. After sitting here listening to this for a while, it's difficult to know exactly where to start. I think I'll start here. I grew up in a rural part of Florida. My parents were poor, but they were good, decent, honest people who taught their seven children to be good, decent, and honest. My mother was in church every Sunday, so that meant I was in church every Sunday. My mother taught me to not just listen to a sermon. She taught me to try to be a sermon, to practice what I heard preached, to treat people with respect, and also leave them with their dignity. So, because of that, I made a decision a long time ago that I would dedicate my life to public service, that I wanted to protect people. I ultimately decided that the best way for me to do that was to become a police officer. Madam Chair, I can tell you as a police officer, I cannot tell you the number of times I may have disagreed with people's personal choices, beliefs, and decisions. I took an oath that I would protect them and their constitutional rights to those decisions and those beliefs. That's what sets us apart from every other nation, your family, life, religion, circumstances, belief, and bodies. It is what makes this the greatest nation on planet Earth. I swore as a police officer and so did we in this body that we would protect that. As a police detective, I have investigated sexual assault, rape, and incest. Imagine--and I'm speaking to all my colleagues, if you are willing--the trauma associated with these types of attacks and abuse, the darkness, hopelessness, humiliation, and the shame. Madam Chair, certainly it appears that these politicians have no shame. On the one hand, they shout government needs to get out of our business. They shout we need less government. When it comes to a woman's most intimate, private, personal decisions, a woman's freedom, and doggone it her right to privacy, certainly politicians want full, uninterrupted, unfiltered access to what a woman does with her body. There's been a lot of talk about the leaker. Well, perhaps the leaker is a conservative who just happens to believe that Roe is established settled law and is appalled at the plan to overturn it and simply sounded the alarm. Can't we just stop trying to shame and control America's daughters? Let's help them soar as we should to their full potential. I trust them. I ask every Member of this body to get out their personal business and trust them too. Professor Goodwin, I want to ask you, why do you think there is disagreement between State laws and reliable, consistent polling, the overwhelming majority of the American people believe that Roe should stay in place? There's some of my colleagues that say the hell with that. Why do you think that State laws are inconsistent with reliable polling showing broad support for the right to an abortion? Professor? Ms. Goodwin. Well, because there is an agenda to dismantle to the rule of law and our democracy as we know it, it's important to realize that Roe v. Wade was a seven to two opinion. Five of those justices were Republican appointed. Justice Blackmun was put on the Court by Richard Nixon. What we see today is antithetical to that history. Ms. Demings. Thank you so much, Professor. Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. Massie for five minutes. Mr. Massie. Thank you, Madam Chair. This hearing and the context that's being offered or called and the title of it is just part of an ongoing effort of the radical left to influence the Supreme Court through intimidation. The decision should've never been leaked. Right now, what's happening here what the Democrats are doing is to try and amplify that leak to try--it's a last ditch effort to influence this decision. Ms. Foster, you mentioned in your opening statement something that I think needs to be explored more. I want to give you a chance to do that. You talked about euphemisms. You didn't really get a chance to discuss some of those euphemisms. I think I know what some of them are. Can you tell us what the euphemistic language is that the radical left uses to describe abortion and why they do that? Ms. Foster. Well, talking about the child in the womb, unless you're President Biden, they use terms like clump of tissue, clump of cells, things like that. They don't seem to recognize and admit that it is a child in the womb even when their own President does, even when all embryology textbooks do, even when the vast majority of the American people. Anyone who's seen an ultrasound can recognize that humanity. Mr. Massie. I mean, aren't we all just a clump of cells at the end of the day? I mean, that's what life is. We are cells that replicate and divide. That's what a baby is doing inside of the womb. That, I would say, is life, when cells multiply on their own without somebody causing that. The other euphemisms that they use to describe the baby in the womb are fetus, pregnancy tissue. This abortion will just quietly remove the pregnancy they might say. Ms. Foster. Products of conception. Mr. Massie. Products of conception, medical waste, I mean, you've already discussed that. They refer to unborn babies as medical waste once they've been aborted. I find it interesting the language they use to describe ending the life of an unborn baby, abortion care. Who's being taken care of there? Birth control, it's actually a consequence of the lack of birth control. Reproductive freedom. These are all euphemisms they use for describing the process of ending the life of an unborn baby. Abortion clinic; even the name of the leading abortion clinic is deceptive in itself. Planned Parenthood? It's the lack of planning. It's an emergency that's gone on or it's an unplanned thing that's happened. Now, they're trying to treat it like an emergency when it should be the birth of a baby. Those who would prematurely end the life of their baby are being called patients. My body, my choice. I remember when I was young and before I learned how babies came about, I thought when they said my body, my choice, they were talking about whatever was inside of the woman was part of their body. The baby is not the body of the woman that it's inside of. It's another life. It's not the body of the woman. So why do you think they use this language? Ms. Foster. Today's hearing has been replete with those euphemisms and misdirections that I referenced in the opening statement. Abortion is a scourge, plain and simple. It's a farce that abortion is presented as a solution to anyone's problems. It's a crime that corporate abortion interests and this kind of euphemism and misdirection hold so much sway over so many. We have to do better than this because our constitutional democracy is at stake. If abortion solved poverty or improved material conditions, wouldn't we have closed the gap in the last 50 years? Right now, inequality is greater than ever, and wage growth is more stagnant than ever. So, please, with the idea that abortion improves equality. Mr. Massie. I think they're using these words to deceive because if they actually described what they were doing, what an abortion causes, that it ends a life, far fewer people would choose that. So, I think they do it to deceive. I hold out hope that the reason they use this language is some of the people in the abortion industry still have a conscience, that they know that it's wrong. What they're doing is wrong. They come up with this language to maintain the cognitive dissonance that allows them to end a life while at the same time knowing that ending a life is morally and ethically wrong. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. The Chair recognizes myself for five minutes. I want to thank Chair Nadler for calling this hearing and our Witnesses who joined us today to sound the alarm about the imminent restrictions on American reproductive freedom. For my entire adult life, abortion has been recognized as a legal form of healthcare and so have a growing number of types of contraception. That means that I've had the freedom to decide when and if I would become a parent. I did eventually so decide with my husband to have three wonderful children. I had the freedom to make that decision on my own terms after I completed years of college, law school, a judicial clerkship, and legal training. I had the freedom to make the decision to become a parent when I was physically, emotionally, and financially ready to take that step. I had the freedom to make that decision once I was ready to spend 30 months being pregnant with all the temporary and permanent physical changes that entails and ready to spend the next 30 years and counting nurturing those children and putting their needs ahead of my own. I was able to make those decisions about my health and well-being and that of my family because of Roe v. Wade and other cases such as Griswold that recognized that as Americans we have human rights and constitutional rights to privacy and liberty to make these most deeply personal decisions about whether and when to become a parent and whether and whom to marry, ourselves and with those most concerned and close to us, whether a family, medical providers, or faith leaders, free from government interference and control. We've heard from some of today's Witnesses how having that choice or lacking that choice due to opportunity or resources had a huge impact on their lives. I've also seen the impact upon the health and well-being of clients I represented as a lawyer of having the freedom, resources, and support, or lack thereof, to make reproductive decisions free from government interference. The vast majority of Americans understand that reproductive health decisions are complex and should be made by a woman and those she's close to based on their individual medical, emotional, financial, and other circumstances and that the government does not belong in control of that decision. We're at a point where the draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization indicates that the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade which will threaten access to abortion care across the country and undermine other personal privacy and liberty rights. Some of our colleagues have suggested that the purpose of this hearing is to pressure the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs' case. I would suggest that our Republican colleagues and particularly Mitch McConnell have already exercised undue influence on the Supreme Court's decision by packing the Court with far-right justices. I would counter that the purpose of this hearing is exactly as its title suggests, to examine the likely impact upon American freedom to make reproductive healthcare decisions if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Opening the door to increasingly restrictive laws and, as Senator McConnell and others have suggested, an outright national ban on abortion care. Last fall, the House voted to pass the Women's Health Protection Act which would codify many of the rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade and Casey. The Senate needs to join us in protecting this essential human right to privacy and liberty by passing that bill. If the current Senate won't pass the bill, then the majority of Americans who support having American's freedom to make reproductive healthcare decisions without government interference, they need to know that we need to change the Senate. Restricting access to abortion care has ripple effects across generations. We cannot go back to an era of criminalized abortion. So, one of my priorities in Congress has been to address our country's rising and unnecessary rate of maternal mortality, a healthcare emergency that disproportionately affects many of my constituents. The U.S. has a pregnancy- related death rate that far exceeds that of similar developed countries and is exponentially worse for women of color. The vast majority of such deaths are almost entirely preventable. With abortion healthcare on the chopping block, I'm very concerned about how maternal mortality across the country would be affected. Dr. Robinson, could you address that question for me? Dr. Robinson. Yes. I've taken care of pregnant people for more than 17 years. So, being a physician who cares for pregnant people, I do understand that there are circumstances where people do need access to the full gamut of options, including abortion care. The same communities that are having difficulty having access to compassionate abortion care are the same communities that do have the highest maternal mortality rates. This care is very important. I think that's the thing that we need to focus on is giving these patients what they need so that we can decrease that maternal and infant mortality rate, like, making sure that they have access to care and not just once they become pregnant. Then making sure that they can continue that access to care beyond a short postpartum period. Ms. Scanlon. Thank you very much. I see that my time has expired. At this time, I would recognize the gentleman from Texas for five minutes. Mr. Roy. I thank the Chair. Earlier, somebody was positing what sets us apart as a country. I would suggest that it is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and the constitutional framework that protects that. Quick question for you, Ms. Foster. A lot has been made about the implications with respect to race on the Roe opinion and what may come down this summer. Would you agree that if you look at the most recent data, 38 percent of abortions affect Black babies? Ms. Foster. Tragically, yes. Mr. Roy. Twenty-one percent affect Hispanic babies? Ms. Foster. Yes. Mr. Roy. A lot of numbers have been raised about--or a lot of questions and issues have been raised about rape and incest. In fact, you had an exchange with my colleague from Maryland, Mr. Raskin, about whether or not he would accept limits on abortion if there was, in fact, an exception for rape and incest. Could you clarify for the record, the Guttmacher Institute is an arm of Planned Parenthood, correct? Ms. Foster. Yes, founded as the research arm of Planned Parenthood. Mr. Roy. According to data that I have, less than one percent of abortions are connected to rape, less than half percent are connected to incest according to Guttmacher. Does that line up with your understanding? Ms. Foster. According to the Guttmacher Institute, ``data suggests that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.'' That's a quote. In fact, it's the same top reasons as first trimester abortions which are financial hardship, relationship issues, and not feeling ready to be a parent which are all issues where we as a caring nation and as loving communities can come alongside the woman. Mr. Roy. So, I think it merits conversation again to your point, yes or no, do you believe that your answer was--the answer from Mr. Raskin, would it be a yes or a no? It would be no, correct? Ms. Foster. It would be no. Mr. Roy. You would not accept limits on abortion. Even if you exempted the one, 1\\1/2\\ percent that falls in that category. Ms. Arrambide, really quick, you made a couple of points I think during your testimony about Texas not being a particularly hospitable place generally or with respect to women as it relates to abortion and made a point about lack of care provided for women. Is it correct--I have information I believe that says that there are 8\\1/2\\ pro-pregnancy and pregnancy counseling centers for every one abortion clinic in the State of Texas. The legislature in passing S.B. 8 appropriated 100 million dollars for women's healthcare. I guess my question here is in light of that and in light of Texas being an inhospitable place according to your testimony, are you aware of how many people moved to the State of Texas in the last decade? Do you know what that number is? Ms. Arrambide. I don't know. Mr. Roy. Yeah, four million people have moved to the State of Texas in the last decade. Ms. Arrambide. I will say that the clinics that you're referring to are free clinics and they don't actually-- Mr. Roy. That's the population of the entire State of Alabama have moved to the State of Texas by choice in the last decade. I would move to one other question here. Ms. Robinson-- Ms. Arrambide. Could I finish my answer, though, about Texas-- Mr. Roy. I didn't ask you a question about that. Ms. Robinson, I would ask you a question. When is the latest that you have performed an abortion in terms of weeks of the unborn child? Dr. Robinson. Yes, my name is Dr. Robinson, and I provide abortion care in Alabama. So, Alabama has a-- Mr. Roy. What is the answer to the question, the latest that you have performed an abortion? Dr. Robinson. I'm going to answer your question. So, unfortunately-- Mr. Roy. It's a number, weeks. Dr. Robinson. --my State is one of those States that has passed restrictions or bans on abortion care which limits physicians like myself-- Mr. Roy. Therefore, in other words, you'd like to do it later. What is the latest you performed an abortion? Dr. Robinson. So, since I will always follow the law and I live in the State of Alabama, I provide abortion care up until 20 weeks gestational age. Mr. Roy. Okay. So, you performed an abortion at 20 weeks. Dr. Robinson. Yes, sir. Mr. Roy. The procedure for an abortion when we're talking about at 20 weeks, as I understand it, is dilation and extraction. Have you performed abortions at that stage? In doing so, have you had baby parts that you've had to discard or store in some capacity? Dr. Robinson. One of the things that you all have done-- Mr. Roy. Legs, arms, eyes? Dr. Robinson. --throughout this hearing is just use inflammatory language-- Mr. Roy. No, it's a question. Ma'am--it's a simple question. Dr. Robinson. --as you talk about the care that we provide. Mr. Roy. Have you had human parts, baby parts, arms, legs, as a result of an abortion performed at the time you just acknowledged-- Dr. Robinson. I am a physician-- Mr. Roy. --you performed abortions up to 20 weeks. Dr. Robinson. --and a proud abortion provider. There is nothing that you can say-- Mr. Roy. Yes or no-- Dr. Robinson. --that makes it difficult--for me to talk about the care that I provide to patients. Mr. Roy. Ma'am, so, have there been baby parts, yes or not? Dr. Robinson. If you will like for me to talk to you about how we perform an abortion for patients who need care-- Mr. Roy. Where and how have they been stored? So, the answer to the question is fairly obvious. Dr. Robinson. --at 20 weeks gestational age, I'm happy-- Mr. Roy. There are baby parts, and you don't want to talk about how they're being stored. You don't want to talk about putting them in freezers. You don't want to talk about putting them in Pyrex dishes. You don't want to talk about the videos that we have from Planned Parenthood at Gulf Coast in Houston, Texas. You don't want to talk about the reality of what actually happens. Ms. Scanlon. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Roy. I yield back. Dr. Robinson. If you don't mind me answering, all those things that you just mentioned, I have never seen that in a healthcare setting ever. We don't put baby parts in freezers or Pyrex dishes. I've never seen a patient-- Mr. Roy. Well, I asked where you put them. Well, then where do they go? Ms. Scanlon. Gentleman's time has expired. Dr. Robinson. Thank you. Ms. Scanlon. The Chair recognizes Ms. McBath for five minutes. Mrs. McBath. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Thank you so much to Chair Nadler. Thank you so much to our Witnesses today. We really appreciate you being here under such duress. Like so many women in America, for years I struggled to get pregnant. My husband and I, we tried everything that we could do to start a family of our own. Finally, we were successful. I had never been so happy. I prayed for this moment for so many years. I wanted to tell everyone. I just wanted to shout it from all the mountaintops. For weeks I began to dream about our life and our future together. Then one day I woke up covered in blood. It is hard to describe the agony of a miscarriage. It is heartbreak, it is helplessness, it is pain, and it is profound sadness. Millions of women suffer from them. I have heard from many who felt guilty, like I did, who felt as though that we weren't worthy of having a child. Those are the same feelings that cut through my mind. Every time I have had these difficult discussions with other women, I remind them that they are strong, and that they are powerful beyond measure, and that their worth is far more than their ability to procreate. However, it seems those in support of this ruling disagree. After my second miscarriage I wondered, in my grief again, if God had decided I was never meant to be a mother. So, when I finally got pregnant again, I was overjoyed because I believed that God was giving me and my husband, finally, he had a plan for us to be parents. After four months, while feeling terror and trauma in my heart, I was rushed to the emergency room. There, with my doctor and my husband, I learned that I had suffered a fetal demise, or a stillbirth. There again I was filled with anguish, and sorrow, and guilt. I tried so hard, and still I felt like I failed trying to be a mother. My doctor thought it would be better to, and safer to end the pregnancy naturally, without the medicines so commonly used. So, for two weeks I carried my dead fetus and waited for me to go into labor. For two weeks people passed me on the street telling me how beautiful I looked, asking how far along I was, and saying that they were so excited for me and my future with my child. For two weeks I carried a lost pregnancy and the torment that comes with it. I never went into labor on my own. When my doctor finally induced me, I faced the pain of labor without hope for a living child. This is my story. It is uniquely my story. Yet, it is not so unique. Millions of women in America, women in this room, women at your homes, the women you love and cherish have suffered a miscarriage. So, I ask on behalf of these women, after which failed pregnancy should I have been imprisoned? Would it have been after the first miscarriage? After doctors used what would be an illegal drug to abort the lost fetus? Would you have put me in jail after the second miscarriage? Perhaps that would have been the time, forced to reflect in confinement at the guilt I felt, the guilt that so many women feel after losing their pregnancy. Or would you have put me behind bars after my stillbirth, after I was forced to carry a dead fetus for weeks after asking God if I was ever going to be able to raise a child? I ask, because the same medicine used to treat my failed pregnancies is the same medicine States like Texas would make illegal. I ask, because if Alabama makes abortion murder, does it make miscarriage manslaughter? I ask, because I want to know if the next woman who has a miscarriage at three months, if she will be forced to carry her dead fetus to term? So, for the women in your life whose stories you do not know, for the women across the country whose lives you may not understand, and for the women in America who have gone through things you simply cannot comprehend, I say to you this: Women's rights are human rights. Reproductive healthcare is healthcare. Medical decisions should be made by women and those that they trust, not politicians and officials. We have a choice. We can be the nation that rolls back the clock, that rolls back the rights of women, and that strips them of their very liberty, or we can be the nation of choice, the nation where every woman can make her own choice. Freedom is our right to choose. Chair Nadler. [Presiding.] The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop. Thank you. Ms. Scanlon said a few minutes ago that this hearing is called because of an imminent peril to the right of abortion. Professor Goodwin, I guess you are the only Witness presented by the majority as having expertise in the law. Do you unequivocally condemn the leak of the draft opinion? Ms. Goodwin. It is absolutely unprecedented that there is a leak. It is a story; it is not the story of these hearings. That is unprecedented. Mr. Bishop. No, I didn't--I am aware it is unprecedented. So, that is factual. Many people have covered that. I am interested as a matter of your expertise; do you condemn it? Was it wrong to leak the opinion? Ms. Goodwin. I believe that, I believe that the justices need to be able to deliberate privately. I think that leaks such as this make that difficult. Mr. Bishop. Thank you. Dr. Robinson, I noticed in your written testimony you said that you use she/her pronouns. You are a medical doctor. What is a woman? Dr. Robinson. It is important for you to understand why I said, ``I use she/her pronouns.'' It is because I understand that-- Mr. Bishop. Well, I am explaining. I was explaining why I am asking the question. I just thought you can answer the question. What is a woman? Dr. Robinson. I think it is important that we educate people like you about why we are doing the things that we do. So, the reason that I use she and her pronouns is because I understand that there are people who become pregnant that may not identify that way. I think it is discriminatory to speak to people or to call them in such a way as they desire not to be called. Mr. Bishop. Thanks for that explanation. Dr. Robinson. So, it is important that we respect each individual person-- Mr. Bishop. Are you going to answer my question? Can you answer the question; what is a woman? Dr. Robinson. I am a woman. I will ask you, which pronouns do you use? Mr. Bishop. Can you provide-- Dr. Robinson. If you tell me that you use she and her pronouns,-- Mr. Bishop. Is that-- Dr. Robinson. --I am going to answer you, I am going to call you Mr. Bishop. I am going to respect you for how you want me to address you. Mr. Bishop. I am just asking, so you have given me an example of a woman. You say that you are a woman. Can you tell me, otherwise can you tell me what a woman is? Dr. Robinson. Yes. I am telling you; I am a woman. Mr. Bishop. Is that as comprehensive a definition as you can give me? Dr. Robinson. That is as comprehensive of a definition as I will give you today. Mr. Bishop. I see. Dr. Robinson. Because I think it is important that we focus on what we are here for. It is to talk about access to abortion care and how important this right is. Mr. Bishop. I see. So, you are not interested in answering the question I asked unless, in answering the question that I asked unless it is part of a message you want to deliver. Is that right? Dr. Robinson. I am sorry. Because I was talking, and you were talking at the same time. Mr. Bishop. Yes, ma'am. I am, right, it is my, it is my time. Dr. Robinson. Okay. I just-- Mr. Bishop. It is my time to ask you questions. That is the purpose of this. I ask you to uncover things by asking you questions and asking you to respond. So, you are not willing to answer a question unless it is part of the message you wish to deliver. Is that correct? Dr. Robinson. So, what I was trying to explain to you is that I had a difficult time hearing you since we were talking at the same time. Mr. Bishop. Let me just see if I can go to Ms. Arrambide. Is that a pretty close approximation of the pronunciation? Ms. Arrambide. Arrambide. Mr. Bishop. Arrambide. Okay. What do you say a woman is? Ms. Arrambide. I believe that anyone can identify for themselves. Mr. Bishop. Okay. Do you believe then that men can become pregnant and have abortions? Ms. Arrambide. Yes. Mr. Bishop. Professor Goodwin, the draft opinion says this, in part: The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently exempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. Adherence to precedent is the norm, but not an inexorable command. If the rule were, otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Lochner would still be the law. Professor, isn't that inarguably true? Mustn't it be the case that all prior decisions of the Court are subject to reevaluation? Ms. Goodwin. Oh, it is certainly the case that we have in the legacy of this Court: Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, Brown v. Board of Education. So, the ability to be able to review is important. That is the ability to be able to review. It is another thing when the Supreme Court then strips away a fundamental protection that has been made, particularly given that the justices who may be involved in this leaked draft opinion suggested that they actually respected the precedent and stare decisis associated with Roe. They were not talking about Plessy v. Ferguson or Dred Scott when they said that they respected that stare decisis. Mr. Bishop. Well, those are examples. So, Roe and Casey would be equally susceptible to reevaluation as Plessy. Would you agree? Ms. Goodwin. Well, and in fact, they certainly could be and be further expanded. They have been. So, one of the things we haven't talked about is that there is Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt, and even just a couple years ago, June Medical v. Russo, which this Supreme Court used to further uphold the principles of Roe v. Wade and also Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Mr. Bishop. I yield back. My time has expired. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Escobar. Ms. Escobar. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank our Witnesses. It has been really challenging to listen to my Republican colleagues essentially minimize and, in fact, completely ignore how difficult decisions like this are for women all over the country. It is even more difficult to listen to them Act as though they know better for women what women--how women should plan their future. The fact that they believe they should be the ones to stand between a woman and her doctor. It is shocking to me how backward this thinking is, and the dark days they want to return women to. I want to share a story briefly of someone close to me. Once the Supreme Court draft was made public, a mother, an incredible mother approached me to share with me her story of her abortion. She was pregnant with her third child. She and her husband were excited about this baby. They bought a crib. They prepared the room. They were fortunate. She was in a stable marriage, in a stable family. They had means to provide for their baby. So, they were making plans for this baby. In her final trimester she heard the horrific news that her baby was not viable. Then she learned that if she carried the baby to term, she would likely die, leaving her kids motherless, leaving her husband without a partner, without a wife. So, she made the decision to terminate a pregnancy that she wanted and had planned for. She had to undergo this procedure at a clinic. The very same people here who are of the belief that they should tell women how to live their lives and usurp the authority of a physician, it was those types of people standing outside that clinic who were jeering and taunting this mourning mother, this mother who couldn't even mourn the loss of her baby because she had to hear the screams of people judging her and yelling at her. To those who think, those in America who believe that my extreme MAGA colleagues aren't coming for you, they are coming for you. They are coming for your rights. We have heard today absolute proof that they want to ban abortion across the United States. So, let that be absolutely clear. There is no State where government-forced birth won't be happening. If Samuel Alito tells you they are not coming for you, just remember this is a Supreme Court majority that lied to Congress and lied to the American people. So, it is a majority without integrity. Remember that the people who are trying to stand between you and your doctor are the same people who voted against paid family and medical leave so that mamas could stay home with their babies. They are the same people who voted against access to childcare so mamas could go to work to provide for their babies. These are the same people who voted against universal pre-K so that mamas could give their babies a fighting chance at an education. These are the same people who put guns ahead of the lives of school children, because schoolchildren, as we know, go to school in terror. Their parents send their kids to school terrified that their kids might not come home. These are the same people who champion Trump policies of family separation. So, let's remember who the people in Congress are who support families and who value mothers and babies. If we want to reduce abortion, then we would provide free contraception and widely-accepted sex education. They are against that, too. Dr. Robinson, I want to ask you, because your voice, they have been trying to obscure your voice and your message, speaking over you. In the remaining 30 seconds, anything you would like to correct the record on? Dr. Robinson. Yes. One of the things I did want to say was there no doubt in my mind about life. I understand that once a sperm meets an egg that there is the potential for life. I do also understand that some people believe that life begins at conception, and some people feel that it begins at a different point. I think what we need to consider is that what goes into that is everybody's belief system, their upbringing, their values. We should respect that. For those people who feel like life begins at conception, I welcome them to never have an abortion ever in their life. We should respect that. I also feel that they should respect the decision of people who do decide that an abortion is what is right for them and for their families. Ms. Escobar. Thank you. Dr. Robinson. I am so sorry about the situation with the person you spoke about who had to go to an abortion clinic and face the harassment and the jeering as she went in and mourn her child. My patients face that on a daily basis, because she cannot get that care in the hospital, even when there is a complicated pregnancy. So, this is the reality for many of our patients. Ms. Escobar. Thank you so much, Dr. Robinson. To the American people watching at home, remember they are coming for you, too. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Owens. Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Last week, at a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified that restricting abortions would have a very damaging effect on the economy. As she took the position of representing teenagers, low-income women, and minorities, Secretary Yellen argued that ending the life of an unborn child is a good thing for the labor force participation rate. Since I am very aware of the founder of Parent Parenthood-- Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, I find the parroting of her manifesto by Secretary Yellen, the devaluation of life of an unborn, poor Black and minority children as very concerning. I have also been aware of Sanger's 1946 book, The Negro Project, in which she shared her vision of poor Blacks and other minorities. I quote, ``The gradual suppression, elimination, and eventual extinction of a defective stock, those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.'' She was a favorite, by the way, of the White supremacist, KKK speaking circuit. When she set up her first abortion shop, it was in Black Harlem in 1921. These are words of a rabid racist founder of Planned Parenthood. That's a multibillion-dollar global abortion cartel, and been responsible for the deaths--and that is going to be her legacy--the deaths of tens of millions of Black babies and other children. Thank goodness for Senator Tim Scott upon hearing the statement by Secretary Yellen calling it out for what it was: Biased, callous, and calculated. I agree with my friend Senator Scott who learned from his single mother that there is dignity in all work, and dignity in all life. In an op ed published in yesterday's Washington Post, Senator Scott wrote: We live in a world where words are too often disconnected from the lived experiences of many Americans. Yellen's cold and robotic reference to the issue of life is just the latest example of that. Secretary Yellen's comments is also deeply offensive to me. For years, the Black community has been disproportionately targeted by the abortionist industry. I have watched it happen. We lost over 20 million Black babies over the last 40 years. That is 40 percent of my race exterminated before given a chance to bless our nation with their innate talents. Based on her conclusion, their demise is a good thing for our labor force participation rates. Secretary Yellen has obviously concluded that these 20 million Black lives would have been an economic drain on our society. A 2017 report by the Life Issues Institute found that 88 percent of Planned Parenthood megacenters targeted women of color, with 80 percent specifically targeting Black communities, and 56 percent targeting Hispanic and Latino communities. For those who love the concept of equity, and everything under the sun, including test score outcomes, when it comes to the death of the unborn, the abortion equity seems to be pretty racist to me. Abortion is not healthcare. Healthcare doesn't result in the intentional death of over 60 million human beings. It undermines the dignity and worth of every individual and their God-given right to life. If a woman feels that abortion is her only and best option, I believe that woman has been failed by her family, her partner, her community, and her healthcare providers. I am the father of six children and 16 grandchildren. Our pride comes from the joy of watching them grow and start a family of their own, even if their circumstances aren't perfect or, as Ms. Yellen would have us believe, an economic burden. Now, two of my beautiful, loving, talented children were born after my NFL career, after I lost everything due to a failed business, and after a brief job stint as a chimney sweep and a security guard. Thank goodness I was raised by a generation of proud Black Americans who taught me that in America our financial status does not define us. It can be temporary. Our children and family relationships, on the other hand, are not only eternal but an invaluable treasure during our brief time on this earth. They are the only legacy at the end of our lives that really matter. Our children are the most precious gifts and blessings from a loving God. The fight to defend life has never been more important, the fight to defend the founding ideals of our nation that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness has never been more important. I ask for unanimous consent to place Senator Scott's Washington Times op ed titled, ``Tim Scott: Abortion is not the way to help single Black mothers,'' in the record. [The information follows:] MR. OWENS FOR THE RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Owens. With the last few seconds I have, Ms. Foster, do you have any comments that you would like to add to the record? Ms. Foster. That brought me to tears. Amen to everything you just said. I would just say when it comes to helping mothers in difficult situations and living in poverty, go ask Planned Parenthood if they provide diapers, formula, a crib, rent assistance, food, bill assistance, counseling, mammograms, continuing education, you know. Then compare that to what pregnancy care centers offer. Then come tell me that pro-lifers are the ones that don't care for children after they are born. Give me a break. Mr. Owens. Thank you. The legacy of Sanger will be for death. That is what she will be known for. Thank you so much for that. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I have a unanimous consent request. Chair Nadler. Wait one second. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman is recognized for a unanimous consent request. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you. Just to enter into the record a letter that we received today from the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Chair Nadler. Without objection. [The information follows:] MR. JOHNSON OF LOUISIANA FOR THE RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you. Chair Nadler. Mr. Stanton. Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Like most of my colleagues, I was shocked to learn the news that a draft decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health had leaked from the Supreme Court. As I read that opinion, my shock turned to disbelief. My disbelief turned to outrage. It has been nearly 50 years since the Court decided Roe v. Wade. In that half century, the American people have recognized the constitutional right to an abortion, the constitutional right to make an informed medical decision with their doctor, the constitutional right to exercise control of their own body. The American people support that right. I have learned during my time in public life that although there are wide- ranging personal opinions about abortion, most Americans believe that the government has no business getting between a woman and her doctor. They believe that government has no business forcing a woman who does not want to be pregnant, to remain pregnant. They know at their core that it is wrong and morally reprehensible for the government to force a victim of sexual assault to carry her rapist's child. That is what is at stake. If Roe is overturned, as we expect it will be, that will be the future for women in many States, including my State, Arizona. Arizona's governor has signed an anti-abortion law that provides no safe harbor for victims of rape or incest. Some State legislatures working with the anti-Roe activists are gearing up to go even further, outlawing abortion altogether. The American people do not want that. They support Roe. They support the right to choose to have an abortion. In my State, which is evenly split among party lines, more than 70 percent of voters oppose making abortion illegal. So, that might explain why up to this point my Republican colleagues have been more concerned with the leak itself than what the draft decision actually says, and what it would mean for our country. This issue is about choice. It is about self-determination. It is about liberty. Americans believe in those freedoms. They rely upon them. That is why the fight to protect them is so important. Should the draft opinion become the decision of the Supreme Court, the rationale used to overturn Roe could easily be used to undermine other fundamental rights, including the right to access contraception, and the right to marry who you love. Now, today we have heard so many misstatements and attacks on our esteemed panel of Witnesses, so I did want to give the remainder of my time, offer it to either Dr. Robinson or Professor Goodwin to correct the record and respond to any of the comments that have been made here today. Professor? Ms. Goodwin. I will start. Mr. Stanton. Please. Ms. Goodwin. Yes. Well, in the comments today there has been the suggestion that other rights such as right to contraception would not be rolled back. Here is what I want to share. Speaking on CNN on Sunday, May 8th, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves refused to rule out attempting to ban some forms of contraception if the Court overrules Roe v. Wade. In Idaho, in an interview on May 6th with the Idaho Public Television, Republican State Representative Brent Crane said he would hold hearings on legislation banning emergency contraception and abortion pills. Equally, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee signed into law additional restrictions on dispensing of abortion pills, including that medication abortion be provided by qualified physicians. We have also seen in the last week or so States like Louisiana seeking to criminalize and punish abortion as homicide, and to allow prosecutors to criminally charge patients. That is just the beginning. I could go through a list even deeper and longer than that. Mr. Stanton. Thank you so much. Dr. Robinson, do you have anything to add? Dr. Robinson. Yes. I just wanted the opportunity just to clear up the record. There has been lots of mention like, or it has been suggested that women or pregnant people are callously making the decision to just terminate their pregnancy at random points in the pregnancy. I think that as a person who provides abortion care, my patients, when they come in, it is very clear that they are very thoughtful in this decision. As we have said, many abortions do take place in the first trimester. However, abortion care needs to be accessible as a pregnancy progresses. Sometimes that may be later in the pregnancy. I know that it is hard for people to imagine those circumstances where a person may have to choose to end a pregnancy later in gestation. That is why we should leave that to the professionals, to the medical doctors, and to the patient. Then, also to suggest that we need to put restrictions in place or to keep passing bans, as if we would perform an abortion without obtaining consent. That is part of what we do as medical professionals. There is no other procedure, not even removing a toenail, that we do without obtaining proper, informed consent. There is informed decision making that goes into the care that we provide. That is taking place without representatives having to keep passing bills and putting these things in place. Mr. Stanton. Thank you. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I have one more unanimous consent. I apologize. Chair Nadler. The gentleman is recognized for one more unanimous consent request, until the next one. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you. This is a letter to the Members of the House Committee on the Judiciary from Students for Life Action. I move it into the record of the hearing. Chair Nadler. Without objection. [The information follows:] MR. JOHNSON OF LOUISIANA FOR THE RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chair Nadler. Mr. Tiffany. Mr. Tiffany. Mr. Chair, thank you very much. This is terrific that, in many ways, that we are having this hearing because this is going to be the beginning point where the American people are really going to see the details behind Roe v. Wade. They are going to see the details behind this, rather than a couple talking points, where they are going to understand, I believe, better what is all happening behind this issue. I have heard the incendiary rhetoric at times that abortions are all going to be outlawed, they are coming for you, and various things like this. I would share with you in the Wisconsin State Senate that I served in for nearly 10 years, that seven years ago we passed a 20-week bill. While I would have probably chosen to go to a little different place than a 20-week bill, that is what we passed with the consensus of the representatives of the people of the State of Wisconsin. My colleague from Arizona just cited that I come from a State that is evenly split. Well, we are the definition of an evenly split State in Wisconsin, and we came to seven years ago that we should be at 20 weeks. The most important thing is that the representatives of the people of the State of Wisconsin were debating it. So, since Roe v. Wade has happened here is what we have learned. Chair Nadler. Will the gentleman yield for a question? Mr. Tiffany. As long as you don't take any of my five minutes. Chair Nadler. It won't take me. Mr. Tiffany. Yeah, go ahead. Chair Nadler. I have been very loose with the gavel, as you may have noticed. This is the United States of America. Why should the rights of a citizen depend on which State they live in? That is my question. Mr. Tiffany. The rights of the people of the United States should be carried--those rights should be, first, they are imbued by our creator at the founding. Then it is up to the will of the people. That is what Roe circumvented. That circumvented the will of the people. It was judge-made law, not law of the people of our country. So, anyhow, if I may continue. Since Roe v. Wade, here is what we have learned. Look at these billboards that you see all across the country. At six weeks, the child has a heartbeat. They have a heartbeat in that womb. Fifteen weeks they can feel pain. We largely didn't know that, I don't think, at Roe. Some doctors may know better than I do. That is something we didn't know. The medical technology in the last 50 years is incredible what has happened that has shown us the humanity of that baby that is in the mother's womb. So, so much has changed. That is why, that is part of the reason why, I think you have seen justices come, what appears to be that they are going to come to a different conclusion here, rather than this judge-made law back in 1973. I want to share something here right now that should be deeply concerning to all of us. I hope the Chair and others on this Committee will say we cannot have this happen here in America. If you could please play some audio. What we are waiting for is audio of a message that was left at the Wisconsin Family Action Offices at Madison that, as you can see in the picture behind me, was fire-bombed shortly after the release, release of the opinion. [Audio available at https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ 0zjcb8cvvun14ei9t4fyz/2022.05.18-Tiffany-Mostly- peaceful.pptx?dl=0&rlkey=52o59zt80gy7p30gox9cn0xa6] Mr. Tiffany. I am sorry for the language that is contained in that. There were multiple messages sent in the same vein to the Wisconsin Family Action, an advocacy group that just advocates for life. This is what happened to their building. I hope the Attorney General of the United States is going to enforce the laws protecting our justices as they--people attempt to intimidate them. I hope the Attorney General protects Wisconsin Family Action as, as I hope no more groups, but a group in Madison, Wisconsin has said this is going to be the summer of rage in Madison, Wisconsin. I hope everyone rises up and says that is not acceptable in what should be normal discourse here in the United States of America. I hope the Attorney General is paying attention and he does not treat the Wisconsin Family Action Council like he treated parents before school boards here in the United States. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Tiffany. I will yield. I will yield back, Mr. Chair. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Garcia. Ms. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for your leadership in convening this, what arguably could be the most important and impactful hearing we will hold for generations to come. As a Catholic, my faith, and the love for others that we preach, I have to support the freedom for women to make a deeply personal and private decision about their own healthcare. As a Catholic and Christian, I am not one to judge, punish, or shame someone who has decided to have an abortion. As Catholics, we were taught, as Jesus did, to treat those going through uneasy times with kindness and compassion. Freedom has no gender. It is not wrapped in pink and baby blue. Freedom is for all. Government has no place in imposing itself on a woman's freedom in making her own private personal decision when it comes to her pregnancy. Abortion is healthcare. Abortion is a human right, period. The public agrees. Recent Gallup poll found 80 percent of Americans believe that abortions should be safe and legal. Washington Post similarly found 75 percent support protecting Roe. In my own district we did a text survey of over 40,000 people. Keep in mind, Mr. Chair, my district is 77 percent Latino. Forty percent--40 thousand on our text survey, 76 percent said they favored having women's rights to have a safe, legal abortion. The justices may ignore settled law, lawmakers may ignore the public, but true justice and freedom means ensuring abortion care is safe, available, and affordable for all. I would like to start with the doctor here. I had already told her I was going to ask her a question during the break. Have you heard of the Lizelle Herrera case in South Texas? Lizelle Herrera, she was a young woman whose self-induced abortion, she had some problems, went to a hospital. The hospital reported her. The D.A. charged her with murder. She had to stay two days in jail till she was bonded on a half million-dollar bond. Dr. Robinson. I am not familiar with the details of that. Ms. Garcia. Well, I bring it up because if we go, if we get rid of Roe v. Wade, which is what the goal is for the Republican Party and the extreme Supreme Court justices, and we may go to a situation where we criminalize the care that you and many provide. For instance, here the hospital was the one who reported her. In Texas' trigger law, once Roe v. Wade is overturned, within 30 days there is a complete ban. If a provider provides any services, or aids and abets, they could be charged with a felony, a felony. As a provider yourself, what do you think, what is your opinion on this criminalization of abortion care, or healthcare? Dr. Robinson. I think it is quite devastating. I think it is going to be harmful to patients. If the real goal is to protect women, this is doing exactly the opposite. It puts physicians in a situation where they are not looking out for the best interests of their patients. They are having to take their own interests, their own freedom into consideration. So, it is going to harm, it is going to harm people. Ms. Garcia. It is. Do you think it will have a chilling effect on some people, some doctors and providers, hospital workers who won't even want to provide some of the care, even in terms of emergencies? Dr. Robinson. Oh, absolutely. I am already seeing that, and we are not post-Roe yet. I have had a patient-- Ms. Garcia. Well, unfortunately, we are in Texas, as the other Witnesses pointed out, so. Dr. Robinson. You are right. That is, that is very unfortunate. Even in Alabama we are not there yet, and we have had patients that have come in who got medication that was legal for care that they needed, and their physician was unwilling to see them following taking that medication. They were afraid that they would be breaking the law. That is going to happen time and time again. Ms. Garcia. To quickly switch to the professor. Professor, you heard our governor suggest that what we need to look at now that we can overturn long, 49-year history of law, that we should look at the case that tells us in Texas and around, others around the State, country, that all children must be educated regardless of their immigration status. Here we have a White supremacist in Tennessee saying, well, if we can overturn Roe, let's overturn Brown v. Board of Education. Is that where we are going? What is next? Ms. Goodwin. What is next is that the State legislators are saying, what you have just said is what will be debated on those State legislatures and may become law. Ms. Garcia. That is most unfortunate, Mr. Chair. There is so much more I could say. I will be submitting additional questions for the record. With that, I yield back. I think my time has expired. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Bentz. Mr. Bentz. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to begin by thanking the Witnesses for participating in such a challenging hearing. This hearing is, obviously, intended to provide an opportunity for the majority to call out the Supreme Court, that is, to intimidate and bully the Court as it works to address one of the most difficult issues any judge will ever face. It is also an opportunity for all of us to ask the American people to avoid violence, and on either side, and to let the process work. This hearing today, although I wish we weren't having it based upon a leaked memo, is evidence of the process working. Now, sometimes it works slowly. It has taken 50 years for this issue to come before the Court. The process, though, does work. The Committee has engaged in a lot of discussion about we Republicans being pro-life, it is only natural that we Republicans should take this opportunity to call out exactly where the Democrats stand on the issue. I think the best means of doing that is by drawing attention to the Women's Health Protection Act. Ms. Foster, Bill Manchin said that his party's bill is not Roe v. Wade codification but, instead, a dramatic expansion of Roe v. Wade. Could you comment? Ms. Foster. That is correct. In the very same sentence where he said that he would support codification, he said that he could not support the Women's Health Protection Act, so- called, because it would so dramatically expand Roe v. Wade and the regime of legalized abortion that we have had in our nation. It would wipe out more than 500 laws protecting women and children. Mr. Bentz. It would, would it not, federalize the abortion issue, taking it away from the States and imposing, if you will, the right to abortion from the time of conception until the time of birth. Is that correct? Ms. Foster. Absolutely. Sure would. Mr. Bentz. So, there were some that suggested, even on your panel, that partial birth abortion, infanticide, just, just doesn't happen. Indeed, under that Act it would be allowed. Am I right? Ms. Foster. It would. Mr. Bentz. Can you go into more detail? Ms. Foster. Under this, under this act, under this potential law, partial birth abortion would be on the table, pretty much anything else that you can think of that we have worked for 49 years to protect in the days since Roe. We have had to enact all these hundreds of separate laws to protect women and children after Roe wiped all the abortion laws off the books in all 50 States, going beyond what any State had on the books at that time. So, this Act would go even further than that. It would force doctors to do abortions. It would allow for abortion up to the moment of birth. It would strip away any kind of informed consent protection, any kind of parental notification much less consent, any kind of health and safety standards. It goes against 50 years of conscience laws, 50 years of protections. That is what is taking us backward. Mr. Bentz. Let's make sure the record is clear. We are talking about the Women's Health Protection Act? Ms. Foster. Yes. Mr. Bentz. To make it clear again, the assertion that partial birth abortion, and even infanticide, does not occur was not recognized in that bill, in other words, is still allowed. Is that correct? Ms. Foster. It would still be allowed, yes. Mr. Bentz. Thank you. With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. Mr. Chair, thank you for holding this very urgent hearing today. To all our Witnesses, thank you for your testimony, your very powerful, moving testimony. A lot has been said today. I have a set of remarks, questions. I just want to address a few things first. The first thing is I share in the outrage of my colleague Veronica Escobar who said earlier today that what we are hearing from our Republican colleagues, this attempt to seize the bodies of women in this country, is outlandish. It would not be happening if the roles were reversed. Can you imagine trying to regulate the healthcare decisions of men in this country? I know so many guys who don't even like being told to clean up after themselves, or to turn the TV down. So, the idea that we would have this concentrated effort to legislate a ban on the ability to women to simply make decisions about their own healthcase is absurd on its face. It is, obviously, going back in time to a place where I had hoped that we had gotten past. It is something that is hypocritical because the opposite would never be allowed to take place if the shoe was on the other foot. Mr. Owens is a nice guy. Also, made some outlandish comments earlier. He leveraged the fact that he was Black to validate those comments, which was a bit disturbing for me, who is also as an African American myself. It is simply the case that if the Republican Party cared about life, my Republican colleagues would be working with me to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to end police brutality in Black communities. If the Republican Party of today cared about life, they would be working with us to extend the expanded Child Tax Credit which, for a time, cut child poverty in this country in half. If the Republican Party cared about life, it would not be actively trying to undermine or outright overturn the Affordable Care Act, which has provided high quality, affordable healthcare for tens of millions more people in this country than who had it prior to the Democratic Congress' enactment of that legislation under Barack Obama. So, I think it is important to clarify the record when it comes to these issues. Professor Goodwin, at this Committee's markup last week, and again in today's hearing, a number of my Republican colleagues celebrated the criminalization of abortion as a win for democracy. On the Supreme Court, Justice Alito even blamed the very people whose rights he intends to erase, as we saw in his draft opinion. He wrote, ``Women are not without electoral or political power.'' Professor Goodwin, in your written testimony you wrote, ``It is offensively naive to suggest that these matters can be resolved at the State level through voting, particularly when voting rights are unprotected and voter suppression dominates the political process.'' So, since my Republican colleagues don't seem to get it, would you help explain why it is so wrong for Republicans to blame women for the GOP's own war on abortion rights in light of their war on the voting rights of people of color? Thank you. Ms. Goodwin. That is right. Well, thank you so much for that question. In fact, they should not blame women. They should not be blaming women in Mississippi who, if they are Black, risk 118 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion; a State in which 80 percent of the cardiac deaths in that State during pregnancy happen to be Black women; a State that historically has disenfranchised Black people, first through enslavement and forced reproduction of Black women; and that even after the 13th Amendment enacted so many Jim Crow era laws that did not get dismantled until the mid-part of the last century; and a State that has tried with all its might to continue to suppress the right of Black people to vote. Fannie Lou Hamer famously talked about being beaten after she attempted to vote, where in the best-case scenarios Black people had to guess how many bubbles on a bar of soap and jellybeans in a jar to be able to vote. This is why this is not just Jim Crow, this is the new Jane Crow. It fails to pay any attention to the lives, historically or in the present, of Black women. That is the part of this that is absolutely shameful. Mr. Jones. Thank you for that. The nation that my Republican colleagues want is terrifying. A handful of unelected, unaccountable, far-right Supreme Court justices encouraging States to seize control of the bodies and decision-making power of women across America. Politicians forcing women to give birth. The government imprisoning patients and their doctors. Apparently, to my Republican colleagues this is what democracy looks like. I would submit that the American people know better. That is not democracy; that is servitude. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to the Witnesses today. Over the past year-and-a-half we have watched President Biden and the Democrats continually push an anti-life agenda. First, they gutted the Hyde Amendment, longstanding provision of appropriations bills that prevents taxpayer funding for abortions, and that saved an estimated two million lives. Then the Biden Administration's Department of Health and Human Services changed their rules to essentially require healthcare providers to perform abortions, despite any moral objections they may have. They have prevented the House from voting on commonsense pieces of legislation, such as Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This bill would ensure that babies who survive abortions are provided with medical care. Finally, my Democrat colleagues passed a radical bill that removed existing limits on abortion and allows abortion on demand, no matter the age of the baby. The party who once claimed that they wanted abortion to be ``safe, legal, and rare,'' now stands for abortion on demand up until birth, and funded by taxpayers. Last week, I joined my colleagues in the Wisconsin Republican Delegation in sending a letter to Attorney General Garland, calling on him to investigate the arson at the Family Action Office in Madison, of which my colleague Mr. Tiffany spoke about earlier. We need to make sure that we prevent similar attacks in the future. Rather than focusing on diffusing threats against Americans for their political beliefs, the Department has in the last 17 months been silent on, or encouraged further, partisan targeting. I myself will always push back on their anti-life stances with a clear and strong message of opposition. I have as a State legislator for 27 years. I believe that every human life is precious and should be protected at every stage. If the leaked Supreme Court opinion ends up being the final product and overturns Roe v. Wade, it would be a fantastic victory for life and for the babies. The pro-life movement has spent decades working on this movement. This is not a complete nationwide ban on abortion. Like I said, I passed hundreds of bills, pro-life bills, at the State level. Elected officials, rather than unelected judges, will set abortion policy based on where consensus is found. Babies in the womb deserve legal protection and possess the basic human right to life. Unborn children at six weeks have a heartbeat, and by 15 weeks can feel pain, and have human features such as nose, lips, and eyebrows. Even if States choose to ban abortions with limited to no exceptions, the value of human life is not determined by the circumstances of his or her conception. Abortions carried out following these horrific crimes only compound the crisis that the mother has endured. Abortion advances a cycle of violence forward on yet another innocent victim. There are two lives at stake here, not one. The pro-life movement has always been committed to serving mothers and children with pregnancy care centers and alternatives to abortion programs. Ms. Foster, even some of the most liberal constitutional scholars, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have been critical of Roe's shaky, if not nonexistent constitutional standing. Can you discuss some of the constitutional errors the Supreme Court made in the Roe and Casey cases, and how those may be corrected in the Dobbs case? Ms. Foster. Absolutely. As of July 2021, we at Americans United For Life have compiled more than 38 pages of scholarly criticism of Roe from the left and the right, explaining just how un-moored in the Constitution Roe and Casey are. We do hope that Dobbs will be the case that Casey wasn't, that it will correct the errors of not finding a right to life in the Constitution, of course, but also finding this purported right to abortion that in the decades since even the Court hasn't been able to quite get grasp of, Right? As it changed the test in the framework from Roe to Casey, and then even in the last few years with Hellerstedt and June Medical, the undue burden standard has been, has been up in the air as it has gotten pushed back and forth in the court. Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Lieu. Mr. Lieu. Thank you, Chair Nadler. I listened carefully to the stories of the Witnesses today. Thank you for your time and effort presenting. I heard Ms. Arrambide, and Dr. Robinson, and Ms. Foster, your experiences. They are all different. That is a point, isn't it? All women have different experiences. Two of you gave different testimony. Because Dr. Robinson and Ms. Arrambide, you didn't try to impose your experience on anybody else. You don't tell women to get an abortion. You don't tell them not to get an abortion. You leave that emotional, difficult, searing, nuanced, complicated, life- changing decision to the woman, to her family, to her God, and to her doctor. MAGA Republicans want to criminalize abortion. They want to take that decision away from American people. They want to put women in jail for making that decision. They want to put doctors in jail for helping women get an abortion. They want to help--anyone who wants to help a woman to get an abortion in Texas can be sued by their neighbor. This is a radical agenda. Really, the question today is not, well, I don't know, when does life begin? It is who makes that decision? Do you want MAGA politicians making that decision, or do you want the woman to make that decision in consultation with her faith, her doctor, and her family? At conception, 12 hours later it is still a single cell. Is that a human being? Is that a person? Thirty hours later it splits into two cells. Is that a human being? Is that a person? Fourty-five hours later it splits into four cells. Now, some women will decide that is a person and carry the pregnancy to term. Some will not. That should be the decision of the woman with her faith, family, and doctor, not for MAGA politicians. That is really the issue here: Whose decision is this? Is it government or is it the woman's decision in consultation with her doctor, faith, and God? I submit that it is the woman's decision because that is what the American public overwhelmingly believes. Only 28 percent support overturning Roe v. Wade. I would like to now turn to the legal issues in Roe v. Wade, specifically legal issues that one of the Supreme Court justices in their confirmation hearings misled the American public. If you look at the draft opinion, the draft opinion says Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. So, Professor Goodwin, my question to you, are the five conservative Supreme Court justices that purportedly sign on to this draft opinion, did any of them say Roe was egregiously wrong from the start in their confirmation hearing? Ms. Goodwin. No, they did not. Mr. Lieu. In fact, what did Justice Alito say? That is what he said, Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. That is what he said. Do you remember Justice Gorsuch, Professor Goodwin, saying that Roe was egregiously wrong from the start? Ms. Goodwin. No. Mr. Lieu. No. Ms. Goodwin. I do not. They did not, he did not say that. Mr. Lieu. In fact, this is actually what Justice Gorsuch said in his confirmation hearing under oath. He said, I will tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. A good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court, worthy as treatment of precedent like any other. Professor Goodwin, do you remember Brett Kavanaugh saying Roe was egregiously wrong from the start? Ms. Goodwin. No. He did not. Mr. Lieu. In fact, this is what Brett Kavanaugh said under oath to the American people and to the U.S. Senate. He said, It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. The Supreme Court has recognized the right to abortion since the 1970 Roe v. Wade case. It has reaffirmed it many times. Multiple conservative Supreme Court justices misled the American people to get power, to get confirmed. Now, you are going to have this radical decision imposed on the American people, taking away that very complicated, emotional, searing, nuanced decision from the American people. We will not let that stand. I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Neguse? Mr. Neguse. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for holding this hearing today. As we near the conclusion of this hearing, I think it would be helpful to try to recenter the conversation on what I believe is the fundamental issue that we are discussing today, which is really freedom--the freedom for a woman to make her own healthcare decisions. That freedom is really at the core issue of what we are discussing today. My friends on the other side of the aisle like to say that there is too much government regulation when it comes to public health measures, and yet, apparently, would like to regulate intimate decisions like pregnancy and deprive women of the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions--as my colleague, Representative Stanton said, the constitutional right to make an informed medical decision. Unfortunately, many Republicans have made it quite clear that, when it comes to health and medical decisions, their beliefs matter more than the families that they claim to represent. I don't want to repeat much of what--this is a long hearing, of course, and a robust debate. I thank all the Witnesses for their testimony today. I don't want to necessarily repeat the comments of my colleagues. Perhaps Mr. Johnson will engage me in a brief colloquy, as he hasn't had an opportunity to talk in quite some time. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Thank you. Mr. Neguse. I guess the question I have, my understanding-- and obviously, the leaked opinion is not--we don't know whether or not that is a final opinion or not. My understanding of your position is that you are supportive of a holding that enables the States to make determinations as to abortion regulations. Is that-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. That is right. That was the case before Roe and before 1973, that is right. Mr. Neguse. Given that, would you be supportive of a Federal abortion ban? Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. There is no right to abortion in the Constitution. It is not in the text, the structure, or the original meaning, intent, as the draft opinion points out very well. So, when a right, as you well know, when a right is not included in the Constitution, the decision, the question falls to the people. So, they should make that decision at the closest level possible, through their elected representatives. The States have that ability and did so before Roe, and that is where it will happen again. Mr. Neguse. Well, I guess, what does that mean? Does that mean yes or no on the Federal abortion ban? Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Well, there will be a lot of discussion about that, but no one has drawn that conclusion. I think, like in my State, in Louisiana, when Roe is overturned, we become a 100 percent pro-life State because we did the heavy work when I was in the legislature there, put it in the State statutes. We have a trigger clause. We admitted our constitution in 2020. So, my State and I think 18 others will have that decision resolved, and then, there will be a very robust debate in the other States. We will see what happens. Mr. Neguse. I appreciate your answer. I would say, while I appreciate your articulation of Louisiana's construction of their abortion regulations, your colleagues, many of your colleagues on your side of the aisle have been much more forward in acknowledging that they would like to see a Federal abortion ban. Maybe Dr. Robinson can help me on this point. Because I think part of what is obfuscated much of this debate is this discussion that the potential Dobbs decision would, essentially, leave this matter to the States, which obscures the reality that many Republicans, including Senator McConnell, Leader McConnell in the Senate, have left the door open to a potential Federal ban on abortion. I guess, Dr. Robinson, maybe you can expound a bit about what that would mean for States like Colorado. As you may be aware, I represent the State of Colorado. In Colorado, we have codified via State statute the right, the freedom to be able to make these healthcare decisions, as well as within the State constitution. It seems pretty clear to me--I would be interested in your thoughts--that this is not a matter that ultimately my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have any intent of leaving to the States. Dr. Robinson. From all the legislation that has been passed over the last several years since I became a provider, it looks like it is very clear that the direction that they are trying to lead us in is for there to be no access to abortion care. I am not a legal scholar. So, as legislation passes, we have to constantly rely on attorneys who can give us guidance about how we can continue to care for patients. So, my understanding is that the States that have protections in place for abortion care, then they will be overwhelmed with patients who are able to leave their communities to access care. In a State like my own in Alabama, then people will no longer have access to that care. Mr. Neguse. I think that is correct. Of course, also, if, in fact, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who believe that a Federal abortion ban should be enacted at the Federal level ultimately gain power of the Federal government, then that, of course, would be potentially a ban nationwide. I am running out of time. I will just briefly say to Dr. Robinson, I also wanted to ask you about Black maternal health. The reality in the United States, as you know, we have the highest maternal mortality rate compared with other wealthy industrialized countries. In addition, in particular, when it comes to Black women, the statistics in women of color are even worse. You, of course, are a doctor, and I know you are an expert in this area. I wonder if you might have any just final words or thoughts of wisdom as to what the Congress can do with respect to improving maternal health outcomes. Chair Nadler. The gentleman's time has expired. The Witness may answer the question. Dr. Robinson. Well, the things that we could do is that I encourage you to pass legislation that will protect access to abortion care; continue to center the people, the providers who need access to this care, and to just look at ways that we can expand access to healthcare, and not looking at--including reducing restrictions on insurance coverages for people to access the care that they need. Chair Nadler. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. Dean? Ms. Dean. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for holding this important hearing on an extraordinary question of our time. I have to thank all the Witnesses for being here, for offering your heartfelt expertise and experience, and heartfelt thoughts and courage. I am thinking a lot about our past, present, and future and paraphrasing something you are going to all be familiar with. First, they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I'm not Jewish. Then, they came for the immigrants, and I did not speak out because I was not an immigrant. Then, they came for Black people and I did not speak out because I'm not Black. Then, they came for my daughters, my granddaughters, and me, and there was no one left to speak for us. Of course, I am paraphrasing Pastor Niemoller, 1946, against the Nazi thinking and values. Yet, the argument applies today. There are so many things that Americans are at risk of losing because people are not speaking out. Republicans are targeting our right to privacy, the right to control our bodies, and it is not a new story. Let me tell you a story I have told often because I thought it was a relic, a sad relic, of the past. My mother-in-law did not know her own mother. She was the youngest of six children, born in 1930 Scranton, Catholic Scranton. Her mother became pregnant with a seventh child, and the doctors knew that the child would be stillborn and warned that the mother would likely die in childbirth. It was 1930s Scranton. The family had no choice. The mother took the stillborn baby to term. Of course, the baby was stillborn, and the mother died, orphaning six children. My mother-in-law never knew her own mother. She told that story so that it would never happen again, to warn that it must never happen again. Dr. Robinson, would it be possible that those stories of the past would become our future? Dr. Robinson. It seems quite plausible that may be the case. Ms. Dean. It scares me, I have to admit to you. What are some of the risks that women suffer right now in the not post-Roe world, although in Texas we are post-Roe in many ways? What are the risks right now that you are seeing in your practice? Dr. Robinson. One of the things that I have experienced is patients who have what we call an inevitable abortion. It is where a patient is pregnant; the cervix is open. The patient is having bleeding, but there is still cardiac activity or there is still the heartbeat of the fetus. There is difficulty in our hospital system with proceeding with care with those patients because there is still cardiac activity with the fetus. So, in those instances, we have mothers who their lives are put at risk in that situation. I have experienced it with a patient of my own, where we needed to start medication to expedite delivery, and there was refusal and a lot of back-and-forth before we could get administrative approval to move on with the care that the patient needed. That is one of the reasons why I think that we really need to look at the decision that we are making. The other side has highlighted all these dark ideas about what happens with abortion care, and they are looking at a very few examples of sometimes what sounds like it could possibly be bad medicine. Like I said, there is already legislation, there are already laws in place for that, and we should just focus on enforcing those laws, but not tie the hands of patients and providers who really just want to provide good care for their patients. Ms. Dean. Thank you for that. For those who say, ``My State is going to be all pro- life,'' I would argue with that characterization. I would say the State would become all pro-choice, the government's choice, not a woman's choice, not an individual's choice to reproductive freedom. I worry for my daughter--I have three sons--I worry for my daughters-in-law. I worry for my three granddaughters for their future, because what their future will be is not what I enjoyed--the chance for me to plan, alongside my husband, when we would have children; how many we would have; what we would be able to do with our own independent freedom, and a most personal decision, when and whether to have children. Ms. Arrambide, I thank you so much for having this conversation with us. Your courage is remarkable, and you leave here with your dignity intact, even though some of these conversations didn't leave with their dignity intact. Finally, Ms. Glenn Foster, I have compassion for you, for your continued sadness, your regret over your abortion. Thank you for sharing that story with us. It is something we all need to think about, but you had a choice. I am sorry you regret your choice. No one forced you to do what you did. You had the right to make a choice. Now, you work to impose your regret as the law of the land, banning everyone else's choice. Just to warn you--this is a comment only--this is not how our rights work. This is not how our Constitution works. Your regret is not to become a ban and the law of the land. I thank you and I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Ms. Ross? Ms. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to all the Witnesses for testifying today. We are here today to discuss one of the greatest threats to women and family that our country has seen in 50 years. If it holds, the Supreme Court's draft opinion overruling Roe will, effectively, allow States to ban abortion entirely. Denial of necessary care, including abortion, can have profound and lasting impacts on people's lives. Denial of access to abortion will be particularly harmful to women who already face disparate access to all sorts of kinds of care, including people of color, people with disabilities, people in rural areas in my State of North Carolina, and low-income people. In States like mine, we have not expanded Medicaid for more than half a million people. We already see significant disparities in who can access care and corresponding disparities in health outcomes. Women who fall into the Medicaid gap in nonexpansion States like North Carolina are frequently unable to access contraception; unable to get prenatal care and delayed in accessing care during their pregnancies. Many of these same States are also likely to enact severe abortion restrictions, if Roe is overturned. We know that forced pregnancy hurts women, threatens our physical and mental health, and restricts our economic possibilities. However, the Republicans on this Committee have shown that they don't really care about these realities or these women. I hope that they demonstrate greater capacity for understanding when they realize that this decision will have ripple effects that harm families and children by locking people into poverty and further limiting access to healthcare. My first question is for Professor Goodwin. Please explain how low-income and people of color will be prosecuted disproportionately and face greater legal risks for violating anti-abortion laws compared to those who are White and wealthy. Ms. Goodwin. Well, individuals who have greater means will be able to afford childcare, afford to be able to travel out of State, be able to have a hotel out of State, the ability to be able to get healthcare services and abortion care out of State. For individuals who happen to be poor and people of color, they are already subject to disproportionate police surveillance and surveillance by other people in society. This will only be inflamed to an even greater extent, and when abortion access is not available in their State, that will result in high rates of maternal mortality, which we already see, and also, maternal morbidity. These are people who stand the risk of being reported by medical professionals who are pressured right now to report on their patients who have miscarriages and stillbirths. That is already occurring in the United States, given this anti-abortion backdrop. Ms. Ross. Dr. Robinson, I saw you nodding when I talked about not having Medicaid expansion. I know that you practice medicine in a State that has not expanded Medicaid. Could you tell us what that failure has done to the health of women who are either seeking to have a child or may not be ready to have a child? Dr. Robinson. Thank you. Yes, I, too, live in a State that did not accept Medicaid expansion. So, as I said in my testimony, in Alabama the maternal mortality rate is five times more than that of our White counterpart, and that is higher than the national average. I think this directly corresponds to access to quality healthcare. So, with that, without taking Medicaid expansion, then my people are being harmed by this. Ms. Ross. Do you see a hypocrisy between people who would deny access to abortion care at the same time they are denying access to healthcare? Dr. Robinson. Absolutely. Ms. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, briefly, could we allow Ms. Glenn Foster to reply briefly to the very personal comments Ms. Dean directed to her. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady has yielded back. Ms. Bush? Ms. Bush. I thank you, Chair Nadler, for swiftly convening today's hearing. I am a proud mother of two beautiful children. I am also a person who terminated two unexpected pregnancies. I am here to express my unwavering support for anyone who has ever decided to terminate a pregnancy. Whether a person is seeking abortion care because they were raped, the condom broke, other birth control failed, they didn't have a reliable partner, or couldn't afford a baby, everyone needs accessible options to have an option where they live. When I was 17 years old, I was raped. Weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. Without the protections afforded to me by Roe v. Wade, I would have been forced to birth a human being that I could not take care of, and the father would have been my rapist. The emotional devastation of this encounter was traumatic. I didn't know if it was my fault. I didn't know what to do. Did I do something wrong? I hadn't consented, but I blamed myself. The stress of possibly having a child at 18 was more than I could bear. It took a full two weeks' worth of pay for me to afford an abortion--money that I sorely needed for bills for food, for my education. For physical, for spiritual, and financial reasons, I knew that this was not the right time for me to bring a life into this world. Ms. Arrambide, what has SB 8 and other abortion bans in Texas meant for low-income people of color who need abortions? Ms. Arrambide. Thank you for your question. I think like in the time before Roe, the people most impacted, especially in Texas, are the most marginalized communities. We are talking about Black communities, people of color, indigenous communities, trans and nonbinary people, people in rural communities, people that live on the fringes of society, the immigrants, the undocumented people. Their access to care has been decimated. For the rest of the people that aren't afraid to seek abortion care because the laws are so confusing or they might risk being sued, those people have had to travel, on average, about 1,300 miles, sometimes as far as 2,400 miles, to access care that should be available within their community. That affects so many people in Texas and so many people we love. We are talking about a State that has not expanded Medicaid. We are talking about a State that cut family planning; that has decimated any sort of support system for these families and people. Abortion has become practically inaccessible for the majority. Ms. Bush. Thank you for those critical insights. I remember when I earned around $7 an hour. Baby formula cost around $12 a can. I received formula through WIC, but that only lasted about two and a half weeks out of the month. That was back around 2000. Over two decades later, the cost of baby formula has increased to anywhere between--what? --$17 and $22. Yet, the Federal minimum wage hasn't changed much since 2009, and it is just $7.25. So, poverty is expensive, especially in a society that fails to invest in living wages and a strong social safety net. So, here is my message for anyone trying to take away a person's bodily autonomy: If you are for life, you will support universal paid leave. If you are for life, you would support livable wages. If you are for life, you would support affordable childcare, affordable housing, and the expansion of WIC, TANF, and SNAP programs. If you are for life, you would support policies to help children and families meet their material needs. You would support the constitutional right to abortion. Abortion care is healthcare. Let me say that again: Abortion care is healthcare, and it is imperative that we protect that right for everyone--everyone meaning all, everyone. Thank you and I yield back. Chair Nadler. The gentlelady yields back. This concludes today's hearing. We thank all the Witnesses for participating. Without objection, all Members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the Witnesses or additional materials for the record. Without objection-- Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, really quick before you adjourn, we are going to have a statement entered into the record, Ms. Glenn Foster's response to what I thought was an ad hominem attack by Ms. Dean. Chair Nadler. Fine. [The information follows:] MR.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 o'clock p.m., in room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher H. Smith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Mr. Smith. The subcommittee will come to order. Let me begin by, again, expressing my apology for the lateness of our start. We did have two votes, recorded votes. They went longer than anyone could have anticipated. For weeks this spring the world watched as Meriam Ibrahim, a pregnant Christian woman in Sudan, faced flogging and the death penalty because her government would not accept that she had lived her life as a Christian and married a Christian man. Meriam has demonstrated both courage and grace under pressure, giving birth in jail in May, while chained, and caring for her two children, including her newborn, not only under restraints but without the normal amenities that any pregnant woman and nursing mother should expect. The harsh application of Sharia law on non-Muslims was the trigger, and everyone knows this, for the two-decade-long civil war in Sudan that eventually led to the secession of the South. Sudan is one of 20 countries in the world who have laws against apostasy, defined as the abandonment by an individual of his or her original religion. In Sudan, apostasy is effectively considered leaving the Muslim faith, particularly the interpretation of Islam followed by authorities there. In Sudan, to leave the Muslim faith is an automatic death sentence. If you are considered an apostate, you cannot legally marry someone of another faith, and for this Meriam was also charged with adultery and sentenced to flogging. However, this story is not just about harshly applied religious and legal principles in violation of national and international law. Daniel Wani, Meriam's husband, is a Christian, who is a dual American and South Sudanese citizen. He has lived in the United States for more than a decade. He married Meriam in late 2011, and they had a son a year later. Somehow, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum could not find a way to help bring this American to get his family out of Sudan before the crisis developed. Even after she was arrested and released last year on charges involving apostasy. Today's hearing is intended to examine the facts as we know them and to determine how strictly applied rules almost led to the officially sanctioned beating and execution of a young woman who has lived as a Christian all of her life, but who has now been told that she has no right to choose her religious belief. This hearing was originally scheduled to take place in June, but at the urging of Sudanese officials and Mark Meadows, who has been doing yeoman's work on this issue, and some in our Government, we postponed it to allow for quiet diplomacy to take place. However, Meriam's legal entanglements seem to be increasing now rather than diminishing. We intend for this hearing to be a strong appeal to the Government of Sudan to use their legal authority to end the official entanglements Meriam has faced since her arrest in January and subsequent trial. A Sudanese court initially ruled that the mere fact that her father was Muslim means that she should have been raised as a Muslim. She was given 3 days to convert to Islam, but she told authorities she would not abandon her Christian faith. Her refusal to leave the faith she had practiced her entire life led to her being in mortal fear for her life. Fortunately, a Sudanese appeals court believed that she considered herself Christian and overturned her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges. However, members of her family, allegedly, have appealed the overturning of her conviction. Meanwhile, the Government of Sudan rearrested Meriam for using South Sudanese documents in an attempt to leave the country while she was released on bail. That case is still pending. Finally, Meriam's family has filed a case in domestic law court to establish that she is Muslim and that her brother, who was unable to prove his legal connection in the original apostasy/adultery case, should be her legal guardian under Sharia law. The hearing date for at least part of that case is currently set for August 4, because she was not given a written summons to appear at a July 17 hearing on the matter. We cannot be absolutely certain of the exact chain of events that led to this situation. The Department of State understandably decided not to testify at this particular hearing, although this will become a hearing in a series of hearings until this is resolved. Daniel and Meriam are still in Sudan at this point, and we will invite the State Department to give a full accounting and any insights they might want to provide. Daniel and Meriam are still in Sudan, as we all know, at this point. Daniel is free to leave with his children, but has chosen of course to stay with his wife until she, too, can leave with her family. Since Meriam's conviction in May, a bipartisan, bicameral congressional coalition has worked tirelessly to undo the harsh penalties for her under the apostasy and adultery laws, and to secure her family's repatriation to the U.S. Contact was made with Daniel, as well as the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, and the Sudanese Embassy right here in Washington. Eventually, the headquarters offices of both State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services got involved. You know, one wonders why this matter had to come to a crisis stage before a means could be found to avoid what now seems to have been an inevitable outcome in this case. Daniel told congressional staff that he sought help from the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, but was told that he should seek an attorney, since the situation was mostly focused on his wife who was not an American. This was the advice he received even when he was--when arrested and had his passport seized. An American citizen should expect more, I believe, from his government's representatives in a foreign country when the country's government has taken action against them. Sudanese officials do not have the right to force someone to be Muslim when they assert their beliefs to be otherwise. Under the principles of natural law, which are the basis of our governing documents and those of countries around the world, there are certain inalienable rights endowed by our Creator. The decision on how to worship our Creator is one of them. Elements in Sudan's Islamic clergy and in the government interpret the Koran, to give them license to tell people how they will live out their faith, whether they consider themselves Muslim or not. In Meriam's case, her father had been absent from her life since she was a small child. Her Christian mother raised her as a Christian. Sadly, Meriam is not the only Sudanese who chose differently on the matter of faith only to be faced with a death sentence for that choice. Sudanese activist Mahmoud Mohammed Taha was arrested and charged with apostasy in 1984 for his efforts to end Sharia law in Sudan. He was subsequently executed. In some countries, Christian converts have been forced to renounce their faith and conform to the version of Islam favored by the government of that day. Some of these countries have constitutions that ostensibly guarantee religious freedom, even as they may also have laws that actually contradict those rights. Except for Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, the other 15 countries, including Sudan, have signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing freedoms for their citizens. Article 18 of that document enshrines ``the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.'' Speaking of the rights of the individual, that article also forbids ``coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.'' Article 18 also guarantees ``the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.'' The current report by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom cites Sudan as a Country of Particular Concern due to its government's engaging in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion. According to USCIRF, Sudan is the world's most violent abuser of the right to freedom of religion or belief. Thankfully, we have the author of that law, the International Religious Freedom Act, Frank Wolf, who back in 1998 authored that landmark legislation. And today testifying we have Zuhdi Jasser from the Commission, who recommends in his testimony that not only should the U.S. Government take appropriate actions against Sudan, as detailed in IRFA, but that our Government should also make freedom of religion and human rights a centerpiece of the U.S.-Sudan bilateral relationship, as that has not been the case to date. The troubling case of Meriam Ibrahim should warn of future incidents in which those who do not believe in Islam are defined by the government, are persecuted, or placed in fear of death or torture. We, again, appeal to the Government of Sudan to use all legal means at its disposal to free her, this courageous young woman, allow her to pursue her faith and join her husband in the United States. I would like to yield to a friend and colleague, the ranking member, Ms. Bass. Ms. Bass. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership and for convening today's hearing. I would also like to thank our distinguished witnesses, and I look forward to hearing your perspective on the socio-political context in Sudan as it relates to this case, the legal framework, as well as adultery laws and information on the limitations on religious freedom. As we prepare to hear from today's witnesses, I hope we can learn critical lessons from their experiences and use them to increase awareness and support for the improved protections of human rights and religious freedom in Sudan. I am also interested in hearing an update on the case. I met not too long ago with representatives from the Embassy, and it was my understanding that this case was going to be resolved very soon. So I will be interested to hear your updates. Thank you very much. I yield back my time. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much. I would like to now yield to a gentleman on the committee, Mark Meadows. Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank each one of you for your valuable time in coming here, and I think the fundamental question for all of us is, is this a day where truly religious freedoms of all faiths are going to be upheld and valued in America? And with that, it is critical history shows us--and it is not about--just about Christian faith. It is of many faiths. History shows us that time and time again when we don't value that the outcome is tragic. And so I thank each one of you for coming today to spend your valuable time to not only continue to intercede on behalf of Meriam, but to also make it a reminder to those of us in a freedom-loving world that it is critical that we stand on those foundations of upholding religious liberty. If there are policies that we can use to go more toward valuing that, I look forward to hearing from each of you on that particular subject. I yield back, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your leadership. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Meadows. And I want to thank you for the meetings that you arranged with the Ambassador in an attempt to try to do this as efficaciously as possible, and the meeting that you did convene was I think a very important one, but still, it has not yielded the result that we are all hoping and praying for, but thank you for that leadership. Mr. Pittenger. Mr. Pittenger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to participate and for holding this hearing of such great importance. I commend you for your tireless dedication, as always. I have watched you now for the last 30 years bringing the right of freedom of religion to everyone in the world. I would also like to thank the witnesses for appearing before us today and for the dedication you have shown to defending human rights and religious freedoms, freedoms of conscience throughout the world. The case of Meriam Yahia Ibrahim Ishag is tragic, a story now, regrettably, that is being told throughout the world, she--a young woman imprisoned because she has chosen to be a believer and follower of Jesus Christ. Her punishment for following her faith, for refusing to convert to a religion she does not believe in, death by hanging. The Sudanese Government declared her marriage to a Christian man unlawful, and, therefore, convicted her of adultery, punishable by 100 lashes. Thankfully, an appellate court overruled both of these convictions, but Ms. Ishag still is not free. While trying to leave Sudan with her husband and children, one which she gave birth to while she was in prison, the family was again detained on claims of using false travel documents. Here is a family simply trying to believe in their own convictions and live out their faith, trying to practice their own religion, and this is what they have been subjected to. While Ms. Ishag's case has garnered significant media attention, we must remember that denial of the basic human right to religious freedom is not an isolated case. As members of the United States Congress, it is vital that we continue to shine light on all of the cases of injustice and for the United States to continue exerting whatever pressure we can on governments who so blatantly and obviously infringe upon those rights. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do yield back. Mr. Smith. Mr. Pittenger, thank you very much for your comments and your leadership. We now yield to Chairman Frank Wolf. And, again, he is the author of the International Religious Freedom Act, landmark legislation that finally, at long last in 1998, put religious freedom as a core element of our U.S. foreign policy. Chairman Wolf? Mr. Wolf. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for having the hearing. I think, as Mr. Pittenger said, you have probably done more than anybody else in the time that I have served here, so I want to thank you. I want to thank the witnesses. I think there are two points. I think our State Department is failing us. We have seen their lack of action on people in Korea. We have seen their lack of action with regard to people in Vietnam. We have seen their lack of action to not even visit Liu Xiaobo's house in China when he is the Nobel Prize winner, and his wife is not well, and we see the fundamental weakness. And we have also seen the failure of this administration with Pastor Abedini. I mean, Pastor Abedini and his wife, they are American citizens and we can't even get them to do anything, nor will the Secretary meet with them. So this is not a surprise. Secondly, I think I would just separate myself out from the State Department. Weakness is never good. And we are weak. We are perceived as weak. Now, I say somewhere out there--and I can almost predict who--there is a representative or two of the Sudanese Government. They are going to listen. They are going to send a message back to al-Bashir who is an indicted war criminal. Indicted war criminal. Two-point-one million people died in the North-South battle. He has blood on his hands. So this ought to be a test. If Meriam is not out in 2 or 3 weeks, the word should go out they will never be off the list. They will always be on the terrorist list. There will always be sanctions. We will bring the government down. What they are doing with the Nuba Mountains, what they are doing with regard to Darfur, they were responsible for the genocide in Darfur and it still continues today. So they are going to look to see how strong you are. One of them out there--they may have a law firm working for them, too--will come back and tell them, ``If Meriam is not out in 2 weeks, never should they ever be taken off the sanctions list.'' And we should make sure the U.N. tracks al-Bashir down when he goes to Egypt, or wherever he goes, and bring him so he goes to The Hague and stands as a criminal. And thank you for having the hearing. Mr. Smith. Chairman Wolf, thank you very much. Mr. Cotton. Mr. Cotton. Thank you, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Bass, for letting me join your subcommittee today, first off. Second off, I would like to closely associate myself with the remarks of Frank Wolf, a great champion in the United States Congress for religious liberty. It is a travesty that Meriam was detained at all in Sudan, or that her detention has continued. I agree with Mr. Wolf she should be released posthaste, if not in 2 weeks from now. But it is troubling that this is part of a pattern more broadly throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and, regrettably, all around the world. Twenty countries now have laws penalizing apostasy, and eight of those can legally impose the death penalty for apostasy, for nothing more than being a follower of Jesus Christ. I saw this kind of persecution firsthand when I was a lieutenant with the 101st Airborne in Iraq and Baghdad in 2006, Christian churches being vandalized and Christians being persecuted and driven out of their homes and neighborhoods. We see it again today in Mosul as the Islamic State is driving Christians out of that city where they have lived almost since the times of Jesus Christ. As a country that was founded by religious refugees, and for whom religious freedom is our very first freedom, it is incumbent upon us in this institution, as well as the President and the State Department, to rectify the injustice, not just when it involves Americans, like Pastor Abedini or Meriam and her family, but to the greatest extent we can all around the world. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Mr. Cotton, thank you so very much, and thank you for your extraordinary military service. I would like to now introduce our distinguished panel. We are very fortunate to have four very knowledgeable and eminent individuals to provide testimony to the committee, beginning with Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, who is a member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. He is also the founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. Dr. Jasser is a first generation American Muslim whose parents fled the oppressive Baathist regime of Syria. He earned his medical degree in the U.S. Navy, on a U.S. Navy scholarship, and served 11 years in the Navy. Dr. Jasser has testified before Congress before, including before our subcommittee, and has briefed members of the House and Senate frequently on issues related to religious freedom. We will then hear from The Honorable Tony Perkins, who is president of the Family Research Council. He is a former member of the Louisiana legislature where he served for 8 years, and he is recognized as a legislative pioneer. Since joining FRC in the fall of 2003, he has launched new initiatives to affirm and defend the Judeo-Christian values upon which this nation was founded. Tony Perkins and FRC have led the way in defending religious freedom. He hosts a daily national radio program and broadcasts a daily commentary heard on over 300 stations nationwide. His daily email update is sent to tens of thousands of individuals throughout this country and in the world. We will then hear from Ambassador Grover Joseph Rees, who has served as the first United States Ambassador to East Timor, and as Special Representative for Social Issues in the U.S. Department of State where he was responsible for promoting human dignity, including issues affecting vulnerable persons and the family within the U.N. system. He was also a senior staff member of this committee. As a matter of fact, he was general counsel and staff director, where he was responsible for human rights and refugee protection, and he played a major role in drafting an enactment of important human rights legislation including the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, International Religious Freedom Act, and the Torture Victims Relief Act. Of high significance as well, he served as general counsel of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and was extremely knowledgeable, especially in fighting against the forced repatriation of many, including the Vietnamese boat people. As a direct result of his work, some 20,000 Vietnamese who were sent back were brought to this country, were rereviewed when they were improperly screened out as refugees. So I want to publicly acknowledge the extraordinary work that he did to ensure the safe immigration of those people, those Vietnamese boat people, to the United States. And, finally, we will hear from Mr. Omer Ismail, who was born in the Darfur region of Sudan and spent over 20 years working both independently and with international organizations on relief efforts in human rights. He fled Sudan in 1989 as a result of his political views and helped found the Sudan Democratic Forum, a think-tank of Sudanese intellectuals working for the advancement of democracy in Sudan. In addition, he co-founded the Darfur Peace and Development Organization to raise awareness about the crisis in this troubled region. He currently works as policy advisor to several agencies working in crisis management and conflict resolution in Africa. Thank you as well for your leadership and for being here. I would like to begin with Dr. Jasser. STATEMENT OF ZUHDI JASSER, M.D., COMMISSIONER, UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Dr. Jasser. Thank you, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Bass, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the extremely troubling case of Meriam Ibrahim. I ask that my written testimony be submitted for the record. Mr. Smith. Without objection, so ordered. Dr. Jasser. Meriam Ibrahim's case must--must continue to draw international attention until she and her family leave Sudan for freedom in the United States. Even then, the international community must continue to focus on Sudan, because while Meriam's case is among the most egregious, it is only the latest example of the Sudanese Government's deplorable religious freedom and human rights record. It is simply the tip of the iceberg, as we have heard from many of your comments. This record has earned Sudan a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designation since 1999 from not only our commission but also from the State Department. The government imposes a restrictive interpretation of Sharia law on Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and charges individuals with the capital crime of apostasy, flogging Sudanese for undefined acts of indecency and immorality, and arrests, threatens, harasses, and discriminates against Christians and others with minority views. These religious freedom violations, along with the violence in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur, derive from President al-Bashir's policy of Islamization and Arabization. Meriam's ordeal began with her February 17 arrest--here is a picture of her from before her arrest. At that time, her brother reported to the police that she had left Islam to marry a Christian man, a capital crime in Sudan. The Sudanese Government's application of Sharia law prohibits a Muslim woman from marrying a Christian man. However, while Meriam was born to a Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother, her father left the family when she was six, and she was essentially raised a Christian. Meriam was convicted on May 15 of apostasy and sentenced to death by hanging. Because the court did not recognize her marriage, she was also found guilty of adultery and sentenced to 100 lashes. While imprisoned, Meriam gave birth on May 27 to her baby daughter, who was detained with her and her 2-year-old son. On June 23, an appeals court cancelled the apostasy charges and death sentence, most likely due to the international attention that many of you and others have brought, and ordered her release from prison. She and her family then were detained on June 24, a day later, in Khartoum's airport when they sought to leave the country, after which she was held with her family at a police station, and then arrested again on document fraud charges. Since June 27, she and her family now remain in Sudan, safely, as the Sudanese Government continues to block their departure from the country. On July 17, Meriam's brother, alleged brother, challenged the appeal that had overturned her apostasy and adultery convictions. The Sudanese Supreme Court has up to 3 months to review the brother's court action. And that is her current status. Meriam's ordeal reflects more deeply the Sudanese Government's enforcement of a rigid ideology against Sudan's religiously diverse population, particularly non-conforming Muslims and Christians. As detailed in our commission's November 13 policy brief, which we have available in the back-- I request that that also be submitted for the record. Mr. Smith. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Dr. Jasser. Thank you. The Sudanese Government has implemented Sharia law for more than 30 years, with the 1991 Criminal Code Act being the cornerstone of that implementation. The Act addresses offenses that violate public order and carry the death sentence for apostasy, stoning for adultery, prison sentences for blasphemy, and floggings for undefined offenses of honor, reputation, and public morality. Since 2011, there has been an alarming increase in the number of persons arrested and found guilty of what are called hudood offenses, with the most dramatic increase in the number of those such as Meriam arrested for apostasy, carrying an automatic death sentence. For example, in the past 3 years alone, more than 170 persons have been arrested, the majority of whom practice a version of Islam which differs from that of the ruling National Congress Party of al-Bashir. Government pressure on Christians in Sudan has also increased since South Sudan's 2011 independence, with the government announcing in July that it no longer would issue any permits--this is just a few weeks ago--for new church buildings. In the last several years, at least 11 churches have been attacked and others threatened. Individual Christians have also been arrested, threatened, and harassed, in Nuba, and South Sudanese Christians continue to be arrested and deported. The Sudanese Government also discriminates against its minority Christian community by promoting conversion openly to Islam, prohibiting foreign church officials from traveling outside Khartoum, using school textbooks that negatively stereotype non-Muslims, and giving preferential treatment to Muslims in employment and services and in court cases involving Muslims against non-Muslims. So what can we do? Meriam's case underscores the need for the U.S. Government to do the following. First, we need to continue to advocate tirelessly for Meriam and her family to immediately leave Sudan and that all charges against her be dropped, and all prisoners who have been jailed on account of their religion or belief also be released and the charges against them be dropped. Second, we need to redesignate Sudan as a CPC and take appropriate actions that follow thereof. We also need to make religious freedom and human rights a centerpiece of the U.S.- Sudan bilateral relations, and take the conversation beyond simply being the issue of violence. We need to press the Sudanese Government to engage in an inclusive and transparent constitution drafting convention. We also need to require before normalizing relations or lifting sanctions, that the Sudanese Government abide by international standards of freedom of religion and belief. And we must also support all those civil society groups monitoring the implementation of the public order laws and advocate for their immediate repeal. We must hold the Sudanese Government accountable to protect and respect freedom of religion or belief, not only for Meriam Ibrahim but for all Sudanese. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Jasser follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Dr. Jasser, thank you very much for your testimony. The Honorable Tony Perkins. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE TONY PERKINS, PRESIDENT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL Mr. Perkins. Thank you, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Bass, and members of the subcommittee. I want to thank you for not only the opportunity to address the situation of Meriam Ibrahim, but also for the work that this subcommittee has done on religious liberty around the world. And with that, I want to briefly address the broader issue of religious liberty internationally. I would like to address the why and the how. First is the why. Now, I am here, as many have tracked the media reports that have been out there, some accurate, some not. I have worked with members of this committee, other Members of Congress, and I have also engaged in conversations, ongoing conversations, with Sudanese officials. The why we are here I think is very clear. We are here because of the courage of a 27-year-old mother, a 27-year-old mother. If you will, just for a moment, imagine the situation in a prison in Khartoum which the U.N. says has an infant mortality rate of one child a day dying in that prison. At her side, 8 months pregnant, is a 20-month-old boy, and she is told that if she will denounce her faith in Jesus Christ, there is the door, you can be a free person. But, yet, she refused to denounce her faith because she had the courage to stare death in the face. What has America done? Where is the courage in America to speak out for those who are suffering at the hands of dictators who refuse to recognize not an American right, but a human right? A human right of religious freedom, to determine the destiny of one's own life, to live your life according to your own conviction and your faith. Why the silence in America? Now, you might be tempted to say, ``Well, this is just one case. Why the big deal?'' This is not an isolated case, as Dr. Jasser said, but just in April another individual who the attorneys have asked that the name not be used, was detained under the same charges of apostasy and facing the same possible outcome. We also have to consider Daniel, her husband, American husband that has been referenced here, a man who is bound to a wheelchair, who was powerless to do anything to secure the freedom of his wife and his children, and yet he went to the State Department waiting for them to act on behalf of his children and his wife, and there was silence until just recently. Now, while other governments have called attention to Meriam's situation, including the European Parliament passing a resolution, and the British Government's Prime Minister speaking publicly, as I said, the U.S. Government has been practically mute. Even after multiple activist organizations initiated petitions with hundreds of thousands of signatures, the U.S. Government's disinterest in the plight of an American and his family is simply indefensible. And, of course, we do this ignoring the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which states that ``It shall be the policy of the United States to condemn violations of religious freedom and to promote and to assist other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to freedom of religion.'' The United States has clearly failed to adequately condemn this violation or to speak out clearly and with conviction and courage on behalf of Meriam. Religious freedom is increasingly under attack around the world today. According to Pew Research Center, as of 2012, Christians continue to be harassed in more countries than those of any other faith, Muslims not far behind. Religious freedom is a fundamental inherent in international human right. Yes, it is a core American ideal, an ideal that we should defend at home and abroad. And a warning should be sounded across America that an indifference to religious persecution abroad can only lead to greater religious intolerance here at home. Now, the binding International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which there has been a reference to, ICCPR, explicitly states, ``Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or a belief of his choice and freedom, either individually or in community with others in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.'' And that is binding. U.S. inaction overseas is all the more troubling when U.S. citizens are involved as has been referenced, such as Daniel Wani, Pastor Saeed Abedini detained in Iran, and Kenneth Bae in North Korea. And I want to point out the U.S. indifference to religious hostility is not limited by political party. It was under the George W. Bush administration's allowance of blasphemy laws under the new Afghan constitution that almost led to the execution of Abdul Rahman, a Muslim convert to Christianity, who only escaped with the assistance of the U.N. when he was offered asylum in Italy. It is difficult to look at these facts and not understand them in light of the current administration's unilateral reinterpretation of religious freedom domestically. This administration believes religious belief should be quarantined to private spaces and excluded from the public space. This truncated view of religious freedom domestically, more accurately described as the freedom of worship, is matched by the administration's failure to even address the growing threats to religious freedom internationally. Indeed, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry only commented on Meriam Ibrahim's case after international outcry over her plight made it impossible for them to remain silent. Now, there is more reasons we should be involved and concerned about religious freedom. There is a growing body of research that points to nations that protect religious freedom as nations that have freer economic markets, and, therefore, greater economic stability and prosperity. This religious intolerance, as evidenced in Sudan, must be condemned in its own right, yet such intolerance is also harmful because it stifles economic growth in countries that need economic growth greatly. In turn, the lack of economic growth fosters instability and a lack of security. There is the why. What is the how? Religious freedom should be a central priority in U.S. diplomatic and strategic engagement worldwide in order to promote freedom for its own sake as well as for reasons of global stability and security. The U.S. and this committee must seriously consider making human rights and religious freedom a central component of U.S. international aid contributions. In short, promoting religious freedom promotes societal well-being at home and abroad. We must--in this particular case, the administration should specifically work to ensure Meriam's children are immediately granted U.S. citizenship as all of the proper documents have been submitted and continue to provide Meriam and her family physical protection while they are in Sudan. Their lives are at risk. Provide Meriam and her family the proper medical care. There are reports that the child, Maya, was injured at birth. We need to make sure that they have the proper medical care. And then we must pressure the Sudanese Government to ensure that legal proceedings conclude quickly, as in yesterday. And then, secondly, we must urge Congress to pass H. Res. 601, the Trent Franks resolution that condemns the treatment of Meriam Ibrahim and pressures the administration to act in accordance with the United States' responsibility to be a strong advocate for religious freedom generally, and Meriam specifically. It was Meriam's courage that brought us here today. Now, it is our turn to act with courage to bring Meriam and her family to America. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Perkins follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Thank you so very much, Mr. Perkins, for your testimony. Ambassador Rees? STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE GROVER JOSEPH REES (FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL, U.S. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE) Ambassador Rees. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Madam Ranking Member, and members of the subcommittee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify at this timely and important hearing, and I am very honored to be on a panel with these extremely distinguished and dedicated witnesses. Thank you. I have been asked to testify on a narrow question about the citizenship of the two children. Whether the two children of Meriam Ibrahim and Daniel Wani are United States citizens who should be given appropriate documentation of their citizenship, and who should be afforded such protection and assistance as the Government of the United States typically gives its citizens who are residing or visiting in other countries. Now, United States citizenship law with respect to children born overseas to a United States citizen is fairly straightforward. Section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides in pertinent part that when a child is born outside the United States and its possessions to parents one of whom is a United States citizen and the other of whom is a foreign national, the child is a citizen at birth, provided that the U.S. citizen parent has lived in the United States for at least 5 years before the birth and that 2 of those years were after the parent had reached the age of 14. Looking at the facts of the case, which have been set forth by other witnesses, and lining them up against the law, it seems pretty clear that these two children are United States citizens and should be certified as such. The two parents were married at the time of both births. Mr. Wani is listed on the birth certificate of Martin, the oldest child, as the father. There is as yet, I understand, no birth certificate for Maya, who was born while her mother was in prison. But there is no reason to think that anyone else will be put as the--will be listed as the father on that birth certificate. It would seem that the application for a Certificate of Citizenship or for a Report of Consular Birth Overseas should have been granted, yet Mr. Wani says it wasn't. Importantly, by the way, Section 309 of the Immigration and Nationality Act sets forth some additional requirements for children born out of wedlock. If the parents are not married at the time of the birth, there has to be ``clear and convincing evidence'' of the blood relationship between the child and the United States citizen parent. Importantly, that provision does not apply to children who were born of a marriage of the parents. And yet Mr. Wani says that he has been asked to provide a DNA test. So what it looks like is that the State Department is applying the test--the consular officer in question is applying the test that the statute provides for out-of-wedlock births instead of the one that is provided for children born in marriage. Now, some supporters of Mrs. Ibrahim have said that this must mean that our Government is applying Sharia law to the case, because if the law is--if the marriage is not recognized under Sudanese law, then they are not married, and he would have to meet the test of blood relationship by clear and convincing evidence, and perhaps a DNA test would be appropriate. I can't say that is not what the consular officer was thinking. I don't know. But I think that unfortunately this may be indicative of a broader attitude, a broader culture of negativity and denial, that many of us who work in the immigration and citizenship area have encountered not only in this case, not only in cases involving Sudan or involving Christians, but in cases across the board and around the world. I am an alumnus of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and I worked with many fine and conscientious people. But we often had to confront this idea that our job was to turn everybody down and then somebody would straighten it out later on if we were wrong. I later learned working with the--I used to say we either needed to change our attitude or we needed to change the sign on the door to say ``Anti-Immigration and Naturalization Service.'' And I later learned working for the State Department and working for this committee that that culture of denial is even more robust, unfortunately, in the consular corps than in the Immigration Service. This doesn't happen because consular officers or immigration officers are bad people. Most of them are fine and decent and conscientious people. It happens partly because they really do encounter fraud. They really do encounter frivolous applications. And we all know the adage ``Once bitten, twice shy.'' I think a corollary of that is that if you are bitten four or five times you are probably shy the rest of your life. Consular officers also work typically in--a lot of what they do involves non-immigrant visas. And for non-immigrant visas, tourist visas, visitor visas, the law says that you are presumed to be an intending immigrant. That is, you are presumed to be lying until you can prove to the satisfaction of the officer that you really will return to your home country according to the terms of your visa. Now, the problem is that a lot of consular officers seem to carry over that extreme skepticism which is required by law in some cases to cases where the law doesn't require it, including the provision of documentation and other consular services to United States citizens. Now, I want to suggest--in my written testimony, which I hope will be accepted for the record, I have given some specific language in the Foreign Affairs Manual that seems to encourage consular officers in this attitude that somehow citizenship is a benefit that they are conferring, and that they have discretion, and that they ought to do the same kind of investigation in a case involving a married couple, a child of a married couple, as they would in an out-of-wedlock case under the statute. I do want to say that it is possible that the facts of the case--there could be facts known to the consular officer that would justify requiring further evidence, not just the fact that the parents were married and that the father is on the birth certificate. For instance, if Mr. Wani's passport showed that he hadn't been in Sudan at any relevant time when the child could have been conceived, then it would be reasonable to ask for more evidence. That is not what Mr. Wani said happened. He says that from the very beginning when he approached the consular officer he was told ``I don't have time.'' He said that the consular officer was rude and high-handed. If that happened, it was a violation of the law. When a consular officer denies a visa to somebody who is eligible for that visa, that might be bad policy. That might be a bad decision. But that is within the discretion of the consular officer. But citizenship is not a benefit. The consular officer isn't making you a citizen by giving you the certificate. You either are or you are not a citizen. And if a consular officer denies the appropriate documentation, appropriate assistance and protection, to a United States citizen, he or she is not just making bad policy, not just making a bad decision, he or she is violating the law. I am happy to say that the State Department--that I am proud of our Government, that in the last few weeks they seem to be making amends. They seem to be providing Mrs. Ibrahim and her family with the appropriate attention and care and are really working to solve this case. It is nice to know that first principles can sometimes trump institutional cultures and institutional concerns. In this case, the principle is that we Americans do not leave our own in harm's way. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Rees follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Ambassador Rees, thank you very much. And without objection, the additional information you would like to make a part of the record is so ordered. Mr. Ismail. STATEMENT OF MR. OMER ISMAIL, SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR, ENOUGH PROJECT Mr. Ismail. Thank you, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Bass, and honorable members. I am honored to be here to appear before you to testify in this important case of Meriam Ibrahim, and I kindly request that my testimony be included in the record. My testimony is going to focus on showing that this is not an isolated case. The case of Meriam Ibrahim is not an isolated case. It is a pattern of behavior that the Government of Sudan has demonstrated through the years. Ten years ago yesterday, the United States Congress determined that the violence that plagued the Darfur region of Sudan is a genocide perpetrated by the country's own government. The brutal Janjaweed militia that is recruited, armed, and financed by the Government of Sudan rode through the villages terrorizing civilians, raping women, burning homes and markets, and destroying the livelihood of a great number of communities. That same tyrannical government is persecuting Meriam Ibrahim and sentenced her to death by hanging because of her religious convictions. The Government of Sudan is the main perpetrator and culprit in the violence across Sudan that is visited on millions of Sudanese who this government considers enemies for no other reason than being different from the image it sponsors. This government flaunts a brand of Islam and promotes a racial identity that is exclusive and divisive and met with widespread rejection and resistance among the majority of the Sudanese people. According to credible reports, Meriam Ibrahim was born to a Muslim father and a Christian mother, and she chose to be Christian. Meriam would not be considered a criminal in any democratic society that respects human rights because she would have the right to choose her religion and her life. The Government of Sudan, however, not only ignores its citizens' human rights, it disrespects its own constitution and the laws drawn from it. According to the Sudanese Interim National Constitute of 2005, and I quote, ``Every person shall have the right to the freedom of religious creed and worship.'' In practice, the Government of Sudan does anything but adhere to its own contract with the Sudanese people. Shortly after the secession of the South of the country from the motherland became inevitable, President al-Bashir declared in Al-Gadarif in eastern Sudan in 2010 that Sudan would become a country ``with no racial or religious diversity.'' Successive events that took place thereafter proved that this statement was not a slip of the tongue but a government policy that spares no one who opposes it. The issue of racial diversity was dealt with by continuing the raging war in the periphery that, in addition to Darfur, witnessed unprecedented violence in the Nuba Mountains and South Blue Nile in addition to callously questioning dissent in the urban centers by killing students in cold blood and committing widespread rape and torture. The violence has led to hundreds of thousands of displaced, in addition to refugees that have fled to the neighboring countries, including the restive South Sudan. Food is used as a weapon of war, and the fate of close to 1 million Muslims, Christians, and practitioners of indigenous religions and other faiths is in jeopardy. The genocidal regime in Khartoum was not satisfied with the social engineering that it ushered in to distort the ethnic composition of the country, but it coupled that with a no less lethal policy of religious intolerance. In April 2012, an old church in the outskirts of Khartoum was burned down to the ground by a mob of supporters of an Islamic cleric who is a member of the government appointed Islamic Ulama Council. In addition, many Sudanese Christians complain about discrimination in getting jobs or in the workplace when they are employed, in addition to a general atmosphere of intimidation and intolerance. In academia, staunch fundamentalists were appointed to the faculty of the universities and devised syllabi to indoctrinate the students, and they banned all opposing activities in the schools. Furthermore, the State of Khartoum issued a decree banning all building permits for new churches and Christian schools, claiming that the capacity of the existing churches and schools is more than enough to serve the Christian minority of 3 percent of the population. This figure was not supported by any census or any credible statistics. In the areas of the Nuba Mountains and the South Blue Nile, mosques, as well as churches, and the limited number of hospitals, are subject to indiscriminate bombing that is meant to scare civilians and drive them into the horrors of displacement. The government authorities and the security apparatus are used to harass people of different faiths other than Islam through intimidation and terror. The case of Meriam Ibrahim has backfired by making citizens more aware of the extent of the callous behavior that the government is willing to carry out in order to achieve its objective of remaining in power at any cost. Her case is also serving as a wakeup call to all peace-loving nations that this regime should be dealt with in a manner that will force it to alter its behavior. In conclusion, I respectfully ask this honorable institution, which represents the American people, to support the moderate Sudanese opposition that is working diligently for the democratization and the respect for human rights. The Sudanese Muslims and Christians and practitioners of other faiths deserve to live in peace among themselves and with other fellow human beings. History will look kindly at those who help them live in dignity and with the most sacred value of all, freedom. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Ismail follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Mr. Ismail, thank you very much. My understanding, Ambassador Rees, you will have to leave at 4:00? Ambassador Rees. My plane is running late, so I can leave a little bit after that. Thank you. Mr. Smith. That is great. Thank you. Let me just begin with a couple of opening questions, and then yield to my colleagues. First, as you said, Ambassador Rees, in your statement, in a CNN interview dated May 30, an interview of Daniel Wani by Nina Elbagir. This is Mr. Wani speaking in response to a question, ``Sadly, it is not the U.S. Government. When the problem began, the U.S. consul here had a very negative position on this. She was very high-handed. She was very, very rude. She said, and I quote, `I don't have the time.' '' If you could perhaps elaborate on this culture of denial that you mentioned earlier, because this has been a systemic problem that I and you, when you served as staff director for this committee and I have been in Congress now for 34 years, all over the world we encounter this, and I will give you a few examples. Tony Perkins mentioned Saeed Abedini. Saeed Abedini's wife, Nagmeh, was originally told, ``There is nothing we can do.'' Frank Wolf convened a hearing of the Lantos Commission and passionately called on the State Department and Secretary Kerry, and then they said that they will raise it, and Secretary Kerry did issue a statement. When Nagmeh came here, she was still bewildered by the lack of engagement on the part of the U.S. Government on behalf of this American being held by the Iranians. As we hold nuclear talks, human rights fell off the page, if you will. Chen Guangcheng, there were four hearings on Chen Guangcheng, and he was given back to the Chinese secret police under guard in a ``hospital'' where he could not leave, and there was an unbelievably porous assurance that Chen Guangcheng would be okay. That is what we were told. Thankfully, he testified by way of a phone call and said, ``I want to come to America,'' and 6 hours later that permission was granted. And we had more press here than I have ever seen before and that helped his case. I had a couple of my constituents stuck in Abkhazia as well as in South Ossetia, so I went there. And I found out, to my shock and dismay, that the Consul General had said that this marriage, purported marriage, of an American who used to be a guard at the White House, so he had to be vetted quite effectively, and he was telling the truth, and this woman who was of Georgian origin was bogus, and, therefore, the little child who was in Abkhazia was stuck and literally was prostrate as Russian tanks went through her town, and obviously everybody was scared to death something might happen to her. And then, finally, Jacob Ostreicher, we have had several hearings on Jacob. He is finally out because of a private extradition effort, or an effort to ferry him out of the country by way of an automobile. At first we were told, and I was told this directly by the Embassy and by top people in the State Department, at his request I asked this question: If Jacob goes to the Embassy, will he be welcomed? Because he felt his life was in dire jeopardy. He even had for a while Venezuelan guards, of all things, guarding him when he was in the hospital. They said, ``We will put him out the door.'' I made that phone call myself and heard that and just said, ``Are you kidding?'' An American? I mean, we are supposed to be the oasis. So, Mr. Ambassador, if you could speak to this culture perhaps a little bit more, because I think there needs to be a sea-change of attitude, which, again, the IRFA bill, the religious freedom bill, was supposed to do about religious freedom. Part of that legislation had text in it about training Foreign Service Officers to understand the importance and centrality of religious freedom, and that trading has been very slight all these years. So if you could answer that question, I would appreciate it. Ambassador Rees. Well, Mr. Chairman, there are at least three things going on. One of them I have already spoken to, which is that you do get fraudulent applications, you do get frivolous applications. We are not supposed to grant those applications. And perhaps there is a natural human tendency when you have been snookered a couple of times to assume that the snookering level is 99 percent instead of some lower number, and that is just an occupational hazard of these kinds of jobs. A second--but we have all seen people in customer service jobs, which is what this is, who frankly have outlived their usefulness on those jobs and ought to go find other jobs. And so I think we do need to try to inoculate people against that tendency to deny good cases simply because some cases are fraudulent. And that is particularly true where you are dealing with people who may well be American citizens. The second thing has to do with the institutional culture of the State Department itself, broader than just consular officers. The State Department is a foreign ministry. A foreign ministry's main job is to deal with governments. With other foreign ministries, with governments of other countries. And these kinds of issues, these humanitarian issues, these human rights issues, these refugee issues, they complicate what many Foreign Service Officers see as their main job, which is to improve the relationship between the United States and that other government. Now, I am not suggesting that they are simplistic or one dimensional. Everybody knows that we have to pay attention to those other issues. But I don't think that the natural reaction of somebody who has to go deal with the foreign ministry in the country that he is living in every day, when he hears about a Meriam Ibrahim case, he is not going to say, ``Oh, boy, a chance to strike a blow for human freedom.'' He might understand that is his duty. We hope he does. But it is not something that makes the State Department's life easier. The third thing with these high profile cases where Members of Congress involved is--as you know, I have seen it from both sides. I worked in Congress, I worked in the State Department. The executive branch in general, and the State Department in particular, hate to be told what to do by Congress. And so there is this faux integrity that gets built up, that we are not going to be politically influenced, we are going to do what we would have done anyway. Now, I don't want to say that happens all the time, and I do have to say, as I said in my testimony, that there are many fine and decent and conscientious people in the State Department, that many of them do the right thing even if it hurts their career. But I do think that institutions have institutional cultures, and that there are some of those tendencies that we need to fight. Mr. Smith. If you could answer that as well, but you mentioned, Dr. Jasser, about no CPCs, the fact that they have not been redesignated. And Robbie George, who was then the chairman of USCIRF, and now Katrina Lantos Swett has taken over that leadership as chairman, no CPCs have been named since 2011, which I think is a huge abrogation of duty on behalf of the administration. Hopefully, they will do it soon and do it robustly, including all of those countries that need to be so named. But I think if you could speak to whether or not that sends a message to countries that are committing egregious violations of religious freedom, when we don't even do the designations anymore. Dr. Jasser. Thank you, Chairman Smith, and that really was the followup to Ambassador Rees' comments, is that, you know, we started a program on prisoners of conscience, that various members have adopted, if you will, various prisoners across the spectrum in many different countries because these cases, like Meriam Ibrahim, are emblematic of deeper problems typically, not only in Sudan but in every one of these countries where prisoners of freedom of conscience, of faith, belief, that are in prison simply because of their belief are a sign typically of more systematic, egregious, and ongoing violations of religious freedom and human rights related to that. So as a result, that is why you make the connection between these prisoners. And when we defend them, when our President, when our State Department, our Embassies defend these prisoners and say that we want them released and freed, it then sends a message that our freedoms that we defend at home, and our International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, actually means something. And we have been concerned at the Commission that there has been a stagnation, and there has been no designations of CPCs since 2011. The lists, while there is no disparity on Sudan, we have-- both the State Department and our commission agrees that they are a CPC, they have not redesignated them since 2011, and we hope that when their report comes out they follow that quickly with a designation. So it is important that when these designations are made it sends the message that we believe that there is egregious and ongoing violations, and, as a result, it carries with it the sanctions that the law--the statute provides. And I think that is how we translate the plight of people like the brave and courageous people like Meriam Ibrahim that get translated into a process and policy that means that, then, religious freedom becomes the centerpiece. And most studies have shown recently repeatedly that countries that honor these principles then become more successful economically and more secure and less threats of terrorism and regionally become better actors in the world. So this is why I think it is very important that this be highlighted, and they have not do so. And we hope--their report is supposed to be coming out this week. I think it has been delayed again, and hopefully it will be followed by a redesignation of Sudan and other countries. Mr. Smith. I have some additional questions for Tony Perkins and Mr. Ismail, and I will go back to that in the second round. I would like to yield to Ms. Bass. Ms. Bass. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to get a sense from the panel how widespread they think apostasy is in countries, one, where we are in conflict with, but also in countries where we are allied. And if you could respond to that, any of the panelists, I am not sure which one of you might know. Dr. Jasser. Thank you, Ranking Member Bass. You know, the issue of the implementation, as our report on Sudan talks about, typically what happens with countries that enact more draconian forms of Sharia law, apostasy violations become a central part of that as we saw in Afghanistan and in Pakistan and in other countries in which the restriction upon the implementation of religious freedom is based upon one of the red flags for the government being that if somebody leaves his or her faith, and apostasy being one of those, but typically it is not isolated. We see the cries of apostasy, if you look at Raef Badawi in Saudi Arabia, he is a Muslim who reports being a Muslim and yet he is in jail on a crime of apostasy because the version of Islam that he defended was not one in line with the Saudi Government. So typically where you see governments like Saudi Arabia or Iran or Sudan that implement draconian, more restrictive forms of Sharia, apostasy is often one of the centerpieces, but linked to apostasy, then, are blasphemy laws that the government controls free speech with and then crimes against especially women, controlling their ability for dress and expression and property. All of that follows the whole implementation of Sharia if you will. Ms. Bass. So do any of the panelists know exactly what her situation is right now? I mean, I realize she is still incarcerated, but the Embassy says that there is supposed to be a hearing, it is supposed to be an expedited process. Now, I heard that a few weeks ago. Obviously, it is not that much expedited, but I wanted to know if any of you had information on her exact status now. Mr. Perkins. The information is not completely reliable. As the press reports one thing, Sudanese officials say something else, and we often find the two are in conflict. But she is in a safe house overseen by---- Ms. Bass. Is she under house arrest, is that what it is? Mr. Perkins. She is not under house arrest. She is actually under the watch care of the U.S. Embassy. Ms. Bass. Oh. Mr. Perkins. And so she has been released from incarceration. When she was seeking to leave the country---- Ms. Bass. Right. Mr. Perkins [continuing]. And detain, she was detained for a few days in the police station, then released. They had a bond and she was released, and she has been released to the custody of the oversight of U.S. officials. So she is safe at present, as long as she stays where she is. If she moves off of the property where she is currently residing, there is concern for her safety. Ms. Bass. Why can't she leave the country? I mean---- Mr. Perkins. They have not issued her documents in order for her to leave. Ms. Bass. Her Sudanese passport? Mr. Perkins. Correct. Ms. Bass. Was it correct that she was detained because she had a South Sudanese passport? Mr. Perkins. That is correct information based--that is correct based on the information we have. Ms. Bass. And do we know where she got that from, why she-- -- Mr. Perkins. From the South Sudanese Embassy. Ms. Bass. You look like you want to respond. Mr. Rees looks like he wants to say something. Ambassador Rees. Well, I don't--I am not sure it was a passport. My reading of--I am just reading the same news reports everyone else is. My reading is it was probably a travel document issued by the Government of South Sudan, because Mr. Wani, who is an American citizen, has dual citizenship---- Ms. Bass. I see. Ambassador Rees [continuing]. With South Sudan. And we, the United States, issue travel documents to people who are not citizens. We issue them, for instance, to lawful permanent residents, and it was probably a document like that. Ms. Bass. So at this point, what do you think--again, any of the panelists--what do you think that we could do to be concrete and helpful in this situation now, as it stands now? I am not talking about the broader picture but just in terms of her and getting her out of the country. Mr. Ismail? Mr. Ismail. Thank you, Madam Ranking Member. I think the pressure should continue on the Government of Sudan to release her, because being there is not serving the purpose of anybody. And uniting with her family in the place that she wants to travel to is a right of all Sudanese people, and she should exercise that right. And she should be given what is called an exit visa out of Sudan, and she is free to go to the destination of her choice. I think without that pressure her situation is going to be in jeopardy, and we don't know, because the Government of Sudan also is under pressure from some of the fundamentalist constituencies. And I would say they brought it on themselves, because it would have been one of the many, many, many cases that our normal everyday people go to court, but they made a political issue out of it. And now it backfires and the fundamentalist constituency of the government is pushing them, and they are saying, ``You shouldn't release this woman because this is a clear case of apostasy and we want to prosecute her.'' The government, I don't think they are interested, but also I believe there are some elements inside the government, because the government is now really not in control of everything. I believe there are some elements inside the government want to get some mileage out of this. At the end of the day, ``Here, the United States, we release this person to you. What is in it for us?'' And so it becomes, you know, kind of a quid pro quo of some sort. So that is also a possibility, but I think it is not serving the larger purpose of the bad rap that the government has got---- Ms. Bass. Thank you. Mr. Ismail [continuing]. As a result of this case. Ms. Bass. Thank you very much. Mr. Meadows. I thank the ranking member. I thank each of you. I am going to follow up with a few questions and would like for you to comment on this. Many people, at times, think that the voice to free people like Meriam and her family is just silent; they are just a few people, it is a few activists here or there. Mr. Perkins, would you say that--could you comment on just what you are hearing from either your listeners or people that are contacting you from the American people? Can you give us a sense of what you are hearing? Mr. Perkins. Congressman Meadows, I think the--what we have actually seen internationally from Great Britain and how this was really a front page story, and leading to the Prime Minister making statements on it, is more reflective, really, of where the American public is on this issue as we have seen hundreds of thousands, there was a White House petition that garnered over 50,000 people that signed that in a very short window of time, that are concerned about this. I think people recognize that there is a correlation between religious persecution abroad and the growing religious intolerance here at home. And I also think that people realize that there was a time when it meant something to be an American, that when you were in--you found yourself in trouble someplace in the world, that you were not alone. Unfortunately, what we are seeing increasingly is that if you are an American on foreign soil, and you are held captive, you are alone. And I think that scares people. They want to return to where it meant something to be an American, and that is why I believe people are responding to this and saying Congress should do something. I know Members of Congress have received lots of phone calls on this, and I know Congress is doing what they can. I express my public appreciation to you for the work that you have done on this particular case, but it is a broader symptom of a greater problem with our country here today and our defense of religious freedom. Mr. Meadows. So, Mr. Ambassador, your comment earlier that the State Department does not want to have Congress telling them what to do, how can we encourage them? You know, they don't express that when they come before this committee for authorization or the Appropriations Committee for their budget, so I am shocked to hear this kind of information. But what can we do to work hand in glove with the State Department? They have a difficult job, obviously. Ambassador Rees. Well, I think that recognizing a tendency, recognizing an institutional tendency, doesn't mean that you have to assume that forever after everybody who works for that other institution is your enemy. There are many people in the State Department who would be very sympathetic on this particular case, for instance. I think there is one phrase that I remember. I have never heard it before or since, but I must have heard it 20, 30 times when I was working as a staff member for this committee some years ago, and we would be in negotiations with the State Department, and they would complain that something on human rights or on refugees that went into a little too much detail, they would say, ``We know how to handle these cases. We don't have to be taught how to suck eggs.'' That was the favorite expression. So I think that--and it always made me wonder, why would anybody want to learn how to suck eggs? But I think that you need to reach out, as I know the committee has, to the State Department on these issues and say, ``How can we help?'' But making clear that help includes an active role in the process, an active concern for the outcome. And you are right, there are many times when the State Department is very anxious for Congress to get involved, but of course we used to do the State Department authorization bill every 2 years, and the State Department's idea of a great authorization bill was, ``Here is $13 billion. Be good.'' Whereas, many Members of Congress wanted paragraph after paragraph after paragraph about what to do in Haiti and about what to do in Sudan, what to do in Burma, and you need to reach a mean between those extremes. Mr. Meadows. So, Dr. Jasser, let me come to you. There are those within the Muslim countries who say that all we are trying to do is export our Christian faith. And yet I know in the case of Sudan that is really not what this is about. My mother went there 51 years ago, I believe, on a medical mission. I have friends who served in the Peace Corps, very dear friends who served in Khartoum in the Peace Corps. For many years, my family and my kids have sent money to provide for relief for Sudan, Sudanese people that were in harm's way. How do we do a good job of elevating religious freedom and liberty without it being one dimensional? Because, really, when we look at religious liberty, it is across all faiths, and yet sometimes we put a priority on one faith or another in terms of what we will or will not tolerate. So how do we do that? How do we communicate that to a predominantly Muslim world in North Africa and the Middle East? Dr. Jasser. Well, you know, I think, Mr. Meadows, that is really a wonderful question, and I think that the wisdom of the IRFA is that it is about religious liberty for all the citizens in the countries that we review and decide their CPC status on. And if you look at the citizens, for every--as much as often, the religious freedom limitations for minorities can be a touchpoint of the conversation. One of the things our commission always talks about is the fact that within the majority there are those in those countries, Sunnis, for example, I, as a Sunni Muslim, know that those who have a minority viewpoint within a majority population are also as persecuted, if not more, than the minorities. And I think I would ask anyone, through not only the work of our commission but also the implementation of the IRFA abroad, in countries to see that it is not specifically related to Christian minorities, but really related to any prisoners of conscience who have wanted to express their particular practice of faith differently and have been arrested for it or have suffered because of those expressions. And I think that is really what we have been expressing. It has not been about advancing or protecting Christianity. I know that as a Muslim. But it has been about advancing and protecting liberty, and that is when those countries are more secure. There is no wisdom in believing that protecting only minorities protects a country's security. It is about protecting freedom for all of its citizens, and that is the wisdom of the International Religious Freedom Act. And we hope, you know, that an Ambassador is named soon for religious freedom who can begin to advance these ideas. That spot has been vacant for some time, and I think this would allow the world to see that America is not just about protecting our own rights but protecting every citizen and their right to the free practice of faith or no faith. Mr. Meadows. Right. Mr. Perkins, you made a comment in your opening statements where you said that we are here because someone that was 27 years of age had the courage to stand up for her faith. That cut deep to my heart, because in a similar situation, knowing that my kids were in a prison, knowing that a simple word would release them, I don't know that I would have had as much courage, and so it was very convicting. I think the other part of that, though, is if a voice of a 27-year-old woman, mother, that I have never met, I have only seen pictures, can cause us to come together and cause us to start to understand that religious freedom is not only paramount, but it is foundational for who we are as a nation, what would you say to the millions and millions of Americans that are out there that many times allow us each and every day to make small concessions? Each and every day we sometimes look the other way, when something is said, something is done. We say, ``Well, that is just the way things are.'' But yet they continue to get worse if we are not willing to stand up as this brave young mother has so eloquently articulated. What would you say to them? What do we need to do as a nation? Mr. Perkins. Well, Congressman Meadows, I think just looking at this table is a reflection that is unique to America and our understanding of religious freedom. To my right, a Muslim; to my left, a Muslim and a Catholic, Protestant, Evangelical; and we are here for the same reason. We are here not in conflict, but we are here in concert. We are not here working against one another, but we are working together for someone that none of us have ever met, as you pointed out. It is a principle. It is a foundational principle through which I would say, as former late Harvard professor Samuel Huntington pointed out, that America became an economic powerhouse in part because of its religious ethic. That provided for the ability for us to be successful as a nation. So that silence on behalf of whether it is Meriam and that growing persecution abroad--I mean, as we see what is happening in Iraq, as it is becoming an Islamic state and Christians are being told that either they leave, convert to Islam, or they pay an impoverishing tax, or they die, that should be a concern for us as Americans. In fact, in our historical record, it has been a concern, because this indifference abroad will lead to greater religious hostility at home, which ultimately affects the well-being and the prosperity of our society as a whole. So I believe we must advocate for individuals like Meriam. As has been pointed out, there are many more like her, but this is one we know about. This is one we cannot escape. We have no excuse not to help this mother and her family. Mr. Meadows. Well, I want to thank you and your work as the American people have reached out. You have been daily, hourly, minute by minute, advocating on behalf of Meriam and religious freedom, and I want to thank you personally, but also on behalf of our Nation, for speaking up for someone who does not have a voice, because the silence that so often is deafening cannot be something that we tolerate. So I want to thank you. Mr. Ismail, let me come to you. You said something earlier that said that your belief is the Sudanese Government is wanting something from this. You know, what basis--why would you say that? So you are saying that it is--the release would be predicated on Congress giving them something? Mr. Ismail. It is just speculation on my side, that some of the elements inside the government might see this as an opportunity to gain something from the United States. This government is desperate to get recognition, especially from the United States, because this is the country that has all kinds of sanctions against it. This is the country that designated this government to be a sponsor of terrorism. This is the country that is not supporting international law in the sense that President al-Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court, and so on and so forth. So, and this is the country where we have a testimony like this from all these wonderful people who are trying to support this woman in need. And in this support, I don't see the support to Meriam Ibrahim only. There are 1 million Meriam Ibrahims in Sudan that are Christians, that are Muslims, that are practitioners of other faiths, that were persecuted daily. The women that were sentenced to 40 lashes or 50 lashes because they are wearing pants, the women that were without any kind of respect, the decency of human beings, were considered indecent in public, and they were faced with all kinds of threats and harassment. This is a case where the Government of Sudan is trying to see if they can--or at least some elements there, to see that, well, if we do this, what is in it for us? We have seen from Naivasha and even before that when the negotiations for the peace agreement, the negotiations to the secession of South Sudan, this government is always demanding something. They create obstacles, so that when they come and they release these obstacles, somebody will say, ``Oh, they did this, they are good, so let us reward them.'' And they do just enough to get this monkey off their back--that is called the international community--and they are not sincere in going the extra mile to make sure that they do this in good faith. Every single step that they have done, be it negotiation with the rebels, be it through, you know, letting the South go as they boast, it wasn't because of them. It is because of the will of the people of South Sudan that they seceded that country. So the government is willing to do everything, including incarcerating people or detaining them by force, or put them in house arrest, so that they can get something out of this. Mr. Meadows. Well, let me comment on that, because I--we met with some of the Sudanese officials here in Washington, DC, as I know Mr. Perkins has, and I think any relationship has to be built on mutual trust and respect. But negotiating for Meriam's release, with financial or other concessions, is not something that is on the table. I think we have made that very clear. But I am hopeful that if there is a new day in Sudan, that this can be the start. And it may be very embryonic, but it could be the start of perhaps a new relationship where religious freedoms are not only held up, but a relationship that is, to both countries, mutual benefit. But to negotiate because there is a woman in prison or being held, or thousands of others, for small, incremental changes, is not what this is about. And so, Mr. Ambassador, I want to come back to you before your plane. You know, this is the only time I have ever heard of applauding a delayed plane, but I thank you for bearing with us. You said that the State Department likes for us to say, ``Okay. Here is $13 billion; go do with it what you will and do a good job.'' How can we encourage them that addressing situations like Meriam will foster more of an open, non-earmarked, non- directive way in terms of finances going forward? Because if they are truly standing up for the Meriams or the Saeed Abedini's or whomever it may be, I am more willing to look at it and say, ``Well, we don't have to put parameters.'' How do we do a better job of working with the State Department where they can see the will of the American people? Ambassador Rees. Well, it is a very big conversation, and it is a conversation that has been going on for a long time. I remember Senator Helms when he was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee used to say they needed an America desk at the State Department. And Secretary Albright responded by saying, ``The America desk is me.'' And so--and I believe that you need to keep on doing what you are doing. You need to keep on having hearings like this. I assume the State Department was invited to this hearing. Maybe if you have another one they will come and have something to say at the appropriate time. I think you need to--I think it is okay for Congress to legislate on foreign affairs matters. There are some in the executive branch who think that is unconstitutional. I don't think it is unconstitutional. And I think that the executive branch's job is to execute, Congress' job is to make policy. The International Religious Freedom Act, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, these are examples of cases where--the State Department resisted both of those bills. And it wasn't that they said they didn't agree with the objectives. They did agree with the objectives, but they didn't think they needed a legal framework in which to operate. Trafficking at least, once it became law, the Department has taken that issue to its bosom. They really do the job. They really do the reports well. International religious freedom, I think sometimes they do well, but it has taken them a little more time to get used to that idea. But you change the legislative landscape, gradually people will begin to get used to it, and sometimes even to like it. Mr. Meadows. Well, I am going to yield to my good friend and the chairman of the subcommittee, and I am going to yield not only the mike but his chair back to him. Mr. Smith. No, no. Stay put. Stay put. Stay put. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your advocacy, because it has been extraordinary. I want the record to show that Mark Meadows has been absolutely relentless in pushing all of us--didn't take much push for a few of us, but certainly made it very clear that this was one of the highest, if not the highest priority. So I want to thank him for his leadership. I want to thank our distinguished witnesses again for your testimonies, which were very comprehensive and I think extraordinarily incisive. You know, human rights usually is demoted in U.S. foreign policy. That has been my experience. I have probably chaired some 500 hearings over the years on human rights, and it has never ceased to amaze me how when it talked about it is usually page 4, if it is there, in terms of our priorities, somewhere at the bottom of page 4. And that is not the way it ought to be. Recently, we had a hearing on North Korea, and our former Special Envoy to Sudan, who is also co-chair of a North Korean human rights organization, said that when the Six-Party Talks were still underway, he and so many others, including me, tried to make human rights a part of that, and it was excluded. So when those talks imploded and nothing happened on the nuclear issue, we got even less when it came to human rights. Same goes with Iran. We have asked Secretary Kerry repeatedly to include human rights, and he has not done so. It is only the nuclear issue, and that is not going very well either. If you could perhaps speak to the minimalist effort that I believe has been expended. I mean, the President, if he has time for golf and time for all of the other things that he engages in that would be called recreational, he should pick up the phone and call some top leadership. Maybe he wouldn't want to talk to al-Bashir. He is an indicted war criminal, and I met with him in the year 2005 with Greg Simpkins, and we had more of an argument than a conversation. But pick up the phone and say, ``We want these Americans to come back.'' That is not a heavy lift. And the same goes to Secretary Kerry and others, to be in contact with them. What is your thought on that? It seems to me that they measure the prioritization of administration by how up the chain of command they are admonished and even demanded of. What is your thoughts on that? Dr. Jasser? Dr. Jasser. Thank you, Chairman Smith. You know, I think from the perspective of a commission focused on religious liberty, one of the reasons for our existence is that we hope to push the needle to emphasize the importance that the focus-- the current focus, regardless of what the motivation is--and I can't speak for how the State Department chooses its priorities, but, you know, if you look at the situation in Sudan, the violence that they have tried to address, which has been the centerpiece of their current focus, is trying to address the violence in places within the states of Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, et cetera. It has failed. We have not done anything to address that. Why? Because one of the primary, if not the primary, reason for that violence is the use of religious repression and institutionalized mechanisms through Sharia law and other ways that have prevented religious freedom. And if that became--if religious liberty became a focus, we may then start to make some headways in an embryonic fashion with various cases like Meriam's and others that would begin to show that we are not only looking to stop the symptom, which is violence, but the causes, which is the lack of religious freedom and whatever tools, whether it be, you know, draconian Sharia law or places like North Korea that are just repressive prisons of governments, the bottom line is that the prevention of religious freedom, as we know in our history, is the first freedom for a reason. And, you know, I think that ultimately that needs to become a centerpiece of American foreign policy, and we think it will then change and move the needle to decrease violence. And as we have seen, as Mr. Perkins mentioned earlier, across the world from Iraq with ISIS and other places, it is not a coincidence that religiously violent organizations are beginning to fill this vacuum. And that vacuum needs to be filled with something else, and it can only be filled with the idea of religious liberty, I believe, as a step toward a solution. Mr. Perkins. Mr. Chairman, I think the State Department has been busy aggressively pursuing its values and human rights priorities, which have not included religious liberty. They have been exerting pressure upon foreign governments to abide by their values and their views, which are in large part inconsistent with the majority of Americans. And I think because of that, when we are talking about pushing the LGBT agenda on foreign governments and making that a priority at the State Department, religious liberty has suffered as a result. That has been a higher priority for this administration rather than a foundational principle upon which this nation is rooted in, and, as we have talked about, the economic success of other nations have benefitted from. So I think what we are creating by our negligence is greater world instability. Now, to verify that, all you have to do is pick up the newspaper, and the world is imploding. And what is this administration doing? Scant, little, when it comes to these core value issues that guarantee the freedom and protection of not just American citizens, but the value of human life in general and this fundamental principle of religious liberty. I think the administration is very busy, but not about the people's business. Mr. Smith. Thank you. Ambassador Rees? Ambassador Rees. I do want to put in a good word for some of the people who work on these issues in our Government, including in the State Department. I said earlier that I think it took a while for the bureaucracy, if you will, to warm to this issue the way they did to trafficking. Trafficking, very early after the passage of the Act, which the State Department opposed, they decided to implement it, and they implemented it vigorously. The International Religious Freedom Act, you could tell the first few years they weren't very vigorous. And when I was in the State Department, I mean, a week didn't go by that we didn't get a memo telling us to do something, a cable telling us to do something about trafficking. We didn't get those about religious freedom nearly as often. I meet with State Department officials. I do a lot of work on Southeast Asia, and I meet with--both with the regional bureau and with the human rights bureau, the DRL (Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor), and with some other bureaus. And in recent years I have sensed that the people in DRL at least really do take these issues seriously, and they really do know more about chapter and verse of what is happening to Montagnard Protestants in Vietnam, and what is happening to Hoa Hao Buddhists in Vietnam, than they did a few years ago. And so I think the legislation is working. The work that you are doing, that Congress is doing, to highlight these issues, the work that the Commission is doing--I don't know if the Commission has had the same experience, but I think there was real hostility to the Commission a few years ago within the Department. I think there are still people in the regional bureaus in particular who, as I said earlier, see their job as having a good relationship with these other governments. And we all hear about knock-down, drag-out battles within the Department where the Democracy Bureau, the Ambassador for Religious Freedom, may recommend that a certain country be a CPC, and the Embassy in that country, the U.S. Embassy in that country and the regional bureau come back with everything they have got and they manage to defeat that. But that happens in trafficking as well. That is just one of the realities of working in institutions is that they are not monolithic. Mr. Smith. Mr. Ismail? Mr. Ismail. Thank you, Chairman Smith. In my view, humbly I would say freedom is indivisible. And the people of Sudan, they don't have freedom, period. There is no freedom of speech. There is no freedom of assembly. There is no freedom to choose your religion. There is no freedom to choose anything. What we want in Sudan is that the rest of the world, including or spearheaded by the United States, helping us gain the freedom of the people of Sudan. Freedom, as it is, indivisible. Freedom in everything. That is not available today. What we need to do with this government, this honorable institution, is to push the Government of Sudan to change or else. We have to say in the loudest voice that this government needs to open up. We need more democratization in Sudan. We need to give the freedom of the people of Sudan to choose their government, to choose whoever they want to represent them, to choose their religion, and to have absolute choice on everything. Without that, we are going--maybe pushing just for religious freedom or maybe for freedom of speech, and the other freedoms will be curtailed, and we have a freedom that is not complete. I think the people of Sudan deserve better. They deserve to live like the rest of people in the world, with dignity and with respect to their rights. Mr. Smith. Mr. Ismail, just ask you a question. It would seem to me that in any dictatorship or authoritarian government there is always people, even within the government, who could be called reformers. Very often, they stay quiet for obvious reasons. We saw it after Tiananmen Square. There were a number of people, including in the People's Daily, who showed themselves. They thought things were changing, and unfortunately, when things didn't, they found themselves in prison or in the Laogai as a direct result. I believe there is at least some tug of war going on in Khartoum between some people who would like reform and those who do not. My hope is that if we start putting clear lines of demarcation, and the international community, and especially the U.S. Government, ratchets up significantly the importance-- when I met with President al-Bashir, he spent most of his time talking about lifting the sanctions. And I said, ``That is not hard to do. There are conditionalities attached which have everything to do with respecting fundamental human rights and protecting the value and the dignity of life. And those sanctions are a goner when that happens.'' We need to ratchet up, I think. And I think, Mr. Perkins, your point about other issues becoming prioritized, frankly, I have been shocked and dismayed by how many Ambassadors and foreign leaders have told me to my face that the LGBT agenda is what trumps everything in the U.S. foreign policy. So religious freedom, in a way, is seen as an impediment to the advancement of that. And even the former head of the UNFPA, Dr. Sadik, when it came to the abortion issue, said that the last remaining barrier to promoting the culture of death worldwide was churches and synagogues and mosques, who believe in the sanctity of human life, including unborn children. So there is a tension, I think, within the State Department. I know that DRL has pushed that issue to the exclusion of most everything else. And Secretary Clinton's statement to the Human Rights Council a couple of years ago couldn't be more clear, that that was the priority, to the exclusion, I believe, of most everything else. So it is a very, very important issue, because now we are seeing how it demonstrates on the ground when a woman of faith is neglected, at least for several months, and I would say mistreated, as well as her children and her husband. You know, as I think Ambassador Rees said recently, they are doing things that we all can be proud of, but at first there was--and why did that--why did it take an outcry by Members of Congress, Members of the U.S. Senate, religious freedom NGOs, and others, to bring a focus upon this? It seems wrong to me that it takes that kind of pressure just to do the right thing. So if you wanted to speak to any of that, and then I think you have some concluding remarks as well. Mr. Meadows. Well, I want to thank the chairman for his words. They have actually called votes. We have got just a few minutes left, and I want to--this is defining day. It is a defining day for America. Are we willing to stand up and say enough is enough? And I thank each of you for being here today to take time from your busy schedule. But it is also a defining day for Sudan. They have a choice to make. Either to make a decision that will hopefully provide a foundation for moving forward or to make another decision that could cause irreparable harm to the relationship going forward. And so with that, we pray for Meriam's safe arrival in the United States, and I thank each of you, and we will adjourn.

He wasn’t talking about the U.S. using nuclear weapons in war.\nThe ad, titled “Presidential,” comes from Priorities USA Action, a liberal super PAC supporting presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The multimillion-dollar ad buy, set to air in eight swing states, says that Trump is “too dangerous for America.”\nTrump did say that he “loves war, in a certain way,” at a campaign rally in Iowa last year. He made the comment after he said that former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein claimed to have weapons of mass destruction as a strategy “to scare” Iran.\nTrump, Nov. 12, 2015: This is the Trump theory on war. But I’m good at war. I’ve had a lot of wars of my own. I’m really good at war. I love war, in a certain way, but only when we win.\nBut Trump’s “including with nukes” comment was unrelated to that and came several months later. He said that during an April 3 interview with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. Trump suggested that Japan might need to acquire nuclear weapons to defend against neighboring North Korea, which does possess nuclear weapons.\nWallace, April 3: You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\nTrump: In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.\nWallace: Understood.\nTrump: It’s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them.\nSo, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.\nWallace: With nukes?\nTrump: Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\nWallace: And South Korea, with nukes?\nTrump: South Korea is right next door, just so you understand.\nWallace: But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula.\nTrump: You already have it, Chris. You already have a nuclear arms race.\nIt’s clear, in that exchange, that Trump wasn’t talking about the U.S. using nuclear weapons, and he wasn’t saying that he “loves” nuclear war.\nBut Trump has previously said that he wouldn’t ever rule out using nuclear weapons as president. That’s a point that Priorities USA Action spokesman Justin Barasky made in an email to FactCheck.org.\nAt an MSNBC town hall in March, when asked by moderator Chris Matthews about the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State terrorist group in the Middle East or even in Europe, Trump said that “I’m not going to take it off the table” even though “nuclear should be off the table.”\nTrump, March 30: Look, nuclear should be off the table. But would there be a time when it could be used, possibly, possibly?\nMatthews: OK. The trouble is, when you said that, the whole world heard it. David Cameron in Britain heard it. The Japanese, where we bombed them in ’45, heard it. They’re hearing a guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons. Nobody wants to hear that about an American president.\nTrump: Then why are we making them? Why do we make them? We had (inaudible).\nMatthews: Because of the old mutual assured destruction, which Reagan hated and tried to get rid of.\nTrump: (inaudible) I was against Iraq. I’d be the last one to use the nuclear weapon.\nMatthews: So can you take it off the table now?\nTrump: Because that’s sort of like the end of the ballgame.\nMatthews: Can you tell the Middle East we’re not using a nuclear weapon on anybody?\nTrump: I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table.\nMatthews: How about Europe? We won’t use it in Europe?\nTrump: I — I’m not going to take it off the table.\nMatthews: You might use it in Europe?\n(LAUGHTER)\nTrump: No, I don’t think so. But I’m not taking …\nMatthews: Well, just say it. “I will never use a nuclear weapon in Europe.”\nTrump: I am not — I am not taking cards off the table.\nMatthews: OK.\nIt’s not our place to say whether a potential U.S. president should or should not talk about using nuclear weapons in war. However, Trump saying that he would not rule out using nuclear weapons as president is not the same thing as saying, “I love war, in a certain way … including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.” That’s what someone might wrongly think Trump said, given the way the ad uses the two quotes one after the other.\nBarasky disagreed. “It’s obvious to anyone that these are different clips and there’s no suggestion all 5 are one statement,” he wrote in an email.\nViewers can be the judge of that. But the two Trump quotes come in quick succession in the ad, and there’s no context given for the “nukes” comment.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7f6741f2-9b68-4613-8263-41ba028fa3d6\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        We’re sorry, this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.\nPlease try again in a few moments.\nException: forbidden\nWe’re sorry, this site is currently experiencing technical difficulties.\nPlease try again in a few moments.\nException: forbidden\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: President Trump’s Display of Peace Through Strength\nPresident Donald J. Trump’s bold, decisive action against Iran — the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism — and its key nuclear facilities was met with bipartisan praise from lawmakers across Capitol Hill.\nHere’s what they’re saying:\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: “The President made the right call, and did what he needed to do. Leaders in Congress were aware of the urgency of this situation and the Commander-in-Chief evaluated that the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act. The world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, which chants ‘Death to America,’ simply could not be allowed the opportunity to obtain and use nuclear weapons. The President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight’s necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties.”\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune: “The regime in Iran, which has committed itself to bringing ‘death to America’ and wiping Israel off the map, has rejected all diplomatic pathways to peace. The mullahs’ misguided pursuit of nuclear weapons must be stopped. As we take action tonight to ensure a nuclear weapon remains out of reach for Iran, I stand with President Trump and pray for the American troops and personnel in harm’s way.”\nSenate Majority Whip John Barrasso: “President @realDonaldTrump’s decision to strike Iran’s nuclear program is the right one. The greatest threat to the safety of the United States and the world is Iran with a nuclear weapon. God Bless our troops”\nSenate Republican Conference Chair Tom Cotton: “Iran has waged a war of terror against the United States for 46 years. We could never allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. God bless our brave troops. President Trump made the right call and the ayatollahs should recall his warning not to target Americans.”\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jim Risch: “As President Trump has said over and over again – as have I – Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Why? A nuclear-armed Iran would without doubt spark a nuclear arms race that would take off around the world. This is a direct threat to American national security if left unchecked. This war is Israel’s war not our war, but Israel is one of our strongest allies and is disarming Iran for the good of the world. I’ve also always said that Israel would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. For Israel this is existential. The Iranians literally want to wipe Israel and all Jews off the face of the earth. This strike will put an end to those ambitions. President Trump took decisive action today to assist the Israelis in their efforts to stop the Iranian nuclear program. Only American weapons could do what has been done. This has made America safer, in addition to the Israelis, and the world more broadly. This is not the start of a forever war. There will not be American boots on the ground in Iran. This was a precise, limited strike, which was necessary and by all accounts was very successful. As President Trump has stated, now is the time for peace.”\nSen. Jim Banks: “I trust President Trump!”\nSen. Marsha Blackburn: “@realDonaldTrump knows peace can only be achieved through strength. This is a victory for the United States.”\nSen. Katie Britt: “I stand by President Trump. Strong and surgical. Please pray for peace.”\nSen. Ted Budd: “Tonight, the United States dealt a decisive blow to Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. military alone had the capability to destroy these facilities deep underground, and I commend President Trump for standing with our Israeli allies in their efforts to end the threat of a nuclear Iran once and for all. May God bless and protect our troops, who continue to keep us safe around the world.”\nSen. Bill Cassidy: “Iran’s nuclear program is a threat to peace and stability. Peace must remain the goal.”\nSen. John Cornyn: “President Trump made the courageous and correct decision to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat. God Bless the USA. Thank you to our extraordinary military and our indomitable @POTUS This is what leadership on the world stage looks like.”\nSen. Kevin Cramer: “When only we can do what needs doing, we must do it. Great call Mr. President and great job @usairforce ! God Bless The USA! #PeaceThroughStrength #GodBlessIsrael.”\nSen. Ted Cruz: “I commend our pilots and servicemembers, our intelligence personnel, and his national security staff on tonight’s successful and critical operation. The prospect of the Iranian regime acquiring nuclear weapons represents the most acute immediate threat to America and our allies. When the Ayatollah chants ‘Death to America’ he means it, and the reason he is building nuclear weapons is because he intends to use them. President Trump has consistently and unequivocally stated that those threats cannot be countered without dismantling the Iranian regime’s enrichment capacity. The President and his negotiators spent two months exploring whether the regime would agree to a negotiated settlement that met America’s national security needs. At the end of that period, Iranian regime officials declared that instead of agreeing to deal they would open a new enrichment facility and install more advanced centrifuges. After that declaration, our Israeli allies launched a preemptive attack against the regime and its nuclear infrastructure, which was enormously successful. It could not disable the nuclear activities at Fordow, an underground enrichment bunker built into a mountain which was legitimized by the Obama-era deal. As long as Iran was able to access and enrich uranium, they could still rush to build a nuclear arsenal. Tonight’s actions have gone far in foreclosing that possibility, and countering the apocalyptic threat posed by an Iranian nuclear arsenal.”\nSen. John Curtis: “Iran’s relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons is a direct threat to American interests, our allies, and global stability. Today’s action was a serious and necessary response to that danger. I honor the brave servicemembers who carried out the mission with skill and courage. Strength paired with genuine diplomacy is how we create peace, prevent conflict, and preserve freedom. I join the President in calling for a return to diplomacy.”\nSen. Steve Daines: “Thank you President Trump and the men and women of our armed forces. America, Israel and the rest of the world are safer tonight as a result of your bravery, courage and unrivaled skill. Iran is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, has killed hundreds of U.S. service members, attempted to assassinate President Trump, and calls the United States ‘big Satan’ and Israel ‘little Satan.’ Stopping Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons is a major step toward achieving peace.”\nSen. Joni Ernst: “By leading with peace through strength, President Trump is making the world a safer place and protecting Americans. Iran must never be able to threaten America with a nuclear weapon. God bless our commander in chief and our servicemembers!”\nSen. Deb Fischer: “For decades, Iran has chanted ‘death to America’ and pledged to wipe Israel off the map. When foreign adversaries pledge to destroy us, we should believe them. President Trump has always been clear: Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon – and I agree. Today, his administration took the necessary steps to keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran’s reach, and I am grateful to the service members who successfully carried out the mission.”\nSen. Bill Hagerty: “@POTUS’s decisive leadership enforced deadlines and redlines. This was a tough decision, one that, as always, President Trump put the interests of the American people first in making. May this be the end of Iran’s nuclear weapon ambitions and lay the groundwork for lasting peace.”\nSen. Lindsey Graham: “Good. This was the right call. The regime deserves it. Well done, President @realDonaldTrump To my fellow citizens: We have the best Air Force in the world. It makes me so proud. Fly, Fight, Win.”\nSen. Chuck Grassley: “Our commander in chief & brave military forces hv carried out a mission in Iran to prevent nuclear enrichment Iran believes in “Death to Israel Death to America” Keeping USA safe is number 1 responsibility of Pres Trump”\nSen. John Fetterman: “As I’ve long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS. Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I’m grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.”\nSen. James Lankford: “I continue to be grateful for the skill and professionalism of our United States service members. Cindy and I are praying for our military, the President and for a lasting peace.”\nSen. Mike Lee: “Tonight, the Iranian nuclear program was wiped out. Please join me in praying for the safety of the brave men and women of America’s armed forces in the Middle East and around the world, and that these strikes may lead to the lasting peace called for by President Trump.”\nSen. Roger Marshall: “Thank you to our brave American Air Force and their successful mission as no Americans were harmed. We stand tall with President Trump who is protecting the world from a nuclear capable Iran.”\nSen. Dave McCormick: “As I have said all along, Iran must not have a nuclear weapon. This targeted attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is the result of the Iranian regime’s failure to make a deal despite months of President Trump’s good faith efforts to negotiate. I applaud President Trump’s strong leadership and his continued commitment to peace through strength. Once again, America’s detractors around the world should know President Trump means what he says. And I am so grateful for America’s brave warriors, who appear to have achieved their mission successfully and are returning home safely. I look forward to being briefed along with my Senate colleagues on this action. This is an important step toward ensuring that the world’s largest state sponsor of terror never obtains a nuclear weapon.”\nSen. Ashley Moody: “This is a solemn and important moment for security and peace. We stand with and pray for our President, the service members who carried out this mission, and the people affected by this conflict.”\nSen. Markwayne Mullin: “To those concerned about U.S. involvement— this isn’t a “forever war” in fact, it’s ending one. @POTUS was clear: Iran must never have a nuclear weapon. The Republican-led @SenateGOP trusts President Trump to keep America safe, free, and prosperous. Peace through strength.”\nSen. Pete Ricketts: “President Trump gave Iran ample time to come to the negotiating table on its nuclear program. Tonight’s strikes mean Iran is further from possessing a nuclear weapon. I’m thankful for the heroes who carried out this strike and for our service members in the Middle East and around the world.”\nSen. Rick Scott: “Thank you, @POTUS, @SecDef, and our brave American warriors for a successful strike on three Iranian nuclear sites. This is what peace through strength looks like. The United States and the world are a safer place without Iran possessing a nuclear weapon.”\nSen. Tim Scott: “Decisive American leadership. Americans and the world can thank President Trump for his courage to lead.”\nSen. Tim Sheehy: “The right decision. Iran had every opportunity to give up their nukes. To the naysayers out there, this isn’t starting a war, this is ending one. Iran has been at war with America for 46 years. The Iranian people should rise up and put an end to this murderous regime.”\nSen. Dan Sullivan: “President Trump meant what he said—Iran will never get a nuclear bomb. I commend @POTUS and his national security team for making this important but difficult decision and our brave military members for carrying it out. The terrorist leaders of Iran have, in essence, been at war with the United States for decades—targeting, wounding and killing thousands of American service members for years. Making sure the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism never gets a nuclear weapon is part of the work of reestablishing deterrence against Iran, which was lost during the appeasement of the Biden Administration. This is difficult work, but critical for our national security. I fully support the President and his national security team in these critical efforts.”\nSen. Thom Tillis: “This was the right decision by @POTUS: we cannot allow Iran to build nuclear weapons. God Bless our brave servicemembers who supported and executed this mission.”\nSen. Tommy Tuberville: “God bless our Troops. God bless President Trump. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.”\nSen. Roger Wicker: “Our commander-in-chief has made a deliberate —and correct— decision to eliminate the existential threat posed by the Iranian regime. We now have very serious choices ahead to provide security for our citizens and our allies and stability for the middle-east. Well-done to our military personnel. You’re the best!”\nSen. Todd Young: “Thank you to our brave service members who executed this mission. The world will be safer if Iran’s nuclear capability is destroyed. I look forward to briefings in the coming days.”\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer: “A nuclear Iran posed a threat to the Middle East and to the world. @POTUS has been consistent that this dangerous regime should NEVER possess a nuclear weapon. He was right then, and he is right today: NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE.”\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain: “President Trump is delivering PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. Today’s successful mission destroyed Iran’s nuclear capabilities, protected American lives, and will make the world safer. Now, it’s time for peace. God bless America and our warfighters!”\nRep. Robert Aderholt: “I fully support President Trump’s decision to take out Iran’s nuclear facilities. As I have said, I believe that if Iran gets a functioning nuclear weapon they would not hesitate to use it against Israel or the United States. When they say death to Israel and death to America, we have no reason not to believe them. I pray this action has made the world safer. President Trump has pledged to get us out of “forever wars.” This could be a step toward ending the war we have been in with Iran since 1979. They have killed hundreds and hundreds of Americans in the past half century.”\nRep. Mark Alford: “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH REQUIRES STRENGTH We strongly support President Trump’s targeted strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. The Ayatollah must never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon and we will always stand with Israel.”\nRep. Don Bacon: “Iran with a nuclear weapon is an existential threat. Pres. Trump is protecting America.”\nRep. Troy Balderson: “Thank you @realDonaldTrump for taking decisive action. The world is a whole lot safer tonight.”\nRep. Michael Baumgartner: “There is no greater threat to the world than nuclear proliferation, let alone from a regime that has consistently used radical Islamic terrorists to attack and kill Americans for nearly 4 decades. I fully support President Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuke reactor. Trump gave Iran a choice. The Ayatollah chose poorly.”\nRep. Andy Barr: “God Bless Donald J. Trump, God Bless our military, and God Bless the United States of America! America thanks you, @realdonaldtrump! The world thanks you too.”\nRep. Tom Barrett: “I anticipate a full briefing of our military strike in Iran immediately upon my return to Washington. Tonight, I am praying for wisdom in our decisions, President Trump and his team, and the safety of our troops. God bless the United States of America.”\nRep. Aarron Bean: “The rogue Iranian regime has murdered American soldiers and been the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism for decades. Peace through strength is a strategy that works. God bless our brave American troops and God bless the USA!”\nRep. Mike Bost: “I trust that President Trump made the decision to target Iran’s nuclear program tonight due to intelligence that indicates the regime was within reach of developing nuclear weapons that could threaten the lives of American citizens and U.S. troops stationed across the globe. He showed the strength to ensure that never happens.”\nRep. Ken Calvert: “Like President Trump, I have consistently said Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. I support his decision to use the force and precision of the U.S. military in coordination with our ally Israel to uphold this redline with tonight’s targeted strike.”\nRep. Buddy Carter: “I support President Trump. Peace through strength! Thank you to the brave troops who defended us and our ally, Israel.”\nRep. Mike Collins: “Peace through strength. Thank God we have President Trump as Commander in Chief.”\nRep. Jeff Crank: “Tonight, President Trump took decisive action to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, protect Americans and build peace in the Middle East. Congratulations to the Department of Defense on a successful mission.”\nRep. Rick Crawford: “As I have said multiple times recently, I regret that Iran has brought the world to this point. That said, I am thankful President Trump understood that the red line—articulated by Presidents of both parties for decades—was real. The United States and our allies, including Israel, are making it clear that the world would never accept Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon. I have been in touch with the White House before this action and will continue to track developments closely with them in the coming days. I commend President Trump for taking decisive action and I am grateful to the U.S. servicemembers who carried out these precise and successful strikes. I continue to pray for the safety of the forces engaged to protect the free world.”\nRep. Dan Crenshaw: “Support President Trump. You think these decisions were easy? They weren’t. You think this means WW3? You’re wrong. You think it means American soldiers deploying to Iran? You’re wrong. You think it means long term stability in the Middle East and a safer future for Americans? You’re right. Because the regime that wanted ‘Death to the Great Satan’ is at its end. Support the President.”\nRep. Scott DesJarlais: “I stand with President Trump’s decision to take out the last of Iran’s nuclear sites and his call for peace. My full statement & the DOJ indictment on Iran’s attempt to assassinate Trump.”\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart: “I stand with our Commander-in-Chief President @realDonaldTrump in making sure the terrorist regime in Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. Proud of our exceptional military and proud to stand by our ally Israel.”\nRep. Neal Dunn: “Iran’s nuclear ambitions are a threat not just to Israel but also to all our allies and the entire free world. The Ayatollah’s regime forced the President’s hand. It was imperative that President Trump act decisively to eliminate that existential threat. Prayers for the Iranian people and peace in the Middle East.”\nRep. Gabe Evans: “I’m glad to see @POTUS take action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. As a veteran of a Global War on Terror, I know we achieve peace through strength. Prayers and thanks to our brave men and women who carried out this necessary operation.”\nRep. Pat Fallon: “President Trump today made the tough, but absolutely correct decision in the best interest of America’s national security to order strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. Let me be clear — Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Thank you to our brave servicemembers for getting the job done.”\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick: “Tonight, the United States executed a successful strike on Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All our aircraft are safely out of Iranian airspace and headed home. This was the right call—and a necessary one. Make no mistake: a nuclear Iran is an existential threat—not just to Israel, but to the entire free world. Peace through strength is how we lead. And tonight, the greatest military on Earth delivered —for America, for our allies, and for the cause of global security. God bless our Troops. God bless America. And God Bless the enduring cause of liberty, now and forever.”\nRep. Chuck Fleischmann: “President Trump is showing strong leadership that will protect America and the entire world by ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. Iran is the world’s largest state-sponsor of terrorism, responsible for the murder of thousands globally. The Iranian regime must NEVER have access to nuclear weapons. I applaud President Trump for his steadfast leadership as our Commander in Chief and our outstanding Armed Forces for their successful mission.”\nRep. Mike Flood: “Tonight, President Trump took bold steps to ensure that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power will not only help keep America safe but can provide peace and stability around the world. Thank you to our brave service members who skillfully carried out this mission.”\nRep. Vince Fong: “President Trump’s decisive action to eliminate the nuclear capabilities posed by the Iranian regime was a necessary one to prevent a real and catastrophic threat. Iran can NEVER be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. We’re grateful for the bravery of the @usairforce and all our military personnel. May God protect them and all Americans in harm’s way as we continue the necessary work to preserve peace and stability.”\nRep. Russell Fry: “I stand with President Trump—Iran CANNOT have a nuclear weapon. Peace through strength.”\nRep. Brandon Gill: “’Peace through strength’ means ensuring our existential enemies don’t acquire the most lethal and catastrophic weapons known to man.”\nRep. Carlos Gimenez: “God bless America! God bless the Jewish State of Israel! God bless President Donald J. Trump! The people of #Iran will soon taste freedom again, Israel will be at peace, & democracy will be safe from this radical Islamist terrorist regime!”\nRep. Lance Gooden: “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH! Thank you, Mr. President, and our great military! And thanks, especially, to God, for our pilots’ safe return.”\nRep. Mark Green: “The United States has given Tehran every opportunity to forgo its nuclear ambitions; it has repeatedly refused. President Trump made the right decision. A nuclear armed Iran would be detrimental to the existence of our ally Israel, the stability of the Middle East, and our own national security.”\nRep. Abe Hamadeh: “Iran has limited internet access. The news of Trump’s successful military operation should be spread far and wide in Iran, DROP LEAFLETS. The Iranian people need to know how weak the regime truly is, and now is their time to chart their own destiny if they choose.”\nRep. Mike Haridopolos: “I support the actions taken by President Trump to end Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The world is a much safer place due to his actions taken today.”\nRep. Pat Harrigan: “President Trump gave Iran a diplomatic off-ramp—60 days to deescalate and come to the table. They kept enriching uranium, kept making threats, and ignored every warning, including the one not to target Americans. We tried peace through strength. With American lives at risk, I support @POTUS’s actions to advance peace in the Middle East.”\nRep. Andy Harris: “A nuclear-armed Iran endangers America, Israel, and the entire free world. The U.S. took decisive action to destroy Iran’s nuclear capability, protecting American lives, our allies, and global stability. This is peace through strength.\nRep. Mark Harris: “I am grateful for President Trump’s thoughtful and wise approach that has gone into the decision and action which has been carried out this evening in a determined approach to make certain Iran does not have a nuclear weapon!! Pray for our nation’s military, the most powerful courageous fighting force in the world!!”\nRep. Diana Harshbarger: “President Trump has tried over and over again to come to a peaceful agreement with Iran, but they have refused to work with us. While I believe war should never be an option, I am proud of President Trump and our military on a successful operation to deter the spread of war in the Middle East.”\nRep. Ashley Hinson: “Thanks to President Trump’s decisive leadership, our military carried out successful strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites tonight. Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism & President Trump made it clear: Iran can never have a path to a nuclear weapon. Now they won’t. Thank you to our brave warriors who carried out these attacks & are now on their way back safely home. God Bless President Trump and the USA.”\nRep. Richard Hudson: “President Donald Trump has been consistent and resolute that Iran- the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism- will not be allowed to build a nuclear weapons capability. He negotiated in good faith and offered Iran peace in exchange for ending their nuclear ambition. Iran did not take President Trump seriously and they have learned tonight that was a mistake. It would be another mistake for Iran to retaliate against Americans anywhere in the world. I support President Trump, I stand with Israel and I pray for the safety of our brave men and women in uniform around the world. America leads with resolve, and the world is safer when we do.”\nRep. Bill Huizenga: “After attempting to negotiate peace through diplomacy, President Trump took decisive action. We must ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon and usher in a new age of nuclear terrorism. I commend the men and women of our Armed Forces for their performance in this operation to make the world a safer place. It is now time for Iran to come to the table and abandon its nuclear ambitions.”\nRep. Wesley Hunt: “When faced with a clear choice between peace and violence, Iran chose violence. That was a grave mistake. Underestimating the resolve of the United States, the leadership of President Trump, and the unmatched strength of the most advanced military force on Earth is not just unwise, it’s fatal. I commend our Commander-in-Chief for acting decisively to dismantle Iran’s nuclear ambitions at the source. This was not just a mission of military precision, it was a message: the United States will not tolerate threats to our national security or to global stability. To the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who carried out this operation with courage and excellence, thank you. The nation stands in awe of your service.”\nRep. Jeff Hurd: “Iran cannot be allowed to possess nuclear capabilities. We must always stand up for the safety and security of the U.S. and its allies. I fully support actions taken to prevent an evil regime from being able to harm us, Israel, and our other allies.”\nRep. Darrell Issa: “Tonight, @realDonaldTrump is showing the world the true meaning of peace through strength. And American strength is making peace with Iran possible for the first time in 46 years.”\nRep. Brian Jack: “I stand with our brave military stationed across the world and President Trump, our Commander in Chief.”\nRep. Ronny Jackson: “President Trump once again demonstrated the bold, decisive leadership the American people elected him for. He has long maintained that Iran must NEVER obtain a nuclear weapon and he kept that promise. A nuclear Iran is a direct threat to America and our allies. Tonight, the world is safer because OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, PRESIDENT TRUMP acted. Thank you President Trump and the servicemembers who carried out the strike. GOD BLESS THE USA!!!”\nRep. Jim Jordan: “God Bless the United States Military. God Bless President Trump.”\nRep. Tom Kean: “The world is a far safer place without Iranian nuclear sites. Thank you to President Trump and our second-to-none American military for carrying out this successful series of strikes. It is time for security and peace for all.”\nRep. Jen Kiggans: “The American military remains the greatest in the world … God bless our troops. I support President Trump’s decision to bomb the three sites in Iran because Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. Iran should heed the president’s warning to not retaliate against U.S. forces or U.S. citizens anywhere in the world. Peace through strength remains our goal.”\nRep. Young Kim: “The military’s targeted actions tonight against Iranian nuclear sites are necessary to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and save lives. I thank our military for their service in this critical operation to restore peace through strength and am glad they are safely on the way home. I look forward to additional briefings from the administration soon.”\nRep. David Kustoff: “Thank you, @realDonaldTrump, for demonstrating strong leadership on the World stage. Iran should never have a nuclear weapon. This is peace through strength!”\nRep. Darin LaHood: “@POTUS and the United States have been clear: under no circumstances can Iran be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. I thank our brave service members, Intelligence Community, and the Administration’s national security team for holding this red line to protect U.S. national security.”\nRep. Nick LaLota: “Tonight’s American response makes it clear: Iran will be held accountable for its proxies killing Americans and its blatant ambition to bring death to America through nuclear weapons. Tehran must return to the table, abandon its nuclear ambitions, and choose peace. Praying for our brave troops and American citizens in the region.”\nRep. Doug LaMalfa: “The President’s decision to carry out a targeted strike on Iranian nuclear sites was the right move. It was necessary, and sent a clear message. No other country has the capability to take out this type of threat. I support President Trump’s decision to take action before it was too late. Iran’s leaders chant “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” as official policy and they mean it. They’ve made it clear that if they ever got their hands on a nuclear weapon, they’d use it on America and Israel. We could not leave major Iranian nuclear sites operational and intact. I hope Iran will take the President’s offer now. They’ve had many chances to give up their weapons ambitions.”\nRep. Nick Langworthy: “God bless the United States of America and the brave men and women in uniform who sacrifice so much to protect our freedoms and do the extraordinary every day. We pray for their safety, and we pray for wisdom and strength for our Commander in Chief.”\nRep. Bob Latta: “Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, must never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. The president took decisive action to stop Iran’s nuclear program. Now is the time for peace. God bless and protect our troops.”\nRep. Mike Lawler: “President Trump made the right decision — and like when President Obama struck Libya, Syria, Pakistan, and Yemen — he did so under the terms of the 2001 and 2002 AUMF. War has not been declared, however, a Nuclear Iran has been prevented. I fully support the President’s decision.”\nRep. Barry Loudermilk: “Thanks to this bold and decisive action by President Trump, and our amazing military, America and the rest of the world are much safer. Putting America first means prioritizing the safety and security of the United States; and Iran has been a serious threat to the U.S. and our ally, Israel, for decades. President Trump exercised incredible restraint while seeking diplomatic solutions with Iran these past few months; unfortunately, Iran was unwilling to cooperate.”\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna: “May God protect our brave service members until they return home safely, along with our foreign service officers and the dedicated men and women of the State Department. Pray for our country. We need peace.”\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis: “There’s no other military in the world that can do what was just done. God bless America and our brave service members.”\nRep.

We pray for wisdom for President Trump and his team as they promote American peace through strength. God bless our troops.”\nRep. Rich McCormick: “President Trump gave Iran every opportunity to give up its nuclear ambitions. They are now very aware that this President will not be dropping pallets of cash to bribe them to stop developing nukes, we will be delivering ordinances that ensures they do.”\nRep. Addison McDowell: “President Trump protects America and our interests: A nuclear Iran was never an option. God bless America and the brave men and women who serve our nation.”\nRep. Carol Miller: “Iran was persistent in their refusal to stop enriching uranium. We gave them every opportunity to stop and agree to nuclear disarmament. They refused, so America ended their nuclear weapons program tonight. The Commander in Chief has my full support.”\nRep. Mary Miller: “A great victory for the United States! President Trump understands that PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH keeps America, and the world, safe and secure.”\nRep. Max Miller: “As President Trump has stated before, Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. Promises made, promises kept”\nRep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks: “Under the constitutional authority granted to the president as Commander-in-Chief under Article II, @POTUS took decisive action tonight to keep America, our allies and the world, safe. His bold leadership and commitment to peace through strength delivered results. Our military successfully struck Iran’s nuclear sites, sending a clear message: the world’s top sponsor of terrorism will never obtain a nuclear weapon. Proud of our warriors and our President.”\nRep. John Moolenaar: “President Trump has been consistent. A nuclear Iran poses a grave threat to our nation, our military, and our allies. His decision to strike Iran is necessary to keep us and our allies safe, and ensure the largest sponsor of terror in the world does not develop nuclear weapons.”\nRep. Barry Moore: “I stand with President Trump. God bless him and our brave service members.”\nRep. Tim Moore: “Iran’s radical regime is a threat to freedom everywhere and has spent decades spreading terror across the globe. President Trump made clear that any attack on Americans or our allies would be met with overwhelming force. May God bless and protect our troops as we confront the evil of Iran and its terrorist proxies.”\nRep. Nathaniel Moran: “Peace through strength in action.

August Pfluger: “Today, American airmen executed an operation at the direction of President Trump to eliminate Iranian nuclear facilities. I commend President Trump, the national security team, and the men and women who executed these orders on this successful mission. The Iranian regime is the largest sponsor of terrorism and the choice is now theirs… I hope they choose peace and a return to normalized society. But one thing is clear, they will not have a nuclear weapon.”\nRep. Guy Reschenthaler: “President Trump was right to strike Iran’s nuclear program. A nuclear Iran was a direct threat to our national security and our allies in the region. Iran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of our servicemembers. May God bless our nation and our troops.”\nRep. John Rose: “Our brave troops executed a well-planned and successful strike in Iran that signals a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter where there is no misunderstanding about American tolerance of a nuclear-armed Iran. @POTUS is leading with strength, and I fully support this action.”\nRep. David Rouzer: “I commend President Trump for taking decisive and resolute action to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

The time is now for the Iranian people to rise up against the radical regime.”\nRep. Keith Self: “This is what leadership from a Commander in Chief looks like.”\nRep. Adrian Smith: “Through months of talks between negotiators from his administration and Iranian officials, President Trump has shown he is committed to achieving peace for the United States and our allies. Today, he and brave American servicemembers acted decisively when it became clear the Iranian regime, which openly threatened to wield nuclear weapons, was not open to diplomatic engagement. America stands with the friends of freedom, and our forces will defend our people against all threats.”\nRep. Pete Stauber: “Iran has been wanting to eliminate the United States and Israel for decades. President Trump’s decision to surgically remove this threat was decisive leadership with the power of our extraordinary military force! This is peace through strength.”\nRep. Greg Steube: “President Trump made every effort to give Iran a peaceful off-ramp to dismantle its nuclear ambitions. The Ayatollah’s refusal to negotiate in good faith confirms what we’ve long known: Iran cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons. I’m deeply grateful to our brave men and women in uniform for executing their mission with courage and precision. And I thank President Trump for his decisive leadership during this critical moment.”\nRep. Dale Strong: “A nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to the entire world. They had ample time to come to the table and make a deal, but forced President Trump to take action to ensure the safety of our country and our allies.”\nRep. Marlin Stutzman: “Peace through strength means you have to be willing to prove your strength when adversaries will not accept the peaceful option.

Grateful our Airmen carried out the mission safely — their courage keeps us safe. FLY FIGHT WIN”\nRep. Derrick Van Orden: “Peace Through Strength. The terrorist regime in Iran’s time in the sun is over.”\nRep. Tim Walberg: “Tonight, President @realDonaldTrump displayed decisive action to eliminate the nuclear program of the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. President Trump pursued and exhausted diplomatic options, and to protect the security of our nation, this moment called for strong leadership. God bless America and God bless our troops.”\nRep. Ann Wagner: “Iran was given every chance to get rid of its nuclear program, but instead of choosing peace the Ayatollah embraced violence and chaos. President Trump was absolutely right to send our bombers in and strike the Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear facilities, and this decision will save American lives and protect our national security. He and I are in full agreement that we must achieve peace through strength, and today’s decisive strikes are a testament to that shared commitment. Iran cannot and will not have nuclear weapons and today is a direct result of the Ayatollah’s reckless choices…”\nRep. Randy Weber: “Iran should NEVER have their hands on a nuclear weapon. President Trump ensured that won’t happen. Congratulations on a successful mission.”\nRep. Roger Williams: “We must always stand with Israel. Iran should never have a nuclear weapon and I’m thankful that under @realDonaldTrump, our country is stronger than ever. God bless our military. We pray for their safety and for peace.”\nRep. Joe Wilson: “President Trump has been consistent in his willingness to engage in negotiations. Enemies of America insult this effort instead pursuing apocalyptic delusions. Ultimately, Peace is achieved through deterrence and Strength. Assad was warned in 2017. The Iranian regime was warned. War criminal Putin has been warned. President Trump will not hesitate to act when tested.”\nRep. Rob Wittman: “The President was right – Iran refused to commit to nuclear disarmament. This was the right decision. America must secure peace through strength. God bless our servicemen and women in uniform – I am praying for their safe return.”\nRep. Steve Womack: “I support the President’s decisive action to thwart Iran from completing a nuclear weapon. Our Israeli allies were instrumental in setting the conditions for these strikes, and President Trump’s decision ultimately makes America and our allies safer. I thank God for the bravery and safety of our servicemembers who made this mission a success.”\nRep. Rudy Yakym: “Thank you to our brave warfighters for defending the greatest nation on earth. God bless our troops and the United States of America!”\nRep. Ryan Zinke: “We gave Iran a chance, they didn’t take it. The President has been crystal clear: Iran must not have nuclear weapons. If they don’t give up their nuclear program, this will continue to escalate. They will lose their Army, Navy, what’s left of their Air Force AND they will lose their refineries. This is a fight they will not win. I pray for the freedom loving Iranian people who have lived under extremism for too long.”\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Since his inauguration, he has worked briskly to try to radically reshape the government and has signed dozens of executive orders, many upending policies created by former President Joe Biden. Trump took stock of what he's done so far and laid out his vision for the economy, immigration and foreign affairs.\nReporters from across NPR's newsroom fact-checked the address and offered context as the speech unfolded.\nBy topic: Immigration | Inflation | Energy | Culture | Spending and tax cuts | Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) | Trade and tariffs |Climate | Foreign policy\nImmigration\nUnlawful border crossings\nTRUMP: \"Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come.\"\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents had about 30,000 encounters with migrants attempting to cross the U.S. borders illegally in January, the agency reported. The agency has not reported the numbers for February, however Reuters reported last week that the administration is on track to report about 8,500 arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border for February. This could be the lowest number of crossings since Homeland Security started reporting the data in 2000.\nCBP has been recording apprehensions since 1925. In 1935, there were only 11,000 apprehensions nationwide for the full year. During President Biden's administration, unlawful crossings nationwide hit an all-time high in 2022 — CBP reported more than 2.2 million encounters. However, Biden's last full month in office, December 2024, saw about 48,000 encounters.\n— Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, Immigration Correspondent\nDeportations\n“I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our Homeland, and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder Dwight D. Eisenhower—a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders.\nIn his remarks, Trump referenced 1954's \"Operation Wetback\" — a racist term used to refer to migrants who crossed the Rio Grande. Government estimates of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's effort showed more than a million Mexican immigrants and some U.S. citizens were rounded up.\nSince then, other presidents have carried out large deportation actions throughout their terms. Former President Barack Obama's administration, for example, deported over 3 million people. But Trump's second administration's own efforts face long-standing logistical and capacity challenges.\n— Ximena Bustillo, DHS and Immigration Policy Reporter\nBiden allowing migrants into the U.S.\nTRUMP: \"In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\"\nThe nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that from 2021 to 2024, the Biden administration allowed more than 5.8 million immigrants into the U.S. They were temporarily allowed into the country through multiple parole and sponsorship programs, many of which have been dramatically curbed or ended by the Trump administration. Migrants who participated in these programs were vetted before being allowed into the country.\n— Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, Immigration Correspondent\nImmigrants and the workforce\nTRUMP: \"Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before.\"\nIncreased immigration — both legal and illegal — has helped to grow the labor force in recent years. It has allowed employers to keep adding jobs at a rapid clip without putting much upward pressure on prices, even as millions of baby boomers are retiring. From January 2024 to January 2025, for example, the foreign-born workforce grew by 2.1 million people while the larger native-born workforce added just 1.3 million.\nImmigration has slowed considerably in recent months, however. Foreign-born workers do not appear to be displacing the native-born workforce. The share of working-age men who were in the workforce in January was 89.4% — higher than all but one month during the first Trump administration. The share of working-age women who were in the workforce hit a record high of 78.4% last summer and has fallen only slightly since.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\n\"Gold card\"\n“We have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million it will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship.”\nTrump recently announced plans to create a \"gold card,\" which he said will allow \"very high-level people\" to apply to become a lawful permanent resident. His administration has pitched this as a replacement to the current EB-5 immigrant investor visa.\nBut the president can't solely create a new visa. That power lies with Congress. And significantly changing the EB-5 visa program would also require congressional action.\nSo far, a formal proposal has not been issued by the Trump administration, so it is unclear how he might modify the existing visa or lobby Congress to create a new one.\n— Ximena Bustillo, DHS and Immigration policy reporter\nTrump highlights his first law\nTRUMP: “That's why the very first bill I signed into law as 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public Safety, very strong, powerful act.”\nThe Laken Riley Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in January, expands the scope of those who can be arrested, detained and deported by federal immigration officers.\nThe measure directs federal immigration enforcement to detain and deport those without legal status charged with minor theft or shoplifting, assault of a law enforcement officer or crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury of another person.\nSeveral criminal offenses could already be grounds for deportation and supporters of immigration point to research that shows immigrants commit fewer crimes than those born in the U.S.\nThe legislation passed with bipartisan support from Democrats. Still, questions remain over the ability for federal law enforcement to fully implement the measure due to limited detention resources.\n— Ximena Bustillo, DHS and Immigration policy reporter\nInflation\nPrice of eggs\nTRUMP: \"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control – the egg prices out of control — and we are working hard to get it back down.\"\nOverall, grocery prices have begun to level off, rising less than 2% between January 2024 and January 2025. But many people still experience supermarket sticker shock. Eggs have been a particular sore spot lately, with prices jumping 53% over the last year. That's largely due to the ongoing challenge of avian flu, which has forced egg farmers to slaughter tens of millions of egg-laying chickens. The shortfall in egg supply has been compounded by panic buying — similar to what happened with toilet paper in 2020 — leading some stores to limit egg purchases. Last week, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced a $1 billion effort to combat avian flu, including $500 million for new sanitary precautions at egg farms. The USDA is also exploring vaccination for laying hens and increasing the supply of imported eggs.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nInflation under Biden\nTRUMP: \"Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief working families, as you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. They've never had anything like it. Suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even the history of our country. They're not sure, as President, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\"\nInflation soared to 9.1% in 2022 — the highest rate in 40 years, not 48 — in the wake of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Robust government spending likely added to the price hikes in the U.S., putting more money in people's pockets. Demand surged, outpacing tangled supply chains. But high inflation was a worldwide problem, even in countries where governments didn't spend so heavily.\nWhile inflation has since eased, settling at 3% in January, prices are still climbing faster than most people would like.\nWhile high prices are a source of frustration for many Americans, the average worker has more buying power today than she did before the pandemic. Since February 2020, just before the pandemic took hold in the U.S., consumer prices have risen 22.8% while average wages have risen 25.8%. Wages have been climbing faster than prices for the better part of two years.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nEnergy\nEnergy production\nTRUMP: \"The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly we have never seen anything like it.\"\nPresident Trump has promised to boost fossil fuel production, but the U.S. is already producing record amounts of oil and natural gas. Even though lease auctions and pipeline construction slowed during the Biden administration, crude oil production in 2023 reached 12.9 million barrels a day, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019. 2023 was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\" techniques.\nRecent years have also seen rapid growth in solar and wind power, while coal has continued to decline as a source of electricity.\nTrump is hostile to wind energy production. On his first day back in the White House, he signed an executive order temporarily blocking federal leases for offshore wind farms and halting permits for wind projects on land and offshore.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nCulture\nDefining two genders, male and female\nTRUMP: \"I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.”\nWhile DNA does indeed encode for two sexes, the way genes express themselves can create individuals who have atypical sexual development, including, in some cases, features of both sexes, such as both ovarian and testicular tissue. These individuals have conditions known as differences in sex development (also called intersex).\nIndividuals may identify with a gender that differs from their biological sex assigned at birth — and actions taken by the administration have sought to curb the rights of transgender people in the U.S. People who identify as transgender and nonbinary see this executive order as a form of discrimination that erases their identity on official documents.\n— Maria Godoy, Health Correspondent\nGender-affirming care for youth\nTRUMP: \"And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning, criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie, and our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\"\nResearch shows that legal efforts that aim to curb the rights of transgender youth are associated with serious negative mental health outcomes. A 2024 study in the journal Nature Human Behavior found that states that passed laws against gender-affirming care and other laws aimed at trans minors saw suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers increase by as much as 72% in subsequent years.\n— Maria Godoy, Health Correspondent\nEnding school indoctrination\nTRUMP: \"I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.\"\nEarlier in his speech, Trump also mentioned getting critical race theory out of schools. While Trump signed an executive action in late January \"ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling,\" the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Education, has little control over what is taught in local schools. The Every Student Succeeds Act, passed by Congress in 2015, expressly forbids federal interference in things like curriculum and teaching materials.\n— Cory Turner, Education Correspondent\nPoll numbers\nTRUMP: \"Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record 27-point swing since Election Day alone.\"\nMore people have said the country has been headed in the wrong direction than the right one for a long time. In an average of the polls compiled by RealClearPolitics it's been that way every month since June 2009 after former President Obama was sworn in.\nAnd despite improvements in those views since Trump won the election, mostly due to Republican enthusiasm, more people continue to say the country is headed in the wrong direction.\nThe latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll finds 54% think the country is headed in the wrong direction, while 45% said it's headed in the right direction. That is a significant improvement from December when 64% thought the country was headed in the wrong direction, again, largely due to Republicans.\nRCP has the average at 51% wrong direction, 43% right direction. It's an improvement, but not net-positive.\n— Domenico Montanaro, Senior Political Editor/Correspondent\nSpending and tax cuts\nTrump nods to Congress' role in extending his tax cuts\nTRUMP: \"The next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts.\"\nThe president is referring to plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted during his first administration. To achieve this, congressional Republicans plan to use a budget tool called reconciliation, which would allow them to pass major legislative items by a simple majority, relying entirely on GOP votes and avoiding the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.\nAlthough Republicans control both chambers of Congress, the Senate and the House haven't yet gotten on the same page in terms of how best to implement President Trump's agenda.\nThey have passed competing budget resolutions, which act as the first step in the reconciliation process. The Senate wants to split up some legislative priorities into two bills — tackling getting more resources to the southern border and boosting military spending first, and then dealing with the tax cut element later this year.\nThe House, concerned that getting its often-fractious conference — which has just a razor thin majority — on board with two bills is difficult, wants to address all the priorities in one large bill.\nReconciliation is only possible if both chambers ultimately get on board with the same plan.\n— Barbara Sprunt, Congressional correspondent\nTrump asks Congress to send him funding bill to sign\nTRUMP: \"I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder, President Dwight D Eisenhower, a moderate man, but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me funding without delay so I can sign it into law.\"\nTrump has met on several occasions with congressional Republicans from both chambers to discuss the legislative path forward to implementing his agenda.\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Trump's border czar Tom Homan told GOP senators in advance of the chamber passing a budget roadmap that $175 billion to secure the southern border would be enough money to implement Trump's border agenda for four years.\nThe House and Senate have not yet gotten on the same page as to how to move forward.\n— Barbara Sprunt, Congressional Correspondent\nNo tax on tips\nTRUMP: \"We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.\"\nWhile popular with many workers in tip-heavy industries like casinos, a big constituency in the swing state of Nevada, the idea has some drawbacks. Unless the lost tax revenue were replaced somehow, it would create an even bigger budget deficit. It would treat one class of workers, tipped employees, differently from all other workers. And it would invite gamesmanship as other workers try to have part of their own income reclassified as tax-free tips. Depending on how the exemption was structured, it could also result in lower retirement benefits for tipped workers.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nBalanced budget\nTRUMP: \"I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget. We're going to balance.\"\nThe federal debt has grown substantially in the last eight years, under both President Trump's first term and former President Biden's tenure. While the pandemic accounts for much of that red ink, both presidents oversaw large deficits, including periods before and after the pandemic when the economy was in good shape. Mounting debt, coupled with high interest rates, means that debt service has now become one of the government's biggest annual expenses. In the most recent fiscal year, the government paid $881 billion in interest — more than it spent on Medicare or national defense .\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\nSocial Security fraud\nTRUMP: \"We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program that our seniors and that our seniors, people that we love rely on, believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members, people aged 100 to 109 years old.”\nTrump and his adviser Elon Musk have both claimed, without evidence, that there is rampant fraud in the Social Security system. In his remarks, Trump asserted that government databases list millions of people aged well over 100 years old, including 1.3 million people between 150 to 159 years old and over 130,000 people aged over 160.\nBut a 2023 report from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said that there were nearly 19 million Social Security number-holders aged 100-plus who didn't have information about their deaths in the system and that \"almost none of the 18.9 million number-holders currently receive SSA payments.\"\nThe SSA's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, has also knocked down these claims.\n— Shannon Bond, Power and Influence Correspondent\nDOGE data\nTRUMP: \"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things, taking back a lot of that money.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency effort has made many claims about taxpayer money saved by cutting the federal workforce, terminating contracts and leases and other actions in the last month. Almost all of them are overstated and misleading, including those in Trump's lengthy monologue.\nDOGE's latest top line savings claim is $105 billion, with a fraction of that amount displayed on a \"wall of receipts.\" NPR's review of the \"receipts\" finds DOGE has deleted errors worth billions from its data, added new errors to its totals and frequently overstates savings. All of the line items Trump mentioned in his speech are real grants or contracts. But they likely offer little \"savings\" because of termination costs and the fact that many of them have already budgeted and spent to their limit. There's no evidence that any of these terminations are the result of fraud being discovered.\nAs for Trump's claim about debt reduction: As of Jan. 31 the federal government collected $1.6 trillion and spent $2.4 trillion this fiscal year, a deficit of about $840 billion.\n— Stephen Fowler, NPR Political Reporter covering the restructuring of the federal government\nTrump calls male circumcision foreign aid spending 'waste'\nTRUMP: \"Just listen to some of the appalling waste...Millions [of] dollars for male circumcision in Mozambique.\"\nIn 2023, Megan Peck — from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Global Health — wrote along with other experts that male circumcision programs are \"a critical component to ending the AIDS epidemic.\" It has been shown to dramatically reduce the chance of transmitting HIV from a female to a male.\n\"If a man is circumcised, it will reduce his chance of acquiring HIV by 60%,\" says Mary Mahy, the director for Data for Impact at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. The U.S. supported more than 10 million voluntary male circumcisions in eastern and southern Africa between 2010 and 2021.\n— Gabrielle Emanuel, Global Health Correspondent\nTrade and tariffs\nCost of tariffs\nTRUMP: \"Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again, and making America great again.\"\nPresident Trump has defended tariffs as a way to raise revenue for the government; a way to encourage more domestic manufacturing; and a bargaining chip to induce other countries to lower their own trade barriers. While Trump insists these tariffs are paid by foreign companies, most of the cost is borne by businesses and individuals in the United States.\nIf tariffs become a significant revenue source for the government, any shift from imports to domestic suppliers would jeopardize that funding stream. Likewise, if tariffs are a bargaining chip, the government revenue could be bargained away.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nReciprocation for trade deficits\nTRUMP: \"Whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.\"\nEarlier Tuesday, President Trump imposed stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, two of the United States' biggest trading partners. Most imported goods from those countries now face a 25% tax, although energy imports from Canada are being taxed at a lower rate of 10%. The president also added an additional 10% tariff today on all imports from China, on top of the 10% tax he imposed last month. While Trump insists these tariffs are paid by foreign companies, most of the cost is borne by businesses and individuals in the United States.\nCanada and China have already retaliated with tariffs of their own on U.S. exports, and Mexico has vowed to do the same in the coming days. Many exporters suffered from the trade wars during Trump's first term in the White House — especially farmers and manufacturers. Trump is also considering additional tariffs on steel, aluminum imports and other products.\n— Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent\nAuto industry investments\nTRUMP: \"By the way, we're gonna have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made, never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it, that, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today, all three top people, and they're so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\"\nThe last few years have seen a boom in new investments in auto manufacturing in the U.S., driven in large part by a shift toward electrification. Those investments were also boosted by tax credits that the Trump administration has signaled it would like to roll back, something that would require congressional action.\nTariffs certainly can incentivize companies to move production from overseas. However, auto executives have emphasized that they cannot make billion-dollar, multi-year decisions to open new factories based on tariffs that are subject to change in the near-term depending on what other countries do about border enforcement, fentanyl policies or other Trump administration priorities.\nReuters has reported that Honda is planning to produce its next-generation Civic in Indiana instead of Mexico in response to tariffs. Honda has not confirmed this, and because Honda already has a plant in Indiana that currently makes the Civic, such a move likely would not involve opening a new plant.\n— Camila Domonoske, Cars and Energy Correspondent\nTrump links tariffs and fentanyl\nTRUMP: \"So much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada. We have very large deficits with both of them, but even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\"\nPresident Trump continues to falsely link tariffs against Canada to fentanyl smuggling and fatal drug overdoses. Experts agree that the U.S.-Canada border plays almost no role in America's overdose crisis. Mexican drug cartels have contributed to tens of thousands of fentanyl deaths in the U.S., but fatal overdoses have fallen dramatically since 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data also shows fentanyl smuggling from Mexico has dropped over the last year.\n— Brian Mann, NPR Addiction Correspondent\nClimate\nClimate change\nTRUMP: \"I terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam.\"\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order \"terminating the Green New Deal.\" There is no Green New Deal that has been enacted by the U.S. government. The broad slogan encompasses an array of climate policy proposals advocated for by some Democratic lawmakers and progressive activists.\nUnder Trump's executive order, the administration froze grant payments for a broad array of climate and environmental projects under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Those laws were signed by former President Joe Biden and authorize hundreds of billions of dollars aimed at protecting the environment and spurring investment in clean energy and new infrastructure. Republican-led states have been big beneficiaries of that spending. Federal judges have ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze the funding.\n— Michael Copley, Climate Correspondent\nForeign Policy\nParis climate accord\nTRUMP: \"I withdrew from the unfair Paris climate accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.\"\nThe Paris Agreement, which was agreed to in 2015, requires countries to periodically submit goals or plans to reduce heat-trapping pollution. There is no punishment for countries that fail to deliver on their objectives. The goal of the agreement is to cut emissions in order to limit global warming and avoid the worst impact from things like more extreme storms, heat waves and floods. The agreement also reaffirmed that industrialized countries like the U.S., which built their wealth producing and using fossil fuels, should provide funding to help poorer nations deal with global warming. However, wealthy countries have been slow to deliver on their financial commitments.\n— Michael Copley, Climate Correspondent\nUkraine aid\nTRUMP: \"The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense.\"\nThe most widely used tracker of Ukraine aid shows the U.S. has provided $114 billion since the full-scale Russian invasion three years ago — though Trump often talks about $350 billion. It is not clear where he gets that figure. Over half of the aid the U.S. has provided is military aid, while the rest is financial and humanitarian. Additionally, Europe collectively has provided $132 billion.\n— Greg Myre, National Security Correspondent\nWatch NPR's full special coverage of the speech and the Democratic response from Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan:\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        |\nIn 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched their economic strategy: (1) establishing\nfiscal discipline, eliminating the budget deficit, keeping interest rates low, and spurring private-sector\ninvestment; (2) investing in people through education, training, science, and research; and (3) opening foreign\nmarkets so American workers can compete abroad. After eight years, the results of President Clinton's economic\nleadership are clear. Record budget deficits have become record surpluses, 22 million new jobs have been\ncreated, unemployment and core inflation are at their lowest levels in more than 30 years, and America is in the\nmidst of the longest economic expansion in our history.\nPresident Clinton's Record on the Economy: In 1992, 10 million Americans were unemployed, the\ncountry faced record deficits, and poverty and welfare rolls were growing. Family incomes were losing ground\nto inflation and jobs were being created at the slowest rate since the Great Depression. Today, America enjoys\nwhat may be the strongest economy ever.\n-\nStrong Economic Growth: Since President Clinton and Vice President Gore took office, economic growth has\naveraged 4.0 percent per year, compared to average growth of 2.8 percent during the Reagan-Bush years.\nThe economy has grown for 116 consecutive months, the most in history.\n-\nMost New Jobs Ever Created Under a Single Administration: The economy has created more than 22.5 million jobs\nin less than eight yearsthe most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were\ncreated in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, are in the private\nsector.\n-\nMedian Family Income Up $6,000 since 1993: Economic gains have been made across the spectrum as family incomes\nincreased for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income has increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in\n1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).\n-\nUnemployment at Its Lowest Level in More than 30 Years: Overall unemployment has dropped to the lowest level\nin more than 30 years, down from 6.9 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. The unemployment\nrate has been below 5 percent for 40 consecutive months. Unemployment for African Americans has fallen from\n14.2 percent in 1992 to 7.3 percent in October 2000, the lowest rate on record. Unemployment for Hispanics\nhas fallen from 11.8 percent in October 1992 to 5.0 percent in October 2000, also the lowest rate on record.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, averaging\n2.5 percent, and it is down from 4.7 percent during the previous administration.\n-\nHighest Homeownership Rate on Record: The homeownership rate reached 67.7 percent for the third quarter of\n2000, the highest rate on record. In contrast, the homeownership rate fell from 65.6 percent in the first\nquarter of 1981 to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993.\n-\n7 Million Fewer Americans Living in Poverty: The poverty rate has declined from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 11.8\npercent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer\npeople in poverty than there were in 1993.\nEstablishing Fiscal Discipline and Paying off the National Debt\nPresident Clinton's Record on Fiscal Discipline: Between 1981 and 1992, the national debt held by\nthe public quadrupled. The annual budget deficit grew to $290 billion in 1992, the largest ever, and was\nprojected to grow to more than $455 billion by Fiscal Year (FY) 2000. As a result of the tough and sometimes\nunpopular choices made by President Clinton, and major deficit reduction legislation passed in 1993 and 1997, we\nhave seen eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement for the first time in America's history.\n-\nLargest Surplus Ever: The surplus in FY 2000 is $237 billionthe third consecutive surplus and the\nlargest surplus ever.\n-\nLargest Three-Year Debt Pay-Down Ever: Between 1998-2000, the publicly held debt was reduced by $363\nbillionthe largest three-year pay-down in American history. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush,\nthe debt held by the public quadrupled. Under the Clinton-Gore budget, we are on track to pay off the\nentire publicly held debt on a net basis by 2009.\n-\nLower Federal Government Spending: After increasing under the previous two administrations, federal government\nspending as a share of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 2000the\nlowest level since 1966.\n-\nReduced Interest Payments on the Debt: In 1993, the net interest payments on the debt held by the public were\nprojected to grow to $348 billion in FY 2000. In 2000, interest payments on the debt were $125 billion lower\nthan projected.\n-\nAmericans Benefit from Reduced Debt: Because of fiscal discipline and deficit and debt reduction, it is\nestimated that a family with a home mortgage of $100,000 might expect to save roughly $2,000 per year in\nmortgage payments, like a large tax cut.\n-\nDouble Digit Growth in Private Investment in Equipment and Software: Lower debt will help maintain strong\neconomic growth and fuel private investments. With government no longer draining resources out of capital\nmarkets, private investment in equipment and software averaged 13.3 percent annual growth since 1993, compared\nto 4.7 percent during 1981 to 1992.\nTo Establish Fiscal Discipline, President Clinton:\n-\nEnacted the 1993 Deficit Reduction Plan without a Single Republican Vote. Prior to 1993, the debate over\nfiscal policy often revolved around a false choice between public investment and deficit reduction. The 1993\ndeficit reduction plan showed that deficit and debt reductions could be accomplished in a progressive way by\nslashing the deficit in half and making important investments in our future, including education, health care,\nand science and technology research. The plan included more than $500 billion in deficit reduction. It also\ncut taxes for 15 million of the hardest-pressed Americans by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit; created\nthe Direct Student Loan Program; created the first nine Empowerment Zones and first 95 Enterprise Communities;\nand passed tax cuts for small businesses and research and development.\n-\nNegotiated the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. In his 1997 State of the Union address, President\nClinton announced his plan to balance the budget for the first time in 27 years. Later that year, he signed\nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a major bipartisan agreement to eliminate the national budget deficit, create\nthe conditions for economic growth, and invest in the education and health of our people. It provided\nmiddle-class tax relief with a $500 per child tax credit and the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax\ncredits for college. It also created the Children's Health Insurance Program to serve up to 5 million\nchildren and made landmark investments in education initiatives including educational technology, charter\nschools, Head Start, and Pell Grants. Finally, it added 20 more Empowerment Zones and 20 more rural Enterprise\nCommunities, included the President's plan to revitalize the District of Columbia, and continued welfare\nreform though $3 billion in new resources to move welfare recipients to private-sector jobs.\n-\nDedicated the Surplus to Save Social Security and Reduce the National Debt. In his 1998 and 1999 State\nof the Union addresses, President Clinton called on the nation to save the surplus until the solvency of\nSocial Security is assured. He also repeatedly vetoed large Republican tax cut bills that would have\njeopardized our nation's fiscal discipline. The President's actions led to a bipartisan consensus on saving\nthe surplus and paying down the debt.\n-\nExtended Medicare Solvency from 1999 to 2025. When President Clinton took office, Medicare was\nexpected to become insolvent in 1999, then only six years away. The 1993 deficit reduction act dedicated\nsome of the taxes paid by Social Security beneficiaries to the Medicare Trust Fund and extended the life of\nMedicare by three years to 2002. Thanks to additional provisions to combat waste, fraud and abuse and\nbipartisan cooperation in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Medicare is now expected to remain solvent until\n2025.\n|\nClinton-Gore Economic Policy Has Dramatically Improved the Economy\n\"My colleagues and I have been very appreciative of your [President Clinton's] support of the Fed over the\nyears, and your commitment to fiscal discipline has been instrumental in achieving what in a few weeks will be\nthe longest economic expansion in the nation's history.\"\nAlan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, January 4, 2000, with President Clinton at\nChairman Greenspan's re-nomination announcement\n\"The deficit has come down, and I give the Clinton Administration and President Clinton himself a lot of\ncredit for that. [He] did something about it, fast. And I think we are seeing some benefits.\"\nPaul Volcker, Federal Reserve Board Chairman (1979-1987), in Audacity, Fall 1994\nOne of the reasons Goldman Sachs cites for the \"best economy ever\" is that \"on the policy side, trade,\nfiscal, and monetary policies have been excellent, working in ways that have facilitated growth without\ninflation. The Clinton Administration has worked to liberalize trade and has used any revenue windfalls to\nreduce the federal budget deficit.\"\nGoldman Sachs, March 1998\n\"Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion over five years,\nsparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and systems that\nbrought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity.\"\nBusiness Week, May 19, 1997\n|\nOpening World Markets to American Goods and Providing Leadership on Globalization\nPresident Clinton's Record on Trade and Globalization: In 1992, 10 million Americans were\nunemployed, new job creation was slow, and wages were stagnant. Other nations' high trade barriers limited the\nability of American businesses and farmers to sell their goods abroad and hampered economic recovery. Our trade\npolicies failed to reflect our values by failing to take into account the responsibility to protect our\nenvironment, eliminate child labor and sweatshops, and protect the rights of workers around the world.\nBut today:\n-\n300 Trade Agreements: President Clinton has opened markets for U.S. exports abroad and created American jobs through nearly 300 free and fair trade agreements.\n-\nThe Most U.S. Exports Ever. Between 1992 and 2000, U.S. exports of goods and services grew by 74 percent, or nearly $500 billion, to top $1 trillion for the first time.\n-\n1.4 Million More Jobs due to Exports: Jobs supported by American exports grew by 1.4 million between 1994 and 1998, with jobs supported by exports paying about 13 percent to 16 percent above the U.S. national average. Jobs related to goods exports pay, on average, 13 to 16 percent higher than other jobs.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, in part because global competition has kept prices low. It has averaged 2.5 percent under this Administration, down from 4.6 percent during the previous administration.\nTo Create Trade Opportunities and Expand the Benefits of Globalization, President Clinton:\n-\nWon Ratification of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, creating the world's largest\nfree\ntrade zone of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. U.S. exports to Mexico grew 109 percent from 1993 to 1999, while exports to the rest of the world grew by 49 percent.\n-\nWon Approval of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. In 2000, Congress ratified permanent normal trade relations with China. The agreement will integrate China into the world economy through entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), open Chinese market to U.S. exports, slash Chinese tariffs, and protect American workers and companies against dumping.\n-\nSuccessfully Completed the Uruguay Round. The 1994 Uruguay Round transformed the world trading system, opening markets in a wide range of industries, enabling the U.S. to enforce agreements more effectively, and applying the rules for the first time to all WTO members (now 138 in total).\n-\nFought for the First-Ever African and the Caribbean Basin Trade Bills. The African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 will support increased trade and investment between the United States and Africa, strengthen African economies and democratic governments, and increase partnerships to counter terrorism, crime, environmental degradation and disease. The legislation will also create incentives for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin to continue reforming their economies.\n-\nPromoted Trade Opportunities for High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors. These efforts are the building blocks of the New Economy.\n-\nSecured Historic Debt Relief. In March 1999, President Clinton presented a plan to a U.S.-Africa Summit in Washington that became the basis for the G-7 agreement in Cologne, Germany (known as the Cologne Debt Initiative). The plan would triple the amount of debt relief available for poor countries, reducing their debt by about 70 percent ($90 billion), in return for firm commitments to channel the benefits into improving the lives of all their people. In September 1999, the President announced that the U.S. would unilaterally exceed the terms of the G-7 initiative and entirely cancel the $5.7 billion in U.S. government debt owed by qualifying countries. In November 2000, President Clinton won $435 million from Congress for U.S. participation in the Cologne Initiative.\n-\nDramatically Expanded U.S. Efforts to Fight Child Labor and Expand Basic Education. In June 1999, the President traveled to the International Labor Organization (ILO) conference in Geneva, Switzerland, to urge adoption of an historic international convention banning the worst forms of child labor. He won $30 million for ILO enforcement of child labor laws and is fighting for a new initiative to promote basic education in areas of the world where child labor is widespread. In 2000, at U.S. urging, the G-8 countries endorsed the goal of universal basic education. President Clinton brought other issues to the forefront of the international economic agenda, including incorporating labor and environmental considerations in the work of major international economic institutions, increasing U.S. support for global efforts to fight HIV-AIDS and infectious diseases, and closing the digital divide.\n-\nDefused International Economic Crises. In 1995, after Congress refused to act, President Clinton made $20 billion in emergency loans to Mexico to stabilize the country's financial markets. Mexico repaid the loans in full, with interest, three years ahead of schedule. Following the Asian and Russian financial crises in 1997 and 1998, the Clinton-Gore Administration led a global effort to re-capitalize the International Monetary Fund to allow it to more effectively deal with these problems. President Clinton also insisted that the G-7 develop a set of measures to restore confidence in the world financial system.\n-\nPromoted U.S. Competitiveness. The Clinton-Gore Administration has made key investments in education and training for American workers and research and development. It has also maintained federal fiscal discipline, helping to reduce interest rates, encourage private-sector investment, and keep productivity high.\nRewarding Work and Empowering Communities\nPresident Clinton's Record on Rewarding Work: In 1992, unemployment reached 7.5 percent, the\nhighest level in eight years. Unemployment and poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanics were\nalarming: unemployment reached 14.2 percent for African Americans and 11.8 percent for Hispanics, and poverty\nrates for both groups were nearly 30 percent. But today:\n-\nHigher Incomes at All Levels: After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower-income families, all income brackets have experienced double-digit income growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate in 20 Years: Since Congress passed President Clinton's Economic Plan in 1993, the poverty rate declined from 15.1 percent to 11.8 percent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 1993. The child poverty rate has declined more than 25 percent, the poverty rate for single mothers is the lowest ever, the African American and elderly poverty rates dropped to their lowest level on record, and the Hispanic poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1979.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate for Single Mothers on Record: Under President Clinton, the poverty rate for families with single mothers has fallen from 46.1 percent in 1993 to 35.7 percent in 1999, the lowest level on record. Between 1980 and 1992, an additional 2.1 million households headed by single women were pushed into poverty.\n-\nSmallest Welfare Rolls Since 1969: Under the Clinton-Gore Administration, the welfare rolls have dropped\ndramatically and are now the lowest since 1969. Between January 1993 and September of 1999, the number of welfare recipients dropped by 7.5 million (a 53 percent decline) to 6.6 million. In comparison, between 1981-1992, the number of welfare recipients increased by 2.5 million (a 22 percent increase) to 13.6 million people.\nTo Help All Americans Benefit from Prosperity, President Clinton:\n-\nEnded Welfare as We Knew It. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation requiring welfare recipients to work, limiting the time they can stay on welfare, and providing child care and health care to help them begin work. It also enacted tough new child support enforcement measures proposed by the President. In 1997, President Clinton won the welfare-to-work tax credit to encourage employers to hire long-term welfare recipients and $3 billion in additional resources to help communities move long-term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.\n-\nRewarded Work by Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in winning passage of an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. The 1993 Clinton-Gore economic plan created nine Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities to spur local community planning and economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. The President won expansions of the program in 1994, 1997, and again in 2000. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nCreated Community Development Financial Institutions. In September 1994, the President signed legislation creating the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, a Clinton campaign proposal to support specialized financial institutions serving often-overlooked customers and communities. The Fund has certified over 400 CDFIs. It has provided over $427 million to match investments in CDFIs and to encourage traditional financial institutions to increase their lending, investment and services in under-served markets.\n-\nStrengthened the Community Reinvestment Act. In 1995, the Administration updated the Community Reinvestment Act regulations to focus on banks' actual service delivery, rather than on compliance efforts. From 1993 to 1998, lenders subject to the law increased mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income families by 80 percentmore than twice the rate they increased mortgage lending to other income groups.\n-\nEncouraged Investment in America's New Markets. In 1999, the President went on two historic \"New Markets\" trips to highlight the continuing need to bring investment to impoverished inner cities, rural communities and Native American tribal lands. In 2000, the President and Congress worked together to pass this bipartisan initiative to stimulate new private capital investments in economically distressed communities and build network of private investment institutions to funnel credit, equity and technical assistance to businesses in America's new markets.\n-\nRaised the Minimum Wage. In 1996, President Clinton and Vice President Gore fought for and won a 90-cent per hour increase in the minimum wage, helping 10 million workers.\n-\nHelped People with Disabilities Work. In 1999, President Clinton insisted that Congress pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act as a condition of the budget agreement. This bipartisan law allows people with disabilities to maintain their Medicare or Medicaid coverage when they work.\nModernizing for the New Economy through Technology and Consensus Deregulation\nTo Capitalize on the Information Technology Revolution, President Clinton and Vice President Gore Have:\n-\nModernized Financial Services Laws. In 1993, the laws that governed America's financial service sector were antiquated and anti-competitive. The Clinton-Gore Administration fought to modernize those laws to increase competition in traditional banking, insurance, and securities industries to give consumers and small businesses more choices and lower costs. In 1994, the Clinton-Gore Administration broke another decades-old logjam by allowing banks to branch across state lines in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. President Clinton fought for and won financial modernization legislation, signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999.\n-\nReformed Telecommunications. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation to open up competition between local telephone companies, long distance providers and cable companies. The law also requires the use of new V-chip technology to give families greater control over which television programming comes into their homes.\n-\nCreated the E-Rate. With the leadership of Vice President Gore, the Telecommunications Act contained the E-Rate initiative, which provides low-cost Internet connections for schools, libraries, rural health clinics and hospitals. More than 80 percent of America's public schools have benefited from the E-rate, which has helped connect 30 million children and up to 47,000 schools and libraries to the Internet. The percentage of public schools connected to the Internet has increased from 35 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in 1999. The percentage of classrooms connected to the Internet has increased from 3 percent in 1994 to 63 percent in 1999.\n-\nIncreased Resources for Educational Technology by Over 3,000 Percent. President Clinton and Vice President Gore increased our investment in educational technology by over 3,000 percent, from $23 million in FY 1994 to $769 million in FY 2000, including training over 600,000 new teachers to use technology effectively in the classroom.\n-\nPaved the Way for Electronic Commerce. President Clinton fought to eliminate legal barriers to using electronic technology to form and sign contracts, collect and store documents, and send and receive notices and disclosures, while ensuring that consumers on-line have the same protections that they have in the paper world. He signed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act on June 30, 2000.\n-\nCreating Market Opportunities for Technology Firms. The Clinton-Gore Administration adopted a market-led approach on e-commerce, making spectrum available for digital wireless, and reforming Cold War export controls.\n-\nWorked to Close the Digital Divide. Since 1992, the President and Vice President have tripled funding for Community Technology Centers, which provide access to computers and the Internet to low-income urban and rural neighborhoods. President Clinton also challenged the private sector to develop new business models for low-cost computers and Internet access to make universal access at home affordable for all Americans. The Technology Literacy Challenge Fund has provided $1 billion in federal resources to help schools work with businesses and community organizations to put modern computers, high-quality educational software, and affordable connections to the Internet in every classroom. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a temporary tax deduction for donations of computers to elementary and secondary schools.\n-\nForged Trade Agreements on High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors; all soon to be capped by the opening of a major networked economy initiative.\nInvesting in Educating and Training the American People\nPresident Clinton's Record on Investing in Americans:\n-\nMore Americans Are Enrolling in College: 66 percent of 1998 high school graduates enrolled in college or trade school the next fall, compared to 60 percent in 1990.\n-\nMore High School Students Are Preparing for College: The percentage of high school graduates who have taken four years of English and three years each of math, science, and social studies increased from 38 percent to 55 percent between 1990 and 1998. Research shows that high-quality academics in high school is key to college success.\n-\nMore Americans Are Earning College Degrees: Over 32 percent of 25- to 29-year-old high school graduates had earned at least a bachelor's degree in 1999, up from 27 percent in 1990. In particular, white and African American women have seen their college opportunities grow.\n-\nAmericans Are Becoming Lifelong Learners: 50 percent of adults participated in formal learning in the year prior to a 1999 survey, up from 38 percent in 1991.\nTo Provide Americans with More, Higher-Quality Education and Training, President Clinton:\n-\nCreated the College Tax Credits, the Largest Single Investment in Higher Education since the G.I. Bill. A $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of college, the Hope Scholarship will pay for nearly all of a typical community college's tuition and fees. The $1,000 Lifetime Learning Tax Credit reimburses families for 20 percent of their tuition and fees (up to $5,000 per family) for college, graduate study, or job training. Starting in 2003, the credit will reimburse families for 20 percent of their costs up to $10,000, for a maximum value of $2,000. This year, 10 million American families will save over $7 billion through the college tax credits.\n-\nDoubled Student Financial Aid. Students will receive over $50 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study aid this year, up from $25 billion in 1993. President Clinton has consistently supported budget increases for Pell Grants; this year, over 3.8 million needy students receive a Pell Grant scholarship of up to $3,300, a $1,000 larger maximum grant than in 1993. The President won another increase for Pell Grants in the FY 2001 budget, bringing the maximum grant to $3,750. The President also won increases in work-study funding to help one million students pay for college.\n-\nCreated Direct Student Loans and Reduced Interest Rates. In the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, President Clinton won the Direct Student Loan program to improve customer service and compete with guaranteed lenders. It has saved taxpayers over $4 billion so far by eliminating lender subsidies. President Clinton also fought to reduce interest rates and fees in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. As a result, students can expect to pay $1,300 less in interest and fees for the average $10,000 loan than they would have in 1992. The student loan default rate is now 6.9 percent, down from 22.4 percent eight years ago.\n-\nCreated New Paths to College through GEAR UP, AmeriCorps, and TRIO. President Clinton won the new GEAR UP initiative in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 which is already helping 700,000 low-income middle school students prepare for college. Over 150,000 Americans have earned money for college while serving their communities through President Clinton's AmeriCorps program, a campaign promise enacted in 1993. To help disadvantaged youth prepare for and succeed in college, the TRIO programs have grown by $342 million over the past eight years.\n-\nStrengthened Elementary and Secondary Education. In 1994, President Clinton reformed federal education initiatives in the Improving America's Schools Act and the Goals 2000 Act. The President's new approach was grounded in the principles that all of America's students should meet high academic standards and the federal government should make new investments to help them meet those standards. The President has also fought to hire 100,000 teachers, promote educational technology, support charter schools, build K-16 partnerships, and focus on early reading through America Reads.\n-\nPassed the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. In 1992, President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed to streamline and bring greater accountability to our nation's job training system. In 1998, they won legislation to meet the needs of both America's workers and businesses by encouraging local control of training and employment programs; helping customers locate assistance through one-stop centers; and empower adults to receive the training they need.\nReducing Tax Burdens for Average and Hard-Pressed Working Families.\nThe Clinton Record on Reducing Taxes for Working Families:\n-\nLowest Federal Income Tax Burden in 35 Years: Federal income taxes as a percentage of income for the typical American family have dropped to their lowest level in 35 years.\n-\nHigher Incomes even after Taxes and Inflation: Real after-tax incomes have grown for Americans at all income levels, much faster than they did prior to the Clinton-Gore Administration. Real after-tax incomes grew by an average of 2.6 percent per year for the lower-income half of taxpayers between 1993 and 1997, while growing by an average of 1.0 percent between 1981 and 1993.\nTo Cut Taxes for Working Americans, President Clinton:\n-\nExpanded the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated the $500 per Child Tax Credit. In 1997, President Clinton secured a $500 per child tax credit for 27 million families with children under 17, including 13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000.\n-\nWon the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit. President Clinton proposed tax credits for college tuition in 1996 and signed them into law in 1997 as part of the balanced budget agreement. The Hope Scholarship provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 for tuition and fees for the first two years of college, roughly equal to the cost of the average community college. It will save American families $4.9 billion this year.\n-\nWon the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Also enacted in 1997, the Lifetime Learning tax credit provides a 20 percent tax credit on $5,000 of tuition and fees (to be raised to $10,000 in 2003) for college and graduate students and adults taking job training. It will reduce the cost of college and job training for American families by $2.4 billion this year.\n-\nEstablished Education IRAs. The 1997 balanced budget agreement also created Education IRAs. For each child under age 18, families may now deposit $500 per year into an Education IRA in the child's name. Earnings in the Education IRA accumulate tax-free and no taxes will be due upon withdrawal if the money is used to pay for college. The law also allowed taxpayers to withdraw funds from a traditional IRA without penalty to pay for higher education for themselves or their spouse, child, or even grandchild.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. President Clinton created Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in 1993 and expanded them in 1994, 1997 and again in 2000 to spur economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nSimplified Pension Rules. In 1996, President Clinton signed the SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) plan into law, simplifying and expanding retirement plan coverage for small businesses.\n-\nSimplified Tax Laws and Protected Taxpayer Rights. President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to simplify the tax laws and enhance taxpayers' rights. The law has saved families and businesses millions of hours be simplifying and reducing paperwork, such as allowing a tax exclusion for income from the sale of a home.\n-\nClosed Tax Loopholes. To ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share, the Clinton Administration addressed the use and proliferation of corporate tax shelters by proposing several remedies to curb the growth of such shelters by increasing disclosure of sheltering activities, increasing and strengthening the substantial understatement penalty, codifying the judicially-created economic substance doctrine, and providing consequences to all parties involved in an abusive sheltering transaction.\n|\nPRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE\nTrade Expands Opportunity for American Workers\n\"Harley-Davidson is growing rapidly, and sales to other countries is one reason why. President Clinton's efforts to open foreign markets have made a difference and helped create jobs at Harley-Davidson.\"\nBobby Ramsey began working at the Harley-Davidson York plant in 1972 and is now responsible for inspecting all incoming motorcycle parts prior to the assembly process. Since 1995, Mr. Ramsey has also been his union's Chief Shop Steward, which entails handling all second step grievances of workers and helping represent his co-workers to management. U.S. exports of motorcycles and parts have grown by 15 percent a year from 1987 to 1998, reaching one-third of industry sales. Harley-Davidson will export 22 percent of the motorcycles produced in Mr. Ramsey's plant. By 2003, Harley-Davidson expects to double production from 1996 levels largely because of exports, creating new jobs for American workers.\n\"Kodak and its employees have experienced significant gains because of NAFTA. The NAFTA has enabled Kodak to realize considerable tariff savings and to make production decisions based on rational economic grounds rather than on tariff considerations. For example, the agreement has enabled Kodak to transfer a high-cost sensitizing operation for color negative film from Mexico to Rochester, New York. In all, NAFTA has been a win-win-win for Kodak's operations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\"\nDan Carp, President and CEO of the Eastman Kodak company, credits NAFTA with Kodak's rapid growth in export sales. Eastman Kodak manufactures high technology imaging products for sale in 160 countries. Under NAFTA, Mexican duties on film and photo paper have been reduced from 15 to 30 percent to 6 to 9 percent, and they will be eliminated by 2004. Kodak's exports to Mexico have more than doubled since 1993, creating greater stability and more job opportunities for Kodak's 54,000 employees.\nMaking the Dream of Homeownership a Reality\n\"I feel true independence in owning my own home. To those who think it's impossible: It is possible. Don't let anyone talk you out of it.\"\nLucy Vocu, a teacher and single mother. Lucy Vocu has lived on the Pine Ridge reservation all her life. In 1985, Lucy got her GED, and in 1994, she graduated from Oglala Lakota College with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. She currently works for the Shannon County school system at Wolf Creek School. Her children, Grace, 15, and Jacob, 7, spend a lot of time using their computer. Jacob recently tracked tornadoes on the Internet. Lucy is a first-time homeowner. She moved from a two-bedroom rental house into this new three-bedroom home, which offers more privacy. Lucy is excited about being a new homeowner and, if her budget allows, she hopes to add to her new home a swing set for Jacob and a basketball net for Grace.\n|\n|\n\"The social workers at Marion House, which has received funding from HUD's homeless grants, helped me get back on my feet. They counseled me on how to find a job and helped me learn the skills I would need to stay employed. Today I am newly married, and I have been working the last four years as a secretary for a social service agency. And I am delighted to say . . . I am a homeowner. Because of your leadership President Clinton, and because of your commitment to providing funding for homeless programs across the country, there will be hope and optimism in place of despair.\"\nChrista Spangler, of Baltimore, MD, December 23, 1998. Christa Spangler was a formerly homeless woman who hit rock bottom in 1994 when she was forced to live in her car. Previously, she had lost custody of her children, and spent eleven years in and out of halfway houses, rehab clinics, and hospitals. She found her way to Marion House, a Catholic transitional housing program for homeless women and children. Christa is now married, working as a receptionist and living in her own home. Federal resources pay 25 percent of the Marion House budget.\nEmpowerment Zones Are a Potent Weapon Against Poverty\n\"I am living proof that the Empowerment Zone works! If it wasn't for the Empowerment Zone, I would have never have had the chance to buy this building or to expand my business. We are fighting the war against poverty throughout our neighborhoods and cities, but we have a very potent weapon the Empowerment Zones. And we will use that weapon to win this war because, after all, our future and our children's future depends on it. We must never give up hope.\"\nNancy Santana, 37, is a single mother of three who lives in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She used resources and a loan she obtained through her local Empowerment Zone to move from welfare to start her own business, Nancy Santana's Cleaning and Maintenance Services. Four years later, her business employs over 25 people, many of whom she recruited off of welfare.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Expand Economic Opportunity\n\"President Clinton's efforts have been very helpful to me. I had trouble getting funding from other sources. The Enterprise Corporation of the Delta has worked with me and people in my community, helping us improve our position in life. Now, I can get into this business, where otherwise I could not have.\"\nEphron Lewis co-founded Lewis & Sons Rice Processing the only African-American-owned rice processing company in the country with his father. The construction of his plant was made possible by a loan and technical assistance from the Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, a community development financial institution supported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He now farms roughly 3,000 acres, producing rice, wheat and soybeans.\n|\n|\nEncouraging the Growth of Small Businesses\n\"I started my small consulting and legal firm with the principle that everyone should have a shot at the twin American dreams of owning your own business and owning your own home. I look for the dreamers, the ones who want to be a part of this country in the best way, but who don't have the tools and information they need. I hope to be an instrument of growth and change in Brooklyn's Latino community through increased business opportunities. This SBA loan will allow me to set up an office outside my home, close to where I can make the most of the services I have to offer.\"\nEnealia Nau, Small Business Owner from Brooklyn, NY. Enealia Nau is a first-generation American who operates a small business consulting firm from her home in Brooklyn. After putting herself through college and law school, Ms. Nau started her consulting firm that focuses on the legal and financial needs of the minority communities from which she draws her clients. Ms. Nau helps families from minority communities realize the American dream through starting their own businesses from beauty shops to corner stores and buying their first homes. She has seen many clients start from nothing and build prosperous lives for their families through small businesses, including one client who started with a small \"bodega\" and now owns one of the largest grocery stores in Brooklyn.\nExpanding Economic Opportunity by Closing the Digital Divide\n\"Bridging the technology gap in Indian Country is a major challenge, and I am grateful for the attention that the Clinton Administration has given to this critical issue. The National Congress of American Indians is building on the initiatives announced during the President's Digital Divide tour stop at the Navajo Nation in April 2000 through its Tribal Leaders Digital Divide Task Force, funded through the AOL Foundation. Through the Task Force, we are actively working with industry, federal officials, and others to forge a new tribal-based partnerships and policy recommendations to close the technology gap.\"\nSusan Masten, President, National Congress of American Indians, and Chairwoman, Yurok Tribe. Susan Masten has served as a strong advocate for the betterment of Native communities on a local, state and national level for 22 years.\n\"Community technology centers provide low-income individuals with skills training and the ability to produce their dreams. They are also an important entryway to the technology industry. We think of President Clinton as our first angel investor; his Administration's work has been fundamental to Plugged In and to the community technology center movement.\"\nMagda Escobar, Executive Director, Plugged In, East Palo Alto, California.

Hardworking Americans have made clear that they do not want Obamacare, which has caused healthcare costs to increase all across the country. It is a shame the President refuses to swallow his pride and admit that this law is not working.”\nCongressman Gary Palmer (R-Hoover) said, “Obamacare is a massive federal takeover of our health care industry that takes away choices from people and limits our freedom. What’s more, it has been a failure. When Obamacare was passed, the American people were told if they liked their doctor, they could keep their doctor. They were told that medical care costs would be cut. They were told that Obamacare would reduce the deficit. They were told that premium prices would drop. They were told that it would not fund abortion, nor force anyone to violate their conscience. We now know the opposite of all these things is true.”\nCongresswoman Martha Roby (R-Montgomery) said, “This action puts accountability for this deceptive, costly healthcare law squarely on the president.”\nRep. Byrne said, “The silver lining here is that we now have a path forward to get rid of Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood once a different President is in the White House. The American people have now seen the path toward two very different Americas, and voters will have a clear choice in November.”\nCongressman Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina) said in a statement, “HR3762 repealed major provisions of Obamacare and reduced the deficit by $516 billion over the next ten years. This repeal is necessary because Obamacare has failed to lower healthcare costs, led to increased deductibles, which have saddled many Americans with massive medical debts, and forced millions of Americans off of their health insurance plans, not living up to the President’s promise ‘if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.’”\nRepresentative Gowdy continued, “Additionally, the bill stopped the horrific Planned Parenthood practices, which are not only barbaric, but may violate federal law. Taxpayers should not, in any circumstance, be forced to fund abortion providers. Speaker Ryan has stated the House will hold a vote to override the President’s veto. Beyond that vote, I remain committed to repealing Obamacare and ensuring Planned Parenthood does not receive federal funds for performing abortions.”\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), “We have now shown that with a Republican president, there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the United States Senate. We are confronting the president with the hard, honest truth. Obamacare does not work. It has to go. Higher premiums, fewer choices, restricted access—these are not signs of success. These are signs of failure. And the American people deserve better.”\nHR3762 was a budget “reconciliation” bill that would have repealed major components of Obamacare and placed a one-year moratorium on Planned Parenthood funding. Previous attempts to repeal Obamacare passed the Republican controlled US House of Representatives; but died in the Senate where Democrats retained control until last year and where the 60 vote threshold needed to cut off debate makes passing legislation without strong bipartisan support almost impossible. HR3762 used rules for budget reconciliation to avoid a filibuster and instead needed only a simple majority to pass.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Affordable Care Act\n| Long title | An Act Entitled The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act |\n|---|---|\n| Acronyms (colloquial) | ACA, PPACA |\n| Nicknames | Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Health Insurance Reform, Healthcare Reform |\n| Enacted by | the 111th United States Congress |\n| Effective | March 23, 2010 Most major provisions phased in by January 2014; remaining provisions phased in by 2020; penalty enforcing individual mandate set at $0 starting 2019 |\n| Citations | |\n| Public law | 111–148 |\n| Statutes at Large | 124 Stat. 119 through 124 Stat. 1025 (906 pages) |\n| Codification | |\n| Acts amended | Public Health Service Act |\n| Titles amended | 42 U.S.C.: Public Health and Social Welfare |\n| Legislative history | |\n| |\n| Major amendments | |\n| Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 | |\n| United States Supreme Court cases | |\n|\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and informally as Obamacare, is a landmark U.S. federal statute enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Together with amendments made to it by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[1][2][3][4] Most of the act remains in effect.\nThe ACA's major provisions came into force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured share of the population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered.[5][6] The law also enacted delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After it came into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.[7] The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and changes to individual insurance markets. Both received new spending, funded by a combination of new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports stated that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, that repealing ACA would increase the deficit,[8][9] and that the law reduced income inequality.[10]\nThe act largely retained the existing structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market, but individual markets were radically overhauled.[1][11] Insurers were made to accept all applicants without charging based on pre-existing conditions or demographic status (except age). To combat the resultant adverse selection, the act mandated that individuals buy insurance (or pay a monetary penalty) and that insurers cover a list of \"essential health benefits\". Young people were allowed to stay on their parents' insurance plans until they were 26 years old.\nBefore and after its enactment the ACA faced strong political opposition, calls for repeal, and legal challenges. In the Sebelius decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could choose not to participate in the law's Medicaid expansion, but otherwise upheld the law.[12] This led Republican-controlled states not to participate in Medicaid expansion. Polls initially found that a plurality of Americans opposed the act, although its individual provisions were generally more popular.[13] By 2017, the law had majority support.[14] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 set the individual mandate penalty at $0 starting in 2019.[15][16]\nProvisions\nACA amended the Public Health Service Act of 1944 and inserted new provisions on affordable care into Title 42 of the United States Code.[1][2][3][17][4] The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, and many of the law's regulations applied specifically to this market,[1] while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained.[2] Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system.[2]\nInsurance regulations: individual policies\nAll new individual major medical health insurance policies sold to individuals and families faced new requirements.[18] The requirements took effect on January 1, 2014. They include:\n- Guaranteed issue prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals because of preexisting conditions.[19]\n- States were required to ensure the availability of insurance for individual children who did not have coverage via their families.\n- A partial community rating allows premiums to vary only by age and location, regardless of preexisting conditions. Premiums for older applicants can be no more than three times those for the youngest.[20]\n- Essential health benefits must be provided. The National Academy of Medicine defines the law's \"essential health benefits\" as \"ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care\"[21][22] and others[23] rated Level A or B[24] by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.[25] In determining essential benefits, the law required that standard benefits should offer at least that of a \"typical employer plan\".[26] States may require additional services.[27]\n- Preventive care and screenings for women.[28] \"[A]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity\".[29] This mandate applies to all employers and educational institutions except for religious organizations.[30][31] These regulations were included on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine.[32][33]\n- Annual and lifetime coverage caps on essential benefits were banned.[34][35][36]\n- Insurers are forbidden from dropping policyholders when they become ill.[37][38]\n- All policies must provide an annual maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP) payment cap for an individual's or family's medical expenses (excluding premiums). After the MOOP payment is reached, all remaining costs must be paid by the insurer.[39]\n- Preventive care, vaccinations and medical screenings cannot be subject to co-payments, co-insurance or deductibles.[40][41][42] Specific examples of covered services include: mammograms and colonoscopies, wellness visits, gestational diabetes screening, HPV testing, STI counseling, HIV screening and counseling, contraceptive methods, breastfeeding support/supplies and domestic violence screening and counseling.[43]\n- The law established four tiers of coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. All categories offer essential health benefits. The categories vary in their division of premiums and out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans have the lowest monthly premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs, while platinum plans are the reverse.[26][44] The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).[45]\n- Insurers are required to implement an appeals process for coverage determination and claims on all new plans.[37]\n- Insurers must spend at least 80–85% of premium dollars on health costs; rebates must be issued if this is violated.[46][47]\nIndividual mandate\nThe individual mandate[48] required everyone to have insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate and limits on open enrollment[49][50] were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral, minimize the free rider problem and prevent the healthcare system from succumbing to adverse selection.\nThe mandate was intended to increase the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs.[51]\nAmong the groups who were not subject to the individual mandate are:\n- Illegal immigrants. Estimated at 8 million, roughly a third of the 23 million projection, they are ineligible for insurance subsidies and Medicaid.[52][53] They remain eligible for emergency services.\n- Medicaid-eligible citizens not enrolled in Medicaid.[54]\n- Citizens whose insurance coverage would cost more than 8% of household income.[54]\n- Citizens who live in states that opt-out of Medicaid expansion and who qualify for neither existing Medicaid coverage nor subsidized coverage.[55]\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,[56] set to $0 the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate, starting in 2019.[57]\nExchanges\nACA mandated that health insurance exchanges be provided for each state. The exchanges are regulated, largely online marketplaces, administered by either federal or state governments, where individuals, families and small businesses can purchase private insurance plans.[58][59][60] Exchanges first offered insurance for 2014. Some exchanges also provide access to Medicaid.[61][62]\nStates that set up their own exchanges have some discretion on standards and prices.[63][64] For example, states approve plans for sale, and thereby influence (through negotiations) prices. They can impose additional coverage requirements—such as abortion.[65] Alternatively, states can make the federal government responsible for operating their exchanges.[63]\nPremium subsidies\nIndividuals whose household incomes are between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) are eligible to receive federal subsidies for premiums for policies purchased on an ACA exchange, provided they are not eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or other forms of public assistance health coverage, and do not have access to affordable coverage (no more than 9.86% of income for the employee's coverage) through their own or a family member's employer.[66][67][68] Households below the federal poverty level are not eligible to receive these subsidies. Lawful Residents and some other legally present immigrants whose household income is below 100% FPL and are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid are eligible for subsidies if they meet all other eligibility requirements.[69][66] Married people must file taxes jointly to receive subsidies. Enrollees must have U.S. citizenship or proof of legal residency to obtain a subsidy.\nThe subsidies for an ACA plan purchased on an exchange stop at 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). According to the Kaiser Foundation, this results in a sharp \"discontinuity of treatment\" at 400% FPL, which is sometimes called the \"subsidy cliff\".[70] After-subsidy premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan (SCLSP) just below the cliff are 9.86% of income in 2019.[71]\nSubsidies are provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credit.[72][73]\nThe amount of subsidy is sufficient to reduce the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan (SCLSP) on an exchange to a sliding-scale percentage of income. The percentage is based on the percent of federal poverty level (FPL) for the household, and varies slightly from year to year. In 2019, it ranged from 2.08% of income (100%-133% FPL) to 9.86% of income (300%-400% FPL).[68] The subsidy can be used for any plan available on the exchange, but not catastrophic plans. The subsidy may not exceed the premium for the purchased plan.\n(In this section, the term \"income\" refers to modified adjusted gross income.[66][74])\nSmall businesses are eligible for a tax credit provided they enroll in the SHOP Marketplace.[75]\n| Income % of federal poverty level | Premium cap as a share of income | Incomea | Maximumb annual net premium after subsidy (second-lowest-cost silver plan) |\nMaximum out-of-pocket |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 133% | 3.11% of income | $33,383 | $1,038 | $5,200 |\n| 150% | 4.15% of income | $37,650 | $1,562 | $5,200 |\n| 200% | 6.54% of income | $50,200 | $3,283 | $5,200 |\n| 250% | 8.36% of income | $62,750 | $5,246 | $12,600 |\n| 300% | 9.86% of income | $75,300 | $7,425 | $15,800 |\n| 400% | 9.86% of income | $100,400 | $9,899 | $15,800 |\n|\na.^ In 2019, the federal poverty level was $25,100 for family of four (outside of Alaska and Hawaii). b.^ If the premium for the second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) is greater than the amount in this column, the amount of the premium subsidy will be such that it brings the net cost of the SCLSP down to the amount in this column. Otherwise, there will be no subsidy, and the SLCSP premium will (of course) be no more than (usually less than) the amount in this column. Note: The numbers in the table do not apply for Alaska and Hawaii. |\nCost-sharing reduction subsidies\nAs written, ACA mandated that insurers reduce copayments and deductibles for ACA exchange enrollees earning less than 250% of the FPL. Medicaid recipients were not eligible for the reductions.\nSo-called cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies were to be paid to insurance companies to fund the reductions. During 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies were to be paid, versus $34 billion for premium tax credits.[76]\nThe latter was defined as mandatory spending that does not require an annual Congressional appropriation. CSR payments were not explicitly defined as mandatory. This led to litigation and disruption later.[further explanation needed]\nRisk management\nRisk corridors\nThe risk-corridor program was a temporary risk management device.[77]: 1 It was intended to encourage reluctant insurers into ACA insurance market from 2014 to 2016. For those years the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) would cover some of the losses for insurers whose plans performed worse than they expected. Loss-making insurers would receive payments paid for in part by profit-making insurers.[78][79][attribution needed] Similar risk corridors had been established for the Medicare prescription drug benefit.[80]\nWhile many insurers initially offered exchange plans, the program did not pay for itself as planned, losing up to $8.3 billion for 2014 and 2015. Authorization had to be given so DHHS could pay insurers from \"general government revenues\".[attribution needed] However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 stated that no funds \"could be used for risk-corridor payments\".[81][attribution needed] leaving the government in a potential breach of contract with insurers who offered qualified health plans.[82]\nSeveral insurers sued the government at the United States Court of Federal Claims to recover the funds believed owed to them under the Risk Corridors program. While several were summarily closed, in the case of Moda Health v the United States, Moda Health won a $214-million judgment in February 2017. Federal Claims judge Thomas C. Wheeler stated, \"the Government made a promise in the risk corridors program that it has yet to fulfill. Today, the court directs the Government to fulfill that promise.\"[83] Moda Health's case was appealed by the government to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit along with the appeals of the other insurers; here, the Federal Circuit reversed the Moda Health ruling and ruled across all the cases in favor of the government, that the appropriations riders ceded the government from paying out remain money due to the insurers. The Supreme Court reversed this ruling in the consolidated case, Maine Community Health Options v. United States, reaffirming as with Judge Wheeler that the government had a responsibility to pay those funds under the ACA and the use of riders to de-obligate its from those payments was illegal.[84]\nReinsurance\nThe temporary reinsurance program is meant to stabilize premiums by reducing the incentive for insurers to raise premiums due to concerns about higher-risk enrollees. Reinsurance was based on retrospective costs rather than prospective risk evaluations. Reinsurance was available from 2014 through 2016.[85]\nRisk adjustment\nRisk adjustment involves transferring funds from plans with lower-risk enrollees to plans with higher-risk enrollees. It was intended to encourage insurers to compete based on value and efficiency rather than by attracting healthier enrollees. Of the three risk management programs, only risk adjustment was permanent. Plans with low actuarial risk compensate plans with high actuarial risk.[85]\nMedicaid expansion\nACA revised and expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014. All U.S. citizens and legal residents with income up to 133% of the poverty line would qualify for coverage in any state that participated in the Medicaid program. Previously, states could set various lower thresholds for certain groups and were not required to cover adults without dependent children. The federal government was to pay 100% of the increased cost in 2014, 2015 and 2016; 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% in 2020 and all subsequent years.[86][87][88][89] A 5% \"income disregard\" made the effective income eligibility limit for Medicaid 138% of the poverty level.[90] However, the Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius that this provision of ACA was coercive, and that states could choose to continue at pre-ACA eligibility levels.\nMedicare savings\nMedicare reimbursements were reduced to insurers and drug companies for private Medicare Advantage policies that the Government Accountability Office and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found to be excessively costly relative to standard Medicare;[91][92] and to hospitals that failed standards of efficiency and care.[91]\nTaxes\nMedicare taxes\nIncome from self-employment and wages of single individuals in excess of $200,000 annually are subjected to an additional tax of 0.9%. The threshold amount is $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly (threshold applies to their total compensation), or $125,000 for a married person filing separately.[93]\nIn ACA's companion legislation, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, an additional tax of 3.8% was applied to unearned income, specifically the lesser of net investment income and the amount by which adjusted gross income exceeds the above income limits.[94]\nExcise taxes\nACA included an excise tax of 40% (\"Cadillac tax\") on total employer premium spending in excess of specified dollar amounts (initially $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage[95]) indexed to inflation. This tax was originally scheduled to take effect in 2018, but was delayed until 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 and again to 2022. The excise tax on high-cost health plans was completely repealed as part of H.R.1865 - Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.\nExcise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs. An excise tax of 2.3% on medical devices and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services were applied as well.[96] The tax was repealed in late 2019.[97]\nSCHIP\nThe State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollment process was simplified.[98][99]\nDependents\nBeginning September 23, 2010, dependents were permitted to remain on their parents' insurance plan until their 26th birthday, including dependents who no longer lived with their parents, are not a dependent on a parent's tax return, are no longer a student, or are married.[100][101]\nEmployer mandate\nBusinesses that employ fifty or more people but do not offer health insurance to their full-time employees are assessed additional tax if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This is commonly known as the employer mandate.[102][103] This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once the exchanges began operating.[104]\nDelivery system reforms\nThe act includes delivery system reforms intended to constrain costs and improve quality. These include Medicare payment changes to discourage hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions, bundled payment initiatives, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and accountable care organizations.\nHospital quality\nHealth care cost/quality initiatives included incentives to reduce hospital infections, adopt electronic medical records, and to coordinate care and prioritize quality over quantity.[105]\nBundled payments\nMedicare switched from fee-for-service to bundled payments.[106][107] A single payment was to be paid to a hospital and a physician group for a defined episode of care (such as a hip replacement) rather than separate payments to individual service providers.[108]\nAccountable care organizations\nThe Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) was established by section 3022 of the Affordable Care Act. It is the program by which an accountable care organization interacts with the federal government, and by which accountable care organizations can be created.[109] It is a fee-for-service model.\nThe Act allowed the creation of accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers that commit to give coordinated care to Medicare patients. ACOs were allowed to continue using fee-for-service billing. They receive bonus payments from the government for minimizing costs while achieving quality benchmarks that emphasize prevention and mitigation of chronic disease. Missing cost or quality benchmarks subjected them to penalties.[110]\nUnlike health maintenance organizations, ACO patients are not required to obtain all care from the ACO. Also, unlike HMOs, ACOs must achieve quality-of-care goals.[110]\nMedicare drug benefit (Part D)\nMedicare Part D participants received a 50% discount on brand name drugs purchased after exhausting their initial coverage and before reaching the catastrophic-coverage threshold.[111] By 2020, the \"doughnut hole\" would be completely filled.[112]\nState waivers\nFrom 2017 onwards, states can apply for a \"waiver for state innovation\" which allows them to conduct experiments that meet certain criteria.[113] To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as ACA, covers at least as many residents and does not increase the federal deficit.[114] These states can escape some of ACA's central requirements, including the individual and employer mandates and the provision of an insurance exchange.[115] The state would receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under ACA, if they cannot be paid under the state plan.[113]\nOther insurance provisions\nThe Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (or CLASS Act) established a voluntary and public long-term care insurance option for employees,[116][117][118] The program was abolished as impractical without ever having taken effect.[119]\nConsumer Operated and Oriented Plans (CO-OP), member-governed non-profit insurers, could start providing health care coverage, based on a 5-year federal loan.[120] As of 2017, only four of the original 23 co-ops were still in operation,[121] including Mountain Health CO-OP.\nNutrition labeling requirements\nNutrition labeling requirements officially took effect in 2010, but implementation was delayed, and they actually took effect on May 7, 2018.[122]\nLegislative history\nACA followed a long series of unsuccessful attempts by one party or the other to pass major insurance reforms. Innovations were limited to health savings accounts (2003), medical savings accounts (1996) or flexible spending accounts, which increased insurance options, but did not materially expand coverage. Health care was a major factor in multiple elections, but until 2009, neither party had the votes to overcome the other's opposition.\nIndividual mandate\nThe concept of an individual mandate goes back to at least 1989, when The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care.[123][124] It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.[125][126][127]\nPresident Bill Clinton proposed a major healthcare reform bill in 1993[126] that ultimately failed.[128] Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.[129] The failed Clinton plan included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican senators proposed an alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance.\nThe 1993 Republican Health Equity and Access Reform Today (HEART) Act, contained a \"universal coverage\" requirement with a penalty for noncompliance—an individual mandate—as well as subsidies to be used in state-based 'purchasing groups'.[130] Advocates included prominent Republican senators such as John Chafee, Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett and Kit Bond.[131][132] The 1994 Republican Consumer Choice Health Security Act, initially contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision;[133] however, author Don Nickles subsequently removed the mandate, stating, \"government should not compel people to buy health insurance\".[134] At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H. W. Bush, remarked, \"I don't remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax.\"[123]\nIn 2006, an insurance expansion bill was enacted at the state level in Massachusetts. The bill contained both an individual mandate and an insurance exchange. Republican Governor Mitt Romney used a line-item veto on some provisions, and the Democratic legislature overrode some of his changes (including the mandate).[136] Romney's implementation of the 'Health Connector' exchange and individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, Senator Jim DeMint praised Romney's ability to \"take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured\". Romney said of the individual mandate: \"I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation.\"[137]\nIn 2007 Republican Senator Bob Bennett and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Healthy Americans Act, which featured an individual mandate and state-based, regulated insurance markets called \"State Health Help Agencies\".[127][137] The bill attracted bipartisan support, but died in committee. Many of its sponsors and co-sponsors remained in Congress during the 2008 healthcare debate.[138]\nBy 2008 many Democrats were considering this approach as the basis for healthcare reform. Experts said the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bore similarities to the 2007 bill[130] and that it took ideas from the Massachusetts reforms.[139]\nAcademic foundation\nA driving force behind Obama's healthcare reform was Peter Orszag, Director of the Office of Management and Budget.[140] Obama called Orszag his \"healthcare czar\" because of his knowledge of healthcare reform.[141] Orszag had previously been director of the Congressional Budget Office, and under his leadership the agency had focused on using cost analysis to create an affordable and effective approach to health care reform. Orszag claimed that healthcare reform became Obama's top agenda item because he wanted it to be his legacy.[142] According to an article by Ryan Lizza in The New Yorker, the core of \"the Obama budget is Orszag's belief [in]...a government empowered with research on the most effective medical treatments\". Obama bet \"his presidency on Orszag's thesis of comparative effectiveness.\"[143] Orszag's policies were influenced by an article in The Annals of Internal Medicine[144] co-authored by Elliott S. Fisher, David Wennberg and others. The article presented strong evidence based on the co-authors' research that numerous procedures, therapies and tests were being delivered with scant evidence of their medical value. If those procedures and tests could be eliminated, this evidence suggested, medical costs might provide the savings to give healthcare to the uninsured population.[145] After reading a New Yorker article that used the \"Dartmouth findings\"[146] to compare two counties in Texas with enormous variations in Medicare costs using hard data, Obama directed that his entire staff read it.[147] More than anything else, the Dartmouth data intrigued Obama[148] since it gave him an academic rationale for reshaping medicine.[149]\nThe concept of comparing the effectiveness of healthcare options based on hard data (\"comparative effectiveness\" and \"evidence-based medicine\") was pioneered by John E. Wennberg, founder of The Dartmouth Institute, co-founder of The Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making and senior advisor to Health Dialog Inc., a venture that he and his researchers created to help insurers implement the Dartmouth findings.\nHealthcare debate, 2008–10\nHealthcare reform was a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45 million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy without a mandate.[150][151]\nDuring the general election, Obama said fixing healthcare would be one of his top four priorities as president.[152] Obama and his opponent, Senator John McCain, both proposed health insurance reforms, though their plans differed. McCain proposed tax credits for health insurance purchased in the individual market, which was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured people by about 2 million by 2018. Obama proposed private and public group insurance, income-based subsidies, consumer protections, and expansions of Medicaid and SCHIP, which was estimated at the time to reduce the number of uninsured people by 33.9 million by 2018 at a higher cost.[153]\nObama announced to a joint session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform.[154][155] By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives.[156] On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a proposal. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of a Senate bill.[157][158][159]\nCongressional Democrats and health policy experts, such as MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber[160] and David Cutler, argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate to ensure that adverse selection or \"free riding\" would not result in an insurance \"death spiral\".[161] They chose this approach after concluding that filibuster-proof support in the Senate was not present for more progressive plans such as single-payer. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas—the same basic outline was supported by former Senate Majority Leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell—the bill's drafters hoped to garner the necessary votes.[162][163]\nHowever, following the incorporation of an individual mandate into the proposal, Republicans threatened to filibuster any bill that contained it.[123] Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican response, concluded Republicans should not support the bill.[164]\nRepublican senators, including those who had supported earlier proposals with a similar mandate, began to describe the mandate as \"unconstitutional\". Journalist Ezra Klein wrote in The New Yorker, \"a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition.\"[127]\nThe reform debate also attracted focused attention from lobbyists,[165] including pharmaceutical and healthcare insurance company advocacy, to assure continued opposition from all Republicans and even from among more conservative democrats, who had not fully supported the public option in earlier proposals.[166][167][168]\nDuring the August 2009 summer congressional recess, many members went back to their districts and held town hall meetings on the proposals. The nascent Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals attended the meetings to oppose the proposed reforms.[155] Threats were made against members of Congress over the course of the debate.[169]\nIn September 2009 Obama delivered another speech to a joint session of Congress supporting the negotiations.[170] On November 7, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act on a 220–215 vote and forwarded it to the Senate for passage.[155]\nSenate\nThe Senate began work on its own proposals while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House.[171] To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate repurposed H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members.[172] It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content.[173] The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes would be necessary to pass the Senate.[174] At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had 58 votes. The Minnesota Senate election was ultimately won by Democrat Al Franken, making 59. Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic party in April 2009, giving them 60 seats, enough to end a filibuster.\nNegotiations were undertaken attempting to satisfy moderate Democrats and to bring Republican senators aboard; particular attention was given to Republicans Bennett, Enzi, Grassley and Snowe.\nAfter the Finance Committee vote on October 15, negotiations turned to moderate Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying centrists. The holdouts came down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a public option[161][175] was met,[176] although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's failed Green Mountain Care.[176][177]\nThe White House and Reid addressed Nelson's concerns[178] during a 13-hour negotiation with two concessions: a compromise on abortion, modifying the language of the bill \"to give states the right to prohibit coverage of abortion within their own insurance exchanges\", which would require consumers to pay for the procedure out of pocket if the state so decided; and an amendment to offer a higher rate of Medicaid reimbursement for Nebraska.[155][179] The latter half of the compromise was derisively termed the \"Cornhusker Kickback\"[180] and was later removed.\nOn December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end debate on the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster.[181] The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote).[182] The bill was endorsed by the American Medical Association and AARP.[183]\nOn January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the recently deceased Ted Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters.[155][184][185] Additionally, the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of the bill.[186][187]\nHouse\nWith Democrats no longer able to get the 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back, dismissing more moderate reform as \"Kiddie Care\".[188][189]\nObama remained insistent on comprehensive reform. The news that Anthem in California intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as 39% gave him new evidence of the need for reform.[188][189] On February 22, he laid out a \"Senate-leaning\" proposal to consolidate the bills.[190] He held a meeting with both parties' leaders on February 25. The Democrats decided the House would pass the Senate's bill, to avoid another Senate vote.\nHouse Democrats had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a House–Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill.[187] They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.[188][191][192]\nPer the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation cannot be subject to a filibuster. But reconciliation is limited to budget changes, which is why the procedure was not used to pass ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations.[193][194] Although the already-passed Senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: \"these changes—higher subsidy levels, different kinds of taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal—mainly involve taxes and spending. In other words, they're exactly the kinds of policies that are well-suited for reconciliation.\"[191]\nThe remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant to support the bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, but they could not address abortion in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment to continue banning the use of federal funds for abortion.[195][196] This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage.[192][197] The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it.[198] It passed the second bill, by 220–211, the same day (with the Senate passing this bill via reconciliation by 56-43 a few days later). The day after the passage of ACA, March 22, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal it.[199] Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010.[17]\nPost-enactment\nSince passage, Republicans have voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act more than sixty times.[200]\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the fine for violating the individual mandate, starting in 2019. (The requirement itself is still in effect.)[57] In 2019 Congress repealed the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on health insurance benefits, an excise tax on medical devices, and the Health Insurance Tax.[97]\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, expanded subsidies for marketplace health plans. A continuation of these subsidies was introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nImpact\nCoverage\nThe law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance. The CDC reported that the percentage of people without health insurance fell from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.9% from January to June 2016.[201] The uninsured rate dropped in every congressional district in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015.[202] The Congressional Budget Office reported in March 2016 that approximately 12 million people were covered by the exchanges (10 million of whom received subsidies) and 11 million added to Medicaid. Another million were covered by ACA's \"Basic Health Program\", for a total of 24 million.[5] CBO estimated that ACA would reduce the net number of uninsured by 22 million in 2016, using a slightly different computation for the above figures totaling ACA coverage of 26 million, less 4 million for reductions in \"employment-based coverage\" and \"non-group and other coverage\".[5]\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimated that 20.0 million adults (aged 18–64) gained healthcare coverage via ACA as of February 2016;[6] similarly, the Urban Institute found in 2016 that 19.2 million non-elderly Americans gained health insurance coverage from 2010 to 2015.[203] In 2016, CBO estimated the uninsured at approximately 27 million people, or around 10% of the population or 7–8% excluding unauthorized immigrants.[5]\nStates that expanded Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on average in the first quarter of 2016, while those that did not had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18–64.[204] As of December 2016 32 states (including Washington DC) had adopted the Medicaid extension.[205]\nA 2017 study found that the ACA reduced socioeconomic disparities in health care access.[206]\nThe Affordable Care Act reduced the percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who were uninsured from 22.3 percent in 2010 to 12.4 percent in 2016. About 21 million more people have coverage ten years after the enactment of the ACA.[207][208] Ten years after its enactment studies showed that the ACA also had a positive effect on health and caused a reduction in mortality.[208]\nTaxes\nExcise taxes from the Affordable Care Act raised $16.3 billion in fiscal year 2015. $11.3 billion came from an excise tax placed directly on health insurers based on their market share. Annual excise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs.\nThe Individual mandate tax was $695 per individual or $2,085 per family at a minimum, reaching as high as 2.5% of household income (whichever was higher). The tax was set to $0 beginning in 2019.[209]\nIn the fiscal year 2018, the individual and employer mandates yielded $4 billion each. Excise taxes on insurers and drug makers added $18 billion. Income tax surcharges produced 437 billion.[210]\nACA reduced income inequality measured after taxes, due to the income tax surcharges and subsidies.[211] CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. The tax subsidy for the employer market, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total.[5]\nInsurance exchanges\nAs of August 2016, 15 states operated their own health insurance marketplace. Other states either used the federal exchange, or operated in partnership with or supported by the federal government.[212] By 2019, 12 states and Washington DC operated their own exchanges.[213]\nMedicaid expansion in practice\nAs of December 2019, 37 states (including Washington DC) had adopted the Medicaid extension.[205] Those states that expanded Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on average in the first quarter of 2016, while the others had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64.[204] Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they did not expand Medicaid under ACA, several states rejected the option. Over half the national uninsured population lived in those states.[214]\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults.[citation needed] The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.[215][216]\nIn many states income thresholds were significantly below 133% of the poverty line.[217] Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level.[218] Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options.[219][220] For example, in Kansas, where only non-disabled adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a family of three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, non-disabled adults were not eligible for Medicaid there.[214]\nStudies of the impact of Medicaid expansion rejections calculated that up to 6.4 million people would have too much income for Medicaid but not qualify for exchange subsidies.[221] Several states argued that they could not afford the 10% contribution in 2020.[222][223][224] Some studies suggested rejecting the expansion would cost more due to increased spending on uncompensated emergency care that otherwise would have been partially paid for by Medicaid coverage,[225][226]\nA 2016 study found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both expanded Medicaid, were more likely to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period.[227][228] Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. Later Arkansas and Kentucky governors proposed reducing or modifying their programs. From 2013 to 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas.[227][229]\nA 2016 DHHS study found that states that expanded Medicaid had lower premiums on exchange policies, because they had fewer low-income enrollees, whose health on average is worse than that of those with higher income.[230]\nIn September 2019, the Census Bureau reported that states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA had considerably lower uninsured rates than states that did not. For example, for adults between 100% and 399% of poverty level, the uninsured rate in 2018 was 12.7% in expansion states and 21.2% in non-expansion states. Of the 14 states with uninsured rates of 10% or greater, 11 had not expanded Medicaid.[231] The drop in uninsured rates due to expanded Medicaid has broadened access to care among low-income adults, with post-ACA studies indicating an improvement in affordability, access to doctors, and usual sources of care.[232]\nA study using national data from the Health Reform Monitoring Survey determined that unmet need due to cost and inability to pay medical bills significantly decreased among low-income (up to 138% FPL) and moderate-income (139-199% FPL) adults, with unmet need due to cost decreasing by approximately 11 percentage points among low-income adults by the second enrollment period.[232] Importantly, issues with cost-related unmet medical needs, skipped medications, paying medical bills, and annual out-of-pocket spending have been significantly reduced among low-income adults in Medicaid expansion states compared to non-expansion states.[232]\nAs well, expanded Medicaid has led to a 6.6% increase in physician visits by low-income adults, as well as increased usage of preventative care such as dental visits and cancer screenings among childless, low-income adults.[232] Improved health care coverage due to Medicaid expansion has been found in a variety of patient populations, such as adults with mental and substance use disorders, trauma patients, cancer patients, and people living with HIV.[233][234][235][236] Compared to 2011–13, in 2014 there was a 5.4 percentage point reduction in the uninsured rate of adults with mental disorders (from 21.3% to 15.9%) and a 5.1 percentage point reduction in the uninsured rate of adults with substance use disorders (from 25.9% to 20.8%); with increases in coverage occurring primarily through Medicaid.[236] Use of mental health treatment increased by 2.1 percentage points, from 43% to 45.1%.[236]\nAmong trauma patients nationwide, the uninsured rate has decreased by approximately 50%.[233] Adult trauma patients in expansion states experienced a 13.7 percentage point reduction in uninsured rates compared to adult trauma patients in non-expansion states, and an accompanying 7.4 percentage point increase in discharge to rehabilitation.[237] Following Medicaid expansion and dependent coverage expansion, young adults hospitalized for acute traumatic injury in Maryland experienced a 60% increase in rehabilitation, 25% reduction in mortality, and a 29.8% reduction in failure-to-rescue.[238] Medicaid expansion's swift impact on cancer patients was demonstrated in a study using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program that evaluated more than 850,000 patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, prostate cancer, or thyroid cancer from 2010 to 2014. The study found that a cancer diagnosis in 2014 was associated with a 1.9 percentage-point absolute and 33.5% relative decrease in uninsured rates compared to a diagnosis made between 2010 and 2013.[235] Another study, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data from 2010 to 2014, found that Medicaid expansion was associated with a 6.4% net increase in early stage (in situ, local, or regional) diagnoses of all cancers combined.[239]\nData from the Centers for Disease and Prevention's (CDC) Medical Monitoring Project demonstrated that between 2009 and 2012, approximately 18% of people living with HIV (PLWH) who were actively receiving HIV treatment were uninsured[240] and that at least 40% of HIV-infected adults receiving treatment were insured through Medicaid or Medicare, programs they qualified for only once their disease was advanced enough to be covered as a disability under Social Security.[240] Expanded Medicaid coverage of PLWH has been positively associated with health outcomes such as viral suppression, retention of care, hospitalization rates, and morbidity at the time of hospitalization.[234] An analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data found a 2.8% annual increase in viral suppression rates among all PLWH from 2010 to 2015 due to Medicaid expansion.[241] As an early adopter of Medicaid expansion, Massachusetts found a 65% rate of viral suppression among all PLWH and an 85% rate among those retained in healthcare in 2014, both substantially higher than the national average.[241]\nAn analysis of hospital discharge data from 2012 to 2014 in four Medicaid expansion states and two non-expansion states revealed hospitalizations of uninsured PLWH fell from 13.7% to 5.5% in the four expansion states and rose from 14.5% to 15.7% in the two non-expansion states.[242] Importantly, uninsured PLWH were 40% more likely to die in the hospital than insured PLWH.[242] Other notable health outcomes associated with Medicaid expansion include improved glucose monitoring rates for patients with diabetes, better hypertension control, and reduced rates of major post-operative morbidity.[243]\nA July 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicated that states enacting Medicaid expansion exhibited statistically significant reductions in mortality rates.[244] From that study, states that took Medicaid expansion \"saved the lives of at least 19,200 adults aged 55 to 64 over the four-year period from 2014 to 2017.\"[245] Further, 15,600 older adults died prematurely in the states that did not enact Medicaid expansion in those years according to the NBER research. \"The lifesaving impacts of Medicaid expansion are large: an estimated 39 to 64 percent reduction in annual mortality rates for older adults gaining coverage.\"[245]\nDue to many states' failure to expand, many Democrats co-sponsored the proposed 2021 Cover Now Act that would allow county and municipal governments to fund Medicaid expansion.[246]\nGaps in expansion\nDespite the significant increase in access to insurance coverage and healthcare services across the board, the ACA's Medicaid expansion has not fully addressed problems of economic equity. Critics argue that Medicaid expansion has not reduced cost-sharing by a significant margin, as the amount households paid out of pocket for healthcare over the past ten years (in the form of deductibles, co-payments, etc.) rose by 77%.[247] Additionally, 30% of providers deny Medicaid patients, which affects the accessibility of quality care.[248] This increase in denial may be in part because providers receive 62 cents from Medicaid for every dollar received from private insurers.[248] Studies on insurance rates show that economic inequality still persists: a significantly higher proportion of those with income greater than 100% but less than 200% of the federal poverty level were uninsured from 2010 to 2015 than of those with income greater than 200% of the federal poverty level.[247] This is exacerbated by the 2012 Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of Medicaid, since many of the states that have opted out have more vulnerable populations, with large numbers of minorities or low-income people.[247]\nMedicaid patients have also reported receiving \"second-class\" treatment compared to privately insured patients, with longer wait times and lower quality of care.[247]\nMedicaid expansion by state\n| State or territory | Status of expansion | Date of expansion | Health insurance marketplace | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Alabama | No expansion | N/A | HealthCare.gov | |\n| Alaska | In effect | September 1, 2015 | HealthCare.gov | |\n| Arizona | In effect | January 1, 2014 | HealthCare.gov | |\n| Arkansas | In effect | January 1, 2014 | Arkansas Health Connector, HealthCare.gov | State implemented expansion through a \"private option\" under a Section 1115 waiver through the Arkansas Health Care Independence Program (HCIP).

For example, a study published in 2016 found that the average requested 2017 premium increase among 40-year-old non-smokers was about 9 percent, although Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed increases of 40 percent in Alabama and 60 percent in Texas.[251] However, some or all these costs were offset by tax credits. For example, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that for the second-lowest cost \"Silver plan\", a 40-year old non-smoker making $30,000 per year would pay effectively the same amount in 2017 as they did in 2016 (about $208/month) after the tax credit, despite a large increase in the list price. This was consistent nationally. In other words, the subsidies increased along with the premium price, fully offsetting the increases for subsidy-eligible enrollees.[252]\nPremium cost increases in the employer market moderated after 2009. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000 to 2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015,[7] with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.[253] From 2008 to 2010 (before passage of ACA) health insurance premiums rose by an average of 10% per year.[254]\nSeveral studies found that the 2008 financial crisis and accompanying Great Recession could not account for the entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely shared at least partial credit.[255][256][257][258] A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for about a quarter of the recent reduction in inflation.[259][clarification needed] Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.[260]\nIn a 2016 review, Barack Obama claimed that from 2010 through 2014 mean annual growth in real per-enrollee Medicare spending was negative, down from a mean of 4.7% per year from 2000 through 2005 and 2.4% per year from 2006 to 2010; similarly, mean real per-enrollee growth in private insurance spending was 1.1% per year over the period, compared with a mean of 6.5% from 2000 through 2005 and 3.4% from 2005 to 2010.[261]\nDeductibles and co-payments\nA contributing factor to premium cost moderation was that the insured faced higher deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums. In addition, many employees chose to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the net impact of ACA difficult to determine precisely.\nFor the group market (employer insurance), a 2016 survey found that:\n- Deductibles grew 63% from 2011 to 2016, while premiums increased 19% and worker earnings grew by 11%.\n- In 2016, 4 in 5 workers had an insurance deductible, which averaged $1,478. For firms with less than 200 employees, the deductible averaged $2,069.\n- The percentage of workers with a deductible of at least $1,000 grew from 10% in 2006 to 51% in 2016. The 2016 figure dropped to 38% after taking employer contributions into account.[262]\nFor the non-group market, of which two-thirds are covered by ACA exchanges, a survey of 2015 data found that:\n- 49% had individual deductibles of at least $1,500 ($3,000 for family), up from 36% in 2014.\n- Many exchange enrollees qualify for cost-sharing subsidies that reduce their net deductible.\n- While about 75% of enrollees were \"very satisfied\" or \"somewhat satisfied\" with their choice of doctors and hospitals, only 50% had such satisfaction with their annual deductible.\n- While 52% of those covered by ACA exchanges felt \"well protected\" by their insurance, in the group market 63% felt that way.[263]\nHealth outcomes\nAccording to a 2014 study, ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013.[264] Himmelstein and Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a rollback of ACA's Medicaid expansion alone would cause an estimated 43,956 deaths annually.[265]\nAccording to the Kaiser Foundation, expanding Medicaid in the remaining states would cover up to 4.5 million persons.[266] A 2021 study found a significant decline in mortality rates in the states that opted in to the Medicaid expansion program compared with those states that did not do so. The study reported that states decisions' not to expand Medicaid resulted in approximately 15,600 excess deaths from 2014 through 2017.[267][268]\nDependent Coverage Expansion (DCE) under the ACA has had a demonstrable effect on various health metrics of young adults, a group with a historically low level of insurance coverage and utilization of care.[269] Numerous studies have shown the target age group gained private health insurance relative to an older group after the policy was implemented, with an accompanying improvement in having a usual source of care, reduction in out-of-pocket costs of high-end medical expenditures, reduction in frequency of Emergency Department visits, 3.5% increase in hospitalizations and 9% increase in hospitalizations with a psychiatric diagnosis, 5.3% increase in utilizing specialty mental health care by those with a probable mental illness, 4% increase in reporting excellent mental health, and a 1.5-6.2% increase in reporting excellent physical health.[269] Studies have also found that DCE was associated with improvements in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment among young adult patients.[239][270] A study of 10,010 women aged 18–26 identified through the 2008-12 National Health Interview Survey found that the likelihood of HPV vaccination initiation and completion increased by 7.7 and 5.8 percentage points respectively when comparing before and after October 1, 2010.[270] Another study using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2007 to 2012 found a 5.5 percentage point decrease in late-stage (stages III/IV) cervical cancer diagnosis for women aged 21–25 after DCE, and an overall decrease of 7.3 percentage points in late-stage diagnosis compared to those aged 26–34.[239] A study using SEER Program data from 2007 to 2012 found a 2.7 percentage point increase in diagnosis at stage I disease for patients aged 19–25 compared with those aged 26–34 for all cancers combined.[239] Studies focusing on cancer treatment after DCE found a 12.8 percentage point increase in the receipt of fertility-sparing treatment among cervical cancer patients aged 21–25 and an overall increase of 13.4 percentage points compared to those aged 26–34, as well as an increased likelihood that patients aged 19–25 with stage IIB-IIIC colorectal cancer receive timely adjuvant chemotherapy compared to those aged 27–34.[239]\nTwo 2018 JAMA studies found the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) was associated with increased post-discharge mortality for patients hospitalized for heart failure and pneumonia.[271][272][273] A 2019 JAMA study found that ACA decreased emergency department and hospital use by uninsured individuals.[274] Several studies have indicated that increased 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year post-discharge mortality of heart failure patients can be attributed to \"gaming the system\" through inappropriate triage systems in emergency departments, use of observation stays when admissions are warranted, and delay of readmission beyond the 30th day post-discharge, strategies that can reduce readmission rates at the expense of quality of care and patient survival.[275] The HRRP was also shown to disproportionately penalize safety-net hospitals that predominately serve low-income patients.[276] A 2020 study by Treasury Department economists in the Quarterly Journal of Economics using a randomized controlled trial (the IRS sent letters to some taxpayers noting that they had paid a fine for not signing up for health insurance but not to other taxpayers) found that over two years, obtaining health insurance reduced mortality by 12 percent.[277][278] The study concluded that the letters, sent to 3.9 million people, may have saved 700 lives.[277]\nA 2020 JAMA study found that Medicare expansion under the ACA was associated with reduced incidence of advanced-stage breast cancer, indicating that Medicaid accessibility led to early detection of breast cancer and higher survival rates.[279] Recent studies have also attributed to Medicaid expansion an increase in use of smoking cessation medications, cervical cancer screening, and colonoscopy, as well as an increase in the percentage of early-stage diagnosis of all cancers and the rate of cancer surgery for low-income patients.[280][281] These studies include a 2.1% increase in the probability of smoking cessation in Medicaid expansion states compared to non-expansion states, a 24% increase in smoking cessation medication use due to increased Medicaid-financed smoking cessation prescriptions, a 27.7% increase in the rate of colorectal cancer screening in Kentucky following Medicaid expansion with an accompanying improvement in colorectal cancer survival, and a 3.4% increase in cancer incidence following Medicaid expansion that was attributed to an increase in early-stage diagnoses.[280]\nTransition-of-care interventions and Alternative Payment Models under the ACA have also shown promise in improving health outcomes.[282][283] Post-discharge provider appointment and telephone follow-up interventions have been shown to reduce 30-day readmission rates among general medical-surgical inpatients.[282] Reductions in 60, 90, and 180 post-discharge day readmission rates due to transition-of-care interventions have also been demonstrated, and a reduction in 30-day mortality has been suggested.[282] Total joint arthroplasty bundles as part of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative have been shown to reduce discharge to inpatient rehabilitation facilities and post-acute care facilities, decrease hospital length of stay by 18% without sacrificing quality of care, and reduce the rate of total joint arthroplasty readmissions, half of which were due to surgical complications.[283] The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program in Medicaid has also shown the potential to improve health outcomes, with early studies reporting positive and significant effects on total patient experience score, 30-day readmission rates, incidences of pneumonia and pressure ulcers, and 30-day mortality rates for pneumonia.[284] The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) payment and care model, a team-based approach to population health management that risk-stratifies patients and provides focused care management and outreach to high-risk patients, has been shown to improve diabetes outcomes.[285] A widespread PCMH demonstration program focusing on diabetes, known as the Chronic Care Initiative in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, found statistically significant improvements in A1C testing, LDL-C testing, nephropathy screening and monitoring, and eye examinations, with an accompanying reduction in all-cause emergency department visits, ambulatory care-sensitive emergency department visits, ambulatory visits to specialists, and a higher rate of ambulatory visits to primary care providers.[285] The ACA overall has improved coverage and care of diabetes, with a significant portion of the 3.5 million uninsured US adults aged 18–64 with diabetes in 2009-10 likely gaining coverage and benefits such as closure of the Medicaid Part D coverage gap for insulin.[286] 2.3 million of the approximately 4.6 million people aged 18–64 with undiagnosed diabetes in 2009–2010 may also have gained access to zero-cost preventative care due to section 2713 of the ACA, which prohibits cost sharing for United States Preventive Services Taskforce grade A or B recommended services, such as diabetes screenings.[286]\nDistributional impact\nIn March 2018, the CBO reported that ACA had reduced income inequality in 2014, saying the law led the lowest and second quintiles (the bottom 40%) to receive an average of an additional $690 and $560 respectively while causing households in the top 1% to pay an additional $21,000 due mostly to the net investment income tax and the additional Medicare tax. The law placed relatively little burden on households in the top quintile (top 20%) outside of the top 1%.[10]\nFederal deficit\nCBO estimates of revenue and impact on deficit\nThe CBO reported in multiple studies that ACA would reduce the deficit, and repealing it would increase the deficit, primarily because of the elimination of Medicare reimbursement cuts.[8][9] The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012–2021 period:[9][287] it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in total receipts, resulting in a $210 billion net deficit reduction.[9] The CBO separately predicted that while most of the spending provisions do not begin until 2014,[288][289] revenue would exceed spending in those subsequent years.[290][dead link] The CBO claimed the bill would \"substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs\"[291]—ultimately extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by eight years.[292]\nThis estimate was made prior to the Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the related federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.[293][294][295]\nThe CBO in June 2015 forecast that repeal of ACA would increase the deficit between $137 billion and $353 billion over the 2016–2025 period, depending on the impact of macroeconomic feedback effects. The CBO also forecast that repeal of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2025, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.[8]\nAlthough the CBO generally does not provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period because of the degree of uncertainty involved in the projection, it decided to do so in this case at the request of lawmakers, and estimated a second decade deficit reduction of $1.2 trillion.[291][296] CBO predicted deficit reduction around a broad range of one-half percent of GDP over the 2020s while cautioning that \"a wide range of changes could occur\".[297]\nIn 2017 CBO estimated that repealing the individual mandate alone would reduce the 10-year deficit by $338 billion.[298]\nOpinions on CBO projections\nThe CBO cost estimates were criticized because they excluded the effects of potential legislation that would increase Medicare payments by more than $200 billion from 2010 to 2019.[299][300][301] However, the so-called \"doc fix\" is a separate issue that would have existed with or without ACA.[302][303][304] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities objected that Congress had a good record of implementing Medicare savings. According to their study, Congress followed through on the implementation of the vast majority of provisions enacted in the past 20 years to produce Medicare savings, although not the doc fix.[305][306] The doc fix became obsolete in 2015 when the savings provision was eliminated, permanently removing that spending restraint.[307]\nHealth economist Uwe Reinhardt, wrote, \"The rigid, artificial rules under which the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation.\"[308] Douglas Holtz-Eakin alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562 billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.[309]\nScheiber and Cohn rejected critical assessments of the law's deficit impact, arguing that predictions were biased towards underestimating deficit reduction. They noted, for example, it is easier to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than to account for savings from preventive healthcare, and that the CBO had a track record of overestimating costs and underestimating savings of health legislation;[310][311] stating, \"innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of electronic medical records[312] and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses ... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another—and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize.\"[310]\nIn 2010 David Walker said the CBO estimates were not likely to be accurate, because they were based on the assumption that the law would not change.[313]\nEmployer mandate and part-time work\nThe employer mandate applies to employers of more than fifty where health insurance is provided only to the full-time workers.[314] Critics claimed it created a perverse incentive to hire part-timers instead.[315][316] However, between March 2010 and 2014, the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000 while the number of full-time jobs increased by two million.[317][318] In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector.[317][319] A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.[320]\nSeveral businesses and the state of Virginia added a 29-hour-a-week cap for their part-time employees,[321][unreliable source?][322][unreliable source?] to reflect the 30-hour-or-more definition for full-time worker.[314] As of 2013, few companies had shifted their workforce towards more part-time hours (4% in a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).[316] Trends in working hours[323] and the recovery from the Great Recession correlate with the shift from part-time to full-time work.[324][325] Other confounding impacts include that health insurance helps attract and retain employees, increases productivity and reduces absenteeism; and lowers corresponding training and administration costs from a smaller, more stable workforce.[316][323][326] Relatively few firms employ over 50 employees[316] and more than 90% of them already offered insurance.[327]\nMost policy analysts (both right and left) were critical of the employer mandate provision.[315][327] They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, even if they did not change existing plans, were real and harmful;[328][329] that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth;[330] that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans;[328][329] and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools.[331][332] The provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions who were not granted exemptions.[329][333]\nHospitals\nFrom the start of 2010 to November 2014, 43 hospitals in rural areas closed. Critics claimed the new law had caused these closures. Many rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but only a small number operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.[334]\nBetween January 2010 and 2015, a quarter of ER doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed they lacked the resources to deal with large increases in the number of patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured.[335] Michael Lee Jr. and Michael C. Monuteaux at Boston Children's Hospital analyzed national emergency department visits among children aged 0 to 17 from 2009 to 2016 using the American Community Survey (ACS) and Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). They found no immediate change in pediatric emergency department visit rates the year after the ACA took full effect in 2014, but the rate of change from 2014 to 2016 was significantly higher than previous rate trends, almost 10%.[336]\nSeveral large insurers formed ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices, amounting to a significant consolidation of the provider industry. The increased market share gave them more leverage with insurers and reduced patient care options.[110]\nEconomic consequences\nCBO estimated in June 2015 that repealing ACA would:\n- Decrease GDP in the short-term, as government spending (on subsidies) was only partially replaced by spending by recipients.\n- Increase the supply of labor and aggregate compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021–2025 period. CBO cited ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so repealing ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more labor, increasing the total number of hours worked by about 1.5% over the 2021–2025 period.\n- Remove the higher tax rates on capital income, thereby encouraging investment, raising the capital stock and output in the long-run.[8]\nIn 2015 the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research found no evidence that companies were reducing worker hours to avoid ACA requirements[337] for employees working more than 30 hours per week.[338]\nCBO estimated that ACA would slightly reduce the size of the labor force and number of hours worked, as some would no longer be tethered to employers for their insurance. Jonathan Cohn claimed that ACA's primary employment effect was to alleviate job lock[339] and the reform's only significant employment impact was the retirement of those who were working only to stay insured.[340]\nPublic opinion\nPublic views became increasingly negative in reaction to specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Approval varied by party, race and age. Some elements were more widely favored (preexisting conditions) or opposed (individual mandate).\nIn a 2010 poll, 62% of respondents said they thought ACA would \"increase the amount of money they personally spend on health care\", 56% said the bill \"gives the government too much involvement in health care\", and 19% said they thought they and their families would be better off with the legislation.[341] Other polls found that people were concerned the law would cost more than projected and would not do enough to control costs.[342]\nIn a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans favored the law. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate.[343] Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers and providing subsidies.[344][345]\nSome opponents believed the reform did not go far enough: a 2012 poll indicated that 71% of Republican opponents rejected it overall, while 29% believed it did not go far enough; independent opponents were divided 67% to 33%; and among the much smaller group of Democratic opponents, 49% rejected it overall and 51% wanted more.[343]\nIn June 2013, a majority of the public (52–34%) indicated a desire for \"Congress to implement or tinker with the law rather than repeal it\".[346] After the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate, a 2012 poll held that \"most Americans (56%) want to see critics of President Obama's health care law drop efforts to block it and move on to other national issues\".[347]\nAs of October 2013, approximately 40% were in favor while 51% were against.[348][349] About 29% of whites approved of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans.[350] A solid majority of seniors opposed the idea and a solid majority of those under forty were in favor.[351]\nA 2014 poll reported that 26% of Americans support ACA.[352] A later 2014 poll reported that 48.9% of respondents had an unfavorable view of ACA versus 38.3% who had a favorable view (of more than 5,500 individuals).[353] Another held that 8% of respondents agreed the Affordable Care Act \"is working well the way it is\".[354] In late 2014, a Rasmussen poll reported Repeal: 30%, Leave as is: 13%, Improve: 52%.[355]\nIn 2015, a poll reported that 47% of Americans approved the health care law. This was the first time a major poll indicated that more respondents approved than disapproved.[356] A December 2016 poll reported that: a) 30% wanted to expand what the law does; b) 26% wanted to repeal the entire law; c) 19% wanted to move forward with implementing the law as it is; and d) 17% wanted to scale back what the law does, with the remainder undecided.[357]\nSeparate polls from Fox News and NBC/WSJ, both taken during January 2017, indicated more people viewed the law favorably than did not for the first time. One of the reasons for the improving popularity of the law is that Democrats who had once opposed it (many still prefer \"Medicare for all\") shifted their positions because ACA was under threat of repeal.[358] Another January 2017 poll reported that 35% of respondents believed \"Obamacare\" and the \"Affordable Care Act\" were different or did not know. (About 45% were unsure whether \"repeal of Obamacare\" also meant \"repeal of the Affordable Care Act\".) 39% did not know that \"many people would lose coverage through Medicaid or subsidies for private health insurance if the ACA were repealed and no replacement enacted\", with Democrats far more likely (79%) to know that fact than Republicans (47%).[359] A 2017 study found that personal experience with public health insurance programs led to greater support for the ACA, most prominently among Republicans and low-information voters.[360]\nBy the end of 2023, a Morning Consult poll of registered voters found that 57% approved of the Affordable Care Act, while 30% disapproved of it. 85% of Democrats, 56% of independents, and 28% of Republicans supported the law.[361]\nPolitical aspects\n\"Obamacare\"\nThe term \"Obamacare\" was originally coined by opponents as a pejorative. According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured.[362] The term officially emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott wrote, \"We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s\".[363][364]\nIn May 2007, Mitt Romney introduced it to political discourse, saying, \"How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it.\"[363]\nBy mid-2012, Obamacare had become the colloquial term used both by supporters and opponents.[362] Obama eventually endorsed the nickname, saying, \"I have no problem with people saying Obama cares. I do care.\"[365] By 2016 Obama explicitly and repeatedly referred to the ACA as \"Obamacare\".[366]\nThe use of \"Obamacare\" became increasingly rare, and at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Obama said, \"I noticed, by the way, since it became popular, they don't call it 'Obamacare' no more.\"[367]\nCommon misconceptions\n\"Death panels\"\nOn August 7, 2009, Sarah Palin created the term \"death panels\" to describe groups who would decide whether sick patients were \"worthy\" of medical care.[368] \"Death panel\" referred to two claims about early drafts.\nOne was that under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age[369] and the other that the government would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).[370] IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when statutory expenditure levels were exceeded within any given three-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.[371][372]\nThe other related issue concerned advance-care planning consultation: a section of the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive.[373] The provision was not included in ACA.[374]\nIn 2010, the Pew Research Center reported that 85% of Americans were familiar with the claim, and 30% believed it was true, backed by three contemporaneous polls.[375] The allegation was named PolitiFact's 2009 \"Lie of the Year\",[368][376] one of FactCheck.org's \"whoppers\"[377][378] and the most outrageous term by the American Dialect Society.[379] AARP described such rumors as \"rife with gross—and even cruel—distortions\".[380]\nMembers of Congress\nACA requires members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance either through an exchange or some other program approved by the law (such as Medicare), instead of using the insurance offered to federal employees (the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program).[381][382]\nIllegal immigrants\nACA explicitly denies insurance subsidies to \"unauthorized (illegal) aliens\".[52][53][383]\nExchange \"death spiral\"\nOpponents claimed that combining immediate coverage with no provision for preexisting conditions would lead people to wait to get insured until they got sick. The individual mandate was designed to push people to get insured without waiting. This has been called a \"death spiral\".[384] In the years after 2013, many insurers did leave specific marketplaces, claiming the risk pools were too small.\nThe median number of insurers per state was 4.0 in 2014, 5.0 in 2015, 4.0 in 2016 and 3.0 in 2017. Five states had one insurer in 2017, 13 had two, 11 had three; the remainder had four or more.[385]\n\"If you like your plan\"\nAt various times during and after ACA debate Obama said, \"If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.\"[386][387] However, in fall 2013 millions of Americans with individual policies received notices that their insurance plans were terminated,[388] and several million more risked seeing their current plans canceled.[389][390]\nObama's previous unambiguous assurance that consumers could keep their own plans became a focal point for critics, who challenged his truthfulness.[391][392] Various bills were introduced in Congress to allow people to keep their plans.[393]\nPolitiFact initially cited various estimates that only about 2% of the total insured population (4 million out of 262 million) received such notices,[394] but readers later voted Obama's claims as the 2013 \"Lie of the Year\".[395]\nCriticism and opposition\nOpposition and efforts to repeal the legislation have drawn support from sources that include labor unions,[333][396] conservative advocacy groups,[397][398] Republicans, small business organizations and the Tea Party movement.[399] These groups claimed the law would disrupt existing health plans, increase costs from new insurance standards, and increase the deficit.[400] Some opposed the idea of universal healthcare.[401][402] President Donald Trump repeatedly promised to \"repeal and replace\" it.[403][404]\nAs of 2013[update] unions that expressed concerns included the AFL–CIO,[405] which called ACA \"highly disruptive\", claiming it would drive up costs of union-sponsored plans; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and UNITE-HERE, whose leaders argued \"PPACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\"[333] In 2014, Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) president Terry O'Sullivan and Unite Here president D. Taylor wrote, \"ACA, as implemented, undermines fair marketplace competition in the health care industry.\"[396]\nIn October 2016, Mark Dayton, the governor of Minnesota, said ACA had \"many good features\" but it was \"no longer affordable for increasing numbers of people\"; he called on the state legislature to provide emergency relief to policyholders.[406] Dayton later said he regretted his remarks after they were seized on by Republicans seeking to repeal the law.[407]\nSocialism debate\nMany economically conservative opponents called the ACA \"socialist\" or \"socialized medicine\", pointing to the government redistribution of wealth via subsidies for low-income purchasers of private insurance, expansion of Medicaid, government requirements as to what products can be sold on the exchanges, and the individual mandate, which reduces freedom of consumer choice to be uninsured.[408][409][410]\nOther observers considered the law a relatively capitalist or \"regulated free-market\" means of paying for near-universal health care, because it creates new marketplaces with choices for consumers, largely relies on private employers and private health insurance companies, maintains private ownership of hospitals and doctor's offices, and was originally advocated by economic conservatives as a capitalist alternative to single-payer health care.[411][412][413] Some pointed out that the previous system also had socialist aspects. Even for-profit private health insurance companies socialize risk and redistribute wealth from people who have it (all premium payers) to those who need it (by paying for medically necessary healthcare).[413] The requirement to provide emergency care also forced redistribution from people who pay insurance premiums to those who choose to be uninsured, when they visit the emergency room.[412]\nSome ACA supporters accused conservatives of using the term \"socialism\" as a negative buzzword for ACA as it was for Medicare and Medicaid,[413] and some embraced the label \"socialism\" as desirable, distinguishing democratic socialism as desirable for education and health care[414] and communism as undesirable.[413] Milos Forman opined that critics \"falsely equate Western European-style socialism, and its government provision of social insurance and health care, with Marxist–Leninist totalitarianism\".[415]\nLegal challenges\nNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\nOpponents challenged ACA's constitutionality in multiple lawsuits on multiple grounds.[416][417][failed verification] The Supreme Court ruled, 5–4, that the individual mandate was constitutional when viewed as a tax, although not under the Commerce Clause.\nACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Court ruled that this was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out without losing preexisting Medicaid funding.[12]\nContraception mandate\nIn March 2012, the Catholic Church, while supportive of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that aspects of the mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns,[418][419] including Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which looked at private corporations and their duties under the ACA.\nIn Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court ruled 7–2 on July 8, 2020, that employers with religious or moral objections to contraceptives can exclude such coverage from an employee's insurance plan. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said, \"No language in the statute itself even hints that Congress intended that contraception should or must be covered. It was Congress, not the [administration], that declined to expressly require contraceptive coverage in the ACA itself.\" Justices Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined Thomas's opinion. Justice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in the judgment, in which Stephen Breyer joined. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented, saying the court's ruling \"leaves women workers to fend for themselves.\"[420]\nIn a later lawsuit brought by private health insurance buyers and businesses, Judge Reed O'Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in March 2023 that the ACA's provision of contraceptives, HIV testing, and screenings for cancer, diabetes, and mental health violated the plaintiffs' freedom of religious exercise, and placed an injunction on that portion of the ACA. The Biden administration planned to seek a hold on O'Connor's decision.[421]\nKing v Burwell\nOn June 25, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, 6–3, that federal subsidies for health insurance premiums could be used in the 34 states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges.[422]\nHouse v. Price\nHouse Republicans sued the Obama administration in 2014, alleging that cost-sharing reduction subsidy payments to insurers were unlawful because Congress had not appropriated funds to pay for them. The argument classified the CSR subsidy as discretionary spending subject to annual appropriation. In May 2016, a federal judge ruled for the plaintiffs, but the Obama administration appealed.[423] Later, President Trump ended the payments. This led to further litigation.[424]\nUnited States House of Representatives v. Azar\nThe House sued the administration, alleging that the money for CSRs to insurers had not been appropriated, as required for any federal government spending. The ACA subsidy that helps customers pay premiums was not part of the suit.\nWithout the CSRs, the government estimated that premiums would increase by 20% to 30% for silver plans.[425] In 2017, the uncertainty about whether the payments would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina to try to raise premiums by 22.9% the next year, as opposed to an increase of 8.8% that it would have sought if the payments were assured.[426]\nU.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that the cost-sharing program was unconstitutional for spending money that has not been specifically provided by an act of Congress, but concluded that Congress had in fact authorized that program to be created. The judge also found that Congress had provided authority to cover the spending for the tax credits to consumers who use them to help afford health coverage.[427] Collyer enjoined further cost-sharing payments, but stayed the order pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The case ended in a settlement before the Circuit Court.\nCalifornia v. Texas\nTexas and 19 other states filed a civil suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in February 2018, arguing that with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which eliminated the tax for not having health insurance, the individual mandate no longer had a constitutional basis and thus the entire ACA was no longer constitutional.[428] The Department of Justice said it would no longer defend the ACA in court, but 17 states led by California stepped in to do so.[429]\nDistrict Judge Reed O'Connor of Texas ruled for the plaintiffs on December 14, 2018, writing that the \"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause—meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\" He then further reasoned that the individual mandate is an essential part of the entire law, and thus was not severable, making the entire law unconstitutional.[430][431] O'Connor's decision regarding severability turned on several passages from the Congressional debate that focused on the importance of the mandate.[432] While he ruled the law unconstitutional, he did not overturn the law.[429]\nThe intervening states appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit. These states argued that Congress's change in the tax was only reducing the amount of the tax, and that Congress had the power to write a stronger law to this end.[433][434] O'Connor stayed his decision pending the appeal.[435] The Fifth Circuit heard the appeal on July 9, 2019; in the interim, the U.S. Department of Justice joined with Republican states to argue that the ACA was unconstitutional, while the Democratic states were joined by the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. An additional question was addressed, as the Republican plaintiffs challenged the Democratic states' standing to defend the ACA.[436]\nIn December 2019, the Fifth Circuit agreed the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but did not agree that the entire law should be voided. Instead, it remanded the case to the District Court for reconsideration of that question.[437] The Supreme Court accepted the case in March 2020, to be heard in the 2020–2021 term,[438] with the ruling likely falling after the 2020 elections.[439]\nDemocrats pointed out that the effect of invalidating the entire law would be to remove popular provisions such as the protection for preexisting conditions, and that the Republicans had still not offered any replacement plan—important issues in the 2020 elections.[439]\nOn June 17, 2021, the Court rejected the challenge in a 7–2 decision, ruling that Texas and the other plaintiff states did not have standing to challenge the provision, leaving the full ACA intact.[440][441][442]\nSection 1557\nIn April 2024, the Biden administration issued a final rule implementing Section 1557 of the ACA, adding gender identity to Title IX's definition of discrimination based on sex.[443][444] In May 2024, 15 states led by Tennessee sued HHS in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, arguing that the 2024 rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution.[445] In October 2025, a federal judge struck down the 2024 rule to the extent that it prohibits discrimination against transgender people in education and health-care programs.[446]\nRisk corridors\nThe Supreme Court ruled that promised risk corridor payments must be made even in the absence of specific appropriation of money by Congress.[84]\nNon-cooperation\nOfficials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those elements over which they had discretion.[447][448] For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law.[449] Other Republicans discouraged efforts to advertise the law's benefits. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.[450][451]\nRepeal and modification efforts\nACA was the subject of many unsuccessful repeal efforts by Republicans in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses: Representatives Steve King and Michele Bachmann introduced bills in the House to repeal the ACA the day after it was signed, as did Senator Jim DeMint in the Senate.[452] In 2011, after Republicans gained control of the House, one of the first votes held was on a bill titled \"Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act\" (H.R. 2), which the House passed 245–189.[453] All Republicans and three Democrats voted for repeal.[454] In the Senate, the bill was offered as an amendment to an unrelated bill, but was voted down.[455] President Obama said he would veto the bill had it passed.[456]\nOn February 3, 2015, the House of Representatives added its 67th repeal vote to the record (239 to 186). This attempt also failed.[457]\n2013 federal government shutdown\nStrong partisan disagreement in Congress prevented adjustments to the Act's provisions.[458] But at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, received bipartisan support.[459] Some Congressional Republicans argued against improvements to the law on the grounds that they would weaken the arguments for repeal.[329][460]\nRepublicans attempted to defund the ACA's implementation,[448][461] and in October 2013 House Republicans refused to fund the federal government unless it came with an implementation delay, after Obama unilaterally deferred the employer mandate by one year, which critics claimed he had no power to do. The House passed three versions of a bill funding the government while submitting various versions that would repeal or delay the ACA, with the last version delaying enforcement of the individual mandate. The Democratic Senate leadership said the Senate would pass only a bill without any restrictions on ACA. The government shutdown lasted from October 1 to October 17.[462][463][464]\n2017 repeal effort\nDuring a midnight congressional session starting January 11, the Senate of the 115th Congress of the United States voted to approve a \"budget blueprint\" that would allow Republicans to repeal parts of the law \"without threat of a Democratic filibuster\".[465][466] The plan, which passed 51–48, was named by Senate Republicans the \"Obamacare 'repeal resolution.'\"[467] Democrats opposing the resolution staged a protest during the vote.[468]\nHouse Republicans announced their replacement, the American Health Care Act, on March 6.[469] On March 24, the AHCA failed amid a revolt among Republican representatives.[470]\nOn May 4 the House voted to pass the AHCA by a margin of 217 to 213.[471] The Senate Republican leadership announced that Senate Republicans would write their own version of the bill instead of voting on the House version.[472]\nLeader McConnell named a group of 13 Republicans to draft the substitute version in private, raising bipartisan concerns about lack of transparency.[473][474][475] On June 22, Republicans released the first discussion draft, which renamed it the \"Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017\" (BCRA).[476] On July 25, although no amendment proposal had garnered majority support, Republicans voted to advance the bill to the floor and begin formal consideration of amendments. Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were the only two dissenting Republicans, making the vote a 50–50 tie. Vice President Mike Pence then cast the tie-breaking vote in the affirmative.[477]\nThe revised BCRA failed, 43–57. A subsequent \"Obamacare Repeal and Reconciliation Act\" abandoned the \"repeal and replace\" approach in favor of a straight repeal, but that too failed, 45–55. Finally, the \"Health Care Freedom Act\", nicknamed \"skinny repeal\" because it would have made the least change to ACA, failed by 49–51, with Collins, Murkowski, and McCain joining all Democrats and independents in voting against it.[478]\nProposed changes in 2024\nDonald Trump, who has historically opposed the ACA,[479][480][481] said during the 2024 United States presidential debates that he had \"concepts of a plan\" to modify or scrap it. JD Vance has said that Trump intends to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or disability, with subsidized insurance replaced with private insurance.[482][483][484] Kamala Harris said she would \"maintain and grow\" the ACA.[485][486]\nFederal government shutdown 2025\nDuring the 2025 federal government shutdown, the Affordable Care Act once again became a focal point of partisan disagreement. On November 8–9, 2025, as the shutdown reached its 39th day, President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans to redirect federal funds used for ACA insurance subsidies toward direct cash payments to individuals, framing the proposal as a strategy to resolve the budgetary impasse. Several Republican senators expressed openness to considering the idea, while Democrats rejected it. Analysts noted that the proposal lacked the bipartisan support necessary to reopen the federal government. Contemporary reports described the dispute over the ACA's subsidy structure as one of the key issues contributing to the protracted shutdown.[487] Trump believes that this law will expire once its tax credit is eliminated and is not renewed.[488]\nThe disagreement focused on whether to continue the enhanced premium tax credits expanded under previous legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, which lowered the portion of health insurance costs paid by consumers. Observers noted that if these subsidies were allowed to expire, many individuals could face significant premium increases, potentially more than doubling for some enrollees. This raised concerns about decreased enrollment in the ACA marketplaces, especially among individuals who previously received little or no subsidy.[489]\nIn addition to the impacts on consumers, small businesses and self-employed individuals relying on ACA marketplace plans faced potential financial strain. Reports also highlighted that certain federal health agency employees were furloughed during the shutdown, temporarily affecting the oversight and administration of health programs. The debate over ACA funding illustrated how federal budget impasses can have immediate effects on both insurance markets and the delivery of health services.[490][491][492]\nActions to hinder implementation\nUnder both the ACA (current law) and the AHCA, the CBO reported that the health exchange marketplaces would remain stable.[494] But Republican politicians took a variety of steps to undermine it, creating uncertainty that adversely impacted enrollment and insurer participation while increasing premiums.[495] Concern about the exchanges became another argument for reforms. Past and ongoing Republican attempts to weaken the law have included:\n- Lawsuits such as King v. Burwell and House v. Price.\n- President Trump ended the payment of cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers on October 12, 2017. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15–20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.[496] In response, insurers sued the government for reimbursement. Various cases are under appeal as of 2019.[424] Several insurers and actuarial groups estimated this resulted in a 20 percentage point or more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year. In other words, premium increases expected to be 10% or less in 2018 became 28–40% instead.[497][498] The insurers would need to make up the $7 billion they had previously received in cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) by raising premiums. Since most premiums are subsidized, the federal government would cover most of the increases. CBO also estimated that initially up to one million fewer people would have health insurance coverage, although rising subsidies might eventually offset this. The 85% of enrollees who received subsidies would be unaffected. CBO expected the exchanges to remain stable (i.e., no \"death spiral\" before or after Trump's action) as the premiums would increase and prices would stabilize at the higher (non-CSR) level.[499] Several insurance companies who sued the United States for failure to pay CSRs won cases in 2018 and 2019. The judiciary decided the insurance companies are entitled to unpaid CSRs.[424][500]\n- The 2015 appropriations bill had a rider that ended the payment of risk corridor funds. This was repeated in later years. This resulted in the bankruptcy of many co-ops. This action was attributed to Senator Marco Rubio.[501] The cutoff generated some 50 lawsuits. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2019 in the case Maine Community Health Options v. United States.[502][503][504]\n- Trump weakened the individual mandate with his first executive order, which limited enforcement of the tax. For example, tax returns without indications of health insurance (\"silent returns\") will still be processed, overriding Obama's instructions to reject them.[505]\n- Trump reduced funding for advertising for exchange enrollment by up to 90%, with other reductions to support resources used to answer questions and help people sign-up for coverage.[506] The CBO said the reductions would reduce ACA enrollment.[496]\n- Trump reduced the enrollment period for 2018 by half, to 45 days.[507]\n- Trump made public statements that the exchanges were unstable or in a death spiral.[508]\nPerceived inadequacies\nIn December 2009, former DNC chairman and former Vermont governor Howard Dean called the ACA \"a bigger bailout for the insurance industry than AIG\" and \"an insurance company's dream\". He viewed the bill's end form as a death of the health care reform effort.[509]\nIn his 2011 book Remedy and Reaction, Paul Starr, the former senior advisor for Bill Clinton's health care reform plan, notes that the ACA did not make health insurance a right and did not make medical care free at the point of service. He criticizies the ACA on the grounds that some lower-income individuals still cannot afford treatment and go without care \"if health care and insurance are treated as ordinary commodities\".[510]\nThe ACA's critics often cite its inability to control costs and lower deductibles,[511][512] the difficulty for average people to compare plans,[513] lack of a strong public option, and inadequate regulations on or alternatives (such as co-operatives) to large corporate health care companies.[514]\nImplementation\nIn 2010 small business tax credits took effect.[515] Then Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) took effect to offer insurance to those who had been denied coverage by private insurance companies because of a preexisting condition.[515] By 2011, insurers had stopped marketing child-only policies in 17 states, as they sought to escape this requirement.[516] In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion.[517][518][519]\nIn 2013, the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the cost of covering only the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income. Family plans would not be considered even if the cost was above the 9.5% income threshold.[520][521] On July 2 Obama delayed the employer mandate until 2015.[327][522][523] The launch for both the state and federal exchanges was beset by management and technical failings. HealthCare.gov, the website that offers insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered many problems.[524] Operations stabilized in 2014, although not all planned features were complete.[525][526]\nThe Government Accountability Office released a non-partisan study in 2014 that concluded the administration had not provided \"effective planning or oversight practices\" in developing the exchanges.[527] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court exempted closely held corporations with religious convictions from the contraception rule.[528] At the beginning of the 2015, 11.7 million had signed up (ex-Medicaid).[529] By the end of the year about 8.8 million consumers had stayed in the program.[530] Congress repeatedly delayed the onset of the \"Cadillac tax\" on expensive insurance plans first until 2020[531] and later until 2022 and repealed it in late 2019.[97]\nAn estimated 9 to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage in 2016, mostly low-income adults. The five major national insurers expected to lose money on ACA policies in 2016,[532] in part because the enrollees were lower income, older and sicker than expected.[533]\nMore than 9.2 million people (3.0 million new customers and 6.2 million returning) enrolled on the national exchange in 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump.[534] The eleven states that run their own exchanges signed up about 3 million more.[534] The IRS announced that it would not require that tax returns indicate a person has health insurance, reducing the effectiveness of the individual mandate, in response to Trump's executive order.[535] The CBO reported in March that the healthcare exchanges were expected to be stable.[494] In May the House voted to repeal the ACA using the American Health Care Act (AHCA), but the AHCA was defeated in the Senate.[536][537] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set the individual mandate penalty at $0 starting in 2019.[56] The CBO estimated that the change would cause 13 million fewer people to have health insurance in 2027.[538]\nThe 2017 Individual Market Stabilization Bill was proposed to fund cost-sharing reductions,[539] provide more flexibility for state waivers, allow a new \"Copper Plan\" offering only catastrophic coverage, allow interstate insurance compacts, and redirect consumer fees to states for outreach. The bill failed.\nBy 2019, 35 states and the District of Columbia had either expanded coverage via traditional Medicaid or via an alternative program.[540]\nIn popular culture\nSNL presented a sketch in October 2009 about the legislation's gridlock, with Dwayne Johnson playing an angry President Obama confronting three senators opposing the plan.[541]\nThe show aired another sketch in September 2013 with Jay Pharoah as President Obama rolling out the plan to the public, and Aaron Paul and other cast members playing ordinary Americans helping him in advocating for the legislation.[542]\nSee also\n- Broccoli mandate\n- Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\n- Individual shared responsibility provision\n- Massachusetts health care reform (sometimes called \"Romneycare\")\n- Medicaid\n- Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Reform to the American Health Care system signed into law by President Obama)\n- Single-payer health care\n- Blue Dog Coalition\n- Universal health care\n- Universal health coverage by country\n- U.S. health care compared with eight other countries (tabular form)\nReferences\n- ^ a b c d Oberlander, Jonathan (June 1, 2010). \"Long Time Coming: Why Health Reform Finally Passed\".

This question comes from Jim Barlow, a Wyoming architect, through our IE Questions project.\nTo find the answer, we need to break it out step by step: first turning raw materials into electricity, next moving that electricity to your neighborhood, and finally sending that electricity through the walls of your home to your outlet.\nStep 1: Making Electricity\nPower plants – coal, natural gas, petroleum or nuclear – work on the same general principle. Energy-dense stuff is burned to release heat, which boils water into steam, which spins a turbine, which generates electricity. The thermodynamic limits of this process (“Damn that rising entropy!”) mean only two-thirds of the energy in the raw materials actually make it onto the grid in the form of electricity.\nEnergy lost in power plants: About 65%, or 22 quadrillion Btus in the U.S. in 2013\nStep 2: Moving Electricity – Transmission and Distribution\nMost of us don’t live right next to a power plant. So we somehow have to get electricity to our homes. This sounds like a job for powerlines.\nTransmission\nFirst, electricity travels on long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines, often miles and miles across country. The voltage in these lines can be hundreds of thousands of volts. You don’t want to mess with these lines.\nWhy so much voltage? To answer this question, we need to review some high school physics, namely Ohm’s law. Ohm’s law describes how the amount of power in electricity and its characteristics – voltage, current and resistance – are related. It boils down to this: Losses scale with the square of a wire’s current. That square factor means a tiny jump in current can cause a big bump in losses. Keeping voltage high lets us keep current, and losses, low. (For history nerds: This is why AC won the battle of the currents. Thanks, George Westinghouse.)\nWhen that electricity is lost, where does it go? Heat. Electrons moving back and forth crash into each other, and those collisions warm up power lines and the air around them.\nYou can actually hear those losses: That crackling sound when you stand under a transmission tower is lost electricity. You can see the losses, too: Notice how power lines sag in the middle? Some of that’s gravity. But the rest are electrical losses. Heat, like the kind from lost electricity, makes metal power lines expand. When they do, they sag. Powerlines are saggier, and leakier, on hot days.\nDistribution\nHigh-voltage transmission lines are big, tall, expensive, and potentially dangerous so we only use them when electricity needs to travel long distances. At substations near your neighborhood, electricity is stepped down onto smaller, lower-voltage power lines – the kind on wooden poles. Now we’re talking tens of thousands of volts. Next, transformers (the can-shaped things sitting on those poles) step the voltage down even more, to 120 volts, to make it safe to enter your house.\nGenerally, smaller power lines mean bigger relative losses. So even though electricity may travel much farther on high-voltage transmission lines – dozens or hundreds of miles – losses are low, around two percent. And though your electricity may travel a few miles or less on low-voltage distribution lines, losses are high, around four percent.\nEnergy lost in transmission and distribution: About 6% – 2% in transmission and 4% in distribution – or 69 trillion Btus in the U.S. in 2013\nFun fact: Transmission and distribution losses tend to be lower in rural states like Wyoming and North Dakota. Why? Less densely populated states have more high-voltage, low-loss transmission lines and fewer lower-voltage, high-loss distribution lines. Explore the transmission and distribution losses in your state on our interactive graphic.\nTransmission and distribution losses vary country to country as well. Some countries, like India, have losses pushing 30 percent. Often, this is due to electricity thieves.\nStep 3: Using Electricity Inside Your Home\nUtility companies meticulously measure losses from the power plant to your meter. They have to, because every bit they lose eats into their bottom line. But once you’ve purchased electricity and it enters your home, we lose track of the losses.\nYour house, and the wires inside your walls, are kind of a black box, and figuring how much electricity gets lost – electricity that you’ve already paid for – is tricky. If you want to find out how much electricity gets lost in your home you’ll either need to estimate it using a circuit diagram of your house or measure it by putting meters on all of your appliances. Are you an energy wonk attempting this? Let us know, we’d love to hear from you!\nEnergy lost in the wiring inside your walls: We don’t know! It could be negligible, or it could be another few percent.\nThe Future Of Transmission and Distribution Losses\nGrid engineers are working on technologies like superconducting materials that could essentially reduce electricity transmission and distribution losses to zero. But for now, the cost of these technologies is much higher than the money lost by utility companies through their existing hot, leaky power lines.\nA more economical solution to reduce transmission and distribution losses is to change how and when we use power. Losses aren’t a constant quantity. They change every instant based on things like the weather and power consumption. When demand is high, like when we’re all running our ACs on hot summer days, losses are higher. When demand is low, like in the middle of the night, losses are lower. Utilities are experimenting with ways to spread out electricity use more evenly to minimize losses.\nThe same principle applies to your house, which is basically your own personal grid. You can reduce losses in your home by spreading out your electricity use evenly throughout the day, instead of running all your appliances at once.\nAdding Up The Losses\n- Generating electricity, we lost 22 quadrillion Btu from coal, natural gas, nuclear and petroleum power plants in 2013 in the U.S. – that’s more than the energy in all the gasoline we use in a given year.\n- Moving electricity from plants to homes and businesses on the transmission and distribution grid, we lost 69 trillion Btu in 2013 – that’s about how much energy Americans use drying our clothes every year.\nHave an idea for an energy topic that could be fun in the classroom?

Please help improve it or discuss these issues on the talk page. (Learn how and when to remove these messages)\n|\nElectric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines that facilitate this movement form a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is part of electricity delivery, known as the electrical grid.\nEfficient long-distance transmission of electric power requires high voltages. This reduces the losses produced by strong currents. Transmission lines use either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). The voltage level is changed with transformers. The voltage is stepped up for transmission, then reduced for local distribution.\nA wide area synchronous grid, known as an interconnection in North America, directly connects generators delivering AC power with the same relative frequency to many consumers. North America has four major interconnections: Western, Eastern, Quebec and Texas. One grid connects most of continental Europe.\nHistorically, transmission and distribution lines were often owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that led to separate companies handling transmission and distribution.[2]\nSystem\n[edit]Most North American transmission lines are high-voltage three-phase AC, although single phase AC is sometimes used in railway electrification systems. DC technology is used for greater efficiency over longer distances, typically hundreds of miles. High-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology is also used in submarine power cables (typically longer than 30 miles (50 km)), and in the interchange of power between grids that are not mutually synchronized. HVDC links stabilize power distribution networks where sudden new loads, or blackouts, in one part of a network might otherwise result in synchronization problems and cascading failures.\nElectricity is transmitted at high voltages to reduce the energy loss due to resistance that occurs over long distances. Power is usually transmitted through overhead power lines. Underground power transmission has a significantly higher installation cost and greater operational limitations, but lowers maintenance costs. Underground transmission is more common in urban areas or environmentally sensitive locations.\nElectrical energy must typically be generated at the same rate at which it is consumed. A sophisticated control system is required to ensure that power generation closely matches demand. If demand exceeds supply, the imbalance can cause generation plant(s) and transmission equipment to automatically disconnect or shut down to prevent damage. In the worst case, this may lead to a cascading series of shutdowns and a major regional blackout.\nThe US Northeast faced blackouts in 1965, 1977, 2003, and major blackouts in other US regions in 1996 and 2011. Electric transmission networks are interconnected into regional, national, and even continent-wide networks to reduce the risk of such a failure by providing multiple redundant, alternative routes for power to flow should such shutdowns occur. Transmission companies determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line (ordinarily less than its physical or thermal limit) to ensure that spare capacity is available in the event of a failure in another part of the network.\nOverhead\n[edit]High-voltage overhead conductors are not covered by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an aluminium alloy, formed of several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands. Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, reduces yields only marginally and costs much less. Overhead conductors are supplied by several companies. Conductor material and shapes are regularly improved to increase capacity.\nConductor sizes range from 12 mm2 (#6 American wire gauge) to 1,092 mm2 (2,156,000 circular mils area), with varying resistance and current-carrying capacity. For large conductors (more than a few centimetres in diameter), much of the current flow is concentrated near the surface due to the skin effect. The center of the conductor carries little current but contributes weight and cost. Thus, multiple parallel cables (called bundle conductors) are used for higher capacity. Bundle conductors are used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by corona discharge.\nToday, transmission-level voltages are usually considered to be 110 kV and above.[3] Lower voltages, such as 66 kV and 33 kV, are usually considered subtransmission voltages, but are occasionally used on long lines with light loads. Voltages less than 33 kV are usually used for distribution. Voltages above 765 kV are considered extra high voltage and require different designs.\nOverhead transmission wires depend on air for insulation, requiring that lines maintain minimum clearances. Adverse weather conditions, such as high winds and low temperatures, interrupt transmission. Wind speeds as low as 23 knots (43 km/h) can permit conductors to encroach operating clearances, resulting in a flashover and loss of supply.[4] Oscillatory motion of the physical line is termed conductor gallop or flutter depending on the frequency and amplitude of oscillation.\n-\nA five-hundred kilovolt (500 kV) three-phase transmission tower in Washington State, the line is bundled 3-ways\n-\nThree abreast electrical pylons in Webster, Texas\nUnderground\n[edit]Electric power can be transmitted by underground power cables. Underground cables take up no right-of-way, have lower visibility, and are less affected by weather. However, cables must be insulated. Cable and excavation costs are much higher than overhead construction. Faults in buried transmission lines take longer to locate and repair.\nIn some metropolitan areas, cables are enclosed by metal pipe and insulated with dielectric fluid (usually an oil) that is either static or circulated via pumps. If an electric fault damages the pipe and leaks dielectric, liquid nitrogen is used to freeze portions of the pipe to enable draining and repair. This extends the repair period and increases costs. The temperature of the pipe and surroundings are monitored throughout the repair period.[5][6][7]\nUnderground lines are limited by their thermal capacity, which permits less overload or re-rating lines. Long underground AC cables have significant capacitance, which reduces their ability to provide useful power beyond 50 miles (80 kilometres). DC cables are not limited in length by their capacitance.\nHistory\n[edit]Commercial electric power was initially transmitted at the same voltage used by lighting and mechanical loads. This restricted the distance between generating plant and loads. In 1882, DC voltage could not easily be increased for long-distance transmission. Different classes of loads (for example, lighting, fixed motors, and traction/railway systems) required different voltages, and so used different generators and circuits.[8][9]\nThus, generators were sited near their loads, a practice that later became known as distributed generation using large numbers of small generators.[10]\nTransmission of alternating current (AC) became possible after Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs built what they called the secondary generator, an early transformer provided with 1:1 turn ratio and open magnetic circuit, in 1881.\nThe first long distance AC line was 34 kilometres (21 miles) long, built for the 1884 International Exhibition of Electricity in Turin, Italy. It was powered by a 2 kV, 130 Hz Siemens & Halske alternator and featured several Gaulard transformers with primary windings connected in series, which fed incandescent lamps. The system proved the feasibility of AC electric power transmission over long distances.[9]\nThe first commercial AC distribution system entered service in 1885 in via dei Cerchi, Rome, Italy, for public lighting. It was powered by two Siemens & Halske alternators rated 30 hp (22 kW), 2 kV at 120 Hz and used 19 km of cables and 200 parallel-connected 2 kV to 20 V step-down transformers provided with a closed magnetic circuit, one for each lamp. A few months later it was followed by the first British AC system, serving Grosvenor Gallery. It also featured Siemens alternators and 2.4 kV to 100 V step-down transformers – one per user – with shunt-connected primaries.[11]\nWorking to improve what he considered an impractical Gaulard-Gibbs design, electrical engineer William Stanley, Jr. developed the first practical series AC transformer in 1885.[12] Working with the support of George Westinghouse, in 1886 he demonstrated a transformer-based AC lighting system in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. It was powered by a steam engine-driven 500 V Siemens generator. Voltage was stepped down to 100 volts using the Stanley transformer to power incandescent lamps at 23 businesses over 4,000 feet (1,200 m).[13] This practical demonstration of a transformer and alternating current lighting system led Westinghouse to begin installing AC systems later that year.[12]\nIn 1888 the first designs for an AC motor appeared. These were induction motors running on polyphase current, independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla. Westinghouse licensed Tesla's design. Practical three-phase motors were designed by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown.[14] Widespread use of such motors were delayed many years by development problems and the scarcity of polyphase power systems needed to power them.[15][16]\nIn the late 1880s and early 1890s smaller electric companies merged into larger corporations such as Ganz and AEG in Europe and General Electric and Westinghouse Electric in the US. These companies developed AC systems, but the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems required a much longer technical merger.[17] Alternating current's economies of scale with large generating plants and long-distance transmission slowly added the ability to link all the loads. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high-voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In what became a universal system, these technological differences were temporarily bridged via the rotary converters and motor-generators that allowed the legacy systems to connect to the AC grid.[17][18] These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.\nThe first transmission of single-phase alternating current using high voltage came in Oregon in 1890 when power was delivered from a hydroelectric plant at Willamette Falls to the city of Portland 14 miles (23 km) down river.[19] The first three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the international electricity exhibition in Frankfurt. A 15 kV transmission line, approximately 175 km long, connected Lauffen on the Neckar and Frankfurt.[11][20]\nTransmission voltages increased throughout the 20th century. By 1914, fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than 70 kV were in service. The highest voltage then used was 150 kV.[21] Interconnecting multiple generating plants over a wide area reduced costs. The most efficient plants could be used to supply varying loads during the day. Reliability was improved and capital costs were reduced, because stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider area. Remote and low-cost sources of energy, such as hydroelectric power or mine-mouth coal, could be exploited to further lower costs.[8][11]\nThe 20th century's rapid industrialization made electrical transmission lines and grids critical infrastructure. Interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was spurred by World War I, when large electrical generating plants were built by governments to power munitions factories.[22]\nBulk transmission\n[edit]These networks use components such as power lines, cables, circuit breakers, switches and transformers. The transmission network is usually administered on a regional basis by an entity such as a regional transmission organization or transmission system operator.[23]\nTransmission efficiency is improved at higher voltage and lower current. The reduced current reduces heating losses. Joule's first law states that energy losses are proportional to the square of the current. Thus, reducing the current by a factor of two lowers the energy lost to conductor resistance by a factor of four for any given size of conductor.\nThe optimum size of a conductor for a given voltage and current can be estimated by Kelvin's law for conductor size, which states that size is optimal when the annual cost of energy wasted in resistance is equal to the annual capital charges of providing the conductor. At times of lower interest rates and low commodity costs, Kelvin's law indicates that thicker wires are optimal. Otherwise, thinner conductors are indicated. Since power lines are designed for long-term use, Kelvin's law is used in conjunction with long-term estimates of the price of copper and aluminum as well as interest rates.\nHigher voltage is achieved in AC circuits by using a step-up transformer. High-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems require relatively costly conversion equipment that may be economically justified for particular projects such as submarine cables and longer distance high capacity point-to-point transmission. HVDC is necessary for sending energy between unsynchronized grids.\nA transmission grid is a network of power stations, transmission lines, and substations. Energy is usually transmitted within a grid with three-phase AC. Single-phase AC is used only for distribution to end users since it is not usable for large polyphase induction motors. In the 19th century, two-phase transmission was used but required either four wires or three wires with unequal currents. Higher order phase systems require more than three wires, but deliver little or no benefit.\nWhile the price of generating capacity is high, energy demand is variable, making it often cheaper to import needed power than to generate it locally. Because loads often rise and fall together across large areas, power often comes from distant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing, wide area transmission grids may span countries and even continents. Interconnections between producers and consumers enables power to flow even if some links are inoperative.\nThe slowly varying portion of demand is known as the base load and is generally served by large facilities with constant operating costs, termed firm power. Such facilities are nuclear, coal or hydroelectric, while other energy sources such as concentrated solar thermal and geothermal power have the potential to provide firm power. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics, wind, wave, and tidal, are, due to their intermittency, not considered to be firm. The remaining or peak power demand, is supplied by peaking power plants, which are typically smaller, faster-responding, and higher cost sources, such as combined cycle or combustion turbine plants typically fueled by natural gas.\nLong-distance transmission (hundreds of kilometers) is cheap and efficient, with costs of US$0.005–0.02 per kWh, compared to annual averaged large producer costs of US$0.01–0.025 per kWh, retail rates upwards of US$0.10 per kWh, and multiples of retail for instantaneous suppliers at unpredicted high demand moments.[24] New York often buys over 1000 MW of low-cost hydropower from Canada.[25] Local sources (even if more expensive and infrequently used) can protect the power supply from weather and other disasters that can disconnect distant suppliers.\nHydro and wind sources cannot be moved closer to big cities, and solar costs are lowest in remote areas where local power needs are nominal. Connection costs can determine whether any particular renewable alternative is economically realistic. Costs can be prohibitive for transmission lines, but high capacity, long distance super grid transmission network costs could be recovered with modest usage fees.\nGrid input\n[edit]At power stations, power is produced at a relatively low voltage between about 2.3 kV and 30 kV, depending on the size of the unit. The voltage is then stepped up by the power station transformer to a higher voltage (115 kV to 765 kV AC) for transmission.\nIn the United States, power transmission is, variously, 230 kV to 500 kV, with less than 230 kV or more than 500 kV as exceptions.\nThe Western Interconnection has two primary interchange voltages: 500 kV AC at 60 Hz, and ±500 kV (1,000 kV net) DC from North to South (Columbia River to Southern California) and Northeast to Southwest (Utah to Southern California). The 287.5 kV (Hoover Dam to Los Angeles line, via Victorville) and 345 kV (Arizona Public Service (APS) line) are local standards, both of which were implemented before 500 kV became practical.\nLosses\n[edit]Transmitting electricity at high voltage reduces the fraction of energy lost to Joule heating, which varies by conductor type, the current, and the transmission distance. For example, a 100 miles (160 km) span at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 0.5% to 1.1%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%.[26] For a given amount of power, a higher voltage reduces the current and thus the resistive losses. For example, raising the voltage by a factor of 10 reduces the current by a corresponding factor of 10 and therefore the losses by a factor of 100, provided the same sized conductors are used in both cases. Even if the conductor size (cross-sectional area) is decreased ten-fold to match the lower current, the losses are still reduced ten-fold using the higher voltage.\nWhile power loss can also be reduced by increasing the wire's conductance (by increasing its cross-sectional area), larger conductors are heavier and more expensive. And since conductance is proportional to cross-sectional area, resistive power loss is only reduced proportionally with increasing cross-sectional area, providing a much smaller benefit than the squared reduction provided by multiplying the voltage.\nLong-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200 kV. At higher voltages, where more than 2,000 kV exists between conductor and ground, corona discharge losses are so large that they can offset the lower resistive losses in the line conductors. Measures to reduce corona losses include larger conductor diameter, hollow cores[27] or conductor bundles.\nFactors that affect resistance and thus loss include temperature, spiraling, and the skin effect. Resistance increases with temperature. Spiraling, which refers to the way stranded conductors spiral about the center, also contributes to increases in conductor resistance. The skin effect causes the effective resistance to increase at higher AC frequencies. Corona and resistive losses can be estimated using a mathematical model.[28]\nUS transmission and distribution losses were estimated at 6.6% in 1997,[29] 6.5% in 2007[29] and 5% from 2013 to 2019.[30] In general, losses are estimated from the discrepancy between power produced (as reported by power plants) and power sold; the difference constitutes transmission and distribution losses, assuming no utility theft occurs.\nAs of 1980, the longest cost-effective distance for DC transmission was 7,000 kilometres (4,300 miles). For AC it was 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles), though US transmission lines are substantially shorter.[24]\nIn any AC line, conductor inductance and capacitance can be significant. Currents that flow solely in reaction to these properties, (which together with the resistance define the impedance) constitute reactive power flow, which transmits no power to the load. These reactive currents, however, cause extra heating losses. The ratio of real power transmitted to the load to apparent power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the power factor. As reactive current increases, reactive power increases and power factor decreases.\nFor transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as phase-shifters; static VAR compensators; and flexible AC transmission systems, FACTS) throughout the system help to compensate for the reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.\nTransposition\n[edit]Current flowing through transmission lines induces a magnetic field that surrounds the lines of each phase and affects the inductance of the surrounding conductors of other phases. The conductors' mutual inductance is partially dependent on the physical orientation of the lines with respect to each other. Three-phase lines are conventionally strung with phases separated vertically. The mutual inductance seen by a conductor of the phase in the middle of the other two phases is different from the inductance seen on the top/bottom.\nUnbalanced inductance among the three conductors is problematic because it may force the middle line to carry a disproportionate amount of the total power transmitted. Similarly, an unbalanced load may occur if one line is consistently closest to the ground and operates at a lower impedance. Because of this phenomenon, conductors must be periodically transposed along the line so that each phase sees equal time in each relative position to balance out the mutual inductance seen by all three phases. To accomplish this, line position is swapped at specially designed transposition towers at regular intervals along the line using various transposition schemes.\nSubtransmission\n[edit]Subtransmission runs at relatively lower voltages. It is uneconomical to connect all distribution substations to the high main transmission voltage, because that equipment is larger and more expensive. Typically, only larger substations connect with this high voltage. Voltage is stepped down before the current is sent to smaller substations. Subtransmission circuits are usually arranged in loops so that a single line failure does not stop service to many customers for more than a short time.\nLoops can be normally closed, where loss of one circuit should result in no interruption, or normally open where substations can switch to a backup supply. While subtransmission circuits are usually carried on overhead lines, in urban areas buried cable may be used. The lower-voltage subtransmission lines use less right-of-way and simpler structures; undergrounding is less difficult.\nNo fixed cutoff separates subtransmission and transmission, or subtransmission and distribution. Their voltage ranges overlap. Voltages of 69 kV, 115 kV, and 138 kV are often used for subtransmission in North America. As power systems evolved, voltages formerly used for transmission were used for subtransmission, and subtransmission voltages became distribution voltages. Like transmission, subtransmission moves relatively large amounts of power, and like distribution, subtransmission covers an area instead of just point-to-point.[31]\nTransmission grid exit\n[edit]Substation transformers reduce the voltage to a lower level for distribution to customers. This distribution is accomplished with a combination of sub-transmission (33 to 138 kV) and distribution (3.3 to 25 kV). Finally, at the point of use, the energy is transformed to end-user voltage (100 to 4160 volts).\nAdvantage of high-voltage transmission\n[edit]High-voltage power transmission allows for lesser resistive losses over long distances. This efficiency delivers a larger proportion of the generated power to the loads.\nIn a simplified model, the grid delivers electricity from an ideal voltage source with voltage , delivering a power ) to a single point of consumption, modelled by a resistance , when the wires are long enough to have a significant resistance .\nIf the resistances are in series with no intervening transformer, the circuit acts as a voltage divider, because the same current runs through the wire resistance and the powered device. As a consequence, the useful power (at the point of consumption) is:\nShould an ideal transformer convert high-voltage, low-current electricity into low-voltage, high-current electricity with a voltage ratio of (i.e., the voltage is divided by and the current is multiplied by in the secondary branch, compared to the primary branch), then the circuit is again equivalent to a voltage divider, but the wires now have apparent resistance of only . The useful power is then:\nFor (i.e. conversion of high voltage to low voltage near the consumption point), a larger fraction of the generator's power is transmitted to the consumption point and a lesser fraction is lost to Joule heating.\nModeling\n[edit]The terminal characteristics of the transmission line are the voltage and current at the sending (S) and receiving (R) ends. The transmission line can be modeled as a black box and a 2 by 2 transmission matrix is used to model its behavior, as follows:\nThe line is assumed to be a reciprocal, symmetrical network, meaning that the receiving and sending labels can be switched with no consequence. The transmission matrix T has the properties:\nThe parameters A, B, C, and D differ depending on how the desired model handles the line's resistance (R), inductance (L), capacitance (C), and shunt (parallel, leak) conductance G.\nThe four main models are the short line approximation, the medium line approximation, the long line approximation (with distributed parameters), and the lossless line. In such models, a capital letter such as R refers to the total quantity summed over the line and a lowercase letter such as c refers to the per-unit-length quantity.\nLossless line\n[edit]The lossless line approximation is the least accurate; it is typically used on short lines where the inductance is much greater than the resistance. For this approximation, the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends.\nThe characteristic impedance is pure real, which means resistive for that impedance, and it is often called surge impedance. When a lossless line is terminated by surge impedance, the voltage does not drop. Though the phase angles of voltage and current are rotated, the magnitudes of voltage and current remain constant along the line. For load > SIL, the voltage drops from sending end and the line consumes VARs. For load < SIL, the voltage increases from the sending end, and the line generates VARs.\nShort line\n[edit]The short line approximation is normally used for lines shorter than 80 km (50 mi). There, only a series impedance Z is considered, while C and G are ignored. The final result is that A = D = 1 per unit, B = Z Ohms, and C = 0. The associated transition matrix for this approximation is therefore:\nMedium line\n[edit]The medium line approximation is used for lines running between 80 and 250 km (50 and 155 mi). The series impedance and the shunt (current leak) conductance are considered, placing half of the shunt conductance at each end of the line. This circuit is often referred to as a nominal π (pi) circuit because of the shape (π) that is taken on when leak conductance is placed on both sides of the circuit diagram. The analysis of the medium line produces:\nCounterintuitive behaviors of medium-length transmission lines:\n- voltage rise at no load or small current (Ferranti effect)\n- receiving-end current can exceed sending-end current\nLong line\n[edit]The long line model is used when a higher degree of accuracy is needed or when the line under consideration is more than 250 km (160 mi) long. Series resistance and shunt conductance are considered to be distributed parameters, such that each differential length of the line has a corresponding differential series impedance and shunt admittance. The following result can be applied at any point along the transmission line, where is the propagation constant.\nTo find the voltage and current at the end of the long line, should be replaced with (the line length) in all parameters of the transmission matrix. This model applies the Telegrapher's equations.\nHigh-voltage direct current\n[edit]High-voltage direct current (HVDC) is used to transmit large amounts of power over long distances or for interconnections between asynchronous grids. When electrical energy is transmitted over very long distances, the power lost in AC transmission becomes appreciable and it is less expensive to use direct current instead. For a long transmission line, these lower losses (and reduced construction cost of a DC line) can offset the cost of the required converter stations at each end.\nHVDC is used for long submarine cables where AC cannot be used because of cable capacitance.[32] In these cases special high-voltage cables are used. Submarine HVDC systems are often used to interconnect the electricity grids of islands, for example, between Great Britain and continental Europe, between Great Britain and Ireland, between Tasmania and the Australian mainland, between the North and South Islands of New Zealand, between New Jersey and New York City, and between New Jersey and Long Island. Submarine connections up to 600 kilometres (370 mi) in length have been deployed.[33]\nHVDC links can be used to control grid problems. The power transmitted by an AC line increases as the phase angle between source end voltage and destination ends increases, but too large a phase angle allows the systems at either end to fall out of step. Since the power flow in a DC link is controlled independently of the phases of the AC networks that it connects, this phase angle limit does not exist, and a DC link is always able to transfer its full rated power. A DC link therefore stabilizes the AC grid at either end, since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently.\nAs an example, to adjust the flow of AC power on a hypothetical line between Seattle and Boston would require adjustment of the relative phase of the two regional electrical grids. This is an everyday occurrence in AC systems, but one that can become disrupted when AC system components fail and place unexpected loads on the grid. With an HVDC line instead, such an interconnection would:\n- Convert AC in Seattle into HVDC;\n- Use HVDC for the 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of cross-country transmission; and\n- Convert the HVDC to locally synchronized AC in Boston,\n(and possibly in other cooperating cities along the transmission route). Such a system could be less prone to failure if parts of it were suddenly shut down. One example of a long DC transmission line is the Pacific DC Intertie located in the Western United States.\nCapacity\n[edit]The amount of power that can be sent over a transmission line varies with the length of the line. The heating of short line conductors due to line losses sets a thermal limit. If too much current is drawn, conductors may sag too close to the ground, or conductors and equipment may overheat. For intermediate-length lines on the order of 100 kilometres (62 miles), the limit is set by the voltage drop in the line. For longer AC lines, system stability becomes the limiting factor. Approximately, the power flowing over an AC line is proportional to the cosine of the phase angle of the voltage and current at the ends.\nThis angle varies depending on system loading. It is undesirable for the angle to approach 90 degrees, as the power flowing decreases while resistive losses remain. The product of line length and maximum load is approximately proportional to the square of the system voltage. Series capacitors or phase-shifting transformers are used on long lines to improve stability. HVDC lines are restricted only by thermal and voltage drop limits, since the phase angle is not material.\nUnderstanding the temperature distribution along the cable route became possible with the introduction of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) systems that measure temperatures all along the cable. Without them maximum current was typically set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. This monitoring solution uses passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either inside a high-voltage cable or externally mounted on the cable insulation.\nFor overhead cables the fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire. The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR)/Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution makes it possible to run the network to its maximum. It allows the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system to reflect major changes to its initial operating conditions.\nReconductoring\n[edit]Some utilities have embraced reconductoring to handle the increase in electricity production. Reconductoring is the replacement-in-place of existing transmission lines with higher-capacity lines. Adding transmission lines is difficult due to cost, permit intervals, and local opposition. Reconductoring has the potential to double the amount of electricity that can travel across a transmission line.[34] A 2024 report found the United States behind countries like Belgium and the Netherlands in adoption of this technique to accommodate electrification and renewable energy.[35] In April 2022, the Biden Administration streamlined environmental reviews for such projects, and in May 2022 announced competitive grants for them funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.[36]\nThe rate of transmission expansion needs to double to support ongoing electrification and reach emission reduction targets. As of 2022, more than 10,000 power plant and energy storage projects were awaiting permission to connect to the US grid — 95% were zero-carbon resources. New power lines can take 10 years to plan, permit, and build.[34]\nTraditional power lines use a steel core surrounded by aluminum strands (Aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable). Replacing the steel with a lighter, stronger composite material such as carbon fiber (ACCC conductor) allows lines to operate at higher temperatures, with less sag, and doubled transmission capacity. Lowering line sag at high temperatures can prevent wildfires from starting when power lines touch dry vegetation.[35] Although advanced lines can cost 2-4x more than steel, total reconductoring costs are less than half of a new line, given savings in time, land acquisition, permitting, and construction.[34]\nA reconductoring project in southeastern Texas upgraded 240 miles of transmission lines at a cost of $900,000 per mile, versus a 3,600-mile greenfield project that averaged $1.9 million per mile.[34]\nControl\n[edit]To ensure safe and predictable operation, system components are controlled with generators, switches, circuit breakers and loads. The voltage, power, frequency, load factor, and reliability capabilities of the transmission system are designed to provide cost effective performance.\nLoad balancing\n[edit]The transmission system provides for base load and peak load capability, with margins for safety and fault tolerance. Peak load times vary by region largely due to the industry mix. In hot and cold climates home air conditioning and heating loads affect the overall load. They are typically highest in the late afternoon in the hottest part of the year and in mid-mornings and mid-evenings in the coldest part of the year. Power requirements vary by season and time of day. Distribution system designs always take the base load and the peak load into consideration.\nThe transmission system usually does not have a large buffering capability to match loads with generation. Thus generation has to be kept matched to the load, to prevent overloading generation equipment.\nMultiple sources and loads can be connected to the transmission system and they must be controlled to provide orderly transfer of power. In centralized power generation, only local control of generation is necessary. This involves synchronization of the generation units.\nIn distributed power generation the generators are geographically distributed and the process to bring them online and offline must be carefully controlled. The load control signals can either be sent on separate lines or on the power lines themselves. Voltage and frequency can be used as signaling mechanisms to balance the loads.\nIn voltage signaling, voltage is varied to increase generation. The power added by any system increases as the line voltage decreases. This arrangement is stable in principle. Voltage-based regulation is complex to use in mesh networks, since the individual components and setpoints would need to be reconfigured every time a new generator is added to the mesh.\nIn frequency signaling, the generating units match the frequency of the power transmission system. In droop speed control, if the frequency decreases, the power is increased. (The drop in line frequency is an indication that the increased load is causing the generators to slow down.)\nWind turbines, vehicle-to-grid, virtual power plants, and other locally distributed storage and generation systems can interact with the grid to improve system operation. Internationally[where?], a slow move from a centralized to decentralized power systems have taken place. The main draw of locally distributed generation systems is that they reduce transmission losses by leading to consumption of electricity closer to where it was produced.[37]\nFailure protection\n[edit]Under excess load conditions, the system can be designed to fail incrementally rather than all at once. Brownouts occur when power supplied drops below the demand. Blackouts occur when the grid fails completely.\nRolling blackouts (also called load shedding) are intentionally engineered electrical power outages, used to distribute insufficient power to various loads in turn.\nCommunications\n[edit]Grid operators require reliable communications to manage the grid and associated generation and distribution facilities. Fault-sensing protective relays at each end of the line must communicate to monitor the flow of power so that faulted conductors or equipment can be quickly de-energized and the balance of the system restored. Protection of the transmission line from short circuits and other faults is usually so critical that common carrier telecommunications are insufficiently reliable, while in some remote areas no common carrier is available. Communication systems associated with a transmission project may use:\nRarely, and for short distances, pilot-wires are strung along the transmission line path. Leased circuits from common carriers are not preferred since availability is not under control of the operator.\nTransmission lines can be used to carry data: this is called power-line carrier, or power-line communication (PLC). PLC signals can be easily received with a radio in the long wave range.\nOptical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line, in the overhead shield wires. These cables are known as optical ground wire (OPGW). Sometimes a standalone cable is used, all-dielectric self-supporting (ADSS) cable, attached to the transmission line cross arms.\nSome jurisdictions, such as Minnesota, prohibit energy transmission companies from selling surplus communication bandwidth or acting as a telecommunications common carrier. Where the regulatory structure permits, the utility can sell capacity in extra dark fibers to a common carrier.\nMarket structure\n[edit]Electricity transmission is generally considered to be a natural monopoly, but one that is not inherently linked to generation.[38][39][40] Many countries regulate transmission separately from generation.\nSpain was the first country to establish a regional transmission organization. In that country, transmission operations and electricity markets are separate. The transmission system operator is Red Eléctrica de España (REE) and the wholesale electricity market operator is Operador del Mercado Ibérico de Energía – Polo Español, S.A. (OMEL) OMEL Holding | Omel Holding. Spain's transmission system is interconnected with those of France, Portugal, and Morocco.\nThe establishment of RTOs in the United States was spurred by the FERC's Order 888, Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities, issued in 1996.[41] In the United States and parts of Canada, electric transmission companies operate independently of generation companies, but in the Southern United States vertical integration is intact. In regions of separation, transmission owners and generation owners continue to interact with each other as market participants with voting rights within their RTO. RTOs in the United States are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nMerchant transmission projects in the United States include the Cross Sound Cable from Shoreham, New York to New Haven, Connecticut, Neptune RTS Transmission Line from Sayreville, New Jersey, to New Bridge, New York, and Path 15 in California. Additional projects are in development or have been proposed throughout the United States, including the Lake Erie Connector, an underwater transmission line proposed by ITC Holdings Corp., connecting Ontario to load serving entities in the PJM Interconnection region.[42]\nAustralia has one unregulated or market interconnector – Basslink – between Tasmania and Victoria. Two DC links originally implemented as market interconnectors, Directlink and Murraylink, were converted to regulated interconnectors.[43]\nA major barrier to wider adoption of merchant transmission is the difficulty in identifying who benefits from the facility so that the beneficiaries pay the toll. Also, it is difficult for a merchant transmission line to compete when the alternative transmission lines are subsidized by utilities with a monopolized and regulated rate base.[44] In the United States, the FERC's Order 1000, issued in 2010, attempted to reduce barriers to third party investment and creation of merchant transmission lines where a public policy need is found.[45]\nTransmission costs\n[edit]The cost of high voltage transmission is comparatively low, compared to all other costs constituting consumer electricity bills. In the UK, transmission costs are about 0.2 p per kWh compared to a delivered domestic price of around 10 p per kWh.[46]\nThe level of capital expenditure in the electric power T&D equipment market was estimated to be $128.9 bn in 2011.[47]\nHealth concerns\n[edit]Mainstream scientific evidence suggests that low-power, low-frequency, electromagnetic radiation associated with household currents and high transmission power lines does not constitute a short- or long-term health hazard.\nSome studies failed to find any link between living near power lines and developing any sickness or diseases, such as cancer. A 1997 study reported no increased risk of cancer or illness from living near a transmission line.[48] Other studies, however, reported statistical correlations between various diseases and living or working near power lines. No adverse health effects have been substantiated for people not living close to power lines.[49]\nThe New York State Public Service Commission conducted a study[50] to evaluate potential health effects of electric fields. The study measured the electric field strength at the edge of an existing right-of-way on a 765 kV transmission line. The field strength was 1.6 kV/m, and became the interim maximum strength standard for new transmission lines in New York State. The opinion also limited the voltage of new transmission lines built in New York to 345 kV. On September 11, 1990, after a similar study of magnetic field strengths, the NYSPSC issued their Interim Policy Statement on Magnetic Fields. This policy established a magnetic field standard of 200 mG at the edge of the right-of-way using the winter-normal conductor rating. As a comparison with everyday items, a hair dryer or electric blanket produces a 100 mG – 500 mG magnetic field.[51][52]\nApplications for a new transmission line typically include an analysis of electric and magnetic field levels at the edge of rights-of-way. Public utility commissions typically do not comment on health impacts.\nBiological effects have been established for acute high level exposure to magnetic fields above 100 μT (1 G) (1,000 mG). In a residential setting, one study reported \"limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals\", in particular, childhood leukemia, associated with average exposure to residential power-frequency magnetic field above 0.3 μT (3 mG) to 0.4 μT (4 mG). These levels exceed average residential power-frequency magnetic fields in homes, which are about 0.07 μT (0.7 mG) in Europe and 0.11 μT (1.1 mG) in North America.[53][54]\nThe Earth's natural geomagnetic field strength varies over the surface of the planet between 0.035 mT and 0.07 mT (35 μT – 70 μT or 350 mG – 700 mG) while the international standard for continuous exposure is set at 40 mT (400,000 mG or 400 G) for the general public.[53]\nTree growth regulators and herbicides may be used in transmission line right of ways,[55] which may have health effects.\nSpecialized transmission\n[edit]Grids for railways\n[edit]In some countries where electric locomotives or electric multiple units run on low frequency AC power, separate single phase traction power networks are operated by the railways. Prime examples are countries such as Austria, Germany and Switzerland that utilize AC technology based on 16 2/3 Hz. Norway and Sweden also use this frequency but use conversion from the 50 Hz public supply; Sweden has a 16 2/3 Hz traction grid but only for part of the system.\nSuperconducting cables\n[edit]High-temperature superconductors (HTS) promise to revolutionize power distribution by providing lossless transmission. The development of superconductors with transition temperatures higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has made the concept of superconducting power lines commercially feasible, at least for high-load applications.[56] It has been estimated that waste would be halved using this method, since the necessary refrigeration equipment would consume about half the power saved by the elimination of resistive losses. Companies such as Consolidated Edison and American Superconductor began commercial production of such systems in 2007.[57]\nSuperconducting cables are particularly suited to high load density areas such as the business district of large cities, where purchase of an easement for cables is costly.[58]\n| Location | Length (km) | Voltage (kV) | Capacity (GW) | Date |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Carrollton, Georgia | 2000 | |||\n| Albany, New York[60] | 0.35 | 34.5 | 0.048 | 2006 |\n| Holbrook, Long Island[61] | 0.6 | 138 | 0.574 | 2008 |\n| Tres Amigas | 5 | Proposed 2013 | ||\n| Manhattan: Project Hydra | Proposed 2014 | |||\n| Essen, Germany[62][63] | 1 | 10 | 0.04 | 2014 |\nSingle-wire earth return\n[edit]Single-wire earth return (SWER) or single-wire ground return is a single-wire transmission line for supplying single-phase electrical power to remote areas at low cost. It is principally used for rural electrification, but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. Single-wire earth return is also used for HVDC over submarine power cables.\nWireless power transmission\n[edit]Both Nikola Tesla and Hidetsugu Yagi attempted to devise systems for large scale wireless power transmission in the late 1800s and early 1900s, without commercial success.\nIn November 2009, LaserMotive won the NASA 2009 Power Beaming Challenge by powering a cable climber 1 km vertically using a ground-based laser transmitter. The system produced up to 1 kW of power at the receiver end. In August 2010, NASA contracted with private companies to pursue the design of laser power beaming systems to power low earth orbit satellites and to launch rockets using laser power beams.\nWireless power transmission has been studied for transmission of power from solar power satellites to the earth.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

I am the product of a father who loved my mother deeply, and regularly did thoughtful and romantic things for her. It was (and still is!) powerful in my life.\nI could focus on my husband’s role all day long. I know it is an important one–Research tell us that it is THE most important one. But there is only so much I can do, as a wife and mom, to affect that. We all know that we cannot “change” our husbands. If they fall short in an area or two, (or twelve,) what can we do to make sure our kids are still seeing healthy examples of loving parents?\nAs for me, I’ve decided to embrace the flip side of the above quote:\nThe greatest thing I CAN DO for my children, is to love their father well.\nAs we love our husbands WELL, we can not only make it easier for them to be good husbands and fathers, but we can also model to our own children a genuine picture of grace. Not perfect parents. But LOVE, covering a multitude of sins.\nSETTING THE TONE: As women, we are the tone-setters of our homes. Though we cannot control dad’s mood, or stress level, we have more influence than we often think. We can establish a peaceful, cheerful environment for our whole family. I have found that when my husband comes in after a long day of work, the tone I set in the home will determine how things go for the rest of the day.\nI have two choices:\nI can greet him as the weary wife that I am, who also had a long day. As he walks in with all four boys chattering at him, he may not even greet me because he is busy responding to phone calls from the hospital. Feeling at least as needy as he does, it’s not beyond me to begin the “who has it worse” game, and a cold, stressful night begins. OR, I can make a choice to greet him with a smile. Instead of waiting for him to reach out to me, I can go straight to him with a big hug, and cheerfully announce (so that my kids can hear,) “Daddy missed me SOO much today! I wish he’d quit hugging me all of the time!”\nAt this point the boys giggle, and I giggle, and Dad is all caught in the middle of it, so of course he laughs as well, and hugs me a little tighter. My kids just watched us love each other. It doesn’t really matter who started it. The tone is set for the night.\nFLIRTING: Not only am I the tone setter for the home, but I can also do my part to keep some romance in my marriage. We don’t have to wait for our men to initiate–there is plenty we can do to keep the sparks alive. Sometimes it is public (like the above scenario) and sometimes it is private. Recently, I needed my husband to stop at Costco on his way home from work. I texted him simply asking if he could. He texted back “Sure.” Suddenly I saw an opportunity: So I texted back “That is SO sexy.”\nSure, I could have just thanked him, and told him how much it meant to me, but he knew all of that. Imagining his reaction when he read my “sexy” text was way more fun!\nFriends, let’s remember that when you’re married, ANYTHING can be “sexy” (or attractive, or whatever word you like to use–I just happen to think sexy is a hilarious word.) Taking out the trash? Oh yes. Mowing the lawn–a 10/10 on my sexy scale. Reading to a toddler: 12/10. It may take some effort at first, but when we maintain a fun and flirty relationship with our husbands, the kids notice. They may not know what exactly has been said, but they know that something is going on between mom and dad…And that is a good thing.\nI have failed plenty in this area. I can be selfish, needy, and immature. There have been times where I put my kids, or a friend in need before my own husband. But I do believe that as we do OUR PART to make the BEST of marriage, (whatever it looks like!) our whole family will be blessed. Never forget the power and influence you have as a wife and mother.A few more ways we can LOVE OUR HUSBANDS WELL:\n- Pray for him daily.\n- Speak WELL of him in front of your kids.\n- Compliment him IN FRONT OF THE KIDS, and privately.\n- Make his favorite meals, just because.\n- Laugh at his jokes.\n- Go out of your way to serve him–find creative ways to be kind.\n- Plan FUN dates.\n- Reach out to him physically, don’t wait for him to reach out to you.\n- Take time to look good for him. Both publicly and privately.\n- Thank him for all of his good qualities.\nWhat are some other ideas for loving our husbands well? Tell us in the comments!\nWith ALOHA! Monica, from www.thegrommom.com\n(All this month, our MOB Society writers will be leaving you with a “Mission Minute” and inviting you to get involved in some of their favorite charities).\n**********\nI am nearing the end of my training for the New York City Marathon in December! I will be running for the charity “Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy” in honor of my nephew, who has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Seeing all that my brother’s family has gone through, and all they have ahead, is heart-breaking. You can read their story on my blog HERE. You can learn more about DMD, or donate towards the cause, at the EndDuchenne website.\n**********\nWe have a few winners to announce from yesterday’s fun relaunch celebration!

It reinforces the idea that the only person we have control over, the only person we can truly change, is ourselves. Good word, mama!\nAmen, Monica! I really love your heart for showing your boys what love looks like in action! And I’m praying for your marathon – SO inspired by you and what you are doing for your nephew!\n[…] HERE to head over to the MOB Society and finish reading this post. You’ll find some fun […]\nThank you for sharing this, Monica! It was a a good reminder.\nThis was such a great reminder!! We have so much influence in our families. Our attitudes and actions can either be a blessing to our husband and kids or a curse. I am practicing making better choices every single day so I can model the right things for my kids and our relationship with each other and God are the two most important!\nGreat post, Monica! Our children will inevitably do as we do not do as we say. How I treat my husband and how he treats me is laying groundwork for the future marriage of my children. I want them to have a strong foundation to build on!\nOh Monica, this was so convicting… and so true. I am going to put this into practice, starting now, with God’s help. Bless you. e.\nThat is so true! I learned this lesson three years into our marriage, which was late but better late than never!\nIn a world where it seems that a central target for our enemy is the family, I appreciate your words which bring us back to the basics in a positive and proactive way! Nothing is too hard for the Lord and it is He that equips us to love even our enemies. Thanks Monica!\nThis is a great post and I agree with the other comments…very counter cultural. Loving our spouse instead of belittling him. One idea I think which has been good for our boys to see is how my husband stops before walking out the door for work…and we stand up, hugging and praying together out loud. Thanks Monica!\nYes! Yes! Yes! It is so easy to focus on our kids, and continually serve them without realizing that it needs to start with our hubs. Great post!\nI’ve gotten strange looks before when I’ve said I love my husband more than my children, but it’s true! Other than God my husband is my number one, and I believe that is how God means for it to be! I do tend to shove our time to the side though or take a call when we are discussing something. I’m really going to work on that! He needs to know that he is as important to me as I say he is! Thank you for this!\nYes! LOVE this SO much Monica! So. Very. Much. And girl, the NYC Marathon! You’re amazing! When I did my Long Beach HALF Marathon, I was giving thanks at the 11 mile turn (when the FULL marathoners peeled off course to do miles 12-26) that I wasn’t going that way…I was so thankful I only had two more to go. Run on friend!! xo\nI feel like I *might* be the winner of the Lego movies, unless there is another Annette B. But I haven’t seen an email. Have emails been sent yet? Thanks! 🙂\nSo true and simply said!\nWow, thank you so much for this post, Monica. We are celebrating 5 years of marriage this month and I can already sense how different things are now than when we first got married. Marriage is being in a constant state of self denial and serving our spouse. Then, a baby comes along…and yikes, he’s only been around 5 months but I can already tell how easy it can be to focus just on him and not on my marriage. Anyhow, I really appreciate the practical advice you have written and pray that I can be more intentional about keeping my marriage growing.\nOh, Monica! How your truth speaks to my heart. As a fellow homeschool mom of 4 boys, I often need the reminder that it is not all about me the moment that my husband and confidant walks in the door. All those things swirling through my head all day can wait a few more hours, so that I can warmly welcome him back to the family when he gets home.\nWe are in each other’s life for a reason. Thank you for showing up. You’re an angel (:\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day, also known as Survivor Day, takes place each year on the Saturday before American Thanksgiving, with virtual and in-person events in communities everywhere. Learn more and find an event near you.\nI lost my father to suicide just one month after my tenth birthday.\nI was young. Really young.\nEven now, as a 26-year old, I can still barely comprehend quite how young I was to have to experience and process such a loss.\nWhen people find out this part of my history, they ask me things like: How did it feel to be a kid and lose your parent in this way? What was it like? How much did you realize was going on? How perceptive were you at that age? How much were you told about what happened? How much do you think you should have been told?\nMy answer to all of these, is basically just: I don’t know.\nIn a way, losing someone when you’re a kid really isn’t that much different than being an adolescent or adult, I imagine: the whole world as you knew it has ended. It’s like everything you knew, planned, imagined, and depended upon has unalterably changed forever; but then you look around and the world somehow keeps spinning like nothing has changed at all. You try to meld the feeling that nothing will ever be the same again, while realizing that everything is still the same way it was seconds, moments, days, and weeks before you were told – but with one obvious change. It’s like the whole world has shifted 10 degrees, and no one else seems to notice but you. Everything is suddenly alien and foreign and strange. It’s an inconsistency that sits in your chest like a lump; a pill you can’t swallow no matter how hard you try to push it down.\nPeople tell you things like, “Your father had a mental health condition. It’s a thing called depression. It has to do with brain chemistry. Something was wrong with him inside. He needed to go away to get help, and that’s the reason he won’t be coming back.”\nWhat should someone tell a child who has just lost a loved one to suicide? What can a kid do to cope with this loss? What can be said?\nHere’s my truth: I don’t know. There is no one easy “key” that unlocks the secret. There is no exact, specific answer.\nBut what you should do is reassure them that they’re not alone. That’s something I realize, now, is true: that even in the darkest of times, no one is ever alone, whether they realize it or not. Don’t kick yourself for not knowing what to do, and don’t let them kick themselves for anything, either. The answer is, you will figure out a way to get through it. That’s the only option: one step at a time.\nThe young person will have questions. “Where’s daddy?” and “How do I move on from here?” These questions are not easy. But there will be people to help figure it out, one question at a time.\nThere will be days and weeks, maybe even months, where they feel completely alone and lost. Do what you can to help guide them along, or just sit next to them through the storm, one day at a time.\nTake it one day, one question, one step, and even one second at a time. Get through the next breath, get through the next meal, and then get through the next day. Just get through it, because that’s what you have to do.\nThere are countless people this has happened to, and there is a wealth of information and support available. So many people have gotten through this, and so will you. Don’t ever think you are alone, whether you’re someone who’s suffered a loss, or the person helping them get through the grief. When push comes to shove, you have the power to get through this, and there are support groups, therapists, activities and hobbies that can help you heal, as well as wonderful organizations like AFSP that can help facilitate the healing process by providing information that can inform your understanding of what has happened.\nMy own grieving process has been a long and winding road. I’ve tried just about everything along the way trying to figure it out. It wasn’t until I was asked to take part in the AFSP documentary The Journey that I found true comfort by finding myself in the company of others who have lost someone as well. That’s another thing that can help those grieving a suicide loss: connecting with others who have gone through what you have. Once a year for International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day, hundreds of Survivor Day events take place across the country. But you don’t have to wait for once a year. Connect with your local AFSP chapter to help get connected to people in your community.\nIf I had to say one thing from one young suicide loss survivor to another, I would tell them the following: that there will come a day that you will stop and realize just how far you’ve come. All the accomplishments that have passed, the laughs you’ve had, the love you’ve found, the heartbreak you’ve felt, the places and things you’ve seen and done. All the things you have gotten through. You’ll look back, and you’ll be amazed by the support you’ve found, and the strength, determination, and hope you’ve found that lay inside yourself the whole time. And that will give you the courage to keep going: to take that next breath, that next step, and tackle the next day. I promise you, as someone who has been there before, I know now there is nothing that I can’t get through.\nThe same goes for you. Just take it one day at a time.\nFor more information on how to support children and teens following a suicide loss, see AFSP’s Children, Teens, and Suicide Loss booklet, written in partnership with the Dougy Center, The National Center for Grieving Children & Families.\nSchools seeking best practices for healing after a suicide loss in their community can look to AFSP’s After a Suicide: A Toolkit for Schools, produced in collaboration with the Suicide Prevention Resource Center.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Barbara Buono, is out with her first television ad today.\nThe ad begins running this week and is a more than $1 million buy, a Buono campaign aide said.\nThe ad's goals are two-fold: hitting her opponent on the state of the economy and introducing herself to voters where she still has low name recognition. Buono, 59, has had digital ads, including one released this week poking fun at the pronunciation of her last name, but this is the first one New Jersey residents will see in their pricey New York City media market. It will run on network and cable television, per the aide. It is is not running in the Philadelphia market, the other market New Jersey residents in the southern part of the state see. It is also one of the nation's most expensive markets.\n\"To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine. Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition,\" Buono says in the 30-second ad before introducing her story to New Jersey.\n\"I know that struggle, because I lived it. My dad was an immigrant who worked as a butcher. Working my way through school, I was able to pull myself up. I'm Barbara Buono. As your governor, I'll fight to give every New Jersey child the same chance I got.\"\nChristie's spokesman Kevin Roberts responded to the ad, saying in a statement, \"As the architect of Jon Corzine's budgets, Barbara Buono was central to those disastrous policies that brought New Jersey to the brink of catastrophe.\"\n\"Barbara Buono may be 'very proud' of her tenure as Jon Corzine's budget chair, but New Jerseyans know that we cannot go back to the failed era of more taxes, more debt and fewer jobs under Jon Corzine and Barbara Buono,\" Roberts said.\nHERE'S CHRISTIE'S OWN AD ATTACKING BUONO\nDespite the financial and polling differences between the two candidates - Christie, 50, has wide margins in both - Christie himself put out an attack ad going after Buono last week.\n\"Meet Barbara Buono. Jon Corzine's budget chair now running for governor. Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes,\" a narrator says before naming the taxes and pivoting to Christie. \"Let's not turn back the clock. Chris Christie's record: four balanced budgets, no new taxes for anyone, the best job growth in a decade and the most education funding ever.\"\nIt ends as others have with Christie looking out at the Jersey Shore, a topic that has also come under some scrutiny this week as Democrats have cried foul at separate state tourism ads that feature Christie and his family.\nDemocrats are calling them publicly funded campaign ads, while Christie supporters point out that they are running outside of New Jersey and the company that made the ads said data research showed Christie would be the most effective messenger.\nThe ad controversy might be getting some heat from Democrats, but he is still beating Buono by a wide margin in recent polls. A poll out earlier this month from NBC News-Marist has Christie up 34 points over Buono, 62 percent to 28 percent.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        PARTICIPANTS:\nFormer Governor Jeb Bush (FL);\nBen Carson;\nGovernor Chris Christie (NJ);\nSenator Ted Cruz (TX);\nGovernor John Kasich (OH);\nSenator Marco Rubio (FL); and\nDonald Trump;\nMODERATORS:\nDavid Muir (ABC News); and\nMartha Raddatz (ABC News)\nMUIR: Good evening, again, everyone.

[applause]\nRADDATZ: Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]\nMUIR: Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Businessman Donald Trump. [applause]\nMUIR: Florida Senator Marco Rubio. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Former Florida Governor, Jeb Bush. [applause]\nMUIR: And Ohio Governor John Kasich. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates. [applause]\nMUIR: And Dr. Ben Carson, please come out on the stage. He's standing there, as well. Dr. Carson. [applause]\nRADDATZ: And Donald Trump. [applause]\nMUIR: And lastly, we welcome back to the debate stage, Donald Trump. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?\nMUIR: It was so noisy in here. Yes. Yes. We're going to introduce Ohio Governor John kasich. [applause]\nThe applause so loud here in the hall.\nRADDATZ: The applause so loud you couldn't hear. We couldn't hear, either. That's a good sign for the excitement this evening.\nGentlemen, thank you for being here tonight, just days before voters here in New Hampshire make their decisions. The rules are simple and have been agreed to by all the campaigns. There will be 60 seconds to answer and if another candidate is mentioned in that answer, that candidate will have 30 seconds to respond. There are green, yellow and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is up and they will also hear this sound.\nMUIR: So let's get started. We welcome you all to the debate stage here tonight. We're going to tackle the issues Americans are most concerned about, the economy, ISIS, Homeland Security. And here in New Hampshire, some of the most heated rhetoric yet over who is best suited to step in on day one, who has the experience, who has the temperament to be commander-in-chief.\nMr. Trump, Senator Cruz has said about you right here in New Hampshire this week, quote, \"I don't know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way, having his finger on the button. We're liable to wake up one morning, and if he were president, he would nuke Denmark.\" Saying, quote, \"That's temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.\"\nI wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to this and to tell the American people tonight why you do have the temperament to be commander-in-chief.\nTRUMP: I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I've gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it, when I — when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard. Everybody said, \"Oh, the temperament,\" because I talked about illegal immigration.\nNow, everybody's coming to me, they're all trying to say, well, he's right, we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something, because there's something going on that's not good. And remember this, I'm the only one up here, when the war of Iraq — in Iraq, I was the one that said, \"Don't go, don't do it, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.\" So, I'm not one with a trigger. I'm not one with a trigger. Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.\nBut I'll build the mill arbitrary stronger, bigger, better than anybody up here, and nobody is going to mess with us. That, I can tell you. [applause]\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. I want to bring this to Senator Cruz, then.\nBecause Senator, you did said of Trump's behavior this week, that's not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.\nWhy not?\nCRUZ: Well, you know, David, the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve.\nThe world is getting much more dangerous. We've had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office, a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy we're facing. This is a president who, in the wake of Paris, in the wake of San Bernardino, will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism, much less focus on defeating the enemy.\nI am convinced every individual standing on this stage, would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. [applause]\nAnd the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us, who is best prepared to keep this country safe, to rebuild the military, to rebuild our Navy, our Air Force, our Army, our Marines, and to ensure that we keep America safe.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz, I did ask about Mr. Trump. You said he doesn't have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Do you stand by those words?\nCRUZ: I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed, who has clear vision, who has judgment, who can confront our enemies, who can confront the threats we face in this country, and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage — both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief, knowing how to go after our enemies.\nIn the case of Iran, for example, who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei, when he chants, \"Death to America,\" he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. We're going to continue on this notion of readiness and experience. I'm going to come back.\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.\nMUIR: If you would like to respond, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didn't answer your question. And that's what's going to happen — OK. [applause]\nThat's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We're going to win with Trump. We're going to win. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. We're going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And that's what I like and that's what the country is going to like. [applause]\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. And we're going to continue on this notion of readiness and on experience, but I want to ask about a headline that was back in the papers again this morning.\nDr. Carson, on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign sent out messages and voicemails saying, quote, \"Breaking news. Dr. Ben Carson will be planning to suspend his campaign following tonight's caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus-goers of this news.\"\nBut as we can all see, you are still standing here tonight. Late this week, your campaign sent this e-mail, quote, \"This kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people don't trust politicians. If Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values.\"\nWhat kind of action do you think Senator Cruz should take?\nCARSON: Well, you know, when I wasn't introduced No. 2, as was the plan, I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But... [applause]\nBut you know, today is the 105th anniversary, or — 105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So, I'm not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz. [applause]\nBut I will say — I will say — I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause — one even died — to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say, \"Forget about you guys.\"\nI mean, who would do something like that? Now, I don't think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would, what does that tell you? So, unfortunately, it did happen.\nIt gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says, if it's legal, you do what you need to do in order to win. That's not my ethics. My ethics is, you do what's right.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz. [applause]\nDr. Carson, thank you.\nSenator Cruz, you have said that Dr. Carson and his wife have become friends of yours. I'm curious as why you didn't call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages.\nCRUZ: Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions, including me. When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, I'm sorry.\nLet me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, \"Taking a break from campaigning.\"\nThey reported that on television, CNN's political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN's report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.\nNow, at the time, I was at the caucuses, I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. I didn't reach him that evening.\n[bell rings]\nI reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then, he said, Ted, would you make this apologize in public? I said, yes, I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently, CNN reported on that — they didn't correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15, that's what CNN was reporting.\nSubsequent to that initial report, Ben's campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had, that's why I apologized.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you.\nWe're going to move on here. Back to the issues...\nCARSON: Since I was mentioned...\nMUIR: Dr. Carson, please.\nCARSON: This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something. [laughter]\nIn fact, the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So, what happened to that one, it is unclear. But the bottom line is, we can see what happened, everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment.\nMUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you. Thank you, doctor.\nSenator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.\nGovernor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote, \" not ready to be president of the United States.\"\nAnd Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?\nRUBIO: Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.\nI will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1,000 years. He's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.\nAnd let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.\nThat's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. [applause]\nI do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?\nCHRISTIE: Sure. First, let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?\nIt's a different experience, it's a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.\nYou have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't. [applause]\nAnd the fact is — the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership, that's truancy. [applause]\nAnd the fact is that what we need to do — what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.\nI like Marco Rubio, and he's a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.\nRUBIO: If I may respond to that. [applause]\nMUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?\nRUBIO: Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey, they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.\nBut I would add this. Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when I'm elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in governor bush on this, because you...\nCHRISTIE: Hold on one second.\nMUIR: ... have made this...\nCHRISTIE: Excuse me...\nMUIR: If you'd like to respond to economic...\nCHRISTIE: I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him. [applause]\nSee Marco — Marco, the thing is this. When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I've done.\nNone of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job, I'm glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States. [applause]\nMUIR: Senator Rubio?\nRUBIO: Chris — Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn't even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.\nHere's the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing.\nCHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.\nRUBIO: Well, that's the — that's the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion — I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we're going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing. He knows what he is doing. That's why he's done the things he's done.\nThat's why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he's done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country. That's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.\nThis election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I'm elected.\nMUIR: Governor Christie, we will — we will...\nBUSH: Chris, why don't you mention my name so I can get into this.\nCHRISTIE: You know what the shame is — you know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when you've never been responsible for that in your entire life.\nRUBIO: Chris, you didn't want to go back. You didn't want to go back. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: And the fact is, I went back, it got done and here's...\nRUBIO: You didn't want to go back, Chris.\nCHRISTIE: Oh, so — wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I don't think it is.\nRUBIO: Chris, everybody — you said you weren't going to go back. He told everyone he wasn't going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, go back with a mop and clean up the flooding?\nCHRISTIE: It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points.\nMUIR: Governor Christie — thank you, Governor. I will mention — listen...\nRUBIO: ... It's your record, it's not a talking point...\nMUIR: ... Listen, people... [applause]\nGovernor Bush, I'll mention your name so that you can come in on this...\nBUSH: ... I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.\nMUIR: I want to bring you in on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \"nothing\" in the Senate. How do you square the two?\nBUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills... [applause]...who has the leadership skills to lead? And, I'm proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.\nWe had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up, and on the job do it. [applause]\nIt's not the same. Look, let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got — we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...[bell rings]...going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...\nMUIR: ... We're going to continue with leadership now. Martha?\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well. Your opponents say you, like Senator Rubio, are not prepared to be Commander in Chief. You have talked tough about threats we face in the Mid-East. It was reported just moments ago that the North Koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has nuclear weapons, and conducted another nuclear test just last month.\nThe missile that was launched is the kind the North Koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. How would you respond if Commander in Chief to that launch?\nCRUZ: Well, I would note, initially the fact that we're seeing the launch, and we're seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.\nAnd, I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So, what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.\nWith respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch, North Korea wants to launch a satellite, and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth, and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of what's called an EMP, and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard, potentially killing millions.\nWe need to harden the grid to defend ourselves, and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea.\nRADDATZ: Well, let me ask you this, if you were Commander in Chief tonight would you have order the U.S. military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent North Korea from becoming an even graver threat?\nCRUZ: You know, at this point I'm not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have, knowing what exactly is there. [applause]\nOne of the real problems...\nRADDATZ: ... Senator Cruz, let me tell you this, you have talked tough about the Mid-East, you haven't gotten those intelligence briefings about that. Why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the U.S...\nCRUZ: ... Actually, with respect, I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I haven't gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Korea's doing because I'm here in new Hampshire. When you're responding to an immediate incident, you need to know the intelligence of what's occurring.\nBut what I was saying — look, it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. It's why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place — because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.\nIt's why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic, and it's why I've pledged, on the very first day in office, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so we're not sitting here in five years, wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that.\nRADDATZ: Okay. Senator Cruz, I will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time, and they have had eyes on it.\nRUBIO: But Martha, just — Martha, just to clarify on that point, because he's right, and one more thing to point — it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians, land and ships.\nRADDATZ: Senator Rubio, I'm talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad.\nRUBIO: Well — no, I understand. And not — but — but I think it's important to note that it is — and Senator Cruz, I think, was alluding to this, as well — it is the standard procedure of the United States, if those missiles pose a threat to land, civilians, our allies or any of our assets, to shoot down that missile in mid-flight.\nI understand your question was about a preemptive strike, but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike from going errant and destroying any — any assets of the United States, or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region.\nRADDATZ: OK. Thank you, Senator Rubio.\nGovernor Kasich, how would you respond to tonight's launch?\nKASICH: Well, we've got to to step up the pressure. And by the way, I've gotta say, after being here, every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today, were so much more positive.\nLook, in terms of North Korea, Martha, we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft, because what they're trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material, along with the — with the technology, the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.\nThat's what I worry about the most, frankly, is non-state actors, people who don't have a uniform, people don't have a country, who can spread this, who are not subject to the — to the mutual assured defense. In other words, you strike us, we strike you.\nSome of these radicals, they don't care about that. That's what I worry about, for my children, and for their children, going forward. So, we have to be very tough.\nAnd we should tell the Chinese, look, if you're not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans, ballistic missile defense to Japan — and by the way, we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran, because they're able to shift money. They're able to send money and receive money. [bell rings]\nWe've gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly, I think we could have — I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that — on that missile that's rising, you want to take action — you will have our support, if that's what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans, or, frankly, in the entire rest of the world.\nMartha, this is — this is the — relates...\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Thank you — thank you...\nBUSH: ... this relates to strategic patience. [applause]\nRADDATZ: ... Governor Bush, I'll get to you in a moment.\nBUSH: This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms, and what they do is they pull back, and voids are filled, and they're now filled by asymmetric threats of terror, as well as nation-states on the run.\nThe next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game, and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe, then we should do it. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Bush.\nMr. Trump, do you have a red line with North Korea? Would you consider military action? And how far would you let them go?\nTRUMP: Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.\nI think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn't know what he's doing. [applause]\nI think he has no idea what he's doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?\nRUBIO: Yeah. I have a — I got mentioned, can I respond?\nTRUMP: Good.\nRADDATZ: And I'd like him to finish the question, please.\nTRUMP: As to North Korea?\nRADDATZ: Specific — as to North Korea.\nTRUMP: We have — tremendous — has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous — the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.\nI deal with them. They tell me. They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country — they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China, let China solve that problem. [bell rings]\nThey can do it quickly and surgically. That's what we should do with North Korea.\nRADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you were mentioned. [applause]\nRUBIO: Here's the broader point, as well, and then I think it touches on what Donald just mentioned. Barack Obama views America as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size. OK?\nThis is a president that views this country as a country that's been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world.\nFor example, it's one of the reasons why he had betrayed Israel, because he believes that if we create separation from Israel, it will help our relations in the Islamic world. The same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region with accommodations to North Korea. North Korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations, as an example.\nAnd Donald's absolutely right. China does have a lot of influence over North Korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that North Korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them — a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the United States potentially.\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much, Senator Rubio.\nGovernor Bush, another problem facing the commander-in-chief right now is that North Korea is currently detaining an American college student. What would you do to get that college student back home?\nBUSH: Well, first of all, it's interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in Iran. A day or two days afterwards, North Korea took a — held an American student hostage. I think it's when we send a signal of weakness, when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didn't commit crimes that are held hostage in Iran.\nWe saw the shameful treatment of our sailors, that this creates weakness — sends a signal of weakness around the world. The next president of the United States is going to have to get back in the game. Where the United States' word matters. Where we back up our allies, where we don't send signals of weakness. We need to use every — every influence possible to get this student back.\nAnd I think John is right about this, there are crippling sanctions that are available, as it relates to the two or three banks that North Korea uses to — to — use it — illicit trade. We ought to re-establish sanctions, not just because of the student, but because of their actions that they're taking right now, as it relates to building this missile capability.\nRADDATZ: Governor Christie, I want to go to you on the same question. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: Let's get something...\nRADDATZ: Would you negotiate with North Korea to...\nCHRISTIE: No. Let's make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we're talking about in North Korea, where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle.\nAnd so, what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength, and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans, but we also need to make sure that they understand there's a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.\nThis president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that, you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say, we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take, not only to get our people home safely, but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate American's sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.\nThis is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State, who is embracing a third Barack Obama term, would be even weaker.\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Christie. [applause]\nDavid?\nMUIR: Martha, we're going to turn to immigration now. And I want to bring in Governor Kasich because you told us in an ABC interview, Governor, quote, \"It is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods, grab people out of their homes and ship people back to Mexico.\" Adding, quote, \"That's not where the party is. The party is not for departing 11.5 million people.\"\nBut Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz, who have made deportation central to their campaigns, top the national polls. So, my question for you, are you not where the voters are?\nKASICH: Well, you know, David, I — I've just spent a lot of time here in this state, as I mentioned earlier, and we have to have practical solutions, just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on North Korea. Look, the situation is, we need to finish the border. It has to be completed. Just like we lock our doors at night, the country has to be able to lock its doors. And we can have a guest worker program, where people can come in and out in an orderly way.\nAnd then for the 11.5 million that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I believe they ought to pay some back taxes, pay a fine, never get on the path to citizenship, but get legalization. It is not — I couldn't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they've been here, leaving their children in the house. I mean, that is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in.\nAnd secondly, I think at the end of the day, that Americans would support a plan like this. I think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border, guest worker, pay a fine, a path to legalization, and not citizenship. And we've got to get this done. And I will tell you this, within the first 100 days that I am president, I will put that proposal to the Congress. And I will tell you, as a former Congressman, and an executive, in Ohio, I can promise you that I believe you'll get the votes to pass that, and we can move on with that issue and protect our border. That's what I think.\nMUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you. [applause]\nI want to bring this next to Senator Cruz. You heard what the governor said. He said, \"We need practical solutions.\" And you've said, \"I don't intend to send jack boots to knock on doors. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime.\"\nSo, what is your plan? How will you deport 11.5 million undocumented people? And be specific. How would you do it?\nCRUZ: So, in terms of a practical solution, I've laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration. It's 11 pages, single-spaced, chapter and verse. It's on our website, tedcruz.org.\nIn short, we're going to do, we're going to build a wall. We're going to triple the border patrol. We're going to increase — and actually, since Donald enjoyed that, I will simply say, I've got somebody in mind to build it.\nWe're going to increase four-fold, the fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they're occurring. We're going to put in place a strong e-verify system in the workplace, so you can't get a job without proving you are here legally.\nWe'll put in place a biometric exit-entry system on visas, because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally, but people coming on visas and overstaying.\nWe will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law. [applause] And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally. [applause]\nMUIR: Let me just ask you this, though, because Governor Kasich was talking about the families and what you do with the families that you would have to send home.\nCan you tell the American people tonight how you would do that?\nCRUZ: What you do is, you enforce the law. You know, under the Constitution, the president has an obligation to, quote, \"Take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Federal immigration law provides, if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, they are to be deported.\nWe saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down, not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law, and for everyone who says, you can't possibly do that, I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people.\nIn eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law — we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people, the border wasn't secure, so they'd come right back. Once you secure the border, enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. I want to bring in Senator Rubio.\nThis question is about immigration, it is also about leadership. You're aware of the criticism from many candidates on this stage tonight that you co-authored the so-called Gang of Eight bill that would have created a path to citizenship for people here illegally.\nGovernor Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Governor Bush has said, \"I don't think we need people cutting and running anymore.\"\nDid you fight for your own legislation, Senator, or did you run from it?\nRUBIO: Here's the bottom line. We can't get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them.\nThis has been abundantly clear. Every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed. And it has failed because the American people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws.\nAnd that's why since then, I have said repeatedly, if you are serious about immigration reform, then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law, but to actually do it. To hire the 20,000 new border agents, to finish the fencing and walls, to put in place mandatory e-verify, to put in place an entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays.\nAnd once that is in place and that's working, I believe the American people will support a very reasonable, but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time, who are not dangerous criminals, who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did.\nBut until then, none of that is going to be possible.\nMUIR: But I'm asking, did you fight for the legislation at the time or did you run from it as you're...\nRUBIO: Well, the legislation passed, but it has no support. In essence, it couldn't pass in the House, it will never pass in the United States until we secure the border, and it is not the way we're going to do when I'm president.\nWhen I'm president, we are going to enforce the law first, prove to people that illegal immigration is under control. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals, who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay.\nMUIR: Governor Christie?\nCHRISTIE: Yeah, David, I would just like you to listen, again, everybody.\nThis is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was, \"Did he fight for his legislation?\" [applause]\nIt's abundantly clear that he didn't. It's abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation.\nWhen the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure, I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.\nWhen they didn't want — when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government, I told them, fine. Close down the government. I'll get in my cars, head to the governor's mansion, order a pizza, open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.\nAnd guess what they didn't do? They didn't pass a tax increase, because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is, a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say, well maybe since I can't win this one, I'll run. That's not what leadership is. [bell rings] That's what Congress is. [applause]\nMUIR: Governor thank you.\nSenator Rubio?\nRUBIO: Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem. And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage.\nIt is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.\nAnd I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening, meaning gaining the support of the American people, you cannot do this without the support of the American people, is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all, illegal immigration is under control.\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. We want to turn to health care in this country, and for that, author and commentator, Mary Katherine Ham tonight.\nHAM: Thanks, David.\nGood evening, guys.\nTRUMP: Good evening.\nRUBIO: Good evening.\nCHRISTIE: Good evening.\nKASICH: Good evening.\nCARSON: Good evening.\nCRUZ: Good evening.\nBUSH: Good evening.\nHAM: Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Yes.\nHAM: In the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton has criticized Bernie Sanders' plan for single payer government health care, noting it would require big, across the board tax increases for Americans. In doing so, she's doubling down on Obamacare, despite its persistent unpopularity.\nMr. Trump, you have said you want to appeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, \"Everybody's got to be covered,\" adding, quote, \"The government's going to pay for it.\" Are you closer to Bernie Sanders' vision for health care than Hillary Clinton's?\nTRUMP: I don't think I am. I think I'm closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. [applause]\nWe're going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.\nI am self-funded. The only one they're not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.\nWe're going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. We're going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better. [applause]\nIn addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.\nAnd I think everybody on this stage would have to agree...[bell rings]...you're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you've got, quote, \"no heart\". There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama's broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan — change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it.\nHow do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?\nCRUZ: Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing.\nYou have a scarcity of doctors. You have rationing. And that means the elderly are told, we're going to ration a hip replacement, we're going to ration a knee replacement. We're going to ration end- of-life care.\nWe're right now heading into a medical system with about a 90,000-doctor shortage in America and socialized medicine; whether proposed by the Democrats or proposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country.\nWhat should we do on health care? If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. [applause]\nAnd once we do that, we will adopt common sense reforms, number one, we'll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance.\nWe'll expand health savings accounts; and we will de-link health insurance from employment so that you don't lose your health insurance when you lose your job, and that way health insurance can be personal, portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors. [applause]\nHAM: Dr. Carson, you have some experience with this matter. In the past, you have said that Obamacare should be replaced before it's repealed. How and why?\nCARSON: Well, thank you. You know, I was hoping to get a chance to talk about North Korea. I was the only one who didn't get to do that, and I've got stuff to say about it, let me tell you.\nBut at any rate, you have to replace it with something that makes sense. It doesn't make sense. And the reason that I dislike Obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people — which the nation is supposed to be centered on — that we don't care what you think, this is what we're doing. And if you don't like it, too bad. That's a problem. And we can't afford to do that because that will fundamentally change America.\nI have proposed a health empowerment account system. Everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born, they keep it until they die. They can pass it on. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with, recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and don't have as such access.\nWe give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman; that saves you a awful lot of money. And that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously, because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care.\nAnd then in terms of taking care of the indigent, we have another whole system, and I can go ahead and explain it, but I don't have the time, but I'd be happy to if you give me some more time. But go to my website bencarson.com, read about it. You can read about everything that's been discussed here in great detail. [applause]\nHAM: Thank you, Dr. Carson. David, Martha, back to you.\nMUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you. We want to turn now to the issue of eminent domain, which is being debated right here in New Hampshire. And Josh McElveen is the political director and the anchor of WMUR TV. Josh?\nMCELVEEN: Thank you, David. And good evening, candidates. Mr. Trump, you have said, quote, \"I love eminent domain\" which is the seizure of private property for the sake of the greater good theoretically. You tried to use the measure in business endeavors, you've said you'd support its use for the Keystone Pipeline project.\nHere in New Hampshire, a project, though, known as the Northern pass would bring hydro-electric power from Canada into the Northeastern grid. Do you see eminent domain as an appropriate tool to get that done?\nTRUMP: Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.\nEminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country. Without it, you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have hospitals, you wouldn't have anything. You wouldn't have schools, you wouldn't have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are — I think I'm more than they are — they tell me, oh — well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet, OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.\nAnd what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying, oh, you're going to take their property. When somebody — when eminent domain is used on somebody's property, that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they'll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain, you don't have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.\nSo eminent domain — it's not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely — it's a necessity for a country. And certainly it's a necessity for our country.\nMCELVEEN: So would that be yes on the Northern Pass project? [applause]\nTRUMP: Yes.\nBUSH: The difference — the difference between eminent domain for public purpose — as Donald said, roads and infrastructure, pipelines and all that — that's for public purpose. But what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose, that is down right wrong. [applause]\nAnd here's the problem with that. The problem was, it was to tear down — it was to tear down — it was to tear down the house...\nTRUMP: Jeb wants to be — he wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didn't take the property.\nBUSH: And the net result was — you tried.\nTRUMP: I didn't take the property.\nBUSH: And you lost in the court.\nTRUMP: The woman ultimately didn't want to do that. I walked away.\nBUSH: That is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use. [applause]\nAnd in Florida, based on what we did, we made that impossible. It is part of our Constitution. That's the better approach. That is the conservative approach.\nMCELVEEN: Mr. Trump, take 30 seconds.\nTRUMP: Well, let me just — you know, he wants to be a tough guy. A lot of times, you'll have — you'll have — and it didn't work very well.\nBUSH: How tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman?\nTRUMP: A lot of time — let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times — a lot of times...\nBUSH: How tough it is to take away a property from an elderly woman?\nTRUMP: ... you — let me talk. Let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times...[booing]...that's all of his donors and special interests out there. [booing]\nSo — it's what it is. That's what — and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets. You can't get them. You know who has the tickets for the — I'm talking about, to the television audience? Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money. [booing]\nThat's who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason they're not loving me...[booing]...the reason they're not — excuse me. The reason they're not loving me is, I don't want their money. I'm going to do the right thing for the American public. I don't want their money. I don't need their money. And I'm the only one up here that can say that.\nEminent domain, the Keystone pipeline — do you consider that a private job? Do you — do you consider that...\nBUSH: I consider it a public use.\nTRUMP: No — no, let me ask you, Jeb. [bell rings] Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private?\nBUSH: It's a public use. It's a public use.\nTRUMP: Is it public or private?\nBUSH: It's a public use.\nTRUMP: Real — a public use?\nBUSH: Yeah.\nTRUMP: No, it's a private job.\nBUSH: It's a public use.\nTRUMP: It's a private job.\nBUSH: Established by the courts — federal, state courts.\nTRUMP: You wouldn't have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.\nMCELVEEN: All right, gentlemen...\nTRUMP: You wouldn't have massive — excuse me, Josh — you wouldn't have massive factories without eminent domain. [booing]\nMCELVEEN: Gentlemen, we do have to move forward. Dave, Martha, back to you.\nMUIR: Josh, thank you.\nWhen we come back here tonight, jobs, ISIS, and what it means to be a conservative. [applause]\nThe Republican debate continues right here from New Hampshire on ABC. We'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nMUIR: And, we welcome you back to the Republican debate from New Hampshire tonight here on ABC. We're going to turn now to what it means to be a conservative, and I want to turn to Governor Kasich.\nGovernor, while campaigning here in New Hampshire, you were already asked about groans from some conservatives after your endorsements from the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. You said, quote, \"What conservatives have to know is they have to say, look isn't it nice to have a conservative like me liked? And, maybe the ought to think about it because if I get elected president, the Republican party and the definition of conservatism is going to change.\"\nHow would you change conservatism?\nKASICH: Well, first of all, look. As the New York Times said, he's certainly not a moderate, but he can bring people together to solve problems. The fact of the matter is I've cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year. I have balanced budgets, the federal budget, the state of Ohio budget, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're up 400,000 jobs, and in Washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which I was the architect.\nBut, here's the beauty of it, it's not just balancing a budget, it's about jobs. You know, when I was kid growing up in a neighborhood where Dad went home at night and said, \"I lost my job today\", it just killed the family.\nIt just was a devastating effect. We have to have economic growth, but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. I believe we need to help the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor. We need to help the developmentally disabled to rise, and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship. In other words, in American, conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles, but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their God given purpose. That's what conservatism should be. [applause]\nMUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.\nMr. Trump, you've heard the argument from many of the candidates on this stage that you're not a true conservative. Tell the voters watching tonight why you are.\nTRUMP: Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I — of — of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very, very strongly.\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. [applause]\nSenator Rubio, you have said yourself that you don't think Donald Trump is running as a conservative. Did he convince you?\nRUBIO: Well, I think conservatism is about three things and Donald touched on one of them, but it's about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level. The federal government is a limited government, limited by the Constitution, which delineates its powers. If it's not in the Constitution, it does not belong to the federal government. It belongs to states, local communities and the private sector.\nIt's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it's the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.\nAnd it's about a strong national defense. It's about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. That's conservatism. [applause]\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to turn this discussion to the economy now.\nAnd Mr. Trump, Governor Christie has said, \"I tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if you get to ask a question, just ask him how.\" Christie said, \"I don't care which of the things he talks about, just ask him how.\" You have said that you'd be the greatest jobs president God ever created. Tell Americans watching tonight how many jobs you would create in the first term and how.\nTRUMP: Well, before I go there, I will tell you, I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico, where New Hampshire, by the way, has been virtually wiped out. They've lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now we're about to sign another trade deal, TPP, which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don't talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster.\nI'm going to bring jobs back and I'll start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan — right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars that's offshore. Right now, they have $2.5 trillion, and in my opinion, it's much more than that. That's what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.\nAnd we're not going to lose Pfizer, which is now leaving, and other great companies, which is now leaving. And they're all leaving. We have many, many companies that are leaving this country. We're not going to lose them anymore because we're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country.\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.\nThere are a lot of governors on this stage tonight and Governor Christie, Governor Kasich said of you, quote, \"In Ohio, we balanced a budget. They don't have one over in New Jersey. Our credit has been strengthened. Their credit has been downgraded. We've got more jobs.\"\nHow important are those metrics in choosing the next president? And is his job — is his record on jobs, I should say, actually stronger than yours?\nCHRISTIE: Well, he deserves credit for his record on jobs. He's done a very good job as governor of Ohio. Never said that John hasn't. He's done a very good job. [applause]\nBut — but unfortunately, John's been so busy doing over stuff, he's using old statistics. That's OK. New Jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years under five different governors this year in New Jersey. New Jersey cut spending over $2.3 billion and we have 10,000 fewer employees than we had when I walked in the door. John has a bigger government now and more employees than he had when he walked in the door.\nBut all that doesn't matter. What really matters is this, that executive experience really matters. You heard this on the stage tonight. We've heard it said on the stage that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing.\nI'd like to ask all the veterans listening out there tonight, who are waiting in line for healthcare, who are literally dying because the Veterans Administration doesn't work, do you think Barack Obama knows what he's doing? I don't. And I'll tell you something. Anybody who evaluates him is knowing what he's doing and managing the government doesn't know how to manage a government themselves.\nAnd one last thing, David, which I think is really important. I listened to Senator Rubio's answer on his bill. He said his bill couldn't pass on the gang of eight. He acted as if he was somehow disembodied from the bill. It was his bill. He said this idea doesn't work. It was his idea.\nSee, when you're a governor, you have to take responsibility for these things. You can't just act as if it happened out of nowhere. We have to take responsibility as executives. I take responsibility for my record in New Jersey. We've rebuilt the economy and rebuilt after the second-worst natural disaster in American history. I'm proud of my record. And by the way, I like Kasich's record, too. He's a good governor. [applause]\nKASICH: David?\nMUIR: Thank you, Governor.\nGovernor Kasich?\nKASICH: Look, I'm — I'm not here — I like Chris.\nMUIR: He didn't say your record was better than his.\nKASICH: Let — but let me — let me just tell you. First of all, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years.\nSecondly, we have grown government at the rate of inflation. And I went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. And we've grown jobs by 400,000 — that's one of the fastest growing states in the country. Our pensions are secure and our credit is rock solid.\nNow, I've learned that, what makes things work, what gets the economy going, not just in Ohio, but in Washington — and it's three things. Common sense regulations, which we have, lower taxes, which we have, the lowest taxes, tax cuts in the country. And thirdly, a fiscal plan to balance the budget.\nWhen you go from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black, when you cut taxes by $5 billion and you grow over 400,000 jobs, that is a record that I can take to Washington, using the same formula that I used in Washington when I was part of the effort to balance the budget to give us a surplus and to create jobs.\nMUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.\nKASICH: That's what I did and I'll do it again in the first 100 days.\nMUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you. I do want to turn from jobs to taxes.\nRUBIO: Now, see, I was mentioned by Governor...\nMUIR: If you would like to respond to the governor, you can.\nRUBIO: Yeah.\nMUIR: I'm coming to you next with a question, anyway. You can respond to that question.\nRUBIO: OK, good, then I'll get to it [inaudible]. Here's the...\nMUIR: We're going from jobs to taxes, and here's the...\nRUBIO: Well, no, sorry. Let me respond to that question.\nMUIR: To the Gang of Eight bill first?\nRUBIO: Well, here's the response. I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here, OK? This is a president — this is a president who is trying to change this country. When he talked about change, he wasn't talking about dealing with our problems.\nObamacare was not an accident. The undermining of the Second Amendment is not an accident. The gutting of our military is not an accident. The undermining of America on the global stage is not an accident. Barack Obama is, indeed, trying to redefine this country. We better understand what we're dealing with here, because that's what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to double down on if they are elected.\nMUIR: The governor wasn't talking about the president, he was talking about the Gang of Eight bill. [applause]\nRUBIO: No. He talked about Barack Obama.\nMUIR: So, let me ask you about taxes, Senator Rubio.\nRUBIO: Yeah.\nMUIR: A recent poll, 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than $1 million a year. Are they wrong?\nRUBIO: I don't know of any problem in America that's going to be fixed with a tax increase. We have an economy today, an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough.\nAnd one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet. Our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world. And then on top of that, we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation, where an American company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back.\nThe combination of these two things has stranded over $2 trillion, the equivalent of the size of the Russian economy, $2 trillion of American corporate money stranded overseas, combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us.\nThe solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase. It is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies, so we can make America globally competitive again. [applause]\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.\nI want to bring in Governor Bush. And Governor, I just want to repeat that number for you — 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than a million.\nWhat do you say to the people who believe that tonight?\nBUSH: I would like to see more millionaires. I think we need to grow more millionaires, we need create a prosperity society where people can rise up. [applause]\nThis notion that somehow we're undertaxed as a nation is just fool hearty, when we have entitlements growing far faster than our ability to pay for it. A conservative, because that's the point of this, believes in limited government, believes in a entrepreneurial capitalism and a strong national defense.\nBut it also has to be, we need to reform things. In my town hall meetings, I went to a place where a woman described her neighbor, who has a better economic deal by not working than her struggling to make ends meet. We need to be on the side of working people. And you know, the problem with the left is, another tax, another regulation, another mandate makes it harder for them to rise up.\nEverything that we should do should be focused on high, sustained economic growth, where the middle class gets a raise for the first time, and where people are rewarded for work, rather than non-work. And I know how to do this. And if people are interested in the specifics of this, they ought to go to jeb2016.com. [applause]\nMUIR: Knew that was coming. Governor, thank you.\nCHRISTIE: David? Hey, David? David? Hey, David? I actually have experience with raising taxes on millionaires in my state. It was done. It was done by my predecessor.\nAnd I want everybody in the public who is in that 68 percent, I want to tell you the truth. You're wrong. And here is why you're wrong. After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires, we lost, in the next four years, $70 billion in wealth left our state.\nIt left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly. If the United States raised taxes any further, that money will leave the United States, as well. We won't have better jobs.\nLet New Jersey be the canary in the coal mine. It is a failed idea and a failed policy, it's class warfare. It happened in my state. I've stopped it from happening again. But we cannot do it.\nThe 68 percent of the people are wrong about that, it will hurt the American economy. We tried it in New Jersey. Come take a look — it did not work. [applause]\nMUIR: Governor Christie, thank you. [applause] Martha?\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you advocate what you call carpet bombing, or saturation bombing, to defeat ISIS, citing the more than 1,100 air attacks that the U.S. carried out during the first Gulf War in 1991.\nExplain how a strategy to defeat a standing army would work against an unconventional terrorist group that is now hiding amongst the population.\nCRUZ: Well, sure. It starts with a commander-in-chief that sets the objective. And the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying ISIS. Obama hasn't started with that objective and everything else flows from there.\nOnce you set that objective, we have the tools to carry that out. The first tool is overwhelming air power. It is one of the blessings of the United States of America, having the greatest military on the face of the earth, is we have the ability to use that air power.\nAs you know, in the first Persian Gulf War, it was 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama is launching between 15 and 30. Now, when I say saturation carpet bombing, that is not indiscriminate.\nThat is targeted at oil facilities. It's targeted at the oil tankers. It's targeted at command and control locations. It's targeted at infrastructure. It's targeted at communications. It's targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of Raqqa. It's using overwhelming air power.\nYou know, couple of weeks ago, it was reported that a facility is open called Jihadist University. Now, the question I wonder, why is that building still standing? It should be rubble. And if you had a president...[bell rings] [applause]... all though I will say this. I would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs.\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz, would you like to expand or loosen the rules of engagement? I was just over in a command center in Erbil and they said they thought the rules of engagement worked. Because you have so many civilians in those populated areas, they don't want to hit civilians.\nCRUZ: Martha, I will tell you, I have visited with active duty military, with veterans over and over and over again in town halls all over the state of New Hampshire. What we are doing to our sons and daughters, it is immoral. We are sending them into fight with their arms tied behind their back. They cannot defend themselves. And it is wrong. [applause]\nAnd I will tell you this. Look. America has always been reluctant to use military force. It's the last step we take. But if and when we use it when it comes to defeating ISIS, we should use it. We should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out. Don't engage in nation-building but instead, allow our soldiers to do their jobs instead of risking their lives with politicians making it impossible to accomplish the objective. [applause]\nRADDATZ: So, loosen the rules of engagement?\nCRUZ: Absolutely, yes.\nRADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you said in the last debate that ISIS is the most dangerous, jihadist group in the history of mankind And that will it take overwhelming U.S. force to defeat them. Can you specifically tell us what you mean by overwhelming force?\nRUBIO: Well, first, we need to understand who they are. ISIS is not just a jihadist group, they're an apocalyptic group. They want to trigger a showdown in a city named Tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure.\nAnd I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. The reason why it's important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own. They are going to have to be defeated. And I believe they need to be defeated on the ground, by a ground force, made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.\nIt will take Sunni Arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily. That will require a coalition of Iraqis and Syrians, that are also Sunnis, but it will also require the cooperation of Jordanians, Egyptians. We should ask more of the Saudis.\nThat will need to be backed up with more U.S. special operation forces alongside them. And it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes. And we are going to have to strike them, not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet. They have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world. [bell rings]\nBut it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a U.S.-led coalition takes on. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Again, Senator Rubio, you've already said ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. So, that would make it more dangerous than Al Qaida, the insurgents we fought in Iraq. We committed hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to fight those groups. So if ISIS is the most dangerous group in history, why not commit a large U.S. ground force?\nRUBIO: Because they currently occupy Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by Sunnis themselves. If they are held by Shias it will trigger sectarian violence. The Kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the Kurdish areas, but Kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni villages and towns.\nIt will take Sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities, and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past.\nAnd why that is important is because if Sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas, you are going to have a successor group to ISIS. ISIS is a successor group of Al Qaida. In fact, they broke away...[bell rings]...from Al Qaida, because as horrible as Al Qaida is, ISIS thought Al Qaida was not radical enough. This is who we're dealing with, and they have more money than Al Qaida ever had.\nBUSH: Martha — Martha, if I...\nRADDATZ: Well, what would you do — what would you do differently to try to get those Sunni forces? They have not been coming forward.\nRUBIO: Well, the problem with the Sunni forces in the region is they don't trust this administration. This administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies, the Shia, in Iran. It poisoned the well with these countries. It makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result.\nThey also, by the way, understand what real U.S. air power looks like. They saw the Iraq war. They saw, up close, also Afghanistan. They know what air power looks like when the United States is committed to the cause. And they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now, and they say to themselves, that's not real commitment. We know what real commitment looks like.\nThe — the Jordanian king was in Washington three weeks ago. He told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans. And the coalition — meaning U.S. leadership on the ground...[bell rings]...would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes.\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump — thank you very much, Senator Rubio. Mr. Trump. [applause]\nYou have said you will vigorously bomb ISIS. You've said, \"we've got to get rid of ISIS, quickly, quickly.\" How would you get rid of them so quickly? And please give us specifics.\nTRUMP: Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil. And if we did that, they wouldn't have the wealth they have right now. Now, I still say the same thing, because we're doing little pinpricks. We're not even bombing — if somebody's driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, \"we're going to bomb.\" If they don't get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.\nWe actually have a case where we don't want to bomb the oil, because we don't want to hurt — pollute the atmosphere. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we can't bomb because we're gonna hurt the atmosphere?\nYou have to knock the hell out of the oil. You have to take the oil. And you have also back channels of banking. You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of — tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.\nSo we have to stop those circuits. Nobody knows banking better than I do. They have back circuits, back channels. Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system. So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up. But it should have been done four years ago, not now.\nRADDATZ: And — and what would you do in those cities, where there are people who we are trying to help, who ISIS is essentially holding hostage?\nTRUMP: You have to go in — first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, that'll very much weaken — and it will happen fairly fast.\nThey'll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth they've accumulated. But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil — not just bomb it, take it — when you do that, it's going to dry up very quickly. They're going to become a very weakened power, quickly. Thank you.\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much, Mr. Trump. [applause]\nLet's turn to Libya. Governor Bush, it is a country in chaos. There is no government. This week, defense officials said there are now 5,000 ISIS fighters there, roughly doubling previous estimates. We know you and others have been critical of the administration's handling of Libya after the initial air strikes that you supported.\nBut this is a problem you would stand to inherit if you're the next president. Reports this week said the administration is considering new air strikes, possible special operations raids. Would you support renewed air strikes or any U.S. involvement on the ground?\nBUSH: I would. And I would do it in concert, again, with our Arab allies and with Europe, most particularly in this case. This is the lesson learned: in history, if you bomb something and not do anything as it relates to deal with the aftermath of this, if you don't have a stable government, you get what we have in Libya.\nAnd this is not — leading from behind is not an effective policy. We have to lead. Without the United States, nothing seems to work. Europe doesn't have the ability to — to — to lead — forward lead in this regard.\nAnd so dealing with the caliphate is important, because it now has spawned other areas. There have been 70-plus attacks in 17 countries, either inspired by ISIS or organized by ISIS, Libya being the most important one now.\nWe have to deal with the caliphate, with building a Sunni army there, but we also have to deal with it in Libya. And I think the United States, ultimately, is going to play — play a significant role in this.\nThe problem with the Obama administration is that they see this incrementally. They're reluctant. They don't lead. No one knows whether we're serious, and when we do it, we do it in increments you can barely see. [bell rings]\nThe United States has to lead in a much more aggressive way than we're doing right now. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Bush. Dr. Carson?\nCARSON: I want to say something about this, because I'm not here just to add beauty to the stage. [laughter]\nYou know, I've been talking about Libya for quite a long time. I think I was the first one to start talking about it because I say we have to have a proactive foreign policy strategy. And of course, the next place that ISIS is going to attack to is Libya.\nIf you want to expand your caliphate and increase your influence, then you're going to go to a place that's strategically located. You go north, across the Mediterranean. You're into southern Europe. You go south, you're into Chad and Sudan and Niger. Not to mention the fact that you have much more oil than you do in Iraq. That's the kind of place that they're going to go to, therefore, we need to be thinking about how do we prevent them from tacking over there. They're already sending their fighters there, we need to be consulting with our military experts and asking them what do they need in order to prevent ISIS from being able to take over Libya. That's going to have enormous concede for us.\nRADDATZ: And would you support renewed airstrikes?\nCARSON: I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in conjunction with our Joint Chiefs and our military people they felt that was an appropriate strategy.\nThe fact of the matter is none of us up here is a military expert, and we sometimes act like we are, but we're not. And if we actually sit down and talk with them and get them to understand our plan and their impression of what needs to be done, I think we're going to make a lot more progress.\nBUSH: Martha and David, I just...\nRADDATZ: We're going to move on.\nBUSH: Martha and David...\nMUIR: Martha, thank you. We're just going to — we're going to stay on ISIS here and the war on terror, because as you know, there's been a debate in this country about how to deal with the enemy and about enhanced interrogation techniques ever since 9/11.\nSo Senator Cruz, you have said, quote, \"torture is wrong, unambiguously, period. Civilized nations do not engage in torture.\" Some of the other candidates say they don't think waterboarding is torture. Mr. Trump has said, I would bring it back. Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?\nCRUZ: Well, under the definition of torture, no, it's not. Under the law, torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems, so under the definition of torture, it is not. It is enhanced interrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.\nMUIR: If elected president, would you bring it back?\nCRUZ: I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed, I joined with Senator McCain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because I think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels.\nBut when it comes to keeping this country safe, the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe. And so, if it were necessary to, say, prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack, you can rest assured that as commander in chief, I would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, you said not only does it work, but that you'd bring it back.\nTRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what. In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people. We have things that we have never seen before — as a group, we have never seen before, what's happening right now.\nThe medieval times — I mean, we studied medieval times — not since medieval times have people seen what's going on. I would bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. [applause]\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. Governor Bush, you have said that you won't rule waterboarding out. Congress has passed laws banning the use of waterboarding by the military and the CIA, as you know. Would you want Congress to change that if you're elected president?\nBUSH: No, no, I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. And it was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I — and I think where we stand is the appropriate place. But what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.\nThe idea that we're going to solve this fight with predator drones, killing people somehow is a — is more acceptable than capturing them, securing the information. This is why closing Guantanamo is a complete disaster. What we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe...[applause]...by having intelligence capabilities, both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today. That's how you get a more safe place is by making sure that we're fully engaged. And right now, this administration doesn't do that.\nMUIR: Governor Bush, thank you. [applause]\nSenator Rubio, I do want to ask you, you have said that you do not want to telegraph to the enemy what you would do as commander in chief. But for the American people watching tonight who want to know where the next president will stand, do you believe waterboarding is torture?\nRUBIO: Well, when people talk about interrogating terrorists, they're acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function. Law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial, and convict them. Anti-terrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply.\nAnd, it is true, we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that we're going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us.\nBut, here's the bigger problem with all this, we're not interrogating anybody right now. Guantanamo's being emptied by this president. We should be putting people into Guantanamo, not emptying it out, and we shouldn't be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States. [applause]\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.\nWe want to turn now to the topic of executive orders, and for that, we're going to turn back to Mary Katharine Ham. Mary Katharine?\nHAM: Thanks, David. Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail you've promised voters a lot, in fact if you're elected president you'd say you end Common Core immediately, abolish the IRS, and do away with sanctuary cities. You've also been a persistent critic of President Obama's executive overreach, going it alone, not working with Congress. How do you intend to implement this aggressive agenda within your Constitutional authority, especially given that it would require working with Congress and Washington players with whom you're happy to say you have a strained relationship?\nCRUZ: Well, thank you for that question. You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country. The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority.\nNow, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. That means on day one his efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen.\nThe reason I can end Common Core at the federal level is because Obama is abusing executive power using Race to the Top funds in the Department of Education to force it on the states. That's one avenue.\nThe second avenue of change is foreign policy, and foreign policy can change the fastest. It's worth remembering that Iran released our hostages the day Reagan...[bell rings]...was sworn in. And, the third is legislation, and that can only be done with the people behind you, which is why the two big legislative initiatives I'm campaigning on are repealing Obamacare, and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the IRS. [applause]\nHAM: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz is known for opposing deals, you literally wrote the book on making them. Senator Cruz has mentioned that on the trail. What would you say to those conservatives that are concerned that a deal maker will just perpetuate the same deals in Washington and the way that things run now [inaudible]...\nTRUMP: ... No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but we'll do it the way our founders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals. Ronald Reagan did it with Tip O'Neil very successfully, you didn't hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all. You have to be able to get a consensus.\nNow, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that? It doesn't get any more amateurish than that. A good deal maker would never make a deal like that. With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree. But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and that's part of being a deal maker. You can't leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker. It doesn't work that way. You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done. But, it's got to be the deal that you want. [applause]\nHAM: Governor Kasich, is the problem with Washington that there are too many deals, or too few?\nKASICH: Well, right now the deals — there's no leadership. I mean, a lot of the things that we're talking about here tonight, on the border, and so many of the things. What we should be doing on foreign policy, you know what the problem is, Mary Katharine? There's not a leader that gets somebody to rise up.\nYou have to have a leader that can inspire, and actually some of what Donald was saying is true. Look, do you know how hard it was...\nTRUMP: Some?\nKASICH: ... to get the balance the federal budget balanced? You have to plead with people. To do what we've done in Ohio, you have to plead with people, then you go back down to Washington and do the same thing.\nYou see, we have to remind people we're Americans before we're Republicans and Democrats, and when we wait, and when we delay what we end up doing, Mary Katharine, is we make the United States weaker. In fact, it's a foreign policy issue because people look at America not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there? So the point is you have to work with people.\nThe problem with executive authority for the president, it's really bad news for this reason. Since he's given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants. He's not a king. He's a president. An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the — in the Congress.\nI've done it in Ohio. I consult. I could use executive orders, but I don't trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak. We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second — in the second back seat of this country. That's what we need to do. [applause]\nAnd we can do it. And we can do it.\nBUSH: This is a — this is an important subject. I agree with everything that's been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs.\nBut we also ought to get back to being a Tenth Amendment country, as well, a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions. And in the Bush administration, we would shift transportation dollars back to the states. I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than Washington, D.C.\nEPA delegated authority, back to the states. Education dollars, back to the states. I would like to see reform take place all across the country, where there's more vouchers, more freedom. [applause]\nIf we did that, we would shrink government's power in Washington, D.C. and we would have a much more effective government, where people would begin to trust our government again, because now, no one believes it works.\nKASICH: Mary Katherine, let me just say this to you. [applause]\nYou must have an agenda that you are ready to move on in the first 100 days. Jeb is right. If you delay and you wait, the Washington operators will take you down. I can tell you this, in the first 100 days, I will have legislation to freeze federal regulations, have them reviewed by the vice president, reduce state taxes on individuals, reduce taxes on corporations, have a fiscal plan to balance the budget, get the border protected and begin to fix Social Security in the first 100 days.\nSo, anybody who is here tonight, if I get elected president, head out tomorrow and buy a seat belt, because there's going to be so much happening in the first 100 days, it's going to make your head spin. We're going to move America forward. I promise you. We're going to move us forward. [applause]\nBUSH: You mentioned me. He mentioned me. One other thing that I think we ought to do, along with repealing Obamacare, we need to shift all of this power of healthcare, which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes, and allow governors to have the Medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century Medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty. There's so much that can be done, but I don't trust Washington to do it. I trust the state capitals to be the place — to be the source of innovation and reform in this country. [applause]\nHAM: Thank you, governors. Martha and David, back to you.\nMUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you.\nWe want to turn to something the governor of New Hampshire said... [laughter]\nKASICH: Jeb mentioned me. Time for me to go again.\nBUSH: I didn't mention him the second time.\nKASICH: He says he didn't mention me the second time. I thought I heard it, Jeb. No. I'm just kidding. Thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight. Thank you.\nMUIR: A connection here on the stage. We're going to move on to what the governor of New Hampshire said just this week, and that is that heroin overdose is not the second-leading cause of death in this state. You don't need me to tell you that. But there's another number, 48 percent of the people here in this state knows someone who has abused heroin.\nJosh, who covers this for WMUR, has the next question.\nMCELVEEN: You're all aware, candidates, this is a major problem here in New Hampshire. It's a very deadly problem as well. Last month, New Hampshire senators Kelly Ayotte, Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, they went down to Washington, along with the police chief of the state's largest city to testify before the Judiciary Committee in D.C.\nSenator Cruz, you're a member of that committee. Your campaign schedule didn't allow you to attend this. Even so, the police chief called your absence outrageous, given the severity of the problem. Last week, though, you told a personal story of a close family member's struggle with addiction. What can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that you understand the severity of this problem and you're not just saying what people want to hear days before the primary?\nCRUZ: Well, Josh, as you noted, this is a problem that, for me, I understand first-hand. My older sister, Myriam, who was my half- sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction. My father and her mom divorced when she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life, and she ended up marrying a man who had been in and out of jail. She then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house.\nI still remember my father and me driving up to get Myriam out of that crack house to try to convince her she needed to be a mom to — to my nephew Joey.\nShe wasn't willing to listen. She was not willing to change the path she was on. She was angry. I was — had just gotten my first job coming out of law school. I took a $20,000 loan on a credit card to put my nephew, Joey, in Valley Forge Military Academy — he was in sixth grade at the time, to pay his way through that.\nAnd about five, six years ago, Miriam died of an overdose. It was — the coroner ruled it accidental. We don't know. She went to one night, had taken too many pills, and Joey walked in and found her dead.\nThis is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve it. Solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like A.A., and counseling, and churches and charities. But it also has to be securing the borders, because you have got Mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this country.\nWe know how to secure the borders. What is missing is the political will to do it.\nAnd as president, I will secure the border, we will end this deluge of drugs that is flowing over our southern border and that is killing Americans across this country.\nMCELVEEN: And Governor Christie, you have talked a lot about this issue here in New Hampshire. [applause]\nState reforms, criminal justice reforms, access to treatment.\nTo Senator Cruz's point, let's take it a step further. Would you be willing to engage in cross-border enforcement into Mexico, a place where law enforcement in New Hampshire has traced at lot of this supply back to. Would you engage in cross-border enforcement without the cooperation without the Mexican government?\nCHRISTIE: Of course I would. As a former United States attorney who spent seven years of my life fighting this on the streets of my state, I would do that. But we need to do more. And let me tell you what we've done in New Jersey, Josh. We are working with the folks in New Hampshire in their legislature right now to show them how we're helping to solve this problem in New Jersey.\nNot just for this campaign — three years ago, I proposed a law that we signed into effect, which said that anyone who was a non- violent, non-dealing, first-time drug offender no longer goes to prison in New Jersey. They go to mandatory, in-patient drug treatment.\nWhat has happened is, crime has gone down 20 percent in those years. The prison population has gone down 10 percent. We've now closed the state prison — closed a state prison, and we're turning it into a drug rehabilitation facility, so people can get the tools they need.\nListen, everyone out there knows this in New Hampshire. This is a disease. It's not a moral failing, it's a disease. And we need to get people the treatment they need. And let me tell you why. Because I'm pro-life.\nAnd I'm pro life not just for the nine months in the womb, I'm pro-life for when they get out and it's a lot more complicated. [applause]\nSixteen-year-old, heroin-addicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup, I'm pro-life for her life. The 42-year-old lawyer who is taking Oxycontin and can't get out of bed and support his family — I'm pro-life for his life. Everyone of those lives is an individual gift from God.\nAnd the last thing is this. These efforts we've taken over the last three years, 2015 in New Jersey, for the first time in four years, drug overdose deaths have gone down, not up.\nI'll bring the same solutions to the country. [applause]\nMCELVEEN: Governor Christie, thank you very much.\nDavid, Martha, back to you.\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Christie. Thank you, Josh.\nOur partner in this debate, the Independent Journal Review, has collected questions from some prominent conservatives around the country.\nHere's a videotaped question from radio host Larry O'Connor.\n[begin video clip]\nO'CONNOR: In 2008, we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history. Let's face it: if Hillary Clinton is the nominee for the Democrats, you'll be running against the prospect of the first woman president.\nHow will you change that narrative and motivate the electorate behind your candidacy?\n[end video clip]\nTRUMP: Well...\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, I'm going to give that question to you. You took it — you took it away anyway.\nTRUMP: Yes. OK, good. It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.\nI think that — I look at what's going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton. I can tell you, I'm the last person that she wants to run against.\nAnd I think you can see what we've done in terms of galvanizing. I've been all over the country. We're — last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people. It set up in about four days. We have galvanized and we've created a movement. A lot of it has to do with — as an example, Josh's question on drugs.\nI'm the first person that said, \"Build a wall.\" But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now. A real wall. And you'll solve lots of problems.\nBut we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton. Because — assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe. So, I don't know that she's going to be running. But on the assumption she runs... [applause]\nI mean, look. And speaking of that, if she runs, she's running for one reason. She's going to be able to run for one reason, and that's because the Democrats are protecting her. Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely — their lives have been destroyed.\nBut on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot. We will win it handily. We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nI'm going to go to Senator Rubio on this. How would you change that narrative?\nRUBIO: I think it's already happening. Look at the turnout in Iowa. A historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses. There are saying the same thing is going to happen here in New Hampshire. Look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having. Much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why.\nBecause people are starting to understand, very clearly, that this election is going to be a turning point. That 2016 is not just a choice between Republican or Democrat. It is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.\nSo here is what Hillary Clinton needs to understand. We're going to have our primary, we're going to have our debates — which by the way, are twice as many as the Democrats have been willing to have themselves. But we're going to bring this party together and we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is unqualified to be the president of the United States of America.\nShe put classified information on her computer because she thinks she's above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in Benghazi, can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Dr. Carson, I want to go to you on Larry O' Connor's question. Would you change the narrative?\nCARSON: It's the same question?\nRADDATZ: Yes.\nCARSON: Yes. Well, first of all, I think it would be a pretty easy contrast, quite frankly, between myself and Hillary Clinton. In one case, you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual. An individual who at Benghazi, which I will never let go, quite frankly, because I think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns, firing away, allowing their colleagues to escape.\nAnd I'm sure, in the back of their mind, they were just saying, if we can just hold on, help is on the way. But help was not on the way. When did we in the United States not send people to help our own people? You know, this is not who we are. [applause]\nAnd — I would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the Washington way.\nMUIR: Martha?\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much Dr. Carson. I'm going to go back to David.\nMUIR: Governor, well come to you in the next segment.\nWhen we come back, questions about race, about our veterans and social issues what younger conservative voters are now saying as we continue with New Hampshire with the Republican debate, right here on ABC.\n[commercial break]\nMUIR: Welcome back to New Hampshire, ABC News coverage of the Republican debate, and it's great to have you back at the podiums, and we want to turn to race in America.\nAnd Mr. Trump, there are many who argue cell phones and smartphones are just now exposing what's been happening in this country for years. Cases of excessive force against minorities.\nAs you know, Mr. Trump, on the other side, the FBI director recently said there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of increased scrutiny. You have said police are the most mistreated people in America. As president, how do you bridge the divide?\nTRUMP: Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether it's an incident done purposely — which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action — or if it is a mistake, it's on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.\nThe police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and they're afraid for their jobs, they're afraid of the mistreatment they get, and I'm telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.\nThey can't act. They can't act. They're afraid for losing their pension, their job. They don't know what to do. And I deal with them all the time. We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police. [applause]\nMUIR: Great. Mr. Trump, I did ask about bridging the divide though as president. So what would you say to the American families who say we have lived through this, we have seen excessive force? What would you say to those people?\nTRUMP: Well, they do. And, you know, they sue. Everybody sues, right? They see excessive — I mean, they go out, they sue. We have so much litigation — I see the courts, I see what they're doing. They sue, and you know what? We don't want excessive force. But at what point — you know, either you're going to have a police force that can do its job...\nI was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday. Tremendous people. They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people. They want to do their job. And you're going to have abuse and you're going to have problems, and you've got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems. But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.\nKASICH: David, David...\nMUIR: I do want to ask — Governor Kasich?\nKASICH: I wanted — I wanted to say, look, this — there can be a win-win here. I have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement. A family doesn't want dad or mom going home in a box. And for our community leaders, many of them think the system not only works — not only doesn't work for them, but it works against them.\nAnd I created a big collaborative in Ohio made up of law enforcement, community leaders, the head of my public safety and a former Democrat, liberal Senate senator Nina Turner, run it. They got together, they made recommendations on recruiting, on hiring, on the use of deadly force and what we're about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a win-win.\nWe need more win-wins in America and we don't have to pick one over another divide. We love the police, but we've got to be responsible to the people in the community. We have to do all of that. [applause]\nMUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio, I want to ask you next, President Obama visited a mosque this week in America for the first time in his presidency. President George W. Bush visited a mosque after September 11th. You said of President Obama, quote, \"he's always pitting people against each other.\" So I'm curious, how are the two visits different, and would you visit a mosque as president?\nRUBIO: I would. But that's not — the issue — my problem with what he did is he continues to put out this fiction that there's widespread systematic discrimination against Muslim Americans.\nFirst of all, let's recognize this. If you go to a national cemetery in this country, you will see stars of Davids and crosses, but you see crescent moons. There are brave men and women who happen to be Muslim Americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country. And we recognize that and we honor that. But by the same token, we face a very significant threat of home grown violent extremism.\nWe need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity, especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech, but inciting violence and taking acts against us.\nAnd I do believe it is important also to recognize, you want to talk about religious discrimination in America. Well, I don't think Barack Obama is being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience. [applause]\nMUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. Martha?\nRADDATZ: Governor Christie, earlier this week, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a global emergency. The same kind of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus in Latin America are found here in the United States, and the virus has been linked to severe birth defects.\nGovernor Christie, at the peak of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, you ordered an American nurse who landed at Newark Airport be detained and quarantined. As fear spreads now of the Zika virus and with the Rio Olympics just months away, is there a scenario where you would quarantine people traveling back from Brazil to prevent the spread in the United States?\nCHRISTIE: You bet I would. And the fact is that because I took strong action to make sure that anyone who was showing symptoms — remember what happened with that nurse. She was showing symptoms and coming back from a place that had the ebola virus active and she had been treating patients. This was not just some — like, we picked up her just for the heck of it, alright?\nWe did it because she was showing symptoms, and the fact is that's the way we should make these decision. You make these decisions based upon the symptoms, the medicine, and the law. We quarantined her, she turned out to test negative ultimately after 48 hours, and we released her back to the State of Maine.\nBut, I want to add something on the issue of mosques. Now, I'm the only one up here who's had a law enforcement background as a U.S. Attorney after September 11th. I went to mosques throughout my state to build bridges. To build bridges between our community in law enforcement so we can get intelligence and information from these folks.\nI've had the experience of working with them as Governor of New Jersey as well. We cannot mix the radical Islamic jihadist with everyday Muslim-Americans. New Jersey is the second largest Muslim- American population in America, of any state. These are good, law abiding, hard working people. What they need is our cooperation, and our understanding. They do not just need broadsides against them because of the religious faith they practice.\nRADDATZ: Governor Christie, thank you. [applause]\nI'm going to move to Dr. Carson, and go back to the Zika virus, is that going too far, quarantining? You're a doctor, what would you do?\nCARSON: Well, you know, it's not a simple issue, and now, you know, we've gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine. So, this is going to be, obviously, a big deal.\nDo we quarantine people? If we have evidence that they are infected, and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that they're doing, yes. But, just willy-nilly going out and quarantining a bunch of people because they've been to Brazil, I don't believe that that's going to work. What we really need to be thinking about is how do we get this disease under control?\nAnd this is where we need rapid response. We need a rapid response for ebola, we need rapid response for Zika, there will be other things that will come up. These are the kinds of things that the NIH, the CDC, can be very effective in. We need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things.\nRADDATZ: Thanks very much, Dr. Carson.\nI want to move on to the military. Senator Rubio, all restrictions on women in combat as long as they qualify. Positions including special operations forces, like Navy Seals. Just this week military leaders of the Army and Marine Corps said that they believed young women, just as young men are required to do, should sign up for Selective Service in case the Draft is reinstated.\nMany of you have young daughters. Senator Rubio, should young women be required to sign up for Selective Service in case of a national emergency?\nRUBIO: First, let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat. That, in fact, whose lives are in very serious danger, and so I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised. But, I support that, and obviously now that that is the case I do believe that Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in case a Draft is ever instituted.\nI think the more fundamental challenge we're now facing is what's happening to the U.S. military — I've said this many times, and I think it's important to start paying attention to this. Our Air Force is about to be the smallest it's been in 100 years. I'm sorry, in our history. Our Army is set to be smaller than it's been since the second World War, and our Navy is about to be the smallest than it's been in 100 years.\nI think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it, and it costs more, and it's a lot more chaotic and dangerous. When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Governor Bush, do you believe that young women...\nBUSH: ... Say it again?\nRADDATZ: Do you believe young women should sign up for Selective Service, be required to sign up...\nBUSH: ... I do, and I do think that we should not impose any kind of political agenda on the military. There should be — if women can meet the requirements, the minimum requirements for combat service they ought to have the right to do it. For sure. It ought to be focused on the morale as well. We got to make sure that we have readiness much higher than we do today. We need to eliminate the sequester which is devastating our military.\nWe can't be focusing on the political side of this, we need to realize that our military force is how we project our word in the world. When we're weak militarily it doesn't matter what we say. We can talk about red lines, and ISIS being the J.V. team, and reset buttons and all this. If we don't have a strong military than no one fears us, and they take actions that are against our national interest.\nRADDATZ: Tell me what you'd say to American people out there...[applause]...who are sitting at home, who have daughters, who might worry about those answers, and might worry...\nBUSH: ... Why would they worry about it...\nRADDATZ: ... if the Draft is reinstituted?\nBUSH: ... Well, the Draft's not going to be reinstituted, but why — if women are accessing...\nRADDATZ: ... Are you saying you'd do away with it?\nBUSH: No. I didn't say that. You — you asked a question not about the draft, you asked about registering. And if women are going to be...\nRADDATZ: You register for the draft.\nBUSH: If — but...\nRADDATZ: If it's reinstituted.\nBUSH: ... we don't have a draft. I'm not suggesting we have a draft. What I'm suggesting is that we ought to have readiness being the first priority of our military, and secondly, that we make sure that the morale is high. And right now, neither one of those are acceptable because we've been gutting the military budget.\nWe also need to reform our procurement process. We need to make sure there are more men and women in uniform than people — than civilians in our Defense Department. There's a lot of things that we need to reform to bring our defense capabilities into the 21st century and I'm the guy that could do that. That's why I have the support of generals, of admirals, of 12 Medal of Honor recipients and many other people that know that I would be a steady commander-in-chief and rebuild our military. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: Martha?\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much.\nCHRISTIE: Can I — can I be really — can I be really clear on this, because I am the father of two daughters. One of them is here tonight. What my wife and I have taught our daughters right from the beginning, that their sense of self-worth, their sense of value, their sense of what they want to do with their life comes not from the outside, but comes from within. And if a young woman in this country wants to go and fight to defend their country, she should be permitted to do so.\nPart of that also needs to be part of a greater effort in this country, and so there's no reason why one — young women should be discriminated against from registering for the selective service. The fact is, we need to be a party and a people that makes sure that our women in this country understand anything they can dream, anything that they want to aspire to, they can do. That's the way we raised our daughters and that's what we should aspire to as president for all of the women in our country. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Christie.\nCARSON: Can I say something...\nRADDATZ: We just covered — wait one second, Dr. Carson.\nCARSON: Something about the draft. Very quickly.\nRADDATZ: Very quickly.\nCARSON: You know, 14 percent decrease in the number of people applying for voluntary military service, and I think part of it is because of the way that we treat our veterans. You know, we wouldn't be a free country if it wasn't for them, and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide.\nSo, I think what we should do is have an external support system for people once they volunteer and it should follow them throughout their career, should follow them for three years, five years afterwards, a year before they get out, should be working on integrating them back into society, so that they quit on Friday and they start their new job. They should have health empowerment accounts that are subsidized so they can go to any medical facility and be taken care of. They can go to a V.A. if they want to.\nBut if we start taking care of our veterans the right way, we won't have to ever worry about a draft again. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much for bringing up that subject, Dr. Carson, of our veterans.\nAnd for another question about our veterans, we go back to Josh McElveen from WMUR. Josh?\nMCELVEEN: Thank you, Martha. None of you on stage tonight have ever worn a uniform as a member of the armed services. That's the reality of it. But as commander-in-chief, you'll also be charged with the care of 23 million active duty service members and veterans in this country.\nSome have suggested privatizing the V.A. as a way to enhance care and increase the quality of the care and access. Others say that veterans should carry I.D. cards that allow them access to any hospital or health care provider. Governor Bush, what specifically would you do to ensure that those who have sacrificed for us are cared for?\nBUSH: I totally agree that we need to give veterans more choices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance the quality of the service inside the Department of Veterans Affairs. We need career civil service reform. Only three people were fired after waiting lists were dropped where veterans didn't get care and people died. It is outrageous. And Hillary Clinton says that that's acceptable? Because she is captive of the public service uniforms.\nCareer civil service reform would allow the next president to fire people that are — that are showing sheer incompetence. At a town hall meeting today, someone came — told a story of their father who looked like he was 85. He had — he got a bill eight years later from an operation he had, eight years it took. They couldn't resolve the dispute and then he was told that he died. Literally, the Veterans Administration sent a death certificate to this guy and it took nine months to clarify the guy — I met him. He's voting for me. And he is — likely to be alive. [laughter] [applause]\nThis is — this is outrageous. It is completely outrageous. So, giving veterans more choices, creating centers of excellence, focusing on the true problems that exist. Dr. Carson is completely right. We need to start focusing on this earlier, before they become veterans so that there's a customized plan so people don't fall through the cracks. We can do this, but it's going to require someone who has proven leadership skills to make it happen. [applause]\nKASICH: Josh?\nMCELVEEN: Governor Kasich, do you have a favored approach?\nKASICH: Josh, I mean, clearly, when a veteran comes home, they should get health care anywhere they want to go. In our state, which is what we should do in the country, you know, if they drive a truck from Kabul to Kandahar in Afghanistan, we say, you can drive a truck from Columbus to Cleveland, and you don't have to go get a license. We're going to hand you one.\nAnd if you've got expertise in the military, we're going to give you college credit or community college credit for the things that you did for our country. And in addition to that, I'll tell you, one of the biggest things I think has to be done — and I would do it as president — the Pentagon has got to work with the returning soldier, sailor, along with the family, and we — they're the most valuable employees in the country. I call them golden employees.\nEverybody wants to hire a veteran. But there is a disconnect between the job openings and the veteran when the veteran comes back. The veteran is a leader. The veteran is strong. The veteran is drug free. There should be no unemployment among veterans.\nAnd if the Pentagon will work with the veterans' services agencies all across this country, Josh, we can get people jobs and we can get them jobs quickly, get them their health care...[bell rings]...get them their college education. Let's lift them. They're the greatest people defending the United States of America and we need to take care of them, and we will. We will. [applause]\nMCELVEEN: Senator Rubio, go ahead?\nRUBIO: Well, my brother's a veteran. We're very proud of him in our family. He served as a green beret in the 7th Special Forces from 1968 through 1971. And as part of his training, he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth.\nAnd for years, he's had to go to get these dental claims. And every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled, the V.A. asks him, \"well, how do we know you lost your teeth in the Army?\" And he says, \"well, it's the only time I ever jumped out of a plane.\" [laughter] But he's had to fight through this process, and I've watched it firsthand. That's why I'm proud that I worked in a bipartisan way. We passed the V.A. Accountability bill that, for the first time, allows us to fire — allows the V.A. secretary to fire someone who's not doing a good job, who's a senior executive.\nAnd the governor's right. They've only fired three people up to now. More people will be fired if I'm president. But the portability part of it is incredibly important.\nVeterans should be able to take their V.A. benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to. When I am president of the United States, veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose. [applause]\nMCELVEEN: Senator Rubio, thanks very much. Going to move forward now. David, Martha, back to you.\nMUIR: Josh, thank you. I want to turn to a family that New Hampshire voters know quite well, and Senator Cruz, the issue of hostages has been a very real and painful one here in this state.\nAs we all know, James Foley was killed. His mother, Diane, said our government should be willing to negotiate, arguing that families should also be allowed to raise money for ransom. What would you say to Diane Foley tonight? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom for their loved ones?\nCRUZ: Well, look, I recognize it is an agonizing experience when anyone is facing a loved — loved member who's been kidnapped. But at the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a reason it has been longstanding U.S. policy that we don't negotiate with terrorists, we don't pay ransoms.\nIf you look at what President Obama has done over and over again, whether it was the James Bergdahl deal, which was absolutely shameful, releasing five senior Taliban terrorists to bring Bergdahl back, or whether it was this recent deal with Iran, where, again, up to 21 terrorists or potential terrorists were — were released or not prosecuted in order to bring back four Americans, what that does — does is it effectively puts a bounty on American servicemen and women serving abroad, on American tourists traveling abroad.\nAnd the proper approach...[bell rings]...is a president and commander in chief that defends this country and that goes after — goes after the terrorists, rather than showing them weakness and encouraging them to target more Americans.\nMUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, what would you say to Diane Foley? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom?\nTRUMP: Well, I — I know Diane Foley very well. Her husband and — these are tremendous people. I spoke for them, I raised a lot of money for the foundation. I fully understand, James, one of — that was really the first that we saw, really visually saw — it was so horrible.\nAnd I will tell you, though, with all of that being said, you can not negotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many, many more James Foleys.\nJames Foley was a great young man. His parents are incredible people. They've done such a good job, since his — since his death. But you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists, or you're gonna have so many other James Foleys.\nAnd one thing on the vets — during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you something...[applause]...I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball (ph) to sarel (ph) and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.\nThe one thing that we're not mentioning, there's tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if I'm running things, that's going to disappear...[bell rings]...and it's going to disappear quickly. [applause]\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.\nWe want to turn now to social issues and young voters and for the question, from Mary Katherine.\nHAM: Thank you David.\nSenator Rubio. One of the lazier pieces of political conventional wisdom is that so-called social issues are hurting Republicans with young people. But on the two most prominent social issues, polling with millennials actually moves in different directions.\nOn one hand, it is clear, young people across the political spectrum increasingly favor same sex marriage. However young voters have not moved to the left on abortion. In fact, large numbers of them favor at least some modest restrictions that conservatives have supported. How do you speak to millennials on both these issues, while Democrats will inevitable charge intolerance and extremism?\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, I don't believe that believing in traditional marriage the way I do makes you a bigot or a hater. It means that you believe that this institution that's been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society. I respect people that believe differently. But I believe deeply, that marriage should be between one man and one woman. [applause]\nOn the issue of life, to me, the issue of life is not a political issue. It's a human rights issue and it's a difficult issue, because it puts in conflict two competing rights. On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right.\nAnd on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live. And they're in conflict. And as a policy maker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence. And I have chosen to err on the side of life.\nHere's what I find outrageous. There has been five Democratic debates. The media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\nWhy don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believe that partial- birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right. They are the extremists...[bell rings]...when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election. [applause]\nHAM: Governor Bush? I want to come to you. Your allies have recently attacked Senator Rubio for being too pro-life to be elected in November. You made a similar charge stating it in an interview. This is a pro-life party. Do you stand behind that criticism?\nBUSH: Look, I'm pro-life. In fact, on this stage, I'm the most pro-life person because I've acted on it for eight years as governor of the state of Florida. [applause]\nWhere we abolished partial-birth abortion, where parents have the right to be notified when their teenage child is having an abortion. We were the first state to do a choose life license plate to raise money for adoption. We were the first state to have state monies go to crisis pregnancy centers, which recently was just increased to $4 million a year.\nWe created greater regulation on abortion clinics, where there were horrific procedures. So I'm pro life, but I believe there should be exceptions: rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. And so, that belief, and my consistency on this, makes me, I think, poised to be in the right place, the sweet spot for a Republican nominee. And others may have a different view and I respect it. [applause] BUSH: But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact there's a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions. [applause]\nRUBIO: I do support protection for the life of the mother because I'm pro-life. I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. If I'm president and there's a bill that's passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, I'll sign it.\nBut I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws. I've already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank. I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life. [applause]\nHAM: Governor Christie. You too, have talked about Senator Rubio's position on the life issue. Some conservative activists have called this line of attack harmful to the pro-life cause.\nCHRISTIE: Well, I've been pretty helpful to the pro-life cause in one of the most pro-choice states in the union. I've stood up for the first time and now for the last six years we've de-funded Planned Parenthood, not talked about it like they do in Washington D.C.\nBut for six years as governor, Planned Parenthood does not receive that funding from the state budget anymore; over $50 million worth of money that's been saved now, that is not going to do exactly what Hillary Clinton wants to have done and has advocated for.\nShe believes that organization, which engages in the systematic murder of children in the womb, in order to maximize the value of their body parts for sale on the open market, is an acceptable position.\nLet me tell you something, I don't care if you are a millennial or whether you are in your 90s, no one is for that type of activity, unless you are the most radical type of extremist on this issue, like Senator Clinton and her party is on this issue.\nI'll say one other thing. The fact is, that I believe that if a woman has been raped, that is a birth and a pregnancy that she should be able to terminate. If she is the victim of incest — this is not a woman's choice. This is a woman being violated.\nAnd the fact is that we have always has believed, as has Ronald Reagan, that we have self-defense for women who have been raped and impregnated because of it, or the subject of incest and been impregnated for it.\nThat woman should not have to deliver that child if they believe that violation is now an act of self-defense by terminating that pregnancy.\nHAM: Thank you, all. Back to you, David and Martha. [applause]\nMUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you.\nWe're going to have closing statements here in just a moment, but before we go, quick lightning round. Come November, two battle-ground states, but they face off tomorrow in the Super Bowl.\nGovernor Kasich, who wins? [laughter]\nKASICH: Carolina's going to win that one. I hate to say it. But they're going to win that one.\nMUIR: Governor Bush?\nBUSH: Peyton Manning is supporting me. And I'm for Denver. [laughter]\nMUIR: Senator Rubio?\nRUBIO: Well, I was going for Peyton Manning, but now I'm rooting for Carolina. [laughter]\nMUIR: [inaudible] Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Carolina.\nCRUZ: With an eye to February 20th, Carolina.\nMUIR: All right, Dr. Carson?\nCARSON: With 100 percent certainly, I will predict the winner — it will either be Denver or Carolina.\nMUIR: Yeah. Governor Christie, the last word?\nCHRISTIE: Denver.\nMUIR: Denver. Thank you so much, gentlemen.\nClosing statements in just a moment, right here, as the ABC News Republican debate continues from New Hampshire, right after this.\n[commercial break]\nMUIR: We welcome you back. The New Hampshire primary, of course, is Tuesday, but time now for closing statements. And we begin tonight with Governor Kasich.\nKASICH: Well, folks, I've done now over 100 town hall meetings and I've loved every second of it. It has been the greatest thing in the world. And I want you to know that you've changed me, because I've listened to your stories and I've had your hugs and I've seen your tears, and I've seen you walk away and say, I now have hope.\nYou know, I've had a conservative message, but a positive message — not just a conservative message, but a positive message about how we can bring people together, how we can restore America's strength, lift everyone. New Hampshire, please give me a chance to carry this message forward to the United States of America. And then, I will come back. Thank you, loved it. And God bless you. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Governor Christie.\nCHRISTIE: Thank you. I've spent the last 13 years of my life focused on one thing: serving the people who have given me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about partisanship, but putting the people of my state and our country first.\nI'm proud to have rebuild my state after Hurricane Sandy, and I'm incredibly proud to be on this stage tonight with these men asking for your vote.\nNew Hampshire, I spent 70 days here with you. You've gotten to know my heart. My heart is to help you solve the problems of your state...[bell rings]...and the problems of our nation. If you give me your vote on Tuesday I will do just that. [applause]\nMUIR: Governor Bush.\nBUSH: I want to thank the people of New Hampshire, and I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president, Ronald Reagan would have been 105 today. [applause]\nPresident Reagan believed in the future of our country, believed in its greatness, had a hopeful, optimistic message. Drew people towards our cause. We need someone who has a proven record to take our case to the American people because our philosophy is by far the best one. Limited government, entrepreneurial capitalism, of peace through strength. I believe I have the skills to take our party to victory in November.\nI ask for your support on Tuesday to keep America, and make America a safer, stronger, and freer. Thank you all very much. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Dr. Carson.\nCARSON: For many months, the political class, pundits, the media, have tried to ignore or bury me. They say that politics is too complex, and too sleazy. You can't survive. Well, guess what? I'm still here, and I'm not going any place either.\nAnd, I believe there is still a place in our country for faith, integrity, and common sense. Hundreds of thousands of you drafted me to run for president...[bell rings]... And, I am going to with the help of God, and you, once again place the American people at the pinnacle with the government there to serve it. [applause]\nMUIR: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Senator Rubio.\nRUBIO: Thank you. You know, this week I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I hadn't' seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me, but the most important part of it is that it once again reminded me of what's at stake.\nHere in New Hampshire in less than 72 hours, we are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they are my age. What kind of country they will be able to raise their families in. And, that's why I'm asking you for your vote. You vote for me, and we will unite this party, we will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us. The single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.\nThank you. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz.\nCRUZ: You know, every candidate running for president says they will stand up to Washington. The natural follow up question is when have you ever stood up to Washington.\nLast week we saw a powerful illustration of that. I campaigned in the state of Iowa four-square against the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My two leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state said vote for anyone but Cruz, and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in attack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing field, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism and corporate welfare...[bell rings]... We can turn this country around if we get back to the Constitution. And, I will always stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption of Washington. [applause]\nMUIR: Thank you. Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: That's because he got Ben Carson's votes, by the way, but we won't [inaudible]. Our country that we love so much doesn't win anymore. We don't win with the military, we don't' win on the border. You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin. Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we don't win with healthcare. We don't win with trade.\nYou look at what other countries are doing to us. China. Everyone, they're killing us on trade. If I'm elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win. Thank you, thank you very much. [applause]\nMUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks to all the candidates on the stage here tonight. We thank the people of Manchester, New Hampshire for having this debate, and to everyone at home.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening.

U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\nI have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end.\nBeginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\nThese are the facts:\nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.\nHomicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.\nIn the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\nI've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?\nAgain, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.\nThe budget is no better.\nPresident Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.\nThis was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.\nIn Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.\nLet's defeat her in November, OK.\nI am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.\nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.\nAfter four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve.\nThe American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\nThat is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\nI have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\nI am your voice!\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.\n[disruption in the audience]\nHow great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\nWhen innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was \"extremely careless\" and \"negligent,\" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.\nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me.\nI will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.\nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.\nThis Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.\nWhen I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.\nTo make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.\nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and we're going to stop it.\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – believe me.\nAnd as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\nWe must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\nRecently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.\nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.\nOn January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.\nBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.\nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.\nNever, ever again.\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.\nShe supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.\nNo longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.\nThis includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.\nWe are going to start building and making things again.\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\nThis new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!\nThank you. Thank you.\nWe are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.\nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.\nWe will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.\nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.\nWe are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\nThe replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.\nIt's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\nThen there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.\nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\nRemember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\nHistory is watching us now.\nIt's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her\". I choose to recite a different pledge.\nMy pledge reads: \"I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\"\nI am your voice.\nSo to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTo all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nGod bless you, and good night! I love you!\nDonald J. Trump (1st Term), Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/318521\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        What if Biden or Trump suddenly leaves the 2024 race?\nHow each party could replace its front-runner if he drops out unexpectedly.\nWhat would happen if a major-party candidate died or abruptly dropped out of the presidential race before Election Day?\nIn any presidential election year, there could always be a sudden tragedy or scandal that takes a leading candidate or nominee out of the picture. But this question could be especially relevant in 2024, as Americans tell pollsters they're concerned about the advanced age of both the Republican and Democratic front-runners for president: 77-year-old former President Donald Trump and 81-year-old President Joe Biden.\nTrump is also facing legal challenges that could theoretically force him from the race, although he has denied wrongdoing in each case and seems unlikely to bow out of the race voluntarily. (According to ABC News Chief Legal Analyst Dan Abrams, he is almost certainly not going to be disqualified under the 14th Amendment or imprisoned before the election. And even on the slight chance he is in prison, there is nothing that legally prevents him from remaining a candidate.)\nReplacing a party nominee or president-elect would be messy under any circumstances, but exactly how messy depends on when the candidate drops out. At some points in the calendar, there would be a clear path forward; at others, the country would be facing an unprecedented situation — although experts say the parties have contingency plans for most such scenarios.\nHere's what could happen if either party's front-runner dropped out at various points in the next year.\nFrom now to March\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and member of the Democratic National Committee, told 538 in an interview that one of the least complicated times for a front-runner to leave the race would be right now — when no voting has started and delegates are not yet bound to candidates. \"If it's now, there's still somewhat of a chance to have a real race,\" Kamarck said.\nIndeed, if Trump were to drop out or pass away within the next couple months, Republicans have a number of well-funded, formidable alternatives, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who are already on primary ballots across the country and could win the nomination in Trump's stead.\nBut if Biden were to leave the race right now, Democrats would be in more of a bind. Very few prominent Democrats have thrown their hats in the ring against Biden, and those who have, like Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson, have had trouble qualifying for the ballot in certain states. Out of 28 contests with candidate lists as of Jan. 5, Phillips missed out on three while Williamson didn't make it in five, and Biden is the only candidate on the ballot in the delegate-rich states of Florida and North Carolina.\nNot to mention, Phillips and Williamson would probably not be acceptable nominees for Democratic Party leaders because of their low profiles, lack of institutional support and the feathers they ruffled by challenging a sitting Democratic president. So if something happened to Biden, you could see a new Democratic candidate (or 10) try to jump into the race. But candidates who entered the race today would have no way of securing a delegate majority at the ballot box because they, too, would not appear on the ballot in many states. As of Jan. 5, the filing deadline for presidential candidates has now passed in 31 states or territories worth about two-thirds of the party's delegates.\nDespite this, it wouldn't be impossible for a Democratic candidate who enters the race today to garner significant delegate support. The party could go to court to try to change filing deadlines for some primaries, or cooperative state legislatures could reschedule those deadlines — or even entire primaries. And new candidates could try to mount write-in campaigns in key states where filing has already closed, so they could still earn some delegates in those places.\nHowever, some states don't permit write-in candidates (either generally or in primaries) or require them to register ahead of an election to have votes cast for them counted. Moreover, write-in candidates or even current contenders like Phillips and Williamson could struggle to get enough votes to reach the 15 percent of the vote that Democrats require for candidates to pick up delegates at the state or district level. Their ability to hit that 15 percent mark would depend in part on the level of support Biden attracted — he would remain on the ballot in many places — as well as whether a state has an \"uncommitted\" option on the ballot that voters could flock to.\nIn sum, it would be very difficult for any candidate to clinch a delegate majority in this scenario, meaning that the nominee would be decided at the convention.\nFrom March to June\nThe period between March and June, when the majority of high-profile state primary elections have concluded, could be one of the most uncertain times for a front-runner to withdraw from the race.\nIt would be just about mathematically impossible for a Biden or Trump alternative to win the nomination at the ballot box if a withdrawal happened in this period. By mid-March (March 12 for Republicans, March 19 for Democrats), both parties will have allocated a majority of their delegates. As a result, even though there would still be several primaries to go, a new entrant to the race or an existing candidate who hadn't won a significant number of delegates yet* couldn't possibly win a delegate majority, and no one would go to the convention as the presumptive nominee.\nAt this point, all the remaining candidates could do is try to accumulate as many delegates as possible in the remaining states in order to try to win the nomination on the convention floor. To do this, though, they'd probably need support from some of the delegates allocated to Biden or Trump before they dropped out. And the rules governing these delegates vary by party.\nWithout a rule change, many delegates who were assigned to Biden would likely go into the Democratic convention uncommitted, Kamarck told us. (Even though she is on his ticket, they would not automatically shift to Vice President Kamala Harris: The presidential and vice presidential ballots are separate at the Democratic convention.) Unlike Republican delegates, Democratic delegates are \"pledged\" rather than \"bound\" to a candidate, and while party rules say that delegates \"shall in all good conscience\" reflect the views of those who elected them, Kamarck said there is no penalty if a delegate votes differently. This could make it easier for Democrats to adjust to a highly fraught situation in which the incumbent president has unexpectedly left the picture.\nMeanwhile, if Trump departs the GOP race before the convention, the rules of each state Republican Party would determine whether his delegates are still bound to him and for how many ballots. If the state party doesn't have specific unbinding rules, the delegates would still be bound for at least the first round of voting, and potentially more, according to the rules of the Republican Party (though the convention delegates themselves could vote to change the rules).\nThis much is clear, though: In the event that Biden or Trump leaves the race this spring, individual delegates would suddenly have a lot of influence on whom their party nominates. Because of this, there could be a \"mad rush\" of people seeking delegate positions so that they can play kingmaker at the convention, Kamarck said. Generally, in both parties, primary voters decide only the number of delegate slots allocated to each candidate; the actual people who serve as delegates are usually not decided until later. While some are directly elected in primaries, most are selected well after, at congressional district and statewide caucus-conventions or by party committees.\nThose who run to be a delegate indicate who they would support as the nominee. Traditionally, Kamarck said, candidates are \"involved in putting forth slates of candidates for those congressional district delegates, because they want to make sure that people get elected who are loyal to them.\" This would undoubtedly be even more true if those delegates were up for grabs: Anyone running to be a delegate could be courted by swarms of candidates seeking their pledge of support. \"All of a sudden these real people would be important people, right? And everybody would want to know who they are. All the people who wanted to be president would want to talk to them,\" Kamarck said.\nWhom those delegates would likely gravitate to also probably depends on the party. Should Biden have to bow out, Harris — as Biden's running mate and, potentially, the sitting president — would be a natural, even likely, destination for many Democratic delegates. Lara Brown, a political scientist and author of \"Jockeying for the American Presidency: The Political Opportunism of Aspirants,\" told 538 that she does not believe that the Democratic convention would be all that contested in the event Biden passed away. There could be a symbolic first ballot vote for Biden, \"then essentially, [the convention could] create a point of order … and then do a second ballot,\" likely for Harris to be the nominee, Brown said.\nFor Republicans, the second-place finisher in the primaries could have a leg up. Per Kamarck, Trump delegates might be inclined to eventually support whoever performs best in the primaries after Trump's withdrawal.\nFrom June to the conventions\nWhat happens if a presumptive party nominee dies, withdraws or becomes incapacitated after primary voting has ended? Kamarck said the answer is straightforward. \"In June, when the whole thing is over, it's very clear that it's going to the convention.\"\nAs in the first two situations, the Republican National Convention (which takes place July 15-18 in Milwaukee) or Democratic National Convention (which takes place Aug. 19-22 in Chicago) in this scenario would become a once-in-a-lifetime political spectacle. Once the delegates that had been bound to the presumptive nominee are officially uncommitted (which would happen according to the same rules described above), there would be a scramble by newly minted candidates to win their support. \"There'll be some formidable candidates,\" Kamarck predicted. \"They will start calling delegates as quickly as they possibly can.\"\nAny new candidate who wants to run at this point would have to get nominated at the convention itself, the rules for which are different for each party. At the Democratic convention, new candidates need to get at least 300 delegate signatures in order to be nominated. For Republicans, convention rules state that candidates have to submit evidence of support from a plurality of delegates in at least five states at least one hour before names are to be placed in nomination.\nThe model for this kind of contested convention would be nominating contests before 1972, which is generally seen as the start of the modern presidential nomination system. Before then, party insiders dominated the delegate selection process in most states, and primaries (when they were held) chose far fewer delegates. Primaries instead mainly served as an opportunity for candidates to prove to uncommitted party leaders that they could win votes in a general election.\nOne notable contested convention came in 1968, when Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the Democratic nomination without having entered a single primary. That convention, with its chaotic protests, police rioting and internal party divisions over the Vietnam War and other issues, helped precipitate the reforms that led to the modern primary process as we know it today. For Republicans, the 1952 convention battle between General Dwight Eisenhower and the more conservative Ohio Sen. Robert Taft stands out. Eisenhower narrowly led Taft on the first ballot, but he stood just short of a delegate majority when Minnesota delegates began a tide of vote-switching to Eisenhower that clinched the nomination for him.\nIn the most chaotic scenarios, it could even take more than one ballot for a candidate to win a majority of delegates and clinch the presidential nomination. The last time a major party needed more than one ballot to nominate a presidential candidate was in 1952, when Democrats took three ballots to choose Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson as their standard bearer.\nFrom the conventions to when ballots are printed\nThe national conventions are a key turning point in our hypothetical calendar. Before them, primary voters, or delegates selected through the primary process, would still have the ability to choose their party's nominee. After the conventions, though, the Democratic and Republican national committees would inherit that power.\nBoth the DNC and the RNC have enshrined in their rules a process for how to fill a vacancy on the party's ticket after the formal nomination has already taken place. For Democrats, there is only one option: Chairman Jamie Harrison would confer with Democratic leadership in Congress and the Democratic Governors Association and would then take the decision to the DNC, according to the party's call to convention.\nThe 483 members of the DNC — who comprise the chairs and vice chairs of each state Democratic Party committee as well as members elected from all 56 states and territories, plus Democrats Abroad — would vote on a new nominee. There are no rules governing who the nominee has to be; the nomination would not, for instance, just go to the former nominee's running mate or the person who won the second-most delegates in the primaries. They just need to get a majority of party members to vote for them.\nExperts say that could be a political mess, with various factions of the party pressuring members to choose one nominee or another. \"They would have all sorts of internal politicking. There would be competition between various factions within the party,\" Richard Pildes, a professor of constitutional law at New York University Law School, told 538.\nFor their part, Republicans have two options for filling a vacancy, according to the party's rules. Like the Democrats, they could choose to have their committee members vote. There are three RNC members per state and territory, but they get to cast the same number of votes their state or territory's delegation was entitled to cast during the Republican National Convention. If members of a delegation aren't in agreement on who to support, their state or territory's votes would be divided equally among them. In order to become the nominee, a candidate must secure a majority of votes.\nBut the RNC is also \"authorized and empowered to fill any and all vacancies\" by reconvening the national convention.\nIn either case, the results of all of the primaries and caucuses would no longer formally matter. While the primary results would be one source of information for the members (if they vote) or delegates (if they reconvene the convention), they wouldn't be bound to choose the person who came in second in the primaries. They don't even have to choose somebody who ran in the primary.\nBeyond their distinct rules, Pildes did not think there would be much difference between how Democrats and Republicans would deal with a candidate's death. The RNC is much smaller than the DNC, which could have an impact. \"It's always easier to reach decisions in a smaller body than a larger body, and so that might be a significant difference in the way the two parties are governed,\" Pildes said. \"But other than that, I don't think there's a dramatic difference.\"\nFrom when ballots are printed to Election Day\nHowever, if either party nominee dropped out or passed away after ballots were printed, then it would be too late to officially replace them on the ballot. In that scenario, millions of Americans would cast ballots for the inactive candidate with the understanding that their Electoral College votes would really go to someone else — probably someone designated by the DNC or RNC.\n\"The reality is, when you vote for president, you're never voting for that person. You're voting for the elector to cast a ballot for that person at the Electoral College meeting in December,\" Brown said. \"I would imagine what would happen is that parties would indicate to the electors who they should vote for.\"\nFrom Election Day to Dec. 17\nNext, let's say we make it to Election Day without incident and voters choose a new president — but then the president-elect passes away or becomes incapacitated before the Electoral College votes on Dec. 17 to make their win official. This could be a messy political situation as well.\nAccording to the National Archives, there is no prescribed process for what to do if the president-elect dies between Election Day and the meeting of the Electoral College. (It would not automatically be the vice president-elect, as, legally, the presidential line of succession would not have kicked in yet.) So the (ex-)president-elect's electors would essentially get to pick the president. \"A whole bunch of Americans don't realize that the electors are actual, real live people,\" Kamarck said, who could theoretically choose for themselves whom to vote for.\nThere is historical precedent for this: After the 1872 election, which was won by Republican Ulysses S. Grant, Democratic nominee Horace Greeley died on Nov. 29, and his electors' votes went to various other people. According to Pildes, whether this could happen again depends on the state, as some state laws address this possibility while others do not.\nThere have also historically been \"faithless electors\" who have not voted for the candidate who won their state. Some states have laws prohibiting this, but in an emergency situation, state legislatures could change the rules to allow them to do so.\nIt's possible that the party would coalesce around a new candidate (for example, the vice president-elect would be a logical choice) and its electors would vote en masse for that person. Brown said the DNC or RNC would likely signal to electors whom they should vote for. That could be Harris on the Democratic side or Trump's still-unannounced running mate on the Republican side. But Brown emphasized that some states would need to adjust their faithless electors laws to allow for this.\nIf the electors cannot agree on a single alternative and no candidate gets a majority of electoral votes, the election would fall to the House of Representatives — a procedure known as a contingent election. The Constitution stipulates that each state's House delegation would cast a single vote for president, with a majority of states required for a candidate to win, and the Senate would elect a vice president based on a majority vote of its members individually. But Brown said that this is a highly unlikely scenario, as the electors would most likely listen to guidance from their party.\nFrom Dec. 17 to Jan. 20\nIf the president-elect dies or is incapacitated after the Electoral College votes but before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2025, the law is clear: the vice president-elect would be inaugurated instead. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution says, in part, \"If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President.\"\nConclusion\nAll of the ballot, delegate, convention and party machinations outlined above get very \"in the weeds,\" as Kamarck put it. Yet if Biden or Trump were to pass away or abruptly withdraw from the 2024 presidential race — or if a nominee did so in a future election — every last detail would matter deeply. And that's aside from the potentially intense reaction from the American public; people would understandably be uncertain about what comes next.\nAt the same time, no experts who spoke with 538 framed a nominee's sudden death or withdrawal as an alarming possibility or constitutional crisis. Brown said she does not believe a major candidate passing away would greatly destabilize American politics, because of how much is laid out in the Constitution and in the party rules already.\n\"Just because these things have not happened in modern times, because the parties and the candidates have essentially coordinated to ensure more predictable outcomes, doesn't mean that if we went to the contingency plan, that our system is lost,\" Brown said. \"We're just in plan B — and plan B usually isn't optimal. But it is serviceable.\"\nFootnotes\n*This whole exercise is predicated on the assumption that Biden and Trump will win the vast majority of delegates as long as they are in the race. Obviously, if this is not true and a candidate like Haley is, say, roughly tied with Trump in delegates on March 12, they would still be able to win the nomination the traditional way.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        State laws and party rules on replacing a presidential nominee, 2024\nDate: November 5, 2024 |\nDonald Trump (R) (won) Jill Stein (G) Chase Oliver (L) |\n2028 • 2024 • 2020 • 2016 |\nThe Democratic and Republican parties have their own processes for replacing a presidential or vice presidential nominee. Each state also has its own process and deadline for ballot certification and printing. Given these deadlines, parties must also consider the election calendar if they seek to replace a candidate.\nOn July 21, 2024, Joe Biden (D) withdrew from the presidential race.[1] His came after a number of U.S. House members and commentators publicly said President Joe Biden (D) should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race following the first 2024 presidential debate.[2][3] Biden initially responded to the calls for him to withdraw in a letter to House Democrats on July 8, where he said he would continue running.[4] Click here to read answers to frequently asked questions surrounding Biden's presidential campaign.\nThree main phases of a presidential election determine which party rules, state laws, and federal laws come into play when attempting to replace a presidential candidate. The first phase takes place before a party's national nominating convention. In 2024, the Democratic National Convention took place from August 19-22, and the Republican National Convention took place from July 15-18. While neither party's nominee is official until delegates elect a candidate at the national convention, there are party rules and state laws that come into play if a party seeks to replace its presumptive nominee.\nThe second phase takes place between the parties' national nominating conventions and the general election, which took place on November 5, 2024. It is rare for a candidate to drop out of the race between his or her formal nomination at a national convention and the general election. The last time a party replaced a candidate was 1972, when Democratic vice presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton withdrew after details about his mental health treatment were publicized.[5]\nThe third phase takes place between the general election and the presidential inauguration, which took place on January 20, 2025. A president-elect has never withdrawn, died, or become incapacitated during this stage of an election. In 1872, Horace Greeley, who lost to Ulysses S. Grant in the general election, died between the election and the counting of electoral votes. Electors initially allocated to Greeley voted for a variety of candidates, including Greeley.[6]\nThis page provides an overview of:\n- Replacing a presumptive nominee before the Democratic National Convention (August 19-22, 2024) or the Republican National Convention (July 15-18, 2024)\n- Replacing a nominee between the Democratic (August 19-22, 2024) or Republican (July 15-18, 2024) national convention and the election (November 5, 2024)\n- Replacing a president-elect between the election (November 5, 2024) and inauguration (January 20, 2025)\nReplacing a presumptive nominee before the national convention\n- See also: Democratic delegate rules, 2024, Republican delegate rules, 2024, and What happens if Joe Biden drops out or is replaced as the 2024 Democratic Party presidential nominee\nThe Democratic and Republican parties do not formally nominate candidates until delegates vote at the party's national convention. The Democratic National Convention took place from August 19-22, 2024, and the Republican National Convention took place from July 15-18, 2024.\nA party's presumptive nominee, meaning the candidate who receives an estimated majority of delegates after state nominating events, could be replaced at the convention. Delegates could elect a candidate who they were not initially bound to at the time of their state's election. Both state law and party rules govern how a delegate must vote at the national convention, including whether a delegate remains bound to a withdrawn candidate and for how many rounds a delegate remains bound to a candidate.[7]\nBoth parties also have delegates who are not bound to a particular candidate at the convention. The Republican Party has a total of 104 unbound delegates, and the Democratic Party has a total of 739 unbound delegates. Democratic unbound delegates can only vote if a convention proceeds past the first round of voting.\nReplacing a nominee between the national convention and the election\nBoth the Democratic and Republican parties have rules governing how to replace a presidential or vice presidential nominee between the party's nominating convention and the November 5, 2024, general election. The section below provides each party's rules on that subject.\nIt is important to note, however, that states require political parties to submit names of presidential and vice presidential nominees and presidential electors before election day in order to certify them for the general election ballot. Deadlines vary by state and depend on the election calendar, including early voting, voting by mail, and absentee voting considerations.\nDemocratic Party rules governing vacancies\n- See also: Democratic presidential nomination, 2024\nUnder Article 2 of The Bylaws of the Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has the responsibility to fill vacancies in presidential and vice presidential nominations between national conventions.[8]\nIn the event of a vacancy on the national ticket, the chairperson would call a special meeting. Under Article 2 § 8(d), questions before the DNC, with some exceptions otherwise outlined in the charter and bylaws, are determined by a majority vote of the DNC members who are present and voting by proxy. The bylaws also state that voting to fill a vacancy on the national ticket must proceed in accordance with procedural rules adopted by the Rules and Bylaws Committee and approved by the DNC.[8]\nRepublican Party rules governing vacancies\n- See also: Republican presidential nomination, 2024\nRule 9 of The Rules of the Republican Party provides guidance on how to fill presidential and vice presidential vacancies.[9]\nIt says that the Republican National Committee (RNC) is authorized to select a new candidate by majority vote or by reconvening the national convention to fill the vacancy. In the former process, the three RNC members from each state—comprised of a state chair, a national committeeman, and a national committeewoman—would be able to cast the same number of votes as the entire delegation from that state to the convention.[9] Under Rule 9(c), if the three RNC members did not all support the same candidate, their votes would be proportionately distributed.[9] For example, each RNC member would cast 13 of Kansas' 39 delegate votes.\nBallot access and vacancies for presidential candidates\nStates require political parties to submit names of presidential and vice presidential nominees and presidential electors in order to certify them for the general election ballot. Deadlines vary by state and are dependent on the election calendar, including early voting, voting by mail, and absentee voting considerations.\nNearly half of the states have a deadline in August, and most require certification or identification of a candidate to fill a vacancy no later than September 6. Replacing a candidate's name on the ballot in September, therefore, becomes increasingly difficult as many states will have already printed ballots or begun to allow voters to cast ballots.\nIt is possible for parties and election authorities to change or work around these deadlines. For instance, in 2020, the Republican National Convention took place after the deadlines in Alabama and Ohio. In Ohio, the state legislature passed a law to change the deadline that cycle so it took place after the Republican National Convention, and in Alabama, the state's election authority accepted a placeholder letter from the RNC that said the party would certify a nominee once the official nomination took place.[10]\nThe following chart provides deadlines related to certifying presidential nominees or submitting a replacement presidential candidate, where available. These deadlines and notes were compiled by reviewing relevant state statutes and other government documents. All such information is subject to interpretation.\nReplacing a president-elect between the election and inauguration\nThere is no established process to replace a nominee between a presidential election and the meeting of the Electoral College. A party could ask presidential electors to vote for an alternate candidate at the December 17, 2024, meeting of electors. However, as of October 2022, 33 states had laws requiring electors to vote for the candidate he or she was pledged to according to general election results. USA Today's Rachel Looker wrote, \"In some states, laws require electors to vote for the winning candidate. If the declared winner drops out before the electoral college meets, these legislatures may have to change the rules so the electors' votes bound to the winner would still count for another candidate.\"[11]\nThe Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution governs what happens if the president-elect dies before taking office. In that case, the vice president-elect becomes the president-elect. It is an open legal question whether a candidate becomes the president-elect after winning a majority of the vote in the Electoral College or only after Congress counts the vote.[7] The Electoral College is scheduled to vote on December 17, 2024, and Congress is scheduled to count the vote on January 6, 2025.[12]\nIf the president-elect does not die but becomes incapacitated, he could voluntarily transfer authority to the vice-president after Inauguration Day. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment lays out this process. If a president submits a written statement that he or she “is unable to discharge the powers and duties” of the office, then the vice president becomes acting president. The president can regain the powers and duties of the presidency by submitting a written statement that he or she is capable of serving again.[13]\nThe Twenty-Fifth Amendment also addresses the possibility that the president becomes incapacitated but is unable or unwilling to leave office. In that situation, if the vice president and a majority of the cabinet declare the president unfit to serve, the vice president becomes acting president. The amendment also outlines how the president can reassume the powers of the presidency. If the president declares that he or she is capable of serving, the cabinet and vice president must respond within four days. If this latter group holds that the president is still unfit to serve, Congress must vote on whether to reinstate the president. The president will be reinstated unless a two-thirds majority of both chambers votes against this.[13]\nNoteworthy events\nBiden withdraws from presidential race (2024)\nOn July 21, 2024, President Joe Biden (D) announced on social media platform X that he was ending his campaign for re-election.[14] In a statement, Biden said:\n| “ |\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.[15] |\n” |\nIn a separate post on X, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris (D) to replace him at the top of the ticket: \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats—it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"[16]\nDemocratic National Committee changes presidential certification date in response to Ohio filing deadline\nOn May 28, 2024, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) said it planned to hold a virtual delegate roll call to certify its presidential and vice presidential nominees ahead of the in-person Democratic National Convention, which took place from August 19-22, 2024, in Chicago, Illinois, and ahead of Ohio's presidential ballot certification deadline on August 7. On July 24, 2024, the DNC Rules Committee voted to hold a virtual roll call vote between August 1 and August 7.[17][18] On July 31, the DNC said the vote would take place from August 1 to August 5.[19]\nOn June 2, 2024, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed a bill into law moving the state's filing deadline to September 1, 2024.[20] On June 4, the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee passed a rule allowing the Democratic convention committee to schedule a virtual roll call vote ahead of the convention. The committee said it was doing so due to uncertainty around whether the bill passed in Ohio would take effect in time.[21][22] The Ohio Secretary of State issued an advisory on June 3 saying the bill would take effect ahead of the new September 1 deadline.[23]\nIn April 2024, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose's (R) office sent a letter to the Ohio Democratic Party saying that since the Ohio filing deadline took place before the convention, \"the Democratic National Committee must either move up its nominating convention or the Ohio General Assembly must act by May 9, 2024 (90 days prior to a new law's effective date) to create an exception to this statutory requirement.\"[24][25]\nThe 2024 Democratic National Convention date also came into conflict with ballot access deadlines in Alabama and Washington. The Alabama State Legislature passed a law changing the deadline, and Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs (D) said he would provisionally approve the Democratic nominee's ballot access ahead of the convention.[25]\nSee also\nUse the dropdown menu below to navigate Ballotpedia's historical coverage of state laws and party rules on replacing a presidential nominee.\n- Important dates\n- Timeline of campaign announcements\n- Deadline to run for president\n- Filing deadlines for independent presidential candidates\n- State laws and party rules on replacing a presidential nominee\n- What happens if Joe Biden drops out or is replaced as the 2024 Democratic Party presidential nominee\n- Changes to the 2024 Democratic presidential primary calendar\n- Platform\n- Conventions\n- Types of delegates\n- Presidential preference primary\n- State laws and party rules on replacing a presidential nominee\n- Democratic Party officials on Joe Biden's 2024 presidential election campaign\n- What happens if Joe Biden drops out or is replaced as the 2024 Democratic Party presidential nominee\nFootnotes\n- ↑ X, \"Joe Biden on July 21, 2024,\" accessed July 21, 2024\n- ↑ Texas Tribune, \"Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett calls on Biden to withdraw from presidential race,\" July 2, 2024\n- ↑ X, \"Matthew Choi on July 2, 2024,\" accessed July 2, 2024\n- ↑ Associated Press, \"Read the letter President Biden sent to House Democrats telling them to support him in the election,\"July 8, 2024\n- ↑ NPR, \"The Thomas Eagleton Affair Haunts Candidates Today,\" August 4, 2012\n- ↑ National Archives, \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" accessed March 6, 2024\n- ↑ 7.0 7.1 Politifact, \"What happens if Joe Biden or Donald Trump leaves his party’s ticket?\" February 20, 2024\n- ↑ 8.0 8.1 Democratic National Committee, \"The Charter & The Bylaws of the Democratic Party of the United States,\" March 12, 2022\n- ↑ 9.0 9.1 9.2 Republican Party, \"Rules of the Republican Party,\" April 14, 2022\n- ↑ Semafor, \"Could two red states keep Joe Biden off the ballot?\" April 10, 2024\n- ↑ USA Today, \"What happens if Biden, Trump drop 2024 presidential bids?

But that’s a problem in the general fund, which pays for teachers and programs. Bond money can only be used on buildings and materials.\nMeanwhile, community groups have critiqued the district’s handling of money from its 2020 bond, partly regarding delays on projects that serve Black students. Others have voiced concerns that the district hasn’t been clear enough about how it will use money in the 2025 bond.\nPPS school board members have addressed some of these concerns as they’ve come up. This past Tuesday night, after concerns were raised, the board passed a resolution committing to prioritize seismic upgrades in the district’s capital improvement strategy if the 2025 bond passes.\nAnd while the Portland community often supports school bonds, there’s been a dip in public and political support for the bond in recent weeks. Willamette Week released a “no” vote endorsement at the end of April, saying the bond process has “lacked the transparency and community engagement necessary for success.” The Oregonian gave a reluctant “yes” endorsement on the bond, comparing the feeling to being backed into a corner. On May 11, after this OPB story initially published, The Oregonian published a new editorial with a “strong” endorsement of the PPS measure.\nAs voters prepare to mark their ballots in the coming days, here’s an overview of what to know about the bond, the context around it, and why some are not as enthused this time around.\nHow much would the bond cost? And who would pay for it?\nIf Portland’s 2025 bond measure passes, and because the tax rate on the district’s existing bonds is scheduled to decline, the tax rate wouldn’t increase. Property owners within district boundaries would continue to pay approximately $2.50 per $1,000 of assessed value.\nThe total principal amount of bonds authorized by this measure can’t go above $1.83 billion.\nIf the proposed measure does not pass, these projects would not be completed as proposed, officials explained, and the property tax rate would gradually decrease.\nWhat would that money pay for?\nDistrict officials have grouped the bond projects into four categories: rebuilds and modernizations; educational materials, technology, physical education and extracurricular activities; updates and repairs to aging elementary and middle schools; and administration and contingency funds.\nThe first — rebuilds and modernizations — is the biggest chunk, totaling $974 million, according to the district’s bond website. That money would go toward renovating or replacing Cleveland and Ida B. Wells high schools and completing the planned reconstruction of Jefferson High School.\nDistrict officials have stressed that these numbers could change. Schedule delays and tariff fluctuations are among many factors that could influence final costs.\nAdditionally, district officials said teams are “actively reviewing project details to identify further cost-saving opportunities.” Leaders have said they intentionally avoided being too specific throughout the process to allow for some flexibility. However, this has led to criticism that the district hasn’t been clear or specific enough for voters.\nFor the second bucket — materials, technology, physical ed and extracurriculars — the district is budgeting $321 million. The bulk of that, $176 million, is for technology. Curriculum would be allotted $56 million, according to the district website, and athletics would get $79 million. The remaining $10 million is set aside for physical education.\nThe district said it would use money from this funding bucket to provide comprehensive, culturally relevant and up-to-date textbooks and curriculum materials; replace or provide student tablets and laptops; and update classroom and district technology.\nOfficials say they intend to upgrade athletic facilities, including at Roosevelt, Franklin and Grant high schools and West Sylvan Middle School. Plans to improve extracurricular facilities include updates to high school performance and theater spaces.\nThe third group priority — updates for aging buildings — would get an estimated $366 million. This includes a $100 million unplanned projects reserve fund, as well as money for seismic improvements and retrofits. Officials said any additional high school project savings would go toward elementary and middle school projects.\nHow does the bond address schools at risk of collapse in an earthquake?\nListed among the safety and security projects is the district’s plan to strengthen buildings to withstand earthquakes. Most PPS buildings were built more than 75 years ago, before Oregon’s earthquake risks were widely known. The issue of school seismic risks is near and dear to many families’ hearts as they send their children to class in these buildings every day.\nA group of concerned Portland parents created the group “Safe Structures PPS” to raise awareness around the issue, calling the unreinforced masonry buildings “ticking time bombs.” The group collected just over 400 signatures on a petition calling for the school board to prioritize seismic upgrades if the bond passes.\nAt the May 6 meeting, the board unanimously approved a resolution outlining the steps the district has taken in recent years and the steps they promise to take if the bond measure passes this month. Safe Structures PPS has since endorsed the bond.\nWhy aren’t some people happy about the bond?\nTo start, the school board had lengthy discussions this winter and spring about paring down the high school’s designs to contain costs. Many affected families voiced concerns that the schools being renovated last will lack some of the strongest features of the schools that have already been updated.\nThe goal to trim down the high school designs didn’t go as planned. Cost estimates remain high — in some cases, much higher than originally anticipated — dimming hopes that more of the repair money could go to elementary and middle schools in need.\nDistrict officials insist they are still seeking cost-saving options but that they won’t be able to provide specifics until after the election, as reported by The Oregonian.\nMeanwhile, several of the high school rebuilds — such as Grant — have been criticized for being undersized and immediately overcrowded. Yet, PPS faces enrollment declines almost twice the statewide rate.\nSuperintendent Kimberlee Armstrong said in a recent OPB’s “Think Out Loud” interview that school closures aren’t out of the realm of possibility for PPS in the near future. These combined factors raise questions about what size the school buildings should be and how uneven enrollment numbers across the city will be balanced.\nSome people are upset that the 2020 projects aren’t done. What accountability measures are in place for the new bond?\nIn addition to the critiques posed earlier this month on Portland’s Center for Black Student Excellence, there are concerns about the delays in school updates, too.\nFor example, the district has been slow to modernize Jefferson High School. Project managers were forced to regroup after the district couldn’t convince the Jefferson High community to relocate students several miles away to the Marshall campus during construction. Last month, the district terminated its contract with the construction firm it had tapped to lead the Jefferson modernization, as reported by the Oregonian.\nAccording to the 2025 bond website, the district’s Bond Accountability Committee — an independent group of appointed community members — would review quarterly reports and audits of how the bond dollars are spent to provide accountability to the public until construction is complete.\nHow would the new bond address deferred maintenance concerns across the district?\nThe district plans to use remaining funds from the aging schools bucket to update or replace several things, including leaking or deteriorating school roofs, heating and cooling infrastructure, electrical and plumbing systems, fire alarms and sprinklers.\nPPS Chief Operating Officer Dan Jung said PPS is currently facing a significant backlog of deferred maintenance needs. As a result, all projects are prioritized based on their urgency and potential impact.\nWill tariffs play a role?\nLikely, yes. Jung told OPB earlier this year that increased construction costs will impact PPS construction projects.\nThat’s something that district officials have to consider every time there’s a delay in construction. The rise in the cost of goods during the time it takes to plan, design, get permits and start construction can change a district’s ability to finish any project.\nAs previously reported by OPB, economists and companies warn that Oregon consumers have yet to feel the full effect of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, but that prices are likely to spike this summer. Construction materials are on the list of impacted products.\nSpeaking of buildings, what’s happening with the PPS headquarters?\nThe PPS headquarters relocation and its 2025 bond measure are separate initiatives and do not have any direct correlation, Jung told OPB.\nThat said, the PPS headquarters is a large, aging building that the district owns and has to maintain. It’s also a prime piece of real estate that could be critical to growth in the Albina neighborhood.\nLast year, Albina Vision Trust, a nonprofit focused on improving the historically Black neighborhood in North Portland, secured its plans to buy the district building, with the agreement that PPS headquarters would move downtown.\nSince then, the school board passed an operating agreement with AVT, which Jung in January described as a significant milestone in the headquarters relocation project.\nLast week, the school board approved the property criteria, which will guide the next phase — the search and evaluation of potential sites. Officials expect this to happen this summer.\nAre there other bond measures on the May ballot?\nPortland’s bond isn’t the only education debate Oregon voters will weigh in on this month. Several districts — including Portland, Beaverton, Hillsboro and Salem-Keizer — are in the thick of local school board races, and others will vote on bonds of their own.\nThe Tigard-Tualatin School District has a $421.3 million bond proposal on the ballot, following their last bond measure back in 2016. Key projects in the new proposal include replacing 50-year-old Fowler Middle School and making significant renovations at four of the district’s oldest elementaries: Bridgeport, Byrom, Durham and Mary Woodward.\nIf passed, the bond is estimated to cost property owners an additional 99 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, for about 20 years. The median homeowner would pay about $25 more per month in property taxes, according to district estimates.\nThe suburban Tigard-Tualatin school district has a recent history of success at the ballot. Its levy renewal to “retain TTSD teachers and preserve classroom programs” passed easily this past November. But just as bond money can’t be used for teachers, the levy money can’t be used for capital construction projects. (A simple phrase often repeated in education circles to remember this: “Bonds are for buildings. Levies are for learning.”)\nCost-conscious voters in Tigard-Tualatin might want to know there is money on the table if their bond passes: the state of Oregon has committed to awarding Tigard-Tualatin a grant of $8.28 million to fund additional projects, but only if the bond passes this month.\n“We think it’s important that voters know that this measure, if passed, would only be used to pay for local projects,” Superintendent Iton Udosenata said in a recent statement.\n“It’s also worth noting that although these are primarily learning spaces,” he said, “our schools are community assets that thousands of people enjoy every month for meetings, sporting events, plays, concerts and green spaces.”\nGladstone School District is the other district in the greater Portland area pursuing a bond this election. According to district officials, it’s the only one that is proposing a lowered tax rate if the bond passes.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story mistakenly referenced a bond measure in the Oregon City School District. OCSD doesn’t have a bond on the 2025 ballot. OPB regrets the error.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In next month’s election, Portland Public Schools officials will ask voters to spend up to $1.15 billion to rebuild three high schools amid declining enrollment.\nBut in an interview with WW’s editorial board last week, PPS Superintendent Dr. Kimberlee Armstrong offered a surprising contingency plan if enrollment doesn’t rebound: Those high schools could also be used as elementary and middle schools.\nThat disclosure comes as the district’s operating costs outstrip its enrollment figures, a key factor in a $40 million budget crunch this year. (Oregon funds its school districts per pupil, so enrollment is key to PPS’s budget.) Modernizing Cleveland, Jefferson and Ida B. Wells high schools, as the district proposes to do with its upcoming construction bond, would add to those operating costs in future budgets. School Board members have argued that new buildings will attract more students to attend public high schools.\nBut what if new construction doesn’t reverse enrollment trends? WW put that question to Superintendent Armstrong in an endorsement interview for Measure 26-259. We asked her to respond to a “doomsday scenario” in which enrollment continues to shrink and buildings are operating at half capacity.\nShe replied that in such a scenario, the district could use the buildings to serve students in kindergarten through 12th grade. “I will tell you, there is no situation where a newly modernized, community-invested high school will go empty or even be half full,” she said. “We would be actively working to make sure that we can house our students.”\nWatch her full response here.\nLook for WW’s endorsements April 30.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Many Portland Public Schools students will return to class Thursday at a temporary school or one under construction as three buildings are overhauled with about $236 million in bond funds.\nRoosevelt High, Franklin High and Faubion K-8 School are being revamped as part of the district's 2012 bond program. Work is well underway at Roosevelt and Franklin high schools, where about 60 percent of the schools will be modernized and 40 percent will be newly constructed, said Jim Owens, school modernization lead. Faubion School will be demolished this fall and rebuilt.\nFaubion School and Franklin High students will spend the next two years at transitional sites, whereas Roosevelt High staff and students will work around construction crews. Owens said projects are on track and new schools should be ready for students by fall of 2017. Owens' last day with the district was Friday and the district is looking for his replacement.\nFranklin High Modernization:\nThe Franklin High upgrade is the district's largest project with a budget of about $106 million, Owens said. The new school will feature a fine and performing arts center, media center, spaces for career programs and more. The school's track and field is also being realigned to accommodate a new sports medicine and athletic facility.\nCrews demolished parts of campus, such as old auto shops and the gym. Construction crews are working around the roughly 20-foot-tall wood and concrete statue of Benjamin Franklin that sits in front of the historic school, Owens said.\nFranklin High students will spend the next two years at the district's Marshall Campus. High school programs at the campus closed in 2011. The district has used parts of the building for staff trainings and other functions, Owens said.\nThe district spent $4 million getting the school ready, repairing sections of the roof, putting in wireless networks, cleaning up the grounds and other prep work.\nPrincipal Juanita Valder wants Marshall to feel like home for Franklin High students. Entryway signs have been replaced and the athletic press box repainted school colors. Elements from Franklin High's interior were also brought over, such as an iron fixture in the shape of a key and a Home of the Quakers banner on the wall.\n\"There's a wealth of tradition that people are steeped in that we want to honor,\" Valder said. \"Our mission and vision hasn't changed.\"\nRoosevelt High Modernization:\nStudents and staff at Roosevelt High will work around around construction for the next two years. The modernized Roosevelt High will feature a new gym, classrooms for engineering and industrial arts, a publishing center and other features. The project budget is about $97 million.\nCrews have demolished the gym, music building and boiler plant, and completed other work.\nThe focus will be on minimizing disruption to classes once students return, Owens said. The main building is separated from much of the work, and contractors will save the noisiest tasks for outside school hours.\nThe district bought in a tent structure for PE classes but volleyball and football teams won't have a true home game this school year, Principal Filip Hristic said. Math classes will be held in portable facilities and music and theater classes have been moved into the cafeteria.\nHristic has encouraged teachers to incorporate the remodel into classroom lessons: A new construction management course will visit work sites and classes can study the history of the old school and community.\nThe goal is to be \"thriving and not just surviving,\" Hristic said.\n\"Amidst all the noise, literally and metaphorically, we're really trying to say focused on what's the reason that we're all here,\" he said.\nFaubion School Rebuild:\nFaubion School will be rebuilt as a PreK-8 program in partnership with Concordia University. The integrated project will have Concordia University classes spread throughout the school, allowing student teachers greater access to classrooms.\n\"Our little children have a chance to see college in action,\" said Faubion School Principal LaShawn Lee. \"We're just so elated.\"\nThe three-story school will also include space for wrap-around services such as a family resource room and early childhood center. The total project budget is $49 million with Concordia University contributing about $16 million, Owens said.\nDemolition could start in late October with new construction beginning in winter, Owens said.\nStudents will spend the next two years at Tubman School, which closed as a young women's leadership academy in June 2012. Most of the building had since housed several special programs that have now been relocated, Owens said.\nUpgrades to Tubman School, including a new fire alarm system and other electrical improvements, cost $2.3 million.\nLee said Tubman School will offer more space and additional features, such as an art room and music room. A Faubion School banner has been hung up in the halls to help parents and students feel welcome.\nLee is also coordinating bus protocols to help students learn new routes. Tubman School is located at 2231 N. Flint Street, about four miles southwest of Faubion. Information about new routes has been sent home to families.\nThe school is hosting an open house at Tubman School on Aug. 26 so students can meet teachers, take a tour and pick up school supplies, Lee said.\n--Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The U.S. Congress is the part of the federal government that makes laws. Congress has two parts: the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives (House). Each of the 50 states is represented by 2 senators, with 100 senators in total. The House has 435 members. The number of representatives in the House for each state depends on how many people live in that state. Each member in the House represents an area of the state called a congressional district. California currently has 52 congressional districts. Voters who live in each congressional district elect one member of the House every two years to represent them. The next election for all 435 representatives will be in 2026.\nU.S. Census Counts States’ Populations Every Ten Years. The number of people living in an area goes up and down over time. Every ten years, the U.S. Census counts the number of people who live in the U.S. The last census was in 2020, and the next census is in 2030. This count is used to determine how many people live in each state and how many representatives in the House each state gets for the next ten years.\nCongressional Redistricting\nEach State Draws Congressional District Maps Following the U.S. Census. Every ten years, after the U.S. Census is completed, states draw new congressional district maps to reflect their number of House representatives and where people live. This process is called “redistricting.” Each state decides what process to use to draw its new district maps. When drawing new maps, each state must follow federal laws. For example, each congressional district in the state must represent about the same number of people.\nStates Typically Do Not Redistrict Sooner Than Every Ten Years. States typically only draw congressional district maps every ten years, unless a court orders changes to comply with the law. In August 2025, however, the Texas Legislature passed a bill to adopt new maps for the 2026 elections without a court order. Several other states also are considering changes to their maps before the 2026 elections.\nCongressional Redistricting in California. State legislatures draw congressional district maps in most states, but some states use commissions to do this job. Before 2010, the California Legislature drew the state’s congressional district maps. In 2010, California voters gave this job to an independent commission known as the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission). The Commission includes 14 members: 5 Democratic members, 5 Republican members, and 4 members who are not registered with either of those political parties. When the Commission draws new congressional district maps, it must follow federal and state laws. For example, state law requires, among other things, the Commission to avoid splitting up neighborhoods or local communities of interest to the extent possible. State law also prohibits the Commission from considering political parties, current office holders, or people running for office when it draws the maps.\nCurrent California Congressional Districts. The Commission drew the current maps for California’s 52 congressional districts. These maps were based on the 2020 U.S. Census and have been used since the 2022 congressional elections.\nCalifornia’s Congressional District Maps\nUse Legislatively Drawn Congressional District Maps Until After the Next Census. Proposition 50 replaces California’s current congressional district maps with new, legislatively drawn maps. (The total number of districts would not change.) Proposition 50’s maps must follow federal law, but they are not required to follow the state requirements placed on the Commission. The state would use Proposition 50’s maps for congressional elections starting in 2026. The state would use these maps until the Commission draws new district maps, following the 2030 U.S. Census.\nNational Congressional Redistricting\nCall for Change in Federal Law. Proposition 50 asks the U.S. Congress to change federal law and propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to require redistricting be done by “fair, independent, and nonpartisan redistricting commissions nationwide.” Proposition 50 expresses voter support for this idea, but does not change federal law or require any particular action of Congress or the California Legislature.\nMinor One-Time Costs to County and State Elections Officials. Counties run elections, and the state oversees them. Because most congressional districts in California would change at least some under the new maps, county and state elections officials would need to update election materials. This would result in one-time costs to counties of up to a few million dollars statewide and one-time costs to the state of roughly $200,000. The state amount is much less than one-tenth of 1 percent (0.1 percent) of the state’s roughly $220 billion General Fund budget. (The General Fund is the account the state uses to pay for most public services, including education, health care, and prisons.)\nThis section shows maps of the current and proposed congressional districts (1) statewide, as shown in Figures 1 and 2; (2) in the northern part of the state, as shown in Figures 3 and 4; and (3) in the southern part of the state, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. A description of the census blocks represented by each district in the proposed maps can be found at the following website: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB604\nNotice of Correction. Figure 2 in the analysis of Proposition 50 contained a typographical error. District 27, which is to the right of District 26, was incorrectly labeled as District 22. This typographical error has been corrected.\nA YES vote on this measure means: The state would use new, legislatively drawn congressional district maps starting in 2026. California’s new maps would be used until the California Citizens Redistricting Commission draws new maps following the 2030 U.S. Census.\nA NO vote on this measure means: Current congressional district maps drawn by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) would continue to be used in California until the Commission draws new maps following the 2030 U.S. Census.\nFiscal Impact: One-time costs to counties of up to a few million dollars statewide to update election materials to reflect new congressional district maps.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Noticing that the post was a few years old and that we appear to still live in Providence, he wanted to know my “updated thoughts about the area.” So here they are for you, reader, and for those of you curious about making a move to the Ocean State.\nWhen I wrote A Year in Providence, I commented that it was the longest we had lived anywhere within the prior six years. In just one more year, it will become the place that I have lived the longest in my life. As scary as that sounds (even to me), I can honestly say that I feel at home here in this small city in the smallest state. That said, no place is perfect. So if you’re considering moving to Providence like I was a few years ago, I will provide you with my own now more-seasoned pro and con list.\nSchools\nCons: The public schools still largely fail to impress in Providence, which is why many people moving to RI who hope to use public schools opt for nearby towns like Barrington or East Greenwich. Sadly, people don’t move to Providence for the schools; they move here despite the schools.\nPros: That said, I do have friends with children at Paul Cuffee Charter School and Vartan Gregorian Elementary who seem extremely happy. Also Nathan Bishop Middle School went through a stellar 35-million-dollar renovation, and no one doubts the reputation of Classical High School.\nPerhaps because of the apparent lack of quality public schools, Providence boasts some amazing private schools (Wheeler, Gordon, Moses Brown, Lincoln). Unlike some cities where money isn’t even enough (good timing and connections are also essential), in Providence’s private schools, there are often spaces available for newcomers. Keep in mind too that all of the private schools do offer financial aid — and you might be surprised to qualify for it since they check not just your income but your expenses.\nIf paying over twenty grand per year for your child’s education is a deal-breaker, there are plenty of terrific lesser expensive local options–we have friends happy with the parochial Bay View Academy, Ocean State Montessori, and the Jewish Community Day School. I’ve also been impressed on recent visits to the French-American School of RI which packs in a lot of learning, language and cultural immersion for less than half of a typical private school tuition. Another option for K-5 is the Henry Barnard School, a laboratory school at Rhode Island College which offers private school education for one-third of the standard cost. However, this is one of the only schools here where I’ve seen an actual waitlist.\nAs a side note, I’ve found no shortage of great daycare and preschool options in Providence.\nCity Life\nPeople who have lived in Manhattan know two things: you live in inches, and you live within a five block radius of your apartment. You live in inches because every square inch of your apartment is precious (which is why we’re storing one of my NYC friend’s grandfather’s photo projector in our Providence basement). And you live within a five block radius, because, for most everything, there’s no need to leave. Within that, you’ll find your post office, banks, bookstores, cafes, restaurants, yoga studios, gyms, playgrounds, etc. When we lived in Manhattan, Geoff and I would count the number of restaurants we could access by crossing only one street, which would quickly hit double digits. Because of this, Manhattan has a much more neighborhood feel than you might expect–the postal workers on Hudson Street still greeted me by name even years after I had moved out.\nCons: Like Boston, in Providence most people who can afford it have a car. Although we can access several restaurants, a playground, two bookstores, several cafes, a post office, and an independent movie theater all within a few blocks of our house, we still drive most days. Even our pediatrician’s office is only a few blocks away (and yet in the winter, I find myself driving there).\nPros: Although we don’t generally live in a five-block radius, I do think Providence in this area gains an advantage over surrounding suburbs and nearby cities like Boston: Providence maintains a friendly, small-town atmosphere with a diverse population and urban culture. Where else other than Providence will you regularly run into your Governor at your local coffee shop?\nPlus, if we made it a priority to walk more, we could. On the upside, we have succeeded in having only one car (and two Zipcar memberships).\nCulture\nCons: Unlike New York City, there probably is not something for everyone in Providence. In particular, I’ve heard single friends complain that it’s not as lively as other cities.\nPros: Maybe it was because our apartment looked out over a pulsating Seventh Avenue, but when we lived in Manhattan, I used to feel guilty staying home on Saturday night. Now, with children ages five and two, we don’t have much time or energy for nightlife. Still, we enjoy great restaurants, theater and museums. We picked Providence because we believed it fit our lifestyle for this time in our lives–a place with some of the best aspects of a city (good food, shopping, arts) without some of the worst (traffic, crowds, cost).\nOne of my friends who was down on Providence before we moved here admitted that we’d eat well. And she wasn’t joking — we have better restaurants (and food trucks) than many cities, and Providence often makes national top ten lists. We’ve got great farmers’ markets, farms, and craft/local art stores. We don’t have the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the RISD Museum houses some impressive art (Van Gogh, Monet) in a museum you can actually get through with kids. We’ve got quality theater (Trinity Repertory, Providence Performing Arts Center). And of course, we benefit from the residual culture from Brown University, Rhode Island School of Design, the University of Rhode Island (which has a Downcity campus), Providence College, and Johnson and Wales University.\nAnd for those urges Providence can’t sate, Boston is under an hour away and New York City under three hours by train. In the last few months, we’ve taken the kids to Boston for the New England Aquarium and the Museum of Science; and last Memorial Day weekend, we took the kids to New York City for Central Park, Times Square and the Natural History Museum. Still, it’s nice to come home to Providence.\nNature\nPros: In my opinion, Rhode Island has the best beaches in New England. Massachusetts beaches (yes, even the Cape) are too cold in my opinion. RI has low-key rocky beaches (Little Compton), protected soft surf beaches (Sand Hill Cove), and open ocean waves (Westerly). Add to that great parks, well-maintained playgrounds, and definitely the best zoo in New England. Plus, unlike other states, driving out to the rural country of Rhode Island takes only a few minutes. In a few miles outside Providence, you can access dozens of farms for berry and apple picking, and small towns for some local charm.\nCons: RI has no mountains, so in-state skiing is restricted to the modest Yawgoo Valley. Still, it’s not a far drive to Vermont or New Hampshire.\nReal Estate\nCons: Unfortunately for us, real estate has not been a great investment in Rhode Island in the last few years (see WPRI story). Every few months either Geoff or I get a serious bout of malaise at having given up our NYC West Village apartment for our house in Providence. I think it’s time to admit that Geoff was right when he said, “we are condo owners”–we don’t really like painting rooms, refurbishing bathrooms, or dealing with plumbing issues on a hundred-year-old house.\nPros: On the upside, this may be a great time to buy in Providence. And right now, you certainly can get a lot more house for your money here than Boston, for example. For us, Providence offered a house where we can walk to the city (and train) but still have a yard, driveway and plenty of room for home offices and guests.\nEconomy\nCons: Job options need to improve here. We have a bit of a catch-22 on our hands here in RI: people can’t live here without jobs, and since people can’t get jobs here, they don’t move here. The jobs and the people come and go together, in other words. RI has trailed the nation with one of the worst unemployment rates (see USA Today story). And we really need to stop placing high on lists like our recent second place in “worst state to do business” (see Providence Business News story).\nFurthermore, corruption still exists here clearly. If the botched 38 Studios deal doesn’t make that strikingly obvious, nothing does. Similarly, RI was doing great with attracting Hollywood film, but they cut the film tax credits which left the state dry compared with neighboring Massachusetts where film is thriving.\nPros: I do have faith in some of our new leaders–I trust Providence Mayor Angel Taveras and Governor Lincoln Chafee. I believe they will make honest, clear-headed decisions. Like one reader wrote, what RI needs is some “forward thinking and concerted effort on the part of business and government leaders.” The more people that move here because they want to and because they feel commitment to improving the state, the more likely it will be that we’ll succeed. Maybe that will be you too…\nYou forgot that Providence has easy access to the best bike path that I have ever been on, no exceptions!\nI agree with everything you said! We moved here from Texas about a year and a half ago and I don’t regret it one bit.\nReally well thought-out answers. I like the public transit, especially around the city proper. When our car was stolen in August, it was a relatively painless transition to RIPTA. We’ve been here 4-1/2 years and definitely find the pros outweigh the cons.\nProvidence is also the host of many prominent colleges. Brown University, Providence College, Rhode Island College, Johnson & Wales University, and an extension of University of RI are all within the city limits.\nYes, how could I forget your school (PC) and mine (URI) — I will add to the mix…\nPingback: How to Build a Forest at the Granoff Center for the Arts | The Rhode Less Traveled: A Rhode Island Blog\nMichele thank you for your great overview of Providence. My wife and I will be relocating to Providence, by way of Dallas, TX, in August and are curious as to where to live. We have a two year old son so safety is of high prioity. Thanks for your input.\nI’m glad the post was helpful. We live on the East Side of Providence, which I find to be quite safe with some lovely family-friendly neighborhoods. I also have plenty of friends who live on the West Side of Providence, and love it too. Feel free to email me if you want more info…\nHi Michelle,\nI enjoyed reading your Blog. I have filmed a couple of shorts and hope to complete a project this summer. It does not come easy at all for me to write a decent script 🙂\nWhy is Providence or RI such an unfriendly business environment? I would assume taxes and red tape. My wife and I are going to visit Providence in early October. How is the winter and is it humid during the summer.\nThanks.\nVance\nHi Michelle,\nI really appreciated your insights on Providence, and reading of your background. I’m contemplating a move to Providence in autumn. Washington DC, Manhattan and Baltimore have been my stomping grounds over the last 15 years and I’m ready for something a bit different. I’m a healing arts practitioner (craniosacral therapy, myofascial release, trauma resolution, energy work, prenatal/postnatal massage, eastern techniques, etc), and I’m wondering if you can speak to the potential to grow my practice there? Also, are you teaching in a community setting at all? I’m keen to re-ignite the writing fires. I’m interested in deeming my writing skills and exploring documentary film-making.\nWarmly,\nSarah\nI can’t speak specifically to the potential of your practice — sounds interesting though. Right now I’m teaching at URI in Kingston, but I’ve also taught at Frequency Providence which is a great local adult education organization for writers.\nHi MIchelle,\nI’m planning to move to Providence after living in San Francisco for a number of years and more recently Buenos Aires. My concern with the East Side is the college kids…are there areas of the East side where you can feel that you aren’t on a campus? You mentioned that you’ve got friends on the West Side. What would you say the primary differences between the two are?\nThanks!\nMeri\nI recommend taking a look at the Providence site that describes different communities at http://www.providenceri.com/ONS/neighborhoods. It’s difficult to characterize the West Side or the East Side because each contains its own neighborhoods, but I’ll give you a rough sketch.\nThe East Side contains College Hill (near Brown University & RISD), Benefit Street and Blackstone Blvd areas in which houses can run as much as 700k to over a million. But on the East Side, there are also some wonderful more affordable neighborhoods near Wayland Square or the Hope Street/Rochambeau stores.\nThe West Side has been the site of a lot of economic development in the past few years and contains diverse enclaves, as well as Providence College and Rhode Island College. The West Side contains Federal Hill (historically an Italian neighborhood), Olneyville, Smith Hill, Mount Pleasant neighborhoods and others. I actually never considered which exact neighborhood friends of mine live in but from looking now, I think mostly in the Mount Pleasant, Federal Hill and Smith Hill areas.\nI’d recommend checking out http://provplan.org/ for future development plans for neighborhoods too.\nVery helpful, Michelle. Thanks! Google street view is great as well to get a visual idea of the different areas….\nThank you for this very useful information!\nI didn’t see a lot of mention about medical facilities in Providence, so I’d like to add that we have excellent hospitals (RI Hospital, Jane Brown, Roger Williams, Miriam, Hasbro Children’s and more) and excellent doctors and medical professionals. There are also many very good nursing and long-term care facilities in or near Providence.\nThank you for this! My husband and I are currently searching for that “place to call home” and would like to escape tha pace of NYC. Love the walkable town we live in in Westchester but SO expensive and I still deal with the crazy of NYC every day at work.\nWe’re going to Providence to tour soon. Any neighborhoods you can suggest for raising a little girl (1) and having a great community, walkable feel? We can’t wait to be homeowners. Thanks!\nWe have many New Yorker friends who moved to Providence! For walkable, nice community, etc. check out the East Side of Providence — especially College Hill (Brown, Prospect Street area) and Wayland Square area. Both of those have great shops, restaurants, etc to walk to plus playgrounds. If you want to be walking distance to downtown & the train, then College Hill is ideal. You might also like the Hope Street area near the shops (the area between Lippitt Memorial Park and Rochambeau). There’s also great neighborhoods on the West Side, but I’m just not as familiar with them. Report back on what your thoughts are!\nThank you for your post. I plan to move from Mass to Providence. I m asking about which part of Providence is safer to live in. Thanks.\nI honestly don’t know about *all* the different neighborhoods of Providence. We live on the East Side, which I consider quite safe. We also have friends who live downtown or on the West Side (near Seven Stars/Grange/Nicks on Broadway), which is a nice area too. I also really like the Mount Pleasant area (near Rhode Island College).\nHi Michele,\nThank you very much for all of this information. I am considering moving to RI from Orange County, California. This information has been really useful in helping me decide if I want to make that move which I think I do.\nMichele, Thank you for this post. My husband and I are looking to move to RI in the next year and I have looked at many websites for information, many leaving me very discouraged. It was nice to see a clearly thought out article. My apprehensions may still be high, but this certainly lets me feel that we will find a place to call home.\nHey there! I could have sworn I’ve been to this site before but after reading through some of the post I realized it’s new to me.\nAnyhow, I’m definitely delighted I found it\nand I’ll be bookmarking and checking back often!\nHi- We are seriously considering a move from Philadelphia to either Providence or Barrington. We’ve lived in center city Philadelphia for over 17 years and are slightly apprehensive about leaving the our urban lifestyle. Our children (ages 5 & 7) are currently enrolled in private school in Philadelphia (our schools are terrible), so are leaning toward Barrington in an effort to avoid private school, but worry about being happy in a suburban setting. Thoughts or experiences on this front?\nYes, it is true that the schools in Barrington are better than the average Providence public school. That said, I have numerous friends who have been very happy with elementary schools like Paul Cuffee (charter), International Charter School (another charter) and Vartan-Gregorian (public). I also have numerous friends with middle schoolers at Nathan Bishop (public) who attest to it, and Classical High School (application based) is excellent. So you *can* manage to do public school in Providence. There’s also Henry Barnard School which is a laboratory school through 5th grade for a third of the cost of typical private school tuition.\nAs for the other part of your question, I’m not a suburbs person. Geoff & I tried that for a few years and we hated it. So I guess I’m willing to make the sacrifices necessary to be in a city… That said, there are plenty of people who make the switch from city to suburb happily so it’s really a personal choice.\nCan you come visit during the school year so you can see some of the schools if that’s your concern?\nHi Danielle. Curious if you made the move from philly to providence. My family and I just left downtown philly for east bay with our two boys (under 3yo) 2mos ago and I’m kicking myself for having left our home and life in PA. I’m seriously so incredibly homesick. I’m not used to driving everywhere or having to make such effort to find friends. My boys and I are missing the walk ability, the active playgrounds and family friendly coffee play group meet ups, restaurants, gelato dates and effortless stimulation. I miss my oh so friendly neighbors and community. I find the burbs isolating and cold. Currently searching for an alternative…curious how your relocation went. I’m thinking we’d be happier in college hill. It looks beautiful and feels more our pace, people seem friendlier…plus seems like most homes have a yard! now if we can only afford the updated house with the yard and private school!!! Lol\nHi LaRiena – Sorry to hear your transition has been rough. I am a bit confused by your post though – where do you live exactly (are you in the suburbs of RI?) Because there are lots of playgrounds, coffee shops, etc. You might want to try going to some of the playgrounds on the East Side – the one at Brown Street Park is nice, but even better perhaps for the littler ones is what people call Humboldt Park (officially called Gladys Potter Park). I’m sure at either of those, you’ll meet lots of other people with kids the same age as yours – and generally people are so friendly, just strike up a conversation! Also, most of the friends that we have made have either been neighbors or parents from our kids’ schools. Once you have your kids in daycare or school, you’re bound to meet other parents too! Hang in there…\nMuch thanks for this informative post! We are in the DC area, but will be relocating to RI in the next month..I have only visited twice, and it is so different from what we are used to here….Your post has given me hope that our new life is something to embrace and look forward to! Thanks for that!\nLoved reading your post. Great information. We are a family of four (10 year old daughter and 11 year old son….6 th n 7th grade) looking to move to this beautiful state. Is there a particular family friendly community that you would recommend? I will definitely start looking into the private schools that you mentioned.\nFamilies live in all areas of Providence – so I suppose they are all in some ways family friendly! If you’re looking into private schools, both Moses Brown and Wheeler are located in the East Side of Providence near College Hill (and Brown University), which is one of the more affluent neighborhoods. I hope that helps!\nMichele, this post has relieved me of so much anxiety, thank you for your review and recommendations! Being totally unfamiliar with Providence, I’m wondering if you can provide any suggestions for me. As a mature student, I am looking to move there early next year (from outside the US) to attend JWU with my 11 yr old (grade 5) son in tow. I see you’ve made made some recommendations for families however; for safety purposes do you have preferences more specific to us since we’re a smaller family ;).\nPs. Just FYI, English is first and only language so not a concern.\nHi – I’m so glad to hear that! Feel free to email me at mm@michelemeek.com if you want to talk more privately. But what type of suggestions are you asking about — schools or neighborhoods?\nThank you for your blog. This has provided my husband and I with some realistic views from someone who has lived in other areas of the country. We are contemplating move to RI from southern Indiana and we are very apprehensive due to the cost of living and job market.\nI will admit the job market is not impressive in RI – hopefully with a new mayor and governor this year, we’ll see some change in that. In the meantime, there are plenty of people who commute to Bosotn (which is 35-50 minutes on the train).\nHi Michelle,\nI just returned from a holiday trip to RI to see my family. I’m thinking of a transition back (20 years since I left!) this article was really serendipitous to find tonight. Really hit all points! Thank you!\nGlad to hear it’s helpful!\nHi Michele-what a breath of fresh air to come across your blog! I’m heading up to RI to interview for a great job in the insurance industry and with grown children, schools are not the concern anymore. We’re an African American professional couple and I know coming from New York there’s really no comparison in terms of diversity but in your opinion and from what you’ve observed do you feel that RI is tolerant and open minded? I do see more and more comments from people moving from other states which is welcoming but I don’t see many comments from people of color which is not surprising since there’s not a large percentage of people of color in RI. I think this may be a great opportunity and of course I’m completely open and I see some wonderful areas to consider moving to if this comes to fruition but just have to ask that all important question (unfortunately). We’d potentially like to live in the Providence area but are certainly open to other options that are safe, quiet, and close to work (a few miles from Providence). Thoughts? Observances? Thanks!\nCertainly the circles that I find myself in are fairly progressive. Many of my friends are academics, doctors, tech/media professionals, and nearly everyone is quite liberal and open-minded.\nStill, I have to admit too, sadly, that the population of the East Side where I live seems to be largely white. One friend of mine told me once how she had prepared her daughter to get used to being the only black person in the room. I’ve thought about this over the years. In actuality, I don’t think it’s much different than neighborhoods where I’ve lived in Boston and New York. NYC seems diverse, but have you seen this article? http://www.forbes.com/sites/trulia/2012/11/13/finding-diversity-in-america/ It says how the West Village, where we lived in NYC, is 83% white, for example. So there are much deeper country-wide problems when the facts in this article demonstrate that “Expensive neighborhoods aren’t very diverse”.\nSo, I guess my answer to the question is that you won’t find tremendous diversity in the more affluent neighborhoods in Providence, any more than you would in any affluent area of the country unfortunately. But I would certainly expect that my friends and neighborhors were open and eager to see that change (I know I would be).\nThanks for Sharing the article as well as providing your thoughts. Essentually economics is a major driver now moreso than any other reason. I’m actually in Providence now for a short time so I’ll have the opportunity to checkout some of the various neighborhoods you mention in the blog and regardless of whether there is diversity or not, I hope we’re fortunate enough to live near people like you. Also following you on Twitter. Appreciate your insights!\nGlad you found it helpful – who knows, our paths may cross at some point. Providence sometimes feels more like a small town than a city! And feel free to post updated thoughts – I’d love to hear your experiences/impressions.\nHey Michele\nAccepted the gig and looking for a place in the Providence area now. Going to really do the deep dive in terms of living in the city or surrounding suburbs and your insights are most appreciated! I’ll keep you apprised.\nGreat! Let me know if you have other questions. I’m a city person, so I didn’t really consider the suburbs. But I have friends who live in Barrington, East Providence, and further out Smithfield…\nWow this is just what I needed! Thanks for the blog and the insights! I have been preparing to move to providence for a job relocation with my company. I have never lived in the north before. I have loved in Florida for 10 years and 10 years now in Atlanta. This will definitely be different for me. My plan is to get to providence and stay in hotel for a few days and while at the same time make a decision of where to rent . I am a single 35 yo male who is part of LGBT community. Would you have any recommendations for me as far as what areas of town may be a good fit to suit my lifestyle? And by lifestyle I mean single male who is quiet and enjoys reading, writing, going to the theaters, and sometimes a weekend outing for drinks with friends. I’ll be working in Lincoln. :)) thank you!!\nGlad to hear it! We currently live on the East Side, but I really like the West Side which feels more cutting edge in many ways with some great new restaurants. I have heard that living downtown or ‘downcity’ as its called is also more fun as a single person. I hope this helps! Feel free to email me at mm@michelemeek.com if you have questions I can answer too!\nOur family moved to the East Side in August 2014. We came from my hometown of Medford NJ and I do remember reading your blog as I tried to decide on Barrington or Providence. Thanks for the putting it out there – it was very helpful. We could not be more thrilled to be on the East Side – our kids are 13 and 15 and love the independence of walking to the shops and restaurants that surround us. They also love that they can ride their bikes and take advantage of the Brown athletic facilities( amazing olympic size pool, extensive turf fields, basketball and tennis courts). Our kids go to LaSalle Academy and have settled right in to this fantastic catholic co-ed school. Great teachers, sports, drama and every kind of club you could imagine. Even our golden doodle loves Providence! So many great places to walk and one of the best dog parks we’ve been to is right down the street from us. The shops at Wayland Square are so dog friendly! The book store hands out biscuits to our furry friend!\nThat’s so great to hear! Thanks for checking in and posting! So often I hear from people while pondering the move, but not so many after to see how it turned out. But I’m glad to hear that – and I’m sure others will appreciate your comments too.\nthank you so much for putting this together. It was really well thought out and the fact that you moved from a NYC meant you’ve dealt with a lot of the same things that my wife and I are working through as we ponder a move from downtown Chicago to Providence.\nThis post was really helpful for us!\nI’m so glad!\nHi Michele – My wife and I are contemplating a move from Boston to Providence. We’ve been car-free for about 9 years in Boston, using Zip car. Do you have any opinion on the feasibility of being car-free in Providence?\nThe public transportation in Boston isn’t *great* (which is why I always had a car there too), but in Providence, it’s obviously even tougher – there are busses (no subways/Ts). Still, between Zipcar and Uber – being car-free in Providence (assuming you pick a place to live near a Zipcar location) is quite feasible. Where I live there are about half a dozen Zipcar locations within walking distance. We have been able to get away with one car, but to be honest it’d be hard to get by without any car. Especially with kids, it seems there is often an extracurricular activity or birthday party or playdate or whatever that they need to be taken to. Plus I go back and forth regularly to URI – and driving is just much faster. I certainly have single friends though who have gotten by without a car, so it’s done frequently. Anyway, I hope you report back on what you decide!\nHi Michelle,\nI’m moving to Newport in a couple of weeks and would love to meet new people as I won’t know anyone! I’ve lived in San Francisco and more recently Buenos Aires. I’d love to find a Spanish speaking group if you, or anyone reading, knows of one. I also have a dog, so any suggestions about dog parks or people with dogs who like to get together would be great. Thx!\nI list some of the dog parks in RI at https://therhodelesstraveled.com/2009/09/10/off-leash-dog-parks-in-rhode-island/ – not sure I got them all though. I wonder if you can find a Spanish-speaking group on Meetup? Good luck!\nThank you! Yes, I was thinking of Meetup. There is a Spanish group in Providence….\nThank you for writing this. I’m going to follow your blog. We are a couple from New York who are considering retiring to either Providence or Newport because we like sailing, art, golf, and the ocean. It’s hard to find a place with all four and reasonable condo prices. (They are reasonable if you are comparing them to NY or CA, where I grew up.) Providence actually has lofts available (always wanted one as an artist) while Newport means we can stay involved in sailing events. Like others, I have lived in NYC and the burbs, and don’t want to live somewhere without nice food, diversity, and culture. Keep up the good work, I want to hear more!\nHmm one of the reasons that Providence usually trumps Newport for me is because there is better access to jobs (and commuting to Boston if necessary) but if you’re retiring that’s an entirely different story. You could always rent short term and try it out (short term winter rentals in Newport are usually dirt cheap). Tough choice! Let me know what you decide…\nHello, love reading your blog. My daughter is applying to Brown and I’ve heard some stories about crime in the city, as far as assault . Can you speak to this topic?\nApril – Thanks for your question. In College Hill (where Brown is located), the main crime is typically robbery. These are usually situations where the person/people break into the house when no one is home. I know that in our house, even, there was an attempted break-in, but since someone was actually home (I think they didn’t realize that since there was no car in the driveway), the person/people ran off when they saw lights/heard someone. In the past year, there have been quite a few cases of these (although some people were caught this summer – http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150831/NEWS/150839870) and I haven’t heard of any recently. There have also been a few cases of ‘armed robbery’ on the streets at night in the area, but these are infrequent. I have not known this to happen to anyone living here, but I do see the reports come through. Overall, the neighborhood is quite safe – much safer than most cities. I have *never* felt unsafe here – even if I’m out at night. Students here are likely advised to take the same precautions anyone living in a city, and I know the Brown students who have worked with us often use the ‘OnCall’ service at night so they don’t have to walk at night. See https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/transportation/brown-university-shuttle/brown-oncall-program for info. I certainly wouldn’t give up a chance to go to Brown because of safety! It’s as safe as any college campus, frankly!\nHi Considering a job offer which is in the Boston area. I am currently living in SF area. We are looking for great schools, safety as we have two young children 5 and 2. We are city people and have lived in Brooklyn, Rotterdam, Vienna and now SF. Diversity, plenty of activities for children, restaurants, museums walking distance would be nice.\nHey – thanks for reading! It sounds like you’ve lived in lots of interesting places. I’ve always wanted to go to Vienna. Anyway, Providence meets most of the criteria you list – I’ve found it’s a great city to raise children in. As you can tell from the blog, we find plenty to do, and there’s such a great community of people here. Let me ask – are you interested in private or public schools? Providence is not known for great public schools (except for Classical High School), but there are many amazing private schools. That said, Boston isn’t really known for great public schools either. If you’re sure you want to go the public school route, you might want to consider a city like Brookline near Boston. Of course, that said, I know Brookline quite well, and I wouldn’t want to live there…\nHi there!\nI absolutely love your blog and really appreciate all the really thorough information and candid experiences you share!\nMy family and I are moving to the area in June/July as the hubs got a job at Brown and I’m so nervous about this transition. We’re coming from Colorado, have a 7 year old and a 1 1/2 year old, and just really want to start making friends and really becoming part of the RI community.\nDo you happen to know of any FB Mom/Parenting groups that are specific to the Providence, Barrington or East Greenwich areas? I’ve done a few searches on FB and came up empty…\nWe’re considering living in either on the east side of Providence, Edgewood area, Barrington or East Greenwich (the two suburban areas are on the potential list due to the reputation of the excellence of the public schools) and are thinking it might be helpful to see what the communities are like in these areas by joining these groups.\nAlso, any other words of advice as we make the trek to RI to a nervous but very excited family?\nThanks so much!\nHi Sarah – I do know there’s an East Side parents group at east-side-parents@googlegroups.com but I don’t know of others. As for your choice b/w Providence vs Barrington vs East Greenwich, I think the first thing to narrow down is city vs suburb. With those suburbs you get quiet, lots of property, and high quality public schools, but you loose out on walkability, culture, public transportation, diversity and to some extent liberal views (you definitely find more conservatives in East Greenwich for instance even in largely Democrat RI). For me, that was no contest – I have lived in several suburbs, and I have not liked it. But I’ve had friends who have moved to Barrington for the schools, who seem perfectly content. I also have friends who came to RI thinking they’d move to East Greenwich but couldn’t fathom it when they arrived and are happier in Providence. So that’s very much a personal preference. I’d check out the following for some pros and cons of towns: http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2006/The-Best-Places-to-Live/\n“The more people that move here because they want to and because they feel commitment to improving the state, the more likely it will be that we’ll succeed. Maybe that will be you too…”\nHere’s hoping! I lived in RI some years ago for college and am hoping to return someday soon. Providence really is a cool little city.\nHello! We are contemplating a move to the East Side of Providence. Having a hard time deciding between a couple of houses – walking to Hope St. shops or Wayland St. shops. How would you describe the difference in those areas? Is one area safer than another? Thanks!\nI’m not sure safety is vastly different between the two neighborhoods, and we have friends who live in both. I personally prefer Wayland a bit better, and I’m fairly certain that near Wayland the prices are a bit higher. One thing to consider is how close you are to either of these shopping areas — because if you’re not within a 3 or so block radius, trust me, you’re going to end up driving instead of walking. That’s just been my experience. So close proximity for me would be more important than which of those neighborhoods…\nHi! I’m a medical student considering a residency in the area, but I’m not sure how the adjustment would be. I’ve lived in Miami my whole life, and it worries me the lifestyle would be such a drastic change. Unfortunately due to time constraints I won’t be able to visit Providence before applying, but if you have any insight or advice I’d appreciate it! Thanks\nI haven’t spent enough time in Miami to make an informed comparison. But I will say that if you’ve lived there your whole life, why not try something different especially for a residency which is temporary. I’m sure you’ll find plenty rollover about it here too…\nHi.Firstly, thank you for the well written article. We will be moving to Providence in October and I am looking at the housing options. I have a 5 year old kid so good schools is a major concern. I found that Providence city public schools are probably not that great but some neighborhood areas like Lincoln,North Providence might have good ones. What are your views on this and could you suggest some more such neighborhoods. I will be working at Brown University and am open to drive to work for 20-25 min if the residential area is safe and has good schools. Thanks!\nHi Michele! Firstly, thank you for the well written article. We will be moving to Providence in October and I am looking at the housing options. I have a 5 year old kid so good schools is a major concern.

Thanks!\nHi – well, I’m glad you found the blog and that it was helpful! Quite a few of our friends have moved to Barrington, RI for the public schools. It’s also a lovely part of the state. It’s on the water and the East Bay Bike Path. So that would be my personal recommendation.\nRhode Island Monthly does a ‘best public school’s article every year. They may have the more recent one on their site, but take a look at https://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2014/Chart.pdf As you’ll see Classical High School, in Providence, ranks as the second best in the state according to them.\nI do want to say as someone who cares *very* much about education (I’m defending my dissertation next month), I truly think that Providence can work if you’re willing to supplement school with some extracurricular programs. So it depends on what your definition of a “good” school is. For me, I’ve realized school is not only for academic preparedness, but for social experience–and I prefer a school with more diversity for that reason. I’m also more about “preparing the child for the road” as opposed to “preparing the road for the child.” I’m willing to supplement school with other programs to make sure the academics meet my standards. Anyway, it’s such a personal decision with a lot of factors to consider. Let me know if you have other questions!\nhi, would you plz tell me how is the job market for the new immigrants? I & my partner are lesbians who will come to the USA as a refugee. my English is good, we both understand English very well.\nwhen I say job market I mean anything that gives us enough income to live in the city and don’t die. I have a bachelor in microbiology but I don’t think I have a chance in that area since I don’t have experience.\nYou might want to reach out to Dorcas – http://www.diiri.org/ – they have some great resources.\nHi, Michele. My husband, 2.5 year old, and I are considering a move from Brooklyn (13-20 years between us) back to New England. My husband is from Providence, and I from CT. We like the vibrancy and diversity Providence offers. I am a public school teacher with the NYC DOE and really value a social justice vision when it comes to education, paired with academic rigor. We looked into Brown Play School for him as well as Ocean State Montessori. I’m more worried about myself, honestly, as my husband is a director and would be traveling on location for work, and you seem like minded in many ways. Is it easy to meet people with these views? Is there community activism around social justice issues? Are you aware of educator groups or schools that may fall in like with this? Any input would be helpful.\nI’m sorry I didn’t see your comment earlier. Yes, you would absolutely find like-minded people! Did you make a decision – both of those schools I’ve heard great things about as well. Especially since the election, there have been a number of grassroots/activist/community groups that have formed that are quite robust. Feel free to email me.\nMichelle, just stumbled on your blog as I am researching our middle school choices for my 5th grader: Nathan Bishop and Community Prep. My daughter has attended our local elementary public, RF Kennedy (Elmhurst is a lovely, if quiet, affordable area in Prov). She’s had great teachers and is doing well academically and socially, but the curriculum has been pretty rote and uninspiring- and there is a punitive attitude among some staff. Mixed bag. My daughter got into the Advanced Academic program at Greene which is closer to us, but she wasn’t keen on Greene. She’s looking for a positive school atmosphere (and challenging academics, nice kids, and opportunities to follow her interests in science, math, and politics…). I’m curious since the years you wrote about Nathan Bishop whether you can offer any further impressions to help us make this decision? And your blog is great!\nHi Jess – I somehow missed your comment before. We have several friends whose children attending Nathan Bishop. The educational experience is mixed. Some of them have addressed this by doing a lot of academic supplementing (like with Squared School for math, for instance). There are definitely students like them who are there and love to learn. But there also seem to be a lot of behavioral issues (according to the students) that keep learning from being effective in some classes. You should visit the school and talk to students and parents (reach out to the parent organization)!\nTwo of my adult children and I (I am 65) are looking at different states to move to from Texas (Ft. Worth area). My son is really interested in Providence. We don’t really have winter weather down here much, so was curious about that, and if the job market has improved since this comment thread began.\nI will say that our current governor has done a lot to try to draw business to Rhode Island, and I think she’s doing a good job. But I will say that most of our friends at least one person in the couple works in Massachusetts… That said, Boston is commuting distance.\nHi Michelle!\nThanks a lot for sharing your experience and vision, so nice to hear from someone that have been living in the city for a while…!\nI have a pending offer from URI to work on Kingston campus. Now we are trying to make the decision as a family, with my husband, a musician who plays his own gigs and teaches; my HS sophomore daughter and our 8-year old son. We are from Argentina, but moved to San Diego 14 years ago and stayed here since. It is a hard decision but opportunity is big and San Diego is beautiful but quite expensive. Top concern for us is safety, which we treasure here in San Diego all around. Then, schools. I know suburban areas have better schools but I am not sure we can fit in those little towns. I wonder if there are more urban-like places, very safe and good schools combos. I was looking into Cranston…\nI saw you also work at URI so will love to hear your opinion and if the commute is doable. We never experienced snow either…\nThanks!!!!\nI commuted to URI for 6 years, and I loved it there. Because I was a grad student and instructor, I was only going in about 2-4 times per week typically. In my opinion, the commute is totally doable from Providence (about 35 minutes and rarely traffic). This Fall, I’ll be commuting to Bridgewater, Massachusetts (about 40 min) where I’m starting as an assistant professor. As for safety, I have never felt unsafe in Rhode Island or Providence. I will say that Barrington, RI might be a good fit for you coming from San Diego, although that might make your commute farther. There are a lot of people there who have moved from Providence for the schools, and it’s a bit more suburban but also just beautiful over the ocean with a coastal bike path running through it. Another option is East Greenwich, although I don’t like it as much personally as Barrington. BTW if for fitting in you are thinking of political persuasions, you might want to check out this recent election map the Providence Journal posted, which shows which areas voted “red” or “blue.” As for the weather, I hate winter. I like ice skating, but I truly can’t think of any other redeeming features. But the kids love it!\nHi, Michele – Did I read correctly that you teach at URI? I recently interviewed for a faculty position at RIC, and am wondering if you have any thoughts about best places to live around there? I went to Brown many moons ago, and the RIC campus is not in a familiar part of Providence for me, so I’d welcome your input. I will have a car and am happy to be up to 20 minutes from campus. Thank you for your informative and personable blog – it’s been enormously helpful.\nThanks to Michele and Geoff’s blog, my wife, son and I moved from Boston to Providence in 2016. Best decision we ever made. The city has been so kind to us. We are on Rochambeau on the east side. We send our 5 year old to Montessori Children’s House for school, we bike quite a bit despite the east side’s hills, and we get away with just one car. People here are warm and welcoming, and willing to help out. Haven’t had any issues with crime or anything like that. Providence needs young creative people; it’s certainly a little more work to find a job or navigate some things but IMHO it’s totally worth it.\nDo you still live there? Im moving with my family in a few months and would love any updated pros/cons…\nYes, I do—love it! I’ve spent a few semesters abroad over the years, but we’ve now been here over a decade. I’m happy to answer questions.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

As the House and Senate Appropriations Committees see the ascension of two new chairs, this long-used, often vilified practice is set to return to the legislative branch with a series of institutional safeguards. And while it may come as a surprise to many, the beneficiaries of this new policy will be everyday Americans, across the country.\nThroughout much of the 2000s earmarking became synonymous with corruption. After a few high-profile scandals in the early part of that decade, Congress put additional rules into place in order to prevent such abuses. However, the conversation around earmarks was quickly hijacked. Some legislators and activists convinced Americans that earmarks served no purpose, were the cause of budget deficits, ballooned the budget, and were the well of legislative misanthropy.\nThe reality of earmarks is much different. First, they serve a real purpose, allowing legislators—who well understand the needs of their districts/states—to target funds for important projects that can solve policy problems and create jobs. Second, while abuses happen, the vast majority of earmarks were meant to respond to constituents’ concerns and needs. Third, earmarks have always composed a miniscule portion of the discretionary budget, typically less than one percent, and fall within a chairman’s mark—the top-line number set for an appropriations bill’s cost. Fourth, earmarks did not disappear with the so-called “earmarks ban” in 2011; it simply transferred the behavior to the executive branch or made them more secretive within the legislative branch. Fifth, earmarking is not a Democratic proposal. Democrats and Republicans have endorsed their use. It is also not a liberal proposal, as some of Congress’s most conservative members, like Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) have defended their use and opposed the original ban.\nIn a very direct way, the earmark ban stripped power from the people and their representatives in Congress and made the practice more likely to be corrupted, not less so. Zachary Courser and Kevin Kosar wrote powerfully recently as to why legislators and their constituents should embrace the return of earmarks with appropriate safeguards. They also highlight some of the institutional challenges within Congress that occurred at the same time the earmark ban was in place. My research has highlighted that federal spending power is an ongoing competition between the legislative and executive branches and when Congress fails to direct spending in specific ways, the executive branch performs that duty for them. In that setting, legislative earmarks become presidential earmarks. In that sense, Republican House members and senators who oppose legislative earmarks are working to transfer additional power to allocate federal funds to Democratic President Joe Biden.\nOver the course of the 116th Congress, the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress worked hard to offer recommendations that would improve the functioning of the institution.[1] One of the issues the committee addressed and ultimately recommended was the reinstatement of earmarks with additional safeguards. Their recommendations included expanding transparency regard disclosing the member requesting earmarks and the recipients, identifying any connections the earmark has to the legislator or his/her family, capping the number of earmarks, and limiting the types of recipients who are eligible, among other requirements. The goal, as the committee report noted was to include “end to end transparency” to allow accountability both in the insertion or earmarks as well as their effectiveness in achieving stated goals.\nThese efforts are important in two ways. First, they refuse to take the foolish step of throwing out an entire practice because of hyperbole, misinformation, and a few bad actors. Second, it seeks to improve the safeguards around the practice in order to make members more accountable and honest and to rebuild the public’s trust in the process.\nIt is now up to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to act on these recommendations and build in the sufficient safeguards necessary to empower legislators to do the work their constituents expect. This new process must ensure that earmarks are used in a transparent, accountable, and forthright manner. It is also important, as part of the discussion around the return of earmarks, for experts, legislators, leaders, and media to have an honest discussion about this practice.\nWill earmarking be flawless? Absolutely not; nothing is in government. However, it is important for Americans to weigh the benefits and costs and to evaluate whether the safeguards Congress enacts will protect the process enough for it to continue. The conversation around earmarking should be an ongoing one. Simply putting it into place and enacting safeguards is not sufficient. Congress should continuously reexamine whether earmarking is making a difference in districts/states, whether the safeguards are preventing corruption and malfeasance, and whether systematic biases exist in the system. If problems arise, Congress should consider further reforms to strengthen the system, rather than take a kneejerk response of banning it.\nThe Committee on the Modernization of Congress suggested changing the name “earmarks” to “congressionally-directed spending”—a moniker that well-reflects what the practice entails. However, whatever the practice is called, Americans need to have faith in it and see the benefits from it. They should also know that the legislative power to earmark is constitutional and an inherent means of limiting the powers of the presidency—an important issue for those skeptical of executive power. And as Congress moves forward with this needed reform, they must be sensitive to the expectations of a public wary of the practice because of decades of bad information.\n[1] For full disclosure, in January 2020 I testified before this committee on the topic of earmarks/congressionally-directed spending.\nThe Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.\nWe are supported by a diverse array of funders.

It has often been a lonely fight, but one I know is worth winning. I am encouraged by some of my Democratic colleagues' new-found enthusiasm for suspending this practice for a year. I hope their recent commitments do not wane once they step off the campaign trail. I believe we must end this process, which has diverted billions in taxpayer dollars to needless projects, once and for all. If voters give me the pen, I will veto every single pork-barrel bill Congress sends me.\n\"The American people demand that we introduce transparency and good judgment in how we spend their tax dollars. If projects like the proposed taxpayer-funded Woodstock concert museum were worthy national priorities, their funding would not be sought through appropriations earmarks, rather, they could withstand the public scrutiny of the regular legislative authorization process.\n\"I am encouraged that Senators Clinton and Obama have joined me in supporting the DeMint amendment banning earmarks for one year. I renew my call for them to fully disclose all of their earmark requests while serving in the Senate and join me in increasing needed transparency and accountability in Washington.\"\nJohn McCain, Statement By John McCain On Banning Earmarks Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/290989\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In 2021, Democrats ended the 10-year earmark moratorium. Earmarks, occasionally referred to as “pork,” are small grants to programs and projects in congressional districts. House Republicans were skeptical of bringing back earmarks, though they recently voted to keep earmarks for the 118th Congress. We do not yet know if Republicans will change the earmarking process. However, we find that the parties have a fundamentally different approach to representation when it comes to their earmark requests. By analyzing data in 2021, we do know that House Democrats and Republicans used earmarks to accomplish very different goals and framed the projects funded by them in different ways. Democrats adopt a transactional or distributional approach to representation and promote policies that appeal to their big-tent constituency. Republicans adopt a more symbolic approach, emphasizing American imagery and values.\nIn our new paper “Partisan Asymmetries in Earmark Representation,” we analyze written justifications to measure how members approach representing their constituents. Under rules first introduced in 2021, members of Congress can request up to ten earmarks in each appropriations cycle. With each of these requests, the members must submit a written justification for why their project is a good use of taxpayer dollars. These written justifications give us an opportunity to see what policy topics are in each earmark, who the earmark is for, and how the funds will have a demonstrable impact on their constituents. We performed a content analysis of all 3,007 of these justifications and found clear partisan differences in the earmarking process.\n“At the individual member level, Republicans requested over $20 million more than Democrats.”\nBecause earmarks by their very nature spend government money, we might expect Democrats to use the earmarking process more. But that supposition is just partially correct. On average, in the 117th Congress Democratic representatives requested two more earmarks than their Republican colleagues at a ratio of about ten-to-eight. But looking at just the number of earmarks requested undersells the partisan differences in earmarking behavior. When we change our unit of analysis to the earmark amount, we see that Republicans asked for $3 million more per earmark than Democrats ($4.7 million for Republicans; $1.7 million for Democrats). At the individual member level, Republicans requested over $20 million more than Democrats.\n“The content in Democratic earmarks, however, are more want-based entities and less expensive than physical infrastructure projects.”\nAt first glance these numbers are jarring, especially given the previous Republican commitments to cutting budgets and eliminating wasteful spending. But looking at the policy content of the earmark requests explains Republicans’ large-dollar requests. The “local infrastructure” projects requested by Republicans are equal parts a need-based entity in their districts (everyone needs a good road and bridge) and expensive. The content in Democratic earmarks, however, are more want-based entities and less expensive than physical infrastructure projects.\nNow that earmarks are staying around for the 118th Congress, we can speculate on two possible outcomes for the future of earmarks. One possibility is that earmarking behavior in the 118th Congress is the same as it was in the 117th. We’ve already addressed a few dimensions of the earmark process. But in our paper, we also test whether earmark representation is shaped by conventional understandings of partisan issue ownership (see Table 1). Issues “owned” by Republicans are high-level: defense, the economy, and immigration. Earmarks are not well-equipped to deal with these issues, as they operate on a district level. Democratic owned issues, on the other hand, are very well suited for earmarks: social welfare, education, and community development. We find that Democrats requested significantly more earmarks with policy topics they owned compared to Republicans. Republicans used earmarks for the large infrastructure projects for which they could claim credit.\nIf in the 118th Congress the behavior stays the same, we would expect Republicans to request much more money from each earmark for their infrastructure projects than their Democratic colleagues, even if they continue to request fewer earmarks in the aggregate. The trend seen throughout this process continues; what Republicans request in an earmark is fundamentally different from what Democrats request.\nBut a second, and more likely, possibility, is that earmarking behavior shifts in response to Republicans controlling the appropriations process. This means Republicans will start to request more earmarks than they did in the 117th Congress, and Democrats will request fewer. It also means that Republicans will begin to utilize earmarks as a tool for representation and start to request earmarks that target their core voting blocs.\nIn our research, we show how Democrats used earmarks as a tool for representation in this way. We group the target populations referenced in the justification letters required to accompany requests by the House Appropriations Committee into core Democratic and core Republican voting blocs (see Table 2). We define a core Democratic target as any reference in an earmark justification to class, race, women, ethnic group, LGBTQ persons or youth. A core Republican target is defined as a reference to religious groups, rural communities, military personnel, farmers, or the elderly. Democrats referenced a core target group in 22% of their earmarks in the 117th Congress. Republicans referenced a core target group in only 4% of their earmarks. These percentages align with the policy topics contained in an earmark justification as well, as the large infrastructure projects requested by Republicans are less likely to be targeted towards a key constituent group. So as Republicans alter their earmarking behavior in response to their new control of the House Appropriations Committee, expect to see more earmarks for fewer dollars, with an increased focus on projects that benefit their core target group.\nThe ten-year gap between earmarking cycles means scholars can approach studying these appropriation tools with fresh eyes in a contemporary context. Earmarks offer a new opportunity to see tangible evidence of the federal government “working” at the local level. If they continue to be allowed in the next congress, more earmark justifications will roll in during the next appropriations cycle. It will be interesting to see how a Republican-controlled House of Representatives will use this tool to benefit their constituents; and how Democrats, now serving in the minority, will adjust their behavior.\nThe Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.\nWe are supported by a diverse array of funders.

The Marshall Project used text analysis to identify 13 major claims about immigration in over 350,000 of Trump’s public statements from Factba.se, some of which Trump has made 500 times or more. All of them are untrue or deeply misleading.\nResearch has shown that as someone hears a statement more times, it feels more true.\nMillions of Americans and people worldwide have heard these claims. Here they are, fact-checked by the staff of The Marshall Project.\nTrump claims that:\n▪ Unauthorized immigrants are criminals [said 575+ times], snakes that bite [35+ times], eating pets, coming from jails and mental institutions [560+ times], causing crime in sanctuary cities [185+ times], and a group of isolated, tragic cases prove they are killing Americans en masse [235+ times].\n▪ They are stealing Americans’ public benefits [270+ times] and jobs [155+ times].\n▪ He has to build a wall [675+], and mass deportations are acceptable because Eisenhower did it [50+ times].\nSkip to the end for more context about these repeated falsehoods.\nclaimed by trump more than 550 times\nFor Donald Trump, immigrants bring crime. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said during his 2015 campaign announcement. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.”\nBut immigration in the U.S. is strongly associated with lower crime. Looking at data from 200 metropolitan areas, a 2017 study found immigrants are “less likely to offend than native born Americans” and “for property crimes, immigration has a consistently negative effect” on a region’s crime rate. That trend, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) research found, has been consistent all the way back to 1870.\nThose findings hold true for undocumented immigrants. Using estimates of undocumented populations, researchers in 2018 found that “undocumented immigration does not increase violence.” Similarly, a study published one year earlier asserted undocumented immigrants have lower rates of drug arrests, overdoses and drunk driving offenses than native-born Americans.\nWhy do immigrants commit fewer crimes? One theory is that the type of person willing to pack up their entire life to seek prosperity in America is also the type of person unwilling to put all of that at risk through criminal behavior, according to a 2007 NBER paper.\nWhile first-generation immigrants generally display lower levels of criminality, their descendants tend to behave more and more like the greater U.S. population as their families assimilate. “By the second generation, immigrants have simply caught up to their native-born counterparts,” reads a 2014 study.\nTrump’s oft-repeated assertion that immigrants make crime worse is shared by around half of Americans, according to a 2023 survey — a number relatively consistent with when Pew started asking the question nearly a quarter-century ago. Only 5% of respondents thought immigrants reduce crime.\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed that millions of immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border were intentionally released from overseas jails, prisons and asylums, especially in countries like Venezuela.\nThese claims have been routinely debunked by journalists, researchers and fact-checkers. Pressed multiple times, Trump’s campaign has not been able to corroborate the claims, making it difficult to fact-check something that may not exist.\nA kernel of truth driving Trump’s claim is that federal officials say they’ve encountered Venezuelan gang members crossing the southern border, though in nowhere near the numbers the former president is pushing. And there’s no evidence they were incarcerated or systematically released, intentionally or otherwise, to infiltrate the U.S.\nCriminology and immigration experts, both inside and outside of Venezuela, told El País, the largest daily Spanish-language newspaper in the world, that there’s been no emptying of prisons and mental institutions. Meanwhile, Trump has exaggerated and misattributed the country’s decline in violent crime. A 2023 annual report on violence from an alliance of Venezuelan universities links a more modest 25% decline in violence to peace agreements between organized gangs and fewer opportunities for crime amid a suffering economy. The report does say outward migration of youth gangs temporarily drove up violence in neighboring countries.\nRepublicans echo Trump’s accusations. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott proclaimed the border a disaster less than five months into the Biden administration. Last month, Abbott amended that proclamation to label Tren de Aragua — the Venezuelan gang at the heart of Trump’s unfounded claim — a terrorist organization.\nDonald Trump has claimed that Mexico is flooding the border with drug dealers, criminals and rapists by repeating emotionally powerful anecdotes. Two weeks after his 2015 presidential campaign announcement, Trump latched onto a poster child: Jose Garcia-Zarate, a five-times deported Mexican national who was charged with murder for fatally shooting 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a pier in San Francisco. She died in her father’s arms.\nTrump repeatedly invoked Steinle’s killing as part of an immigrant crime wave and said that he is “the only one who can fix it.”\nTrump’s focus on Garcia-Zarate is part of a pattern of highlighting undocumented people of color killing or raping White women: Lakin Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Marilyn Pharis.\nWhile each of these violent crimes is tragic, multiple studies have shown there is no crime wave: Documented and undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Individual cases of violence can always be found within a population of some 11 million undocumented immigrants, said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a professor at the Moritz School of Law.\nThese individual stories “serve as useful rallying points around which his supporters and members of the right-wing media ecosystem are willing to devote immense amounts of time,” García Hernández said.\nAnd some of Trump’s cases aren’t what he claims they are. A jury acquitted Garcia-Zarate of murder, finding the gun went off by accident and ricocheted off the pier before killing Steinle. Trump called it “a disgraceful verdict” and tweeted, “BUILD THE WALL!”\nSteinle’s family did not appreciate the attention. “For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed — beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,” Liz Sullivan, Steinle’s mother, told the San Francisco Chronicle. “We were the perfect storm for that man.”\nFederal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections and the available evidence shows attempts to get around the law are vanishingly rare.\nState-level reviews of voter rolls have routinely found negligible numbers of noncitizens attempting or successfully registering to vote. For example, earlier this year in Ohio, about 600 noncitizens were found to have registered to vote. Of those, about 138 are believed to have cast a ballot, representing about 0.002% of the state’s registered voters. Similarly, in August, a yearslong review in Texas found about 2,000 “potential” noncitizens with voting histories on Texas voter rolls — or 0.01% of the electorate — but to date, none have been accused of voting illegally.\nRepublicans have still tried to tighten voter registration laws, specifically the 2024 SAVE Act legislation, which would force states to verify citizenship before adding someone to the voter rolls, an effort that Democrats have stymied to this point.\nAnother version of Trump’s argument is that pro-immigrant efforts by Democrats pad the census counts of Democrat-majority districts and give the party an advantage in House representation and the Electoral College. Trump ally Elon Musk has repeatedly echoed this claim, falsely claiming that Democrats have gained as many as 20 seats in the House due to illegal immigration.\nMultiple analyses have found that illegal immigration is responsible for between 0 and 1 additional Democratic representatives in the House based on the 2020 census. Additionally, at the statewide level, noncitizen arrivals have been concentrated in Republican-leaning states since 2019, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute.\nAlthough there is no single definition for a “sanctuary city,” Donald Trump is broadly referring to states or municipalities that choose not to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to arrest or detain people suspected of violating the country’s immigration laws. It’s a movement that traces its origins back to the 1980s, when churches banded together to shelter refugees fleeing violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. These religious communities offered migrants protection in open defiance of the federal government.\nTrump’s claims that these policies lead to increased crime by undocumented immigrants are central to the larger debate over whether the sanctuary movement threatens the safety of the local communities embracing it.\nResearch shows that there is no link between sanctuary policies and rising crime rates. There are numerous studies that reach the same conclusion using various types of statistical research methods. Instead, researchers find that migrants are less likely to commit crimes than their native-born counterparts.\nA 2017 study found that, across 107 U.S. cities, homicide and robbery rates tended to drop as the number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico increased, but only in sanctuary cities. One theory explaining why is that sanctuary policies allow undocumented immigrants to interact with law enforcement without fear of deportation, producing “a spiral of trust that supports police and raises informal social control over crime.”\nAt rally after rally, Donald Trump asks the crowd if they want to hear the poem “The Snake” and the audience roars. A Marshall Project analysis estimates he has read or referenced the poem at least three dozen times.\nThe poem is actually the lyrics of a song based on one of Aesop’s fables, in which a tender-hearted woman picks up a frozen snake and warms it. When it’s revived, the snake repays her kindness with a poisonous bite. She asks him why he would kill her and the snake replies, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” In a speech in South Carolina, Trump told the crowd the lyrics were pertinent in light of “people coming into our country who are going to cause tremendous problems.”\nMisinformation can come in the form of outright lies, but also in the less tangible, and more difficult to fact-check, medium of a metaphor. A 2018 academic paper analyzed Trump’s use of metaphor and found he frequently evoked the image of immigrants as animals. “He uses this metaphor to present himself as a hero, as someone who will protect you from these animals,” a study author told Frontline.\nIronically, the song was written by civil rights activist and musician Oscar Brown Jr. Brown, who wrote essays against racism, ran as a progressive candidate in Illinois and for a brief time joined the Communist Party.\nIn an interview, Brown’s daughter Africa Brown said her father was “never against immigrants” and said, “Trump is the living embodiment of the snake that my father wrote about in that song.”\nDonald Trump’s assertions that members of Hamas, ISIS and other extremist groups are entering the country as refugees to conduct acts of terrorism largely don’t hold up to reality. Historically, most perpetrators of terror attacks have been U.S.-born citizens or permanent legal residents from countries not part of the Trump administration’s “Muslim ban,” which restricted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nA 2023 Cato Institute analysis found that the annual odds of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack by a refugee is one in 3.3 billion. The likelihood of being killed in a terrorist attack by any foreigner is one in 4.3 million, and the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by an undocumented immigrant is “zero.”\nAccording to a 2015 Migration Policy Institute article examining nearly 800,000 resettled refugees since Sept. 11, 2001, only three — two Iraqi and one Uzbek — have been arrested for planning terror attacks: Two were to take place abroad, and one was “barely credible.” However, the following year, a Somali refugee in Ohio stabbed 13 people (none of whom died).\nAfter Israel’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack that killed almost 1,200 Israelis and took over 250 hostages last year, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the “same people” behind the attack in Israel were entering the U.S. through “our totally open southern border.”\nPalestinians in Gaza largely cannot escape the war outside the strip’s borders because of Israel’s land, sea and air blockade. The main U.N. agency settling Palestinian refugees does not refer them to the U.S. The number of Palestinian refugees going through other countries, and referred to the U.S. by nongovernmental organizations, is quite small and subject to rigorous vetting to identify anyone posing “security risks.” According to the State Department, fewer than 600 Palestinians have come to the U.S. as refugees in the last decade. In the 2023 fiscal year, out of more than 60,000 total refugees accepted by the U.S., only 56 were Palestinian.\nDonald Trump often repeats that undocumented immigrants put a financial burden on American taxpayers by taking advantage of public welfare benefits. “Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in 2018.\nUndocumented immigrants are able to use some public services. Undocumented children can receive public education. And the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), provides items like baby formula to low-income parents, including undocumented ones. However, fear often keeps undocumented immigrants from taking advantage of their benefits. After Trump took office, many undocumented families withdrew from WIC for fear of being detected and deported.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for many other public benefits. Undocumented people can pay into Social Security and unemployment insurance, but are unable to access them themselves.\nThis is in contrast to veterans, who have benefits like the Veterans Health Administration, the GI bill to pay for education and specialized loan assistance programs.\nA report from the Cato Institute argued that undocumented immigrants could be a net benefit to public coffers because they tend to pay more in taxes than they consume in government services.\nUndocumented people contribute to the American economy by working, earning income and paying sales, income and payroll taxes, including through automatic paycheck withholdings or by using taxpayer identification numbers instead of Social Security numbers. Again, fear and lack of information about the tax preparation process often keeps undocumented people from receiving tax credits they may otherwise qualify for.\nAccording to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in 2022 in federal, state and local taxes.\nOn the night Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, Donald Trump claimed, if given the chance, she would “allow more than 100 million illegal aliens into our country.”\nAlthough Trump says Democratic politicians like Harris support “open borders,” both Harris’ presidential platform and the Biden administration’s current policies advocate for strong border enforcement.\nSince becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has called for stricter asylum rules and vowed to prosecute drug-smuggling gangs. “The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them,” Harris said during a recent visit to the border town of Douglas, Arizona.\nIn some ways, the Biden administration carried over Trump’s immigration policies. Both administrations enforced Title 42, a pandemic-related policy allowing Border Patrol agents to turn away migrants on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.\nAfter Title 42 was lifted last May, the State Department clarified this change “does not mean the border is open.” Instead, immigration rules reverted to Title 8, which imposes harsher penalties for illegal border crossings, such as deportation and a five-year ban on reentry — consequences not enforced under Title 42.\nHowever, border crossings continued to rise and, earlier this year, President Joe Biden issued an executive order stopping the government from processing asylum requests when Border Patrol’s daily number of encounters with “removable noncitizens” averages more than 2,500 over the course of a week. Harris has pledged to reduce that limit to 1,500 per week.\nBiden’s order mandates deportation for anyone denied asylum, which exposes them to criminal charges and a long-term ban on reentering the U.S. A month after the order, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported the lowest arrest levels since September 2020, with a 32% decrease in illegal crossings.\nDonald Trump often points to the 1950s-era immigration policies of then-President Dwight Eisenhower when discussing his plans for mass deportations of migrants.\n“He moved out 1.5 million people and brought them back to where they came from,” Trump said during a 2015 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\nOperation Wetback, Eisenhower’s military-style deportation operation targeting undocumented immigrants, whose name comes from an anti-Latino slur, has been an inspiration for the former president and current presidential candidate. “We’re rounding them up in a very humane way, a very nice way,” Trump told “60 Minutes” in 2015. When asked to elaborate, he referred to deportations under the Eisenhower administration.\nBut despite Trump’s sympathetic characterization of Operation Wetback, historians widely describe it as inhumane. It’s not just that the deportations also ensnared U.S. citizens. Historian Mae Ngai wrote that, in one roundup, 88 migrants died of sunstroke. Ngai also pointed to a congressional investigation comparing conditions on a boat used for deportations to an “eighteenth century slave ship.” Many who survived the voyage were displaced to unfamiliar locations within Mexico.\nHistorians also contest the number of people deported. After the 1954 initiative, officials reported over a million migrant apprehensions and expulsions. But researcher Kelly Lytle Hernández’s review of records shows apprehensions and expulsions fell closer to 250,000. Hernández argues that the initiative’s results, much touted by officials, were “less than they were portrayed to be.”\nStill, she wrote, that “does not render the summer of 1954 meaningless” because it directed greater public attention to the United States’ ongoing push to exert increasing control over its southern border.\nDuring Donald Trump’s presidential run in 2015, he told rallygoers, “They’re taking our jobs.” At the time, the amorphous “they” were people from Mexico. And the jobs were manufacturing jobs.\nThis election cycle, Trump still says “they” are taking our jobs. This time, the meaning of “they” has evolved to encompass anyone who enters the U.S. illegally, and the jobs are what Trump has repeatedly called “Black jobs” and union jobs, reflecting two groups of potential voters the former president is courting.\nWhen Trump’s original claims surfaced, the Urban Institute noted that while immigrants were increasingly filling low-skilled, low-wage jobs here, the types of jobs were different from jobs native-born Americans did. Immigrant workers, especially those with less education, worked as maids, house cleaners, cooks and in agricultural jobs. Similar native-born workers were cashiers, sales clerks and janitors. Zooming out, a 2007 National Bureau of Economic Research study found that the last large wave of immigration led to a dip in employment for Black people at lower skill levels and, perhaps, higher incarceration rates.\nIn a September speech, Trump said that “Kamala Harris’ border invasion is also crushing the jobs and wages of African American workers and Hispanic American workers, and also union members.” It’s true that Black workers have largely had lower wages and higher unemployment rates than White workers for decades, due to discrimination and other barriers. In recent years, Black workers and all low-wage workers have seen their paychecks grow, driven by state-level boosts to minimum wage, and wage growth for Black workers from 2019 to 2023 outpaced White workers.\nWhen it comes to union jobs, until the early 2000s, modern labor and manufacturing unions were staunchly anti-immigration but flipped that stance and supported amnesty policies. A widely circulated paper from the Cato Institute found a link between increases in immigration in general — whether legal or not — and a drop in unionization.\nBuilding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has been a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s immigration policy. He argues it’s effective at curbing illegal border crossings and that Mexico can cover the construction costs.\nBut the reality of building a wall at the border is more complex and its efficacy is dubious.\nAccording to a Government Accountability Office report, from 2017 through January 2021, the Trump administration added about 450 miles of barriers along the over-1,900-mile expanse. But 81% of the new structures replaced old ones. Government officials and others “noted that the barriers led to various impacts, including to cultural resources, water sources, and endangered species, and from erosion,” the report said. Also, because of the wall, people are more likely to try to cross at more dangerous points, contributing to more injuries and deaths.\nHistorically, many undocumented immigrants have come into the country legally and overstayed their visas, something a wall wouldn’t prevent. Additionally, people have found ways of circumventing the wall with tunnels and even a hidden rail system.\nA review by The Washington Post of Customs and Border Protection records found smuggling gangs had sawed through the wall 3,272 times from 2019 to 2021, usually cutting it “with inexpensive power tools widely available at retail hardware stores.”\nThus far, despite Trump’s promises, Mexico has not covered the nearly $20-million-per-mile expense of building a border wall.\nTrump\nThe people that came in, they’re eating the cats... They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.\nFact-check\nThere is no evidence to support claims that Haitian migrants are abducting, killing or eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio.\nDuring a recent presidential debate against Kamala Harris, Donald Trump made some shocking claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio.\n“They’re eating the dogs. The people that came in,” he said. “They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame.”\nTrump’s assertions about migrants eating pets drew further attention to other claims he and his vice presidential running mate, Sen. JD Vance, made: that migrants were in the U.S. illegally and that their presence had led to an increase in both crime and communicable diseases.\nIn a statement, Springfield spokesperson Karen Graves asserted “that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.”\nIn a post on Springfield’s website, city leaders refuted claims about the city’s Haitian population committing high levels of crime or being undocumented. An August report from health officials in Clark County, where Springfield is the largest city, showed that, excluding COVID, infectious disease case counts in the county remained relatively similar to a decade ago, well before Springfield’s influx of Haitian migrants began.\nPolice body camera video purportedly showing a Haitian woman eating a cat in Springfield was ultimately determined to be an incident involving a U.S.-born American woman from Canton, Ohio, a nearly three-hour drive from Springfield. The woman was arrested on animal cruelty charges and her attorney requested she undergo a mental health evaluation. A similar story falsely claiming a Haitian migrant had captured a pair of endangered geese has also been debunked.\nSimilar tales of Haitian migrants eating cats and dogs date back to the 1980s, when it became a popular insult against Haitian American youth in places like South Florida. Haitians are not alone in being targeted with these types of rumors. Other migrant populations, including people from Asia, have been accused of using pets for food.\nKamala Harris: A more positive tone, backs tough policies\nReporters also searched for and reviewed Vice President Kamala Harris’ public statements about immigration. Since the Factba.se database is focused on presidential candidates, data for Harris was limited to the time since she became the Democratic nominee in July, resulting in far fewer statements than what was available for Trump. What statements there were, though, indicated a more positive tone toward immigration and those seeking asylum in the U.S.\n“Innocent people.” “Children who had fled incredible violence.” “Displaced.” “Dreamers.” “Families.” “Muslim brothers and sisters.” “We’re all immigrants.”\nWhile Harris frequently references her record of prosecuting transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers, she also supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants: “Let’s bring all of these folks out of the shadows into the sunlight, and be true to the value that we have as a country.”\nStill, as vice president, she has expressed what experts call the party’s toughest approach to immigration in a generation. Though these measures fall far short of Trump’s extreme proposals like mass deportations, they include increased border enforcement, raising the bar for asylum, and expanding immigrant detention centers.\nHarris also often cites a tough border security bill she supported. The bill would have increased funding for border personnel, shut loopholes related to the asylum system, reduced the ability of migrants to temporarily enter the country, and given more discretion to the president to close down the border. Trump derailed the bill, in part because its passage would “make things much better for the opposing side.”\n“Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down,” said Harris.\nThe harm of repeating the false link between immigration and crime\nEven recognizing that a statement is false becomes more difficult when someone repeatedly hears false information.\nIn what cognitive scientists call the “illusory truth effect,” the more someone hears a statement, the more likely they are to believe it. A leading explanation for the phenomenon is that repetition makes information easier to process, making it seem more truthful. A 2021 study found that even as the greatest increase in perceived truth happened when subjects heard a piece of information a second time, subjects reported perceptions of truth increased with repetition up to nine times, and didn’t decrease with further repetition.\nFalsely linking immigration and crime has resulted in real policies. These include Secure Communities, a Department of Homeland Security Program that flags immigrants in local law enforcement custody for deportation, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which delegates some immigration enforcement tasks to local law enforcement.\n“None of them delivered the increased public safety that was promised,” said Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine. “Why? Because immigrant criminality was not a problem to begin with.”\nAccording to Kubrin, this focus shifts attention and resources from other public safety concerns such as mass shootings, violence against women and crimes with broad economic impact like fraud, corporate negligence and failure in regulation.\nDiscrediting election results\nClaims about immigration and crime can also strengthen attempts to discredit the results of the 2020 general election, and potentially, the 2024 general election.\nGov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia accepted the 2020 election results while raising concerns about noncitizen voting. While campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Youngkin highlighted his state’s purging of 6,303 names recorded as noncitizens from voter rolls. Election administrators say these registrations are often the result of errors when filling out paperwork and there are no records of noncitizens casting votes, and few instances of illegal voting in general. Youngkin’s registration removals now face a federal lawsuit.\nIn Texas, the right-wing group True the Vote has led a campaign to challenge voter registrations in the state, leaving election officials to process thousands of challenges while ensuring that voters aren’t improperly removed. While most of the Texas challenges are over the residence of the voter, the group behind the challenges has stoked claims of noncitizen voting.\nTrue the Vote, and other groups have also challenged registrations in states like Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The challenges are often based on name-matching software that has known issues with data quality and usability. This comes after activists pushed Republican-led states to leave the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a partnership of state election administrators that many regarded as the most rigorous system for helping states maintain up-to-date voter rolls.\nNormalizing hardline policies\nScholars have noted the cumulative effect of scapegoating immigration. Trump’s rhetoric helped shift the window of acceptable language, and policy, toward immigrants, making controversial practices like family separation or mass deportation more palatable, Laura Finley and Luigi Esposito, sociology and criminology professors at Barry University, wrote in a 2020 article.\nIn 2018, researchers reviewed available studies on policies that limited local cooperation with immigration enforcement, often referred to as “sanctuary” policies, and found there was little evidence that linked such policies, or immigration overall, to more crime. The researchers concluded that linking immigration and crime allows xenophobia and racism to be expressed under a “color-blind” concept of “rule-of-law.”\nPolls show more Americans favor fewer immigrants and more restrictions on immigration. A July Gallup poll found that 55% of respondents wanted a decrease in immigration. The poll, which has asked about immigration levels since 1965, has not found such a high level of those who wanted decreased immigration in nearly two decades. Other 2024 polls also show support for tougher border measures and that many Americans find immigration to be a key problem facing the country.\nThe same poll shows broad support for tougher immigration measures. A majority of those polled support temporarily halting migrants from seeking asylum at the Southwest border, hiring more border patrol agents and expanding walls at that border. Nearly half support deporting all immigrants in the country illegally. Despite this, large majorities also supported some path to citizenship for those in the country without authorization. Support for the restrictive measures rose from five years ago while support for pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants fell.\nPolling also shows support for tougher state immigration policy. An August poll found 63% of polled Arizona voters supported Proposition 314, a ballot measure before voters in the November 2024 election. The measure would make crossing the border with Mexico outside ports of entry a state crime, allowing state and local police to arrest migrants for the new crime.\nThe effects of repeating a lie\nBeyond Trump, there is a growing partisan divide around the way politicians talk about immigrants. In a 2022 article published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers describe how they analyzed over 200,000 U.S. congressional speeches and 5,000 presidential communications on immigration since the late 1800s. While there has been a general trend toward more positive language on immigration, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to use words like “crime,” “legality” and “threat” and to use dehumanizing language, the researchers found.\nPoliticians across parties and nations continue to reap rewards by blaming immigrants for social problems. “Politicians, from far-right populists to centrist liberals, use anti-immigrant narratives to deflect attention from deeper systematic issues such as affordable housing shortages, economic inequalities and failing public services,” Yvonne Su, director of the Centre for Refugee Studies at York University, wrote last month.\nFor Alex Piquero, a University of Miami criminology professor and former director of the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the body of research is “absolutely clear” that immigrants are not responsible for increases in crime.\nBut beliefs to the contrary are persistent. “What we have here is a mismatch between what the data show and what the political rhetoric says,“ Piquero said.\nTrump seems confident in the power of repetition. “I could get elected twice over the wall,” he said in a speech at CPAC in 2020. That didn’t happen that year. Will it happen in November?\nThis story was updated to omit the minimum number that some claims are repeated.\nCredits\nREPORTING AND WRITING\nAnna Flagg, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Geoff Hing\nFACT CHECKS\nAala Abdullahi, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Rachel Dissell, Daphne Duret, Shannon Heffernan, Ghazala Irshad, Jamiles Lartey, Doug Livingston, Ilica Mahajan, Ana Graciela Méndez, Joseph Neff, Aaron Sankin, Chris Vazquez\nDATA ANALYSIS\nRobert Flagg, Anna Flagg\nAUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT\nAshley Dye, Chris Vazquez, Kristin Bausch\nCOPY EDITING\nKelsey Adams, Lauren Hardie, Ghazala Irshad\nTRANSLATION\nAna Graciela Méndez, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón\nVIDEO EDITING\nAlex Gilwit, Celina Fang, Anna Flagg\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nAndrew Rodriguez Calderón\nPRODUCTION COORDINATION\nMara Corbett, Ruth Baldwin\nPARTNERSHIPS\nTerri Troncale, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón\nEDITING\nDavid Eads, Aaron Sankin, Susan Chira\nDISTRIBUTION PARTNERS\nDocumentedNY\nSpecial thanks to Moiz Syed for contributing design.\nLearn about how The Marshall Project is covering the 2024 election’s criminal justice and immigration issues across the U.S. and in our local news teams’ cities.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        (�/� Xt��F*o/�Hd��PY��Y�Pc�����0�M4o�\\)ЁD������\\�� �;l���a�,[e�=�<�w�2�2H�;�s��y��?(1h�!�G�c�s�2��=����Ҫ],���vY�a�UU�x����� ��D �8s��ϳq�8��ue��}��'�{�3ˮ˲��^k�ɲ얿C���6j�U��f]0k���%�2����3\\���ٽ���a���g\\����,���D���^ ��Qm��B�X(�öq�\\#�X$jB���o�q�Fb��g�hT\\C� Ƃ9.;W5���&[ueX��)�]X�a���y'��U�a���`02���2w]�r��,�,~��-��]����S���hnL�f��LzkL%0Pf=��i�����q����\\�{�jd�u�jk,�uج�JPz�,��9W����6�ьb�E��F��Vi��Y�������k1(�6��QK9FC�8l�Zwqw�(������Қ��j��.v�U�JT��b6�����ͺԉː�����Y��e���G}�Ǳ�VU�a���)��73lq����&����F1�aXV���6Zi�D���q�[4�E�lf�uYVU]z��*�,J M� ��r�(�Erc z�>��AE)@\"���{����`тx`(��\\����;Py����y����X��\\~T�����P���^~���\\��{�vp��䭽>v�7�){��u�1��T ���� ��g��xD���! _����h�[��ס�,��D$�.i�� Ϲ��tn� X�y��Ӽs��<;�H�w��z�<�\\�ٓ�KB�g��])�a�� ������P�����F�����8 �x��$↢�\"��eD�Г�PZ �0S�#����b�C�s3�P�_�������hz$�+2th�h��%��Q%�dFZ}�Lp�2 ����&�Q�ޡ�Qz����ʪU4���#��'$��������TˬvUX�iVQ��:WEov�]��W��c-+�2��ь^�~�R�,=�o����@PH���I<���{E\"�,���I�ܤ$��J��Gio��t����?�%6C�#�]z ���R�K\"QH`�e's)y,��� d��\\�@����&���6_�|JW*3�K2��Tf��KY�H���O�����.-@�_�Y���gP���oa �^A�_2Hۉ�Կ��,Jߛi�$1&��������. �.{o�Y�u��l�}'9[��Y�pƜ%uy�� p� gp� g$n��]� �7掠��y���O��c�B��d�eHQ��?�@��y4�S$��� �Ib�Ĕ����ʛ$q���H�2, �,��V�6˪̂�����ﺠ �X��BF�à~�ʨ1�\\���(��Q�X �&(ևQ !`.r�������sb�<�41������a��#����{ r�ml(8��^��|����>\\����h�Z�ǩ�?Om���z��A,?�Ce'CY�2H�_�;7|�?�d����y�\\�?� �ɥ(x�����]KLi�>� �D�`�9�g�&��y\\��Q\"� E��+}���p��<\"��?���<��h(�����&�d���҇� @��`(�6��� B��d�`�/�zS��ӑ�����{�?������ @-�� `�_����,�%,͒��V�jyԚ�Y�ei�h�2�Z7î��&�T6p�SbP�(O�� ԫN��je'��f/kʮ���Zu�`.���Z�k��T-沲u��dY�N���,MR�v�դUSE��:eԲ�v�dY�u�K���0l���9�ce�D-;a�SvM���ʪӭ��N���e]SU�����ɪ&jY��ϛ��ZS����:]����:իZ욪6]�~�ǼI��&���z3k�K�.��juʰ�f��]��鲪���y��^�Uo����D9>�zY�N�5Q�NXU��z3����d]����fMUU��6K�<��߸��+5H'*�ln�����$�obID�͗=e�|�o<���`��jY�f���0��Yo��f �����[i�9�`w�z(i��O��{�� R�a�l���o�˄4�O����IS�0�i�xw��B���\"M�ä／�6��ϣ��)ϱ�&�x�a�P_�1� w!�4}ˇ)��B�(i�&5��O�Q��#�P��P��cϖy�Z�T����7{�q�Y��ݏ�֍k �_T� �=����B%�Vi�1�I�w�(*M�c��)z��!_P�KSu����k�kQ���y5ǔ= �\"��io���=�2�uJ+Uf��������WK�������Uq��r���'q��ϳ�?�<�+���7~��� n �8����� vOd������ ��a�Gjo�C��٘�6y��;bJ�:DY�3������n�E�e6�>�%��}?Lz�ܼ_�Ɵ��.�H]�V�n9,�h�F��6o�����e�� Ǥ(S;sLR{}�_u/k�AL�D�]�8�¾��qy)��&s��ov�Q.�z��X�zS�ws����m����{pޞgz�����E�{�y����[�o wU����A���3�=�`���[�%y_���ԁ���h o/0I�1�j\\����q�k��:�?�)�+� �y'}.-ID�*�&�I�����{��L^u�$\"�����V��D70�;g��,�,k+W-*E�e��\\b�s\\�-z�}�9l}{(~�\\K���4��h��ڻ���(���S%�� �����N�V'��{m.���f�>�a�4[Y�a+�ǟ�����E-Jk�&���5���Ui®*M�U xa�C�R��2��dIS,�&j]ۋ��le'Z�����&�`�,+Md�R�d'�G�0�����M�2�K*���@�E���@�J\"�J\"�J\"�J\"�n�b�S�^�g�/���%��^3i��4eW �����(|Q�A]����8E�{ ���;{*�5���]���,r�IoٌЍ뺉�x~�a�/��.J��%4L;l�\\�d��G�Ð���[���z�eq��E���e���Z�[�v]�^�VK�f��V�bX�5/q�ʪ�@��R�S�Z�hŰz՚Y��W���0[i�e�Z5���eX��R{ь�J���qy����>�/����a/��ǿ�T6E�@��]���qi~�(f k2{�@��eq]�u��<ϧ�#X��y0H}�A�w�A��a+3�A��ըTuqQ�a���V��-8+c��Vթ��D xa�Ց�A��2����C�%���ͯ{�2�e����MQxn�UƟ���he`{���z���3��֒�Z&MU�������� E�b��:l��8�}�&��PX��#fF����F��@ր���8:Pe��h�j�x�6v��ୋ���)6�1]h?@Lt�|>'њ�[(Np[��/�H4D����H4Ft&)?�;F2�F�G牌�9�SBB4�\\(���D�CR>0ߚ�vR~�43�Rl\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The same was true for 110 House Republicans and 73 House Democrats.”\n“The vast majority of members of Congress are quite comfortable, financially , while many of their own constituents suffer from economic hardships,” said Sheila Krumholz at the Center For Responsive Politics. “Few Americans enjoy the same financial cushions maintained by most members of Congress — or the same access to market-altering information that could yield personal, financial gains.”\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Why is Congress a millionaires club?\nThe evidence is clear: Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Congress and don't believe their representatives share their priorities.\nThere's plenty of room for debate over whether Congress shares voters' priorities on political and policy issues. But when it comes to personal priorities, at least, voters have good reason to be skeptical of Congress. Most members of Congress simply don't share in the average American experience.\nNational unemployment has lingered above 8 percent for longer than 28 straight months. Congress, meanwhile, is a club that consists of 245 millionaires. Based on 2009 data, there are currently 66 in the Senate and 179 in the House (among current voting members). So while just 1 percent of Americans are millionaires, 66 percent of senators are millionaires, as are 41 percent of House members.\nEven the 2010 elections, with its promises to \"take our country back,\" produced a freshman class of senators with a median net worth of close to $4 million. The median net worth of freshman House members is more than half a million dollars, according the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based, non-partisan research group that tracks the effect of money on elections and public policy.\nMultiple factors contribute to this picture. It begins with campaigns that have become increasingly costly to run, making it all the more difficult for a person of modest income to run for office. National parties, looking for ways to bring down their own costs, actively recruit wealthy candidates.\nFull Series: United States of Influence\nAbout the series\nOnce in office, members of Congress enjoy access to connections and information they can use to increase their wealth, in ways that are unparalleled in the private sector. And once politicians leave office, their connections allow them to profit even further.\nHow wealthy is Congress?\nThe average estimated personal wealth of congressional members far exceeds the average American's wealth, according to Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. \"We're talking orders of magnitude,\" he said -- people with assets in the high six figures in the House and even higher in the Senate.\nThe Center regularly goes through the time-consuming process of reviewing congressional financial disclosure reports -- which are only filed on paper -- and publishing the information in a reader-friendly online format. Their work has shown that, besides a slight dip between 2007 and 2008, Congress' personal wealth has continued to rise.\n\"Most Americans are being represented by people who, any way you cut it, are in the elite of the financial elite,\" Levinthal said.\nCan only the wealthy run for Congress?\nAt the same time that Congress has become more of a millionaires' club, running a congressional campaign has become increasingly costly. There's no empirical evidence to suggest the two are related, but any political operative will tell you that not everyone can afford to run a campaign.\nAs a congressional candidate, \"every waking minute of every day is devoted to that campaign,\" said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. \"It requires an extraordinary amount of time, and it becomes difficult for a lot of people if you have a full-time job... When you've got a mortgage to pay and college tuition and braces to pay for, those kinds of day-to-day, real-life expenses come before putting six months into a campaign.\"\nThe amount of money a candidate needs gets larger with each election cycle. The average Senate campaign in 2010 cost $8,002,726, according to the Campaign Finance Institute, a non-partisan research group that analyzes fundraising by candidates and political parties. That compares to a cost of $5,827,139 in 2000 and $2,587,616 in 1990.\nSimilarly, the average 2010 House campaign cost $1,163,231, though it cost just under $700,000 in 2000 and just over $320,000 in 1990.\nFactors like incumbency play a huge role in the outcome of elections, but so does money: Since the 2000 election, candidates who spent more money in open seat House races won 86 percent of the time, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nIf a candidate doesn't put up the money himself, it's up to the political party backing him to do so. That gives the party organizations big incentive to recruit wealthy candidates.\n\"Self funders are attractive because it's one less candidate that a committee may have to make a huge investment in,\" said Doug Thornell, a Democratic strategist at SKDKnickerbocker who has worked for the campaign arms of Congress.\nHeye points out that money goes farther when it comes from the candidate directly, rather than through fundraisers.\n\"It's free money,\" he said, explaining that a candidate could write a $1 million check -- or spend $400,000, on things like fundraising events and direct mail, to raise $1 million.\nBut it turns out that candidates who finance their campaigns with their own personal wealth don't have the best record: During the 2010 election cycle, only 11 of 58 federal candidates who contributed at least $500,000 to their own campaigns prevailed on Election Day, the Center for Responsive Politics reported.\nStill, a wealthy candidate brings more to the table than his own checkbook -- he also brings his friends' checkbooks.\n\"Wealthy candidates who try to buy office with their own money tend to lose, but in order to set up a campaign, you have to know a lot of wealthy people and wealthy special interests -- and that's something that most of us are not privy to,\" said Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen.\nOnline fundraising has opened the door for candidates with fewer personal connections or resources, but the method hasn't completely proven itself yet. Even President Obama, whose 2008 campaign set the bar for online fundraising, raised nearly 50 percent of his money from donors giving $1,000 or more.\nMaking money in Congress\nOnce a candidate actually makes it into Congress, he's presented with new opportunities to increase his wealth -- some that are unmatched in the corporate world.\nThere are some ethics restrictions in place that limit the income congressional members can take in; for instance, they're not allowed to take in outside income (from sources like speaking fees) that amounts to more than 15 percent of their salary (the base pay for a member of Congress is $174,000).\nAnd like everyone else, members of Congress are subject to current insider trading laws. However, current insider trading laws do not apply to nonpublic information about current or upcoming congressional activity -- that's because members of Congress aren't technically obligated to keep that information confidential.\nCongressmen can get away with \"the type of insider trading that would send Martha Stewart to prison,\" Holman said. \"They go into hearings and confidential meetings with business interests, understanding new legislation is going to come out next week,\" and are free to trade on that information.\nSo, for instance, if a lawmaker learns an upcoming bill will grant a company a large government contract, which could boost that company's stock, he or she is free to buy that stock ahead of the bill's public introduction.\nA report released last month by four universities found that on average, stock portfolios held by House members from 1985 to 2001 beat the market average by approximately 6 percent annually. In 2004, the same group of professors found that the average stock portfolios held by members of the Senate beat the market average by about 10 percent.\nOfficially, House ethics rules say it would \"impractical or unreasonable\" to ask members of Congress to divest from industries over which they have jurisdiction, in part because a congressman may have been elected to represent a \"common interest\" he shares with his constituents. Thus, the rules say, if asked to divest in that industry, the member of Congress may be \"ineffective in representing the real interests of the constituents.\"\nCharles Schumer's Wall Street dance\nCorporations and Congress: A love affair (Video)\nAlienated nation: Americans complain of government disconnect\nCBS News Poll: America's thoughts on the government (Video)\nHouse ethics rules dictate that a lawmaker should \"never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making a private profit.\" House rules, however, are only enforced on an internal basis, and breaches of the rules are often lightly punished, if at all.\nDemocratic Reps. Louise Slaughter of New York and Tim Walz of Minnesota have introduced legislation to stop insider trading in Congress. But the bill, which has been introduced before, has never had more than 14 congressional sponsors.\nIt's not just the lawmakers themselves who exist in this ethical grey space -- sometimes a congressman's spouse or family member is in a position to profit from congressional actions, raising questions about how far to extend conflict of interest rules.\n\"We find that one really effective way for a corporation to do influence peddling without actually bribing a member of Congress is hire the spouse,\" Holman said. \"They'll hire these spouses at exorbitant salaries, and that money really goes directly into the pocket of the member.\"\nDemocratic Rep. Barney Frank recently acknowledged that in the 1990s he helped his then-partner get a lucrative job with Fannie Mae, though he said he did nothing wrong. New York Times reporter Gretchen Morgensen, who reported the detail in a new book, said in an interview that Fannie Mae \"rolled out the red carpet\" for Frank's partner to try to win him over, since he was a member of the Financial Services Committee.\nBefore Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh retired last year, he was the subject of scrutiny because his wife earned more than $1 million a year from sitting on various corporate boards in sectors like pharmaceuticals and insurance. Bayh said his wife's business interests didn't influence his votes on policy that impacted those sectors.\nOnce a member leaves office, even more opportunities for financial gain present themselves. According to Public Citizen, between 1998 and 2006, 43 percent of all members of Congress took lobbying jobs after leaving Congress, landing positions with an average annual salary of $2 million.\nWhile there's room for debate as to whether Congress should adopt more rules to avoid conflicts of interest, it's clear that the more transparency there is, the better. When it comes to the disclosure of lawmakers' personal assets, however, there is certainly room for improvement -- starting with putting the information online, said Levinthal of the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\"Digital scanners and the Internet have been a around for a while now,\" he said wryly. \"But there hasn't been any action. We would hope members of Congress would see the wisdom in making this information accessible to the public.\"\nThis article was updated to correct the percentage of donations President Obama received from donors giving $1,000 or more.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

They should start by focusing on the deal’s heavy water loophole, whereby Iran can store offshore in Oman heavy water it owns and controls in excess of the nuclear deal’s limits, awaiting its eventual sale. To date, if the stocks in Iran and Oman are counted together (a reasonable view since Iran owns and controls both stocks), Iran has far exceeded the nuclear deal’s stated limit of maintaining a stock of only 130 metric tons of heavy water. Yet, this loophole was sanctioned by the executive body of the Iran deal, the Joint Commission. Despite such generous treatment, Iran has even so twice violated the narrow limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water it can hold inside Iran since the deal started in January 2016. Iran should no longer be facilitated in its overproduction of nuclear-related heavy water. Oman would do the world a favor by halting its willingness to accept Iranian heavy water and send any back to Iran for downblending. The return of the heavy water and its blending down would dramatically signal to Iran that violations of the Iran deal are no longer going to be tolerated, or worse, facilitated. Moreover, any further overproduction should be seen by the United States as a violation of the deal. It should work to end the Oman loophole and mitigate damage caused by a U.S. purchase of Iranian heavy water.\nHeavy Water Limits Violated and then Facilitated\nHeavy water is controlled because of its link to Iran’s plutonium pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran’s last violation of the 130 metric ton cap of the stock in Iran occurred in November, despite Iran receiving a warning from the international inspectors charged with monitoring the nuclear deal. Sound enforcement of the Iran deal should have mandated that Iran blend down any excess heavy water to normal water or stop producing more. If an overage occurs, blending down heavy water is easy and safe, given that the material is non-radioactive and naturally present in tiny concentrations in water.\nIran recently announced that it had shipped 11 metric tons of heavy water to Oman for storage while it awaits a buyer and produces additional heavy water. This followed previous shipments to Oman and eventual sale of 70 metric tons of excess heavy water to the United States and Russia–heavy water that should have been blended down rather than sold internationally. Instead of focusing on adequately enforcing the Iran deal, the United States tolerated and minimized Iran’s violations and sought to legitimize its international standing as a commercial supplier of heavy water.\nAlthough the excess of heavy water held inside Iran above the cap has been relatively small in each case, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), showed that the second violation involved Iran deliberately exceeding the cap even after it notified Iran that it had reached the 130 metric ton limit. This deliberate flaunting of the cap raised questions about Iran’s commitment to the Iran deal and left the United States vulnerable to Iran exploiting other parts of it.\nSecret Decision\nThat Iran can send the heavy water it owns to Oman is a flaw in the Iran deal’s implementation. The Joint Commission, comprised of representatives of Iran and the E3/EU+3 (China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy), sculpted the work around of the heavy water cap prior to Implementation Day or shortly thereafter. Iran did not want to either stop production of heavy water or blend down its excess, and finding enough international buyers to take the heavy water at the time was not possible. Instead of saying no to Iran’s desire to “have its cake and eat it too,” the Obama administration endorsed a major concession. The Joint Commission ruled in secret during late 2015 or early 2016 to allow Iran to park its unsold heavy water in excess of the limit in Oman while Iran sought buyers, which ultimately turned out to be the United States and Russia, two countries that did not need the heavy water. The Joint Commission has not released publicly the details of this decision, like many others it has reached that affect the limitations and conditions of the deal. But the contents of the decision have inevitably emerged, some out of necessity as the heavy water in Oman was sold, particularly to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and some following investigations by the Wall Street Journal and our Institute. Other details emerged out of Iranian bravado about getting such a good arrangement, something it wanted to advertise to help it sell its heavy water. We have recently learned that although Iran has selectively revealed secret aspects of the Joint Commission heavy water decision that suits its needs, it is the major roadblock to the Joint Commission publicly revealing information about several of its decisions and interpretations of the deal.1 Given the overriding need for the transparency of the nuclear deal, and in particular Iran’s nuclear activities, this excessive secrecy is counterproductive.\nIn summary, Iran has been able to exploit this loophole to export a total of 81 metric tons of heavy water to Oman (see table below). Without this loophole, Iran would have needed to halt production of or blend down by now almost all of this heavy water, or about 70-75 metric tons. The rest would have required eventual blend down, if Iran continues to produce heavy water.\n|\n|||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Heavy Water Stock | Amount (metric tons) | ||\n| In Iran | In Iran and Oman | ||\n| Prior to Implementation Day(ID) | about 180.9 | about 180.9 (none in Oman) | |\n| Shipped out before or right after ID | -50 | ||\n| As of February 17, 2016 | 130.9 | 180.9 | |\n| Shipped out on February 24, 2016 | -20 | ||\n|\nSubtotal |\n110.9\n|\n180.9\n|\n|\n| As of May 9, 2016 | 116.7 | 186.7 | |\n| As of August 30, 2016 | 126.5 | 164.5 (with U.S. shipment) | |\n| As of November 8, 2016 | 130.1 | 130.1-168.1 (sent to Russia?) | |\n| Shipped to Oman in Nov/Dec 2016 | -11 | ||\n| Subtotal |\n119.1+?\n|\n130.1+?

This amount, which should be a few to several metric tons, would reduce the value of 180.9 metric tons in stock prior to Implementation Day, which was January 16, 2016.\n3) Production from February 17, 2016 to November 8, 2016: 19.8 metric tons, or a daily average rate of 0.075 metric tons per day over 264 days. Extrapolating this daily average to a yearly production of 365 days, or an annualized production rate, gives 27.4 metric tons per year (365*0.075). The production is occurring in two lines at the Arak heavy water production plant, where each line has achieved an average annualized rate of 13.7 metric tons per year. Prior to Implementation Day, the IAEA stated that the Arak plant had a design capacity of 16 metric tons of nuclear-grade heavy water per year, apparently unaware of the second production line. Based on the IAEA value, the average capacity factor of one line is estimated at 85.5 percent (13.7/16).\nUneconomic and Strategically Unwise U.S. Policy\nOther than getting heavy water out of Oman and subsidizing and helping legitimize Iran’s nuclear program, two goals arguably not in U.S. interests, the United States’ purchase of Iran’s heavy water makes no sense economically. The United States faced no imminent shortage of heavy water. Canada, North America’s main supplier, was ready and able to provide heavy water.\nWhen the DOE purchase of Iranian heavy water emerged publicly last spring, the DOE and then the State Department issued misleading statements about why the United States bought the heavy water. They said that DOE had to buy Iranian heavy water for one of its facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee because the normal expected supply from Canada had been disrupted. What they did not state is that it was the United States that disrupted the existing Canadian supply by cancelling the procurement process won fairly by a Canadian company. In a procurement process started in 2014, a DOE Oak Ridge facility awarded the contract to this Canadian company in late 2015 to supply six metric tons of heavy water. This process was terminated suddenly by Oak Ridge in late December 2015 or early January 2016 when Oak Ridge decided to use Iranian heavy water instead.\nAlthough a DOE official many months later apologized to the Canadian company, it received no public acknowledgement of its sacrifice for a supposedly broader good or any compensation for the lost business with the Oak Ridge facility. This company had to undertake a considerable amount of testing and development to show how it would meet the strict specifications of Oak Ridge’s procurement award. In fact, based on the unusual strictness of the specifications on impurities as well as extremely low conductivity in the heavy water, legitimate doubts remain about whether the Iranian heavy water did in fact meet those specifications. Or, was the DOE required to further purify the Iranian heavy water to meet the strict specifications for the Oak Ridge facility? This would raise additional questions about the fairness of DOE’s actions in suddenly rejecting the Canadian company’s well-tested heavy water.\nBased on an analysis of the DOE’s purchase price of the heavy water and Iran’s heavy water plant, Iran sold its heavy water to the United States at below its cost to produce the heavy water and the market price internationally. The U.S. purchase of Iran’s heavy water unfairly helped Iran enter the international market and disrupted the existing commercial market.\nTo make matters worse, the DOE purchase damaged the prospects for a reliable North American heavy water supply chain that the Canadian company is developing. Since the DOE needed only six metric tons for Oak Ridge out of its total purchase of 32 metric tons, it announced that the rest, or 26 metric tons, was to be sold on the commercial market, perhaps at below market value if DOE passes along the relatively low price paid to Iran. The sudden appearance of this heavy water disrupted needed investment in a reliable long term production capability of heavy water for both the U.S. government and private industry. While the North American supply of heavy water is plentiful today, the medium and long term prospects are bleak since there has not been significant heavy water production in North America for well over a decade. The existing North American stockpile is shrinking and supplies from India, the other major supplier, are needed for India’s own domestic requirements. As a result, investment is needed for new production capability in North America, which could end up being located in the United States. The DOE purchase and sale of Iranian heavy water has threatened the prospects of avoiding a shortage in the future.\nU.S. officials told one of us that the DOE would be very unlikely to buy any more heavy water from Iran. However, according to a person briefed by the administration, the Obama administration may be willing to grant special licenses under the Iran deal to U.S. companies so that they can buy heavy water directly from Iran.\nThe U.S. purchase of heavy water and subsequent actions turned the Obama administration into a promoter and legitimizer of Iran’s heavy water sales. The administration should call this sale what it is – a sweetener for Iran. The arrangement has only encouraged Iran to overproduce heavy water for sale and seek legitimacy as a nuclear supplier. Iran subsequently offered heavy water for sale through the IAEA by circulating a letter dated November 7, 2016 offering two grades of heavy water. According to Iranian officials, Iran is now seeking to sell about 20 metric tons of heavy water per year, which is most of its annual production at the Arak heavy water production plant (see table).\nIllegitimate Nuclear Supplier\nBut Iran has not taken the necessary actions to become a legitimate nuclear supplier. Simply put, it does not abide by international rules. It does not have an export control system meeting international standards, and under the Iran deal, it has only committed that it “intends” to create such a system for nuclear materials, equipment, and technology. The Iran nuclear deal does not contain a deadline for creating such a control system. More concerning, Iranian officials continually boast of Iran’s prowess at violating other countries’ sanctions and export control laws to obtain banned goods for its nuclear, missile, and military programs. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated on August 30, 2014, “Of course we bypass sanctions. We are proud that we bypass sanctions.” After the negotiation of the Iran deal, the Iranian Majlis Special Commission tasked with approving the nuclear deal stated in an October 4, 2015 report: “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has said that it does not intend to implement sections of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 that compromise defense and national security,” a clear reference to not abiding by conventional arms and missile bans on imports to Iran.\nConsistent with Iran’s commitment to illegal overseas commodity trafficking, the heavy water Iran has been sending to Oman has been produced in the illegally outfitted Arak heavy water production plant. Its recent increased heavy water production rate was likely achieved by importing goods in violation of sanctions and export control laws. Some of these goods were seized by South Korea in 2010 and discussed in a report by the UN Panel of Experts on Iran. Analysis by experts in another government contacted by the Institute showed that the quantity seized implied that Iran intended to double the size of its heavy water plant, a goal Iran subsequently achieved. Its success in increasing the plant’s output indicates that Iran’s illicit procurements for this plant continued after 2010. This example is just one of many that show that Iran remains a serial criminal state undeserving of any stamp of legitimacy from the United States.\nRecommendations\nThe Trump administration should announce as soon as possible that it will neither buy more heavy water from Iran nor grant any licenses under the Iran deal for U.S. private companies to buy any. This policy was earlier encapsulated in a bill, H.R. 5119, that passed the House of Representatives in July 2016.\nThe new administration should also seek to end the Oman heavy water loophole. A way to do this would be for the United States to indicate to its Joint Commission partners that it views retransfers of heavy water from Oman to another country as subject to the Procurement Working Group (PWG) requirement that the country, in this case Oman, must submit a proposal for approval.2 The PWG is a Joint Commission body set up at the United Nations to administer and approve or not approve proposals by countries seeking to participate in or permit certain transfers of nuclear or nuclear dual-use goods and technology, or engage in nuclear or nuclear-related transactions for the benefit of Iran. Heavy water is a nuclear good on Part 1 of the Nuclear Suppliers Group list, and the onward transfer of Iranian heavy water by Oman clearly benefits Iran, a key condition listed in the nuclear deal, even though the heavy water originated in Iran. As a result, under the nuclear deal, Iranian heavy water transfers from Oman to a foreign customer should require a proposal from Oman subject to PWG review. The Trump administration should next make clear that it will block at the PWG any transfers of Iranian heavy water from Oman to a foreign customer, and that Oman’s lack of an official proposal would violate the Iran deal’s provisions.\nThe Iran deal should be strengthened so that the IAEA regularly re-verifies the design of the Arak heavy water production plant. A goal would be to ensure that no new equipment is installed and that additional capacity is not commissioned. The IAEA should also regularly monitor any heavy water in Oman until it is removed.\nA policy of the United States should also be to block at the Procurement Working Group any procurements of goods, materials, or technology for use in producing heavy water. In particular, Iran should not be able to expand its production of heavy water. The United States should also re-establish vigorous investigations and prosecutions aimed at thwarting Iran’s repeated violations of U.S. and other countries’ export control laws.\nLastly, instead of further disrupting the North American market and subsidizing Iran, the United States should work to minimize the damage of its heavy water purchase. One useful mitigating step would be for the DOE to place any remaining heavy water of the original 32 metric tons into a strategic reserve. This strategic reserve would act as a key “last resort” supply, reducing the chances of a shortfall in the future and limiting the DOE’s disruption of the private market.\nConclusion\nThe Iran nuclear deal requires considerable strengthening and in some areas even renegotiation. However, that will take time. The new administration needs to act quickly to rectify a glaring weakness created in part by the current administration that facilitates on-going Iranian violations via sending heavy water to Oman for eventual sale. It should end the Oman loophole and undo damage wrought by this loophole at home. Quick action would also send an early signal that the new administration intends to rigorously enforce the nuclear deal.\nSources\n1.The Iran deal states that the Joint Commission can release information if it decides to do so (see Annex IV to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)). Because the JCPOA states in general that the Joint Commission makes decisions by consensus, the Joint Commission has taken the position that releasing information about its decisions also requires consensus. Despite overwhelming support for the release of such information among the members of the Joint Commission, Iran has so far blocked consensus on releasing a set of about a half dozen explanatory notes or clarifications of how certain paragraphs of the JCPOA are interpreted. Some of the clarifications and interpretations apparently involve changes in the limitations and conditions of the deal; others involve exemptions to nuclear constraints. For more on this issue, see a forthcoming report by our Institute on Joint Commission secrecy.↩2.Under 6.1. of annex IV of the JCPOA, with the purpose of establishing a procurement channel, the Joint Commission will, except as otherwise provided by the United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing this JCPOA, review and decide on proposals by states seeking to engage in: 6.1.1. the supply, sale or transfer directly or indirectly from their territories, or by their nationals or using their flag vessels or aircraft to, or for the use in or benefit of, Iran, and whether or not originating in their territories, of all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology set out in INFCIRC/254/Rev.12/Part 1. Since heavy water in amounts greater than 0.2 metric tons is subject to Part 1 and Iran benefits from the retransfer of its heavy water from Oman to a customer, this provision should require Oman to submit a proposal to the PWG for each heavy water shipment from its territory to an overseas customer.↩\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

This investment includes the unanimous adoption of the more than $104 billion 10-year transportation plan by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to improve safety, address congestion and connectivity, and preserve roadways for Texas drivers. It also includes over $43 billion for development and routine maintenance. This is a $5.6 billion increase in total investment from the previous year.\n“Strengthening our roadways and transportation infrastructure is critical for Texas to remain the Best State for Business in the nation,” said Governor Abbott. “With the adoption of this record-breaking $148 billion transportation investment, Texas will continue to meet the needs of Texans in rural, urban, and suburban communities while also improving roadway congestion and safety. People come to Texas because we provide the freedom and opportunity they can’t find anywhere else, and that’s why we’re investing in the future of Texas roads. Projects like this will ensure our products and people can move quickly to keep the Texas economy booming. Together, we are building a bigger, better Texas for years to come.”\n“With a booming population and economy, TxDOT is meeting the moment with a record investment in our state roadway system to ensure Texas remains the preferred destination for families and businesses,” said Texas Transportation Commission Chairman J. Bruce Bugg, Jr. “Thanks to the vision of Governor Greg Abbott and the Texas Legislature, this historic transportation investment focusing on safety and congestion relief will help meet the needs of Texans for years to come.”\n“This investment impacts communities across the state, with projects that can help save lives and improve connectivity,” said TxDOT Executive Director Marc Williams. “TxDOT has a record amount of active construction projects this year, and this will help continue that work of moving people and goods safely and efficiently in our rural, urban and metropolitan areas.”\nMany of the projects in the 2025 Unified Transportation Program (UTP) are roadway segments identified on Texas’ 100 Most Congested Roadways list. Texas Clear Lanes congestion-relief projects will see an increase in funding of $1.9 billion, supporting the $75.8 billion total investment for completed, under-construction, and planned non-tolled projects since 2015. It also includes around a $17.3 billion investment in safety and an additional $1.7 billion in funding for rural corridors and key roadways in economic hubs. A full breakdown is available online.\nThe adoption of the 2025 UTP comes after an extensive public-involvement process to allow all Texans to voice their opinions on the projects in their communities. Public comments, collected via a public hearing and online, phone, email, and other formats were considered before the Texas Transportation Commission approved the UTP.\nThe UTP is a planning document that authorizes highway projects for development and construction. In addition to highway projects, the UTP also includes investments in public transportation, maritime, aviation, and rail. Projects are selected based on how effective they are in addressing areas such as pavement condition, safety, capacity and rural connectivity.\nFor more information on the UTP projects is available here.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Two Roads, One Mission\nHOUSTON - Today, Texas Transportation Commissioner Steve Alvis and TxDOT Executive Director Marc Williams joined local officials, community leaders, and TxDOT staff to celebrate the Houston District’s completion of the I-610 Cambridge Project and the I-10 Brookshire Project. These two projects bring the total number of Texas Clear Lanes initiatives completed in Houston to four. The ceremonies took place in Houston and Brookshire, respectively.\nI-610 Cambridge Project\nOn Tuesday morning, July 1, Commissioner Alvis and Executive Director Williams participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony beneath the direct connector from the I-610 South Eastbound to SH 288 Southbound, marking the completion of the I-610 South Cambridge project. This effort represents a $117 million investment in Houston’s mobility and quality of life.\nThe project involved reconstructing the main lanes and frontage roads of I-610 between Cambridge Street and Scott Street, as well as building a new freeway overpass at Cambridge and eight direct-connector ramps that connect smoothly to and from SH 288 and the SH 288 Express Toll Lane system.\n“Getting Texans moving faster and safer is the goal. As we look to the future, TxDOT remains committed to addressing the challenges of traffic congestion and economic vitality to ensure that Texas continues to lead the way in transportation innovation,” said Commissioner Steven Alvis.\nTexas House of Representatives Lauren Simmons praised area residents for their patience during the project, adding, “This is a shining example of government working for the people. Whether going to work or picking up kids on more efficiently flowing highways, this is how you get your tax dollars back.”\n“These improvements create a continuous, high-speed corridor that connects the Texas Medical Center, Museum District, Sunnyside, Historic Third Ward, NRG Park, and nearby universities and neighborhoods,” said Marc Williams, TxDOT Executive Director.\nCity of Houston Mayor Pro-Tem Martha Castex-Tatum said, “This section of the 610 South Loop and its intersection with SH 288 is one of the busiest in the city. Relieving congestion saves money, helps the environment, and frees up valuable time that busy Houstonians need.”\nTxDOT Houston District Engineer Glenn Allbritton echoed this commitment, noting, “It’s not just a task of maintaining existing roadways, whether through farmland surrounding Houston or through the middle of the nation’s fourth-largest city. So, our challenge is always asking how we can eliminate a bottleneck or prevent a bottleneck from developing.\"\nThis project provides crucial access between Houston and southern communities, including Pearland, Manvel, Lake Jackson, and West Columbia.\nThe benefits are immediate for drivers and transit operators, as it provides shorter peak-hour delays, smoother emergency vehicle access to the Medical Center, more reliable travel times to major event venues such as the NRG Complex, and improved freight flow to and from the Port of Houston.\nEnhancing traffic circulation reduces fuel consumption and emissions, supporting Houston’s broader sustainability goals.\nI-10 Brookshire Project\nOn the afternoon of Tuesday, July 1, Commissioner Alvis and Director Williams joined the Mayor of Brookshire, Texas, to cut the ribbon on the completion of the Interstate 10 Brookshire project, from FM 359 to the Brazos River. “In the Houston District, we’ve completed $461 million worth of Texas Clear Lanes projects, have over $2 billion under construction, and have more than $17 billion planned.\nBy adding main lanes, frontage roads, and rebuilding bridges over the Brazos River, we are making travel times safer and much more efficient for industry and everyday highway users,” said Commissioner Alvis. I-10 also serves as a major evacuation route for hurricanes. This project will help to increase flow capacity for traffic moving in and out of the metro area. TxDOT is meeting the needs of Texas, which has grown to over 30 million residents.\nBrookshire’s Mayor, Robert Richards, said, “Completion of this project comes at an important time for our growing community. The Houston Association of Realtors recently highlighted Brookshire’s growth as one of the Hottest Communities. So, this TxDOT project is a welcome improvement for our rapidly expanding area. Brookshire looks forward to continuing its strong partnership with TxDOT to support Texas’s growth and prosperity.”\nDarrin Willer, Vice Chair of the Transportation Advocacy Group (TAG), mentioned the importance of regional collaboration: “At Houston Transportation Advocacy Group, we are dedicated to creating a healthy state of mobility in the Houston region by advocating for multi-modal transportation infrastructure funding through collaboration with local, state, and federal leadership.”\nDirector Williams noted, “The population growth and real estate development west of Houston in Katy and beyond has been very rapid, causing congestion on I-10. This project provides additional capacity by widening the freeway to six lanes in some sections and eight in others. It has also improved overpasses and replaced outdated bridges over the Brazos River.” The I-10 Brookshire Project was completed at a cost of just over $141 million.\nAbout the Texas Clear Lane Project\nIn 2015, Governor Greg Abbott called upon the Texas Transportation Commission to identify and address the state’s most congested chokepoints in the five major metropolitan areas of Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Fort Worth, and Dallas. In response, the Texas Clear Lanes program was created.\nTexas Clear Lanes is a statewide congestion-relief initiative dedicated to funding non-tolled roadway projects that improve safety, reduce delays, and enhance mobility for commuters and freight carriers alike. By prioritizing the state’s most heavily traveled corridors, the program channels billions of dollars in state and federal transportation funds into projects that make a measurable difference in daily life across Texas.\nThis investment includes the adoption of TxDOT’s more than $104 billion Ten-Year Transportation Plan to improve safety, address congestion and connectivity, and preserve roadways for Texas drivers. The program also includes $44 billion for development and routine maintenance throughout the state.\nTexas currently has $60 billion in projects under active construction, more than triple the number underway just ten years ago. This surge in investment responds directly to Texas’s rapid population growth and the escalating costs of gridlock, which today amount to more than $224 billion nationwide each year.\nThrough collaboration with local transportation leaders and data-driven project selection, Texas Clear Lanes continues to address the ripple effects of congestion, lost productivity, wasted fuel, diminished air quality, and reduced quality of life, while keeping Texas’s economy strong and its communities connected.\nVisit the Texas Clear Lanes website to learn more about the program.\nVisit TxDOT Electronic Media Kit for videos and photos of both ceremonies.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Although the federal government claims the power to conduct certain kinds of warrantless stops within 100 miles of the U.S. border, important Fourth Amendment protections still apply.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The Problem\n-\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects Americans from random and arbitrary stops and searches.\n- According to the government, however, these basic constitutional principles do not apply fully at our borders. For example, at border crossings (also called \"ports of entry\"), federal authorities do not need a warrant or even suspicion of wrongdoing to justify conducting what courts have called a \"routine search,\" such as searching luggage or a vehicle.\n- Even in places far removed from the border, deep into the interior of the country, immigration officials enjoy broad—though not limitless—powers. Specifically, federal regulations give U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authority to operate within 100 miles of any U.S. \"external boundary.\"\n- In this 100-mile zone, Border Patrol agents have certain additional authorities. For instance, Border Patrol can operate immigration checkpoints.\n- Border Patrol, nevertheless, cannot pull anyone over without \"reasonable suspicion\" of an immigration violation or crime (reasonable suspicion is more than just a \"hunch\"). Similarly, Border Patrol cannot search vehicles in the 100-mile zone without a warrant or \"probable cause\" (a reasonable belief, based on the circumstances, that an immigration violation or crime has likely occurred).\n- In practice, Border Patrol agents routinely ignore or misunderstand the limits of their legal authority in the course of individual stops, resulting in violations of the constitutional rights of innocent people. These problems are compounded by inadequate training for Border Patrol agents, a lack of oversight by CBP and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the consistent failure of CBP to hold agents accountable for abuse. No matter what CBP officers and Border Patrol agents think, our Constitution applies throughout the United States, including within this “100-mile border zone.”\nMuch of U.S. Population Affected\n- Many people think that border-related policies only impact people living in border towns like El Paso or San Diego. The reality is that Border Patrol's interior enforcement operations encroach deep into and across the United States, affecting the majority of Americans.\n- Roughly two-thirds of the United States' population lives within the 100-mile zone—that is, within 100 miles of a U.S. land or coastal border. That's about 200 million people.\n- Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont lie entirely or almost entirely within this area.\n- Nine of the ten largest U.S. metropolitan areas, as determined by the 2010 Census, also fall within this zone: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego and San Jose.\nOutdated Legal Authority and Lack of Oversight\n- The regulations establishing the 100-mile border zone were adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1953—without any public comments or debate. At the time, there were fewer than 1,100 Border Patrol agents nationwide; today, there are over 21,000.\n- The Border Patrol often ignores this regulation and, aside from limiting interior checkpoint locations to within the 100-mile zone, rejects any geographic limitation on agents' authority. At least two federal circuit courts condone Border Patrol operations outside the 100-mile zone, federal regulations and Supreme Court precedent notwithstanding.\n- Federal border agents are stopping, interrogating, and searching Americans on an everyday basis with absolutely no suspicion of wrongdoing, and often in ways that our Constitution does not permit.\n- For example, Border Patrol, according to news reports, operates approximately 170 interior checkpoints throughout the country (the actual number in operation at any given time is not publicly known). The ACLU believes that these checkpoints amount to dragnet, suspicionless stops that cannot be reconciled with Fourth Amendment protections. The Supreme Court has upheld the use of immigration checkpoints, but only insofar as the stops consist only of a brief and limited inquiry into residence status. Checkpoints cannot be primarily used for drug-search or general law enforcement efforts. In practice, however, Border Patrol agents often do not limit themselves to brief immigration inquiries and regularly conduct criminal investigations and illegal searches at checkpoints. The Border Patrol also frequently pulls over motorists in \"roving patrol\" stops, often without any suspicion that an immigration violation has occurred.\n- The ACLU has documented numerous cases of abuse by Border Patrol and filed lawsuits to obtain more information about the agency's practices. Given Border Patrol's lack of transparency, and in the absence of any meaningful oversight, there is still much that we don't know about the full extent and impact of these interior \"border enforcement\" operations.\nPart of a Broader Problem\n- The spread of border-related powers inland is inseparable from the broader expansion of government intrusion in the lives of ordinary Americans. For example, CBP claims the authority to conduct suspicionless searches of travelers' electronic devices—such as laptops and cell phones—at ports of entry, including international arrivals at airports. These searches are particularly invasive as a result of the wealth of personal information stored on such devices. At least one circuit court has held that federal officers must have at least \"reasonable suspicion\" prior to conducting such searches and recent Supreme Court precedent seems to support that view.\n- These practices also coincide with the spread of numerous border technologies, including watch list and database systems (such as the Automated Targeting System traveler risk assessment program), advanced identification and tracking systems (including electronic passports), and intrusive technological schemes such as the \"virtual border fence\" and unmanned aerial vehicles (aka \"drone aircraft\"). With many of these technologies in the hands of private companies, there are powerful financial incentives for the continued \"militarization\" of the border zone.\n- The expansion of government power both at and near the border is part of a trend toward expanding police and national security powers without regard to the effect of such expansion on our most fundamental and treasured Constitutional rights. The federal government's dragnet approach to law enforcement and national security is one that is increasingly turning us all into suspects. If Americans do not continue to challenge the expansion of federal power over the individual, we risk forfeiting the fundamental rights and freedoms that we inherited—including the right to simply go about our business free from government interference, harassment and abuse.\nRead the ACLU factsheet on Custom and Border Protection's 100-mile zone\nRelated Issues\nRelated Documents\nJun 21, 2018\nKnow Your Rights: In the 100-Mile Border Zone\nJun 21, 2018\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” which, among many other actions,orders a significant expansion of expedited removal in the United States. On January 21, the Trump administration published a Notice in the Federal Register implementing the policy – which was created by Congress in 1996 as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) – to its full extent.\nUnder the expanded expedited removal policy, undocumented immigrants (1) anywhere in the United States, (2) who cannot prove they have resided in the U.S. for at least two years will be subject to an expedited deportation process. The expedited removal guidelines apply to undocumented immigrants who have not been admitted to the U.S. This usually includes individuals who entered between Ports of Entry (i.e. unlawfully), but may also include those who were paroled into the U.S. and have their parole status revoked.\nUnder existing law, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary can expand expedited removal without formal notice and comment rulemaking. However, as a matter of discretion, DHS issued the Notice in the Federal Register. The expanded expedited removal guidelines took effect immediately on January 21, 2025 and remain in place.\nWhat is expedited removal?\nExpedited removal is a procedure that allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to rapidly deport noncitizens who are undocumented or who have committed misrepresentation or fraud. Under expedited removal processes, certain noncitizens are deported in as little as a single day without an immigration court hearing or other appearance before an immigration judge.\nBefore President Trump expanded the program in his first term, regulations from 2004 – put in place under the George W. Bush administration – limited expedited removal to noncitizens entering the U.S. without authorization who were apprehended (1) within two weeks of their arrival in the U.S. and (2) within 100 miles of a U.S. land border. The guidelines set forth in 2019 under the first Trump administration expanded the temporal restriction to its full extent of two years and removed the geographic restriction. This expanded expedited removal policy was subsequently rescinded by the Biden administration in March 2022. The Trump administration’s most recent notice has rescinded the Biden administration changes and effectively reverted to the guidelines set forth in 2019.\nWhat is expanded expedited removal?\nThe Trump administration in January 2025 expanded expedited removal to its full extent. The new, expanded policy now applies to undocumented persons who:\n- Are apprehended anywhere in the U.S.\n- Cannot prove they have resided in the U.S. for at least two years; and,\n- Entered the U.S. between Ports of Entry (POEs) or were paroled into the U.S. and have their parole status revoked.\nThe expanded expedited removal guidelines do not apply to visa overstayers, though these individuals must be able to show evidence that they were entered the U.S. with a visa. As noted above, people placed in expedited removal may be deported in as little as a single day without an immigration court hearing or other appearance before an immigration judge.\nThose who are subject to expedited removal but claim fear of persecution or express an intention to apply for asylum should still receive a credible fear interview before an asylum officer. If they are determined to have a credible fear of persecution, they are removed from the expedited removal process.\nThe Trump administration’s expanded expedited removal policy has already been subject to litigation. The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C, argues that expedited removal violates the constitutional right to due process and asks that expedited removal be restricted to the limits instituted by the Biden administration.\nExpanded expedited removal & parole\nThe Biden administration implemented several humanitarian parole programs that admitted close to two million individuals into the U.S. These programs included the use of the CBP One mobile application at the U.S.-Mexico border (936,500 individuals), the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) humanitarian parole program (531,690 individuals), Operation Allies Welcome for Afghan allies following the fall of Kabul in August 2021 (70,000 individuals), and the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) parole program following the Russian invasion of Ukraine (240,000 individuals). The Trump administration moved to cancel parole statuses for those admitted under CBP One and the CHNV humanitarian parole program. However, those broad cancellations of parole status are facing legal challenges.\nDHS published a memo on January 23, 2025 providing guidance on how to use expedited removal for people who were lawfully paroled into the country. The memo directs ICE officers and CBP agents to “[t]ake all steps necessary to review…and consider” whether to place an individual with parole in expedited removal, including using the officer’s “enforcement discretion” to terminate that person’s active parole status. This directive effectively permits immigration officers to individually revoke a person’s parole status and place them in expedited removal – that is, if the person qualifies for expedited removal.\nWhile visa overstayers are not subject to expedited removal, those who enter the U.S. through parole within the last two years may be subject to expedited removal once their parole status ends. This distinction arises because parole is a humanitarian benefit that permits noncitizens to remain in the U.S. if they are applying for admission but do not have a legal basis for that admission. When a parole status ends or is revoked, individuals revert back to their prior immigration status – typically as applicants for admission and, since they are already in the U.S., effectively undocumented immigrants. Because inadmissibility is a prerequisite for receiving humanitarian parole and parolees revert to their prior immigration status upon the termination of their parole status, most former parolees would be considered subject to expedited removal if they have been in the U.S. for less than two years. A few exceptions are possible, including obtaining Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or applying for asylum.\nBackground\nExpedited removal under the first Trump administration\nPresident Trump issued an executive order titled “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements” upon taking office in January 2017, calling on the DHS Secretary to use their discretion to expand the use of expedited removal to its full extent. On July 23, 2019, DHS issued the notice announcing the expanded expedited removal guidelines.\nAt the time, DHS claimed that expanding expedited removal “will strengthen national security, diminish the number of illegal entries, and otherwise ensure the prompt removal of aliens apprehended in the United States,” reducing incentives for unlawful entry. DHS further contended that the policy would address “the ongoing crisis at the southern border” and help reduce backlogs in the immigration courts.\nExpedited removal under the Biden administration\nIn March 2022, the Biden administration officially rescinded the first Trump administration’s 2019 notice on expanded expedited removal, returning to the policy that was set before 2019. During most of the Biden administration, expedited removal only applied to those who had entered within the previous 14 days and were encountered within 100 miles of the Canadian or Mexican land borders with the U.S.\nThe Biden administration pursued expedited removal in other formats. In 2023, the administration authorized the Family Expedited Removal Management (FERM) program, which processed migrant families for removal without detention. The FERM program placed families in a 30-day process, in which families would travel from the U.S.-Mexico border to their destination in the U.S., find an attorney, and prepare for and participate in initial protection screenings. While this program was an alternative to housing families in immigration detention facilities, there were concerns about violations of due process due to the 30-day timeline. Families seeking asylum were put through a speedy adjudication process and then rapidly deported if they failed it.\nThe Biden administration also utilized expedited removal following the end of Title 42 in May 2023, when the number of people entering expedited removal proceedings increased to more than 20,000 migrants every month.\nImpact of expanded expedited removal\nMore people will face expedited removal\nThe regulation – combined with the revocation of parole statuses – potentially exposes hundreds of thousands of additional people to expedited removal, limiting their access to immigration hearings and to due process generally. The absence of an immigration court hearing with limited time to obtain counsel prior to deportation is almost certain to lead to people being erroneously deported. This goes counter to our tradition of upholding and protecting due process.\nPreviously the existence of temporal and geographic restrictions on expedited removal limited the likelihood of improper deportations. Removing these restrictions will inevitably have an adverse impact on those additional people who now could face erroneous removal.\nErroneous deportations will occur\nThere almost certainly will be instances of people with valid asylum claims or other removal defenses being deported without being able to make their case to an immigration judge. In addition, this dramatic expansion of expedited removal is almost certain to sweep up individuals with legal status, lawful permanent residents (LPRs), and even potentially U.S. citizens who may face accidental deportation with only limited avenues to challenge them.\nWhile people claiming citizenship or another legal status are not subject to expedited removal under the new guidelines, the speed of expedited removal and absence of due process make it more likely that such persons may be erroneously removed. As before, those falsely claiming citizenship are rendered inadmissible and subject to removal.\nCivil liberties will be infringed\nThe Notice purports to place the burden of affirmatively showing that they have been physically present in the U.S. continuously for two years on persons determined to be inadmissible. This raises the possibility that those likely to be questioned by immigration officers – whether citizen or immigrant, documented or undocumented – will be effectively required to carry documentation establishing their citizenship and/or legal presence or demonstrating a two-year period of residency in the United States. The specter of having federal authorities request immigration papers and/or identification to travel in the interior of the United States is a substantial expansion of federal authority and a substantial infringement on civil liberties.\nThe regime set up by the new expedited removal guideline is likely to sow fear in immigrant communities and to increase instances of racial profiling and discrimination against those groups likely to be asked to show their papers.\nExempted communities\nThose who express a fear of return to their home country. If a noncitizen expresses a fear of returning to their home country, they should be referred to an asylum officer for a “credible fear” interview. If the asylum officer determines that the individual has a credible fear of persecution, the noncitizen will be detained and placed in regular removal proceedings, under which they can present their case before an immigration judge.\nVisa overstayers are not currently subject to expedited removal. These individuals were legally admitted into the U.S. and entered “with inspection.” This means that they entered through a port of entry (POE) and were admissible at the time of their entrance.\nMinors and unaccompanied children are not subject to expedited removal. Unaccompanied children and minors have legal protections which differ from adults in the U.S. immigration system. Due to these protections, unaccompanied children and minors are entitled to go through removal proceedings, where they can present their case before an immigration judge. However, Unaccompanied children (UACs) from contiguous countries (Mexico and Canada) can be immediately returned to their country of origin in lieu of removal proceedings.\n.\nNational Immigration Forum would like to thank Katia Diamond-Sagias, Policy and Advocacy intern, for helping to develop this explainer.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

In 2011, he left Wits to take up the position of professor and director of mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic of Namibia, where he started Industrial Engineering courses and qualifications in Namibia and encouraged the introduction of industrial engineering in Botswana.\nHe authored numerous papers and articles, as well as two books related to industrial engineering. He was an Honorary Fellow of the Southern African Institute for Industrial Engineering (SAIIE) and served on the SAIIE Council for many years, as well as president in 1994.\nDuring his retirement, he kept regular contact with the Industrial Engineering Department at Wits, giving the occasional lecture, providing valuable advice to the faculty, and regularly speaking at student evenings and prize-giving ceremonies.\nHe will be remembered for his incredible energy, drive, enthusiasm, wit, humour, forthrightness, and for not compromising on qualities such as excellence, kindness, generosity. He will be dearly missed by all who knew him, particularly his children: Susan (BSc Building 1997), Collin (BMus 1995) and Bruce (BCom 1998) and his grandchildren.\nSources: SAIIE\nMargo Mwamba Kalenga (2001-2025)\nMargo “Maggie” Kalenga (B Audiology 2023), a pre-med student at Drake University in Des Moines, United States, died suddenly on 29 September 2025 at the age of 24.\nKalenga was born on 7 May, 2001, in Congo, and graduated with a Bachelor of Audiology from Wits in 2023. She received the 2022 AB Clemons Research Award for her fourth-year research project. Her research supervisor Katijah Khoza-Shangase (BA Speech and Hearing 1997, MA Audiology 2001, PhD 2008) said Kalenga’s “voice and insight shone brightly”.\nKalenga kept in touch with her former supervisor, writing: “Although I am not actively practicing audiology at the moment, I am open to participating in any research projects you are willing to allow me to participate in. I believe it would be a great way to keep my research skills polished and to continue learning.”\nKalenga’s area of research focused on “language, culture, and inclusion in audiology education and practice”. She made the dean’s list throughout her time at Drake.\nOutside of academics, she was known for her love for others and her faith. “She forgave quickly, never held a grudge, and spoke God’s Word with grace and authority. Her love for Christ shaped every part of her life,” the obituary from IIes Funeral Homes read.\nShe is survived by her parents, siblings, extended family, and a host of friends.\nDeon Fourie (1932-2025)\nDeon François Schönland Fourie (BA Hons 1967) died on 10 September 2025. He was a soldier, academic, military historian, and devoted member of the Order of St John. He combined a lifelong military career with academia, and devoted himself to public service, cultural life, and his family.\nHe spent his early years in Sabie and his childhood was shaped by his father’s career as a mining commissioner. Later the family moved to Lichtenburg and to Pietersburg, where he completed his schooling. At Pietersburg High School, he excelled in history, English, and Afrikaans and had a passion for cadets. After matriculating, he worked briefly in the civil service in Pietersburg before pursuing studies in social science at the University of Natal, in Durban, from 1951 to 1953 and later undertook postgraduate studies at Wits.\nAfter passing the Foreign Affairs exams, he joined the South African Diplomatic Service in 1955, but found the work unfulfilling. He also tried his hand as a qualified trademark agent, at Spoor & Fisher, a law firm specialising in trademarks and patents, but again, he found the work uninspiring. Quite by chance, he accepted a position at the University of South Africa in 1968, beginning what became an academic career.\nHe started as a lecturer in public administration and in 1973 he introduced strategic studies as an academic discipline at honours level – the first such programme in South Africa. He became a professor of strategic studies, a post he held until his retirement in 1997. He supervised generations of postgraduate students, many of whom went on to senior positions in the military, government, and academia. Even after retirement, he continued to supervise research and to lecture periodically, keeping close ties with former students.\nFourie’s military career spanned more than fifty years. Over the years he served in the infantry, marines, navy, and armoured corps. He commanded the Pretoria Armour Regiment from 1975 to 1980, and even after formally leaving the regiment remained involved with the Regimental Association for his entire life. In 1987 he was appointed Director of Citizen Force Liaison on the general staff of the South African Defence Force, a post he held under four successive Chiefs of the Army. In this role he advised on citizen force policy and training, including the introduction of civic education into the armed forces. His military service earned him numerous decorations.\nHe played an active role in South African civic and cultural life. He chaired the South African National Museum of Military History, and the Pretoria branch of the South African Institute of International Affairs. He also served on the advisory councils of the Institute for Security Studies and the University of Pretoria’s Institute for Strategic Studies. He served on the governing board of Pretoria High School for Girls and had close links with Pretoria Boys High School where we worked with the then principal in introducing cadets and setting up the pipe band.\nFor more than 40 years, Fourie devoted voluntary service to the Order of St John in South Africa. In recognition of his decades of leadership, he was appointed a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St John in 2021, one of the Order’s highest honours.\nIn 1964 he met his wife, Felicia, and they were married in 1967 and shared a life for nearly six decades. They raised three children. He was also a proud grandfather of seven grandchildren.\nSource: Fourie family, further reading: Wikipedia\nJack Spence, OBE (1931–2025)\nProfessor John Edward “Jack” Spence, OBE (BA 1952, BA Hons 1953, LLD honoris causa 1997) distinguished scholar of international relations and diplomacy, passed away peacefully on 17 August 2025 in Ludlow at the age of 94.\nBorn on 11 June 1931, Spence was the son of a County Durham miner who emigrated to work in the gold mines of Krugersdorp. He was educated at Pretoria Boys High School and completed his Bachelor of Arts and honours degree in history from Wits. His interests shifted from history to political science, and he qualified with Bachelor of Science in economics from London School of Economics (LSE) in 1955.\nHis academic career spanned continents and more than six decades, leaving a lasting mark on the study of politics, diplomacy, and African affairs. Spence began his career at the University of Natal, followed by a Rockefeller junior research fellowship at the LSE. He later taught at University College Swansea, before serving as professor of politics and pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Leicester. In 1991 he became director of Studies at Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs).\nHis influential works on South Africa and international diplomacy included Ending Apartheid (Routledge 2010, with David Welsh). He wrote extensively on South African foreign policy, convened expert study groups on South and Southern Africa, and fostered close collaboration with the South African Institute of International Affairs. He also edited After Mandela: The 1999 South African Elections (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1999), bringing together a distinguished group of scholars. He received honorary fellowships at several universities, and honorary doctorates, including Wits in 1997. He served as a member of the University’s London Committee “during several years of its existence” and, until he was 88, as a managing trustee of the University Appeal Fund – a UK charity acting for the benefit of Wits. He was a remarkable ambassador for Wits who would be seen in London wearing his Wits tie, using his Wits cufflinks, carrying his Wits bag, or all three at once!\nIn 2014, King’s College London established the Jack Spence BA Prize in International Relations. He taught, wrote, and supervised students well into his later years, serving as Professor of Diplomacy in the Department of War Studies at King’s College from 1997 until his retirement in 2022 at the age of 91.\nBeyond his academic and policy contributions, Spence was a generous mentor. He committed time and resources to the next generation. Well into his eighties, he was pivotal to organising visiting research positions for Wits PhD students to spend time at King’s. He remained “old school”, never learning to type, relying on landlines, and avoiding email. His late wife Sue, who predeceased him in 2021, often fielded calls and messages on his behalf.\nHe is survived by his daughter, Rachel.\nSources: Kings College London, Wits archives,\nread tributes from two former students\nAlain Francois Leger (1931-2025)\nSerial entrepreneur, Alain Francois Leger (BSc Eng 1954), died at the age of 94 on 13 August 2025.\nIn July 1958, at the age of 27, he founded Vesco Plastics, known as Vesconite Bearings today, and devoted his career to the business. Known as “Mr Leger”, he was a creative problem-solver, doing much with minuscule resources. He grew a small-town business into a company with global sales. He was described as “a true scientist and chemist, he meticulously recorded every experiment, idea and experience of his life.” His painstaking dedication laid the foundation for the product range the company continues to have today.\nHe lived simply and was concerned that there should be a substantial philanthropic aspect to business success, so he funded projects that focused on early childhood development.\nSpiritually, he would cite Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a French Jesuit, to his son Jean-Patrick Leger (BSc Eng 1979, PhD 1992): “We are not physical beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a physical experience.”\nHe shared eight lessons for entrepreneurs with alumni relations in 2018.\nSource: Leger family\nMaurice McGregor (1920-2025)\nDistinguished cardiologist and former dean in the Wits Faculty of Health Sciences between 1984-1987, Dr Maurice McGregor (MBBCh 1943, DScMed honoris causa 1974) died of complications related to Parkinson’s disease at age 105 on 4 August 2025. Over the years he played multiple roles in clinical cardiology, teaching, and research. He was a skilled administrator and leader, serving as dean of medicine at McGill University in Canada from 1966 until 1972. President of the Conseil d’évaluation des technologies de la santé du Québec and chair of the Health Technology Assessment Unit at the McGill University Health Centre, he received numerous awards, including the Order of Quebec and the Order of Canada.\nMcGregor was born on an orange farm in Rustenburg on 24 March 1920, the second child of Frank and Ella (née Mills) McGregor. He matriculated from Michaelhouse and obtained his medical degree in 1943. Fresh out of medical school he served as a medical officer in Italy in World War II. He completed his medical internship after the war and left for England for a postdoctoral residency in cardiology, where he married his wife Margot Becklake (MBBCh 1945, DScMed honoris causa 1974). In 1957 the family emigrated to Montreal when he was recruited by McGill University.\nThe couple shared a legacy of leadership with Becklake becoming one of the Montreal Chest Institute’s “Fab Five” and a globally renowned pioneer of respiratory medicine and epidemiology. She passed away in 2018. McGregor moved up in stature having more than 180 publications to his credit and is recognised for his novel and decisive contributions to the understanding of pulmonary hypertension and coronary ischemia.\nIn 1984, Wits asked him to take on the role of dean of the Faculty of Medicine. He set up a committee to eliminate apartheid practices within the faculty, which met monthly until it was dissolved in July 1991. Among others, it organised a petition signed by 926 faculty members calling for the unification of health services, approaching numerous levels of government. During his tenure, the government repealed the decision that black students needed to obtain ministerial approval to attend ‘white’ universities and the percentage of black students admitted to the medical school rose from 10% to 30%.\nReturning McGill University in 1987 he served as dean of medicine, becoming the inaugural director of a ground-breaking provincial council that evaluated health technologies entering the healthcare market – the first such council in North America. In 2014, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health created the Dr Maurice McGregor Award. In 2020, in honour of his 100th birthday, McGill announced that its cardiovascular research day would now be known as the Maurice McGregor Cardiovascular Research Day.\nOn his 101st birthday, McGregor was interviewed by the youngest student at Michaelhouse. Asked what advice he had to share, his reply was simple and concise. “You can waste life or live it,” he said.\nHe is survived by his son James (BSc 1973) and daughter Margaret; his grandchildren, great-grandchildren and numerous nephews and nieces.\nSources: McGill Health-e News, Wits archive\nSydney Lipworth (1931-2025)\nDistinguished barrister Sir Maurice Sydney Lipworth (BCom 1952, LLB 1954, LLD honoris causa 2003), who enjoyed a wide-ranging career in law, business and the public service, died in London at age 94 on 27 June 2025.\nHe was born in Johannesburg on 13 May 1931, the son of Isidore Lipworth (originally Lipschitz, of Lithuanian and Latvian descent) and his wife Rae. He was educated at King Edward VII School, where his classmates included Sir Donald Gordon (DEconSc honoris causa 1991) and Sir Mark Weinberg (BCom 1952, LLB 1954, DEconSc honoris causa 1990). He graduated with both business and law degrees from Wits cum laude. He was joint winner of the Alexander Aitken Medal in his commerce class and the Society of Advocates Prize for the best law graduate in his LLB graduating class. He qualified as an attorney in 1955 and was admitted to the bar in 1956, practising as an attorney for eight years.\nLipworth was one of a trio of liberal-minded lawyers who left apartheid South Africa along with Sir Mark and Lord Joel Joffe (BCom 1952, LLB 1954, LLD honoris causa 2001), the latter having been a defence attorney for Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders in their 1963-64 “Rivonia” trial on charges of sabotage. Also in their circle was Gordon who remained in South Africa to build Liberty Life but was later a property tycoon and philanthropist in the UK. Lipworth advised him at Liberty Life in the 1950s before moving to London to join Weinberg in the launch of their insurance business, Abbey Life.\nAfter Abbey Life was acquired in 1970 by the US conglomerate ITT, the trio moved on. With Weinberg as the driving entrepreneur, Lipworth as a shrewd business brain alongside him, and Joffe as the corporate conscience urging them to give profit-shares to charity, they built a new business which evolved from Hambro Life to Allied Hambro and ultimately Allied Dunbar, a constituent of the FTSE 100 index until it was taken over at a rich price by BAT Industries in 1986.\nLipworth was deputy chairman of Allied Dunbar until 1988, when he took on the full-time chairmanship of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a five-year term. Lipworth was immune to “lobbying or political bullying”, one profile noted, and had no truck with “trimming to the fashion of the day”. That took him to the chair of the Financial Reporting Council, overseeing audit professionals and corporate governance, and he became a powerful voice on other committees and in other boardrooms.\nHe also chaired the trustees of the Philharmonic Orchestra and gave his support to the Royal Academy, the South Bank Foundation, Sadler’s Wells and the Contemporary Dance Trust. For recreation he enjoyed tennis as a member of Queen’s Club. He was knighted in 1991 and appointed an honorary QC in 1993.\nIn 1957 he married Rosa Liwarek, who was introduced through Arthur Chaskalson (BCom 1952, LLB 1954, LLD honoris causa 1990). She was appointed CBE in 2010 for her own charitable work and together they were significant benefactors of Wits and graciously hosted Wits alumni in their beautiful London home on many occasions. She survives him with a son; another son predeceased him.\nSources: The Telegraph and Wits archives\nHans Christian Benecke (1941-2025)\nHans Christian Benecke (BCom 1965) died at the age of 84 in Johannesburg after a long battle with cancer. He was director of Atlas Organic Fertilizers for decades, “both through good and bad years”. As a notable rower during his time at Wits, Benecke was the president of the Wits Boat Club and did much to rebuild its depleted resources. During the Wits 1975 Henley and European tour, he hosted the entire crew at his family home on of Lake Konstance in Switzerland.\nHis charming personality, wicked wit and fantastic memory allowed him to befriend many and catalogue and maintain an extraordinary archive of lives. He loved to reminisce on the glory days of the Club, and its wild adventures.\nA tribute was written by a close friend, Derrick Read (BA 1965), for his funeral which said: “Hans loved South Africa, the Orange River, the Zambezi, the Vaal. A pioneer, an explorer with a passion for nature and the beauty around its creation, and the people who lived in those spaces, and coming from a family at the forefront of development in Southern Africa, Hans grew his love for Africa from the deserts of Namibia, and the grasslands and mountains of Zimbabwe, to the diamonds on the banks of the Orange River… The people of those areas meant much to Hans, the local people, the farmers, the tribesmen, he knew them all, respected and loved them, the salt of the earth. Hans spoke Afrikaans well and admired the faith, strength, and pragmatism of the community, especially the rural farmers and their families.”\nHe is survived by his Michele and three children, Paul, Josephine and Nicholas.\nSources: Derrick and Allison Read, Wynand and Landi Dreyer and Benecke family\nCosta Gazidis (1936-2025)\nActivist and medic Costa Gazidis (MBBCh 1962) died in London on 19 March 2025 at the age of 90. He had travelled from his Cape Town home in 2018 to visit family and friends in England but fell ill and never fully recovered.\nThe son of Greek immigrants, Gazidis was born in Krugersdorp and was initially accepted to study civil engineering but switched to medicine in 1953. At the start of his anatomy year, he was incensed on learning that black students were forbidden to dissect white cadavers. He read Karl Marx’s banned Communist Manifesto and became convinced of the possibility of an egalitarian future of racial equality and shared wealth.\nOnce qualified, he worked at the McCord Zulu Hospital in Durban and at Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg. In 1964 he was convicted for being a member of the Communist Party and spent two and a half years in Pretoria Central prison, much in solitary confinement.\nAfter his release in 1966 he was subjected to a banning order. By 1968 his life in South Africa had become so untenable that he relocated with his young family to the UK. In his new home he studied for a diploma in public health before working as an assistant senior medical officer in Portsmouth, as a senior medical officer in Nottingham and then as a senior epidemiologist for the Public Health Laboratory Service in London.\nUntil the early 1990s he occupied various positions in community medicine until he returned to South Africa after the fall of apartheid, taking up a post as a public health specialist in Umtata in the Eastern Cape and as a senior lecturer at the University of Transkei medical school, before working as a community health specialist in East London from 1996 until retirement in 2004.\nSoon after his return to South Africa he had begun prescribing AZT to pregnant mothers with HIV/Aids – until he was threatened with imprisonment by the ANC’s minister of health. Afterwards he funded the provision of antiretroviral drugs out of his own pocket and formed a charity, the ABBA Trust, to dispense them off hospital premises. Ultimately, his efforts, in conjunction with many others, changed government policy.\nDespite his rebellious streak, he was happy and optimistic, and larger-than-life. He is survived by his third wife, Janet (née Page), whom he married in 2005, and by seven children: Amanda, Ivan and his stepson Peter from his first marriage to Dorothea Constantinides, Robert and Shona from his second marriage to Janet Moir, and Rita and Djamilla from two relationships before his marriages – with Ena Arnold and Laura Hitchens respectively.\nSources: The Guardian and Medical Class of 1960 archive\nNaomi Livni (1937-2025)\nDr Naomi Livni (MBBCh 1960), who died aged 87, was a clinical pathologist, and specialist in urological histology in London.\nShe was born in Johannesburg, the second eldest of six. She matriculated from Parktown Girls High School, excelling in sport and academics. She recalled her initial interest in nuclear physics at Wits: “I was the only person in the queue for nuclear physics – when I approached the desk the gentleman seated there said to me “we only have two places for students in nuclear physics and you aren’t going to get either one of them – so run along little girl’. This was my first [and not the last] encounter with the glass ceiling! I left the room with not much of a clue as to what to do and joined the queue for medicine and was accepted.”\nHalfway through her first year she met Leopold “Leon” Kahn [MBBCh 1960) and they were married two weeks after graduation. Through a serendipitous encounter, she applied for a job advertised at the South African Institute for Medical Research in cytology, which opened up a new career path in histopathology.\nThe family moved to the UK in 1989, after she accepted a post initially as consultant and then later as head of department at St George’s Hospital in Tooting. She later took up a post as head of cytology at Hammersmith, Charing Cross and Chelsea and Westminster hospitals, a position she remained at for 16 years and in which she oversaw many changes. After her retirement in 2008, she took up a position as lead uropathologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital where she worked for the next 6 years: “This was a wonderful time working with many leaders in my field,” she shared in 2020.\nThe last 18 months of her life were difficult as colon cancer, which had been in remission, returned. She said in 2020 that “My incredible husband and my wonderful children have been my greatest champions. My ultimate accolade is that both my sons chose to marry career women.”\nShe is survived by her husband Leon, two sons Leonard (MBBCh 1984) and David (BSc 1983) and their families.\nSource: Alumni correspondence and medical class of 1960 newsletter\nLynn Gamsu Freed (1945-2025)\nSouth African born author Lynn Ruth Freed (BA 1967) died of lymphoma at the age of 79 in Sonoma, California on 9 May 2025.\nShe was the third and youngest daughter of Anne (Moshal) and Harold Derrick Freed, born on 18 July 1945. She captured in fiction and memoir her father, her fiercely ambitious mother, and their theatre company and exuberant household in Durban in the 1950s and 1960s. \"The real world of my childhood,\" she wrote, \"was a large subtropical port on the Indian Ocean, with beaches and bush and sugarcane and steaming heat, a strict Anglican girls' school, massive family gatherings on Friday nights and Jewish holidays, and then my parents' theatre world...this world did not exist, not even peripherally, in the literature available to me.\"\nShe first went to the United States as a high school exchange student with the American Field Service and shortly after receiving her degree from Wits, she enrolled as a graduate student in English literature at Columbia University and earned her doctorate. She moved to San Francisco in 1970 and lived in Sonoma from 1989 till her death. She was professor emerita of English at the University of California, Davis, where she taught for 15 years. She was also a member of the core faculty of the MFA program at Bennington College and a frequent faculty member at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Vermont.\nHer style has been described as “mordant and darkly comic”, exploring her Jewish upbringing during apartheid. She wrote seven novels Heart Change (1982), Home Ground (1986), The Bungalow (1993), The Mirror (1997), House of Women (2002), The Servants' Quarters (2009), and The Last Laugh (2019). She published a collection of stories, The Curse of the Appropriate Man, in 2004, and two volumes of essays: Reading, Writing, and Leaving Home (2005) and The Romance of Elsewhere (2017).\nIn 2002, the American Academy of Arts and Letters awarded Freed the inaugural Katherine Anne Porter Award in fiction. She received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and The Guggenheim Foundation among others.\nShe often expressed ambivalence about leaving South Africa and feeling displaced: “I saw my bifurcated life for what it was: as a failure of daring. I had not dared to remain. More than this, I had been a show-off in my leaving. And I was still showing off — leaving there, leaving here — keeping the truth for the writing itself, hiding it away like a criminal. For what is writing, after all, but a bid for the truth? And what is truth if not the life at the very heart of failure?\"\nShe is survived by her daughter, Jessica Gamsu, and her granddaughter, Georgia.\nHer first marriage, to Gordon Gamsu, ended in divorce. She was married to Robert Kerwin until his death in 2021.\nSources: Legacy, The San Francisco Chronicle and The New York Times\nJacqueline Galpin (1950-2025)\nFormer head of school in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Professor Jacqueline Galpin (BSc Hons 1972) died on 18 May 2025.\nAffectionately known as Jacky, she began her career at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 1973 before joining the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at Wits University in April 1990 as a senior lecturer. She served the department for many years, including a term as Head of School from June 2003 to December 2007.\nAs a lecturer at Wits, she developed several courses, and her research covered both theoretical and applied areas, particularly regression, sampling, small-area estimation, and official statistics. Although she officially retired from Wits in 2008, Galpin continued to contribute to academia, first as a contract lecturer at Wits until 2017 and later as a Visiting Senior Research Associate at the University of Johannesburg in 2019.\nShe served on the executive committee of the South African Statistical Association for 21 years, and was elected president and honoured as a fellow in 1998. She played a central role in organising, and served as managing editor, of the South African Statistical Journal from 1988 to 2005. Galpin was also a council member of the South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions and represented the South African statistical community internationally.\nHer passion for advancing statistical literacy, empowering women in statistics, and training educators, government officials, and official statisticians was unwavering. Jacky was known for her warmth, generosity, and tireless support of students and colleagues.\nHer only family member and beloved husband, Richard, passed away on 29 August 2021.\nSource: Wits news\nRobert Pullen (1939-2025)\nDistinguished leader and former president of the South African Institution of Civil Engineering, Robert Pullen (BSc Eng 1961, MSc Eng 1970) died on 27 May 2025 at the age of 85.\nHis career trajectory reflected a unique balance of technical expertise, visionary leadership, and public service. He held senior roles in planning and construction, contributing significantly to iconic national projects and policy-making, including the drafting of South Africa’s first major water policy document.\nIn 1963 he joined the Hydrological Research Unit (HRU) at Wits to work as a research engineer under Professor Des Midgely (DSc honoris causa 1986). His research was related to the development of practical methods for addressing flooding. His master’s thesis provided a major component of the seminal “Design Flood Determination in South Africa”, which became the standard reference for flood analysis and the design of protection works in South Africa.\nIn 1969 he joined the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, where he held management positions in planning and construction, including that of resident engineer on the Tugela-Vaal inter-basin transfer project for augmenting the supply of water to the Witwatersrand. He made innovative contributions and was also involved in the planning and design of the Drakensberg pumped storage scheme for incorporating hydroelectric power generation.\nHe left a promising career in public service for private consulting in the water resources field and was a director of SRK Consulting from 1982 to 1985, director of Consultburo from 1985 to 1997 and director of BKS after its merger with Consultburo from 1997 to 2002. He became Deputy CEO of BKS Group in 2002.\nIn May 2009 he was presented with the National Science and Technology Forum Award in Category C (for activities other than research and its outputs over the last five years or less) for 2008/9 by the Minister of Science and Technology for his contribution to the regulation of the engineering professions and his contribution to civil engineering and environmental practice. In 2013 Wits awarded him a Gold Medal for his “outstanding contribution to the practice of water resources engineering and especially to the wider engineering profession in South Africa”.\nHe will be remembered not only as a brilliant engineer and strategic thinker but as a man of great integrity, humility, and warmth.\nSources: Wits archives and SAICE\nJan Peter Reynders (1940-2025)\nDistinguished academic in the field of high voltage engineering and former dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Professor Jan Peter Reynders (BSc Eng 1965, PhD 1979), died on 16 April 2025 at the age of 84.\nHe earned his PhD in electrical engineering in 1979 and started lecturing in his 20s under Prof Guerino Bozzoli – continuing his relationship with Wits well into his 70s. He pioneered the establishment of the Wits high-voltage laboratory in the 1980s and advanced research in gas-insulated switchgear in South Africa. As part of the Johannesburg Lightning Research Laboratory, founded in 1992, Reynders made significant contributions to addressing problems caused by lightning on power and telecommunications systems.\nHis leadership extended to collaborations with high voltage facilities at universities, universities of technology, and industry, earning him international recognition. As chair of the organising committee, Reynders played a pivotal role in hosting the 16th International Symposium on High Voltage Engineering in South Africa in 2009, a testament to his global stature. He served as president of the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers and was actively involved with Cigré, the International Council on Large Electric Systems, shaping power systems research worldwide.\nAfter his retirement, Reynders became a fully ordained Methodist minister, offering a “non-itinerant, non-stipendiary service” – in remote congregations where he was needed most. He was a quiet man, with a gentle sense of humour. “He was never dismissive or flippant, tackling even the smallest tasks with seriousness and attention to detail,” the congregation at his memorial service was told. He integrated his faith and science effortlessly and was a specialist at fixing things with his hands – as carpenter and qualified electrician – and passed these skills on to his children and grandchildren.\nIn his final years, Parkinson’s had a devastating impact, but his true character shone through and he became gentler and more peaceful.\nReynders is survived by his wife Joan; sons David (BSc Eng 1994, MSc Eng 1999), and Stephen (BSc Eng 1996, MSc Eng 2002) and their extended families.\nSources: Wits archives and memorial service\nGeoffrey Klass (1948-2025)\nJohannesburg’s extraordinary bookseller Geoffrey Klass (BSc 1972) died on 27 February 2025 after a short illness. He co-founded a bookshop, the Collectors Treasury, in 1974 with his brother Jonathan, which became an institution for the city’s bibliophiles.\nKlass was born in 1948 to psychiatrist father Dr Max Klass and Maisie (née Goldberg) in Johannesburg. His grandparents Solomon and Zelda Klass were immigrants to South Africa from Lithuania and they sold everything from ginger beer to baby clothes. Solomon bought property and acquired the Johannesburg Ritz Hotel and later owned a residential hotel in Berea, and for a time he was the owner of the Radium Beer Hall. Klass attributed his love of books and collecting to his father. Books were part of the family home in Doveton Road in Parktown West, while Maisie was an avid antiques collector.\n“We inherited a well-rounded view of cultural matters, and we were instilled with a love of objects and the history behind them. We don’t specialise, we don’t see boundaries, we see everything in a broad stream of culture,” Klass said in a 2005 interview with the Heritage Portal. He matriculated at Parktown Boys High and went on to read for a Bachelor of Science degree at Wits, graduating in 1972. His interests were broad and “the academic trajectory was too narrow for his exploding mind.” He declined the opportunity to study on a fellowship, for a PhD in Chicago.\nIn 1991 the Klass family bought a building at 244 Commissioner Street in old Johannesburg and part of the revitalised Maboneng to house their massive collection. It was an old face-bricked, eight-storey building which originally was an old clothing factory.\nIn addition to books, the stock extended to antique maps, old engravings and prints, printed ephemera, periodicals, newspapers and photographs. They also curated and dealt in vinyl records and 78rpm discs. The shop housed an extensive range of small antiques and collectables, with a strong emphasis on the decorative arts between 1870-1970, glassware, ceramics and porcelain.\nKlass was the founding member and first chairman of the South African Bookdealers Association, the official body for out-of-print bookdealers in Southern Africa. He is survived by his brother Jonathan and sister-in-law Jenny, niece and nephew Mathew and Rebecca, and by his beloved partner, Gundi Weinick.\nSource: Kathy Munro, Heritage Portal\nAndrew Dickson (1940-2025)\nFormer head of school in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Wits Professor Andrew John Dickson (BSc Eng 1962, MSc Eng 1964) died peacefully at the age of 84 in his home in Colorado, US. Dickson matriculated from St John’s College and he was awarded with both a graduate and master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Wits. He received a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology soon after and completed another master’s in electrical engineering. On returning to South Africa, he worked as an engineer in Mokopane for several years before returning to Wits as lecturer in Engineering Design in the School of Mechanical Engineering. Teaching was his first love. He was well-liked and respected by his students and fellow academics. He always had time to help his students and never turned anyone away from his door. In the early 1980s Eskom lured him back into the profession. He went on to have an illustrious career in Eskom and was, for many years, generation engineering manager. He played a major role in the team which included John Maree (BCom 1949) and Ian McRae (BSc Eng 1954, DSc Eng honoris causa 1989), who built Eskom into being one of the finest generation companies in the world at the time.\nIn the mid-1990s he returned to Wits to take up the Eskom Chair of Engineering in the Faculty. He remained in that role until his retirement. Soon after retiring, he and his wife Pam (BSc 1962) moved to Colorado to be closer to their daughter Susan van den Heever (BSc 1989, PDipEd 1989, BSc Hons 1991, MSc 1995), who is a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.\nSource: Dickson family\nChristopher Julian Cooke (1940-2025)\nEmeritus Professor in the School of Architecture, Planning and Geomatics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), Christopher Julian Cooke (BArch 1963, HDipTP 1972) died on 24 February 2025.\nCooke, known affectionately as Julian, started teaching at UCT in 1976 and retired formally in 2000, serving as the dean in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, as well as director of the school. He played a pivotal role in forging various programmes, as well as creating a curriculum that questioned the status quo, was politically progressive and anti-apartheid. Student projects in both planning and architecture were regularly set in the urban and rural conditions of the apartheid city of Cape Town, and small towns nearby. Architecture was understood to not only be a formal artistic or sculptural endeavour, but also a socio-political one.\nHe was editor of the journal Architecture SA from 1982 to 1987, and was re-appointed in 2003. He won several open architectural competitions in South Africa, and received many awards, including the South African Institute of Architects Gold Medal Award for architecture in 2015.\nCooke’s most significant work was the hostels upgrade programme which comprised approximately 3000 units in Nyanga, Gugulethu and Langa.\nHe said the squalid, barrack-like hostels reminded him of Charles Dickens’ “dark, satanic mills” of the European industrial revolution 150 years ago. The transformation took 15 years to accomplish, with Cooke establishing a relationship with the community he later he regarded as family.\nHe described moments of beauty he encountered: “The difference between the living conditions and the way places are occupied says something profound about the greatness and resourcefulness of human beings. In one room we meet a woman who is carefully braiding her daughter’s hair. The child is sitting on a bed covered with an immaculately embroidered bedspread and on the wall next to her is a large, framed picture of a curly-haired Jesus. I find the irony in the juxtaposition of such care and beauty with the crude hostel block difficult to bear.”\nThe project won the firm, Architects Associated, of which Cooke was part, the Impumelelo Innovations Award in 2004.His lectures were described as interesting and accessible. He came up with the idea of a project called “Ten dreams for Cape Town”. This was a project that brought together many architects and urban designers, to rethink and, importantly, to show, an alternative Cape Town that was more efficient, egalitarian and sustainable. This project culminated in a series of lectures for one of UCT’s Summer School courses in 2019, with an accompanying exhibition. It was later turned into a book titled A Vision for a Future Cape Town.\nHe had an unwavering belief in the project of architecture and continued to teach long after retirement from the school as well as creating courses for UCT’s Summer School.\nHe will be remembered as an “exemplary architect, urban designer, teacher and human being.”\nLeah Simon (1927-2025)\nLeah, known as “Lily” Simon, (BA 1947), née Edelstein died suddenly on 17 February 2025 in Sydney, Australia. She was born to impoverished parents in Krugersdorp. Being one of the brightest pupils in her school, she matriculated at the age of 16. She won a scholarship to study at the Wits, in residence, graduating at 19. Post graduation she taught English at her alma mater school, Krugersdorp High.\nShe married fellow Witsie Leslie Simon (BArch1950, PGDip TP 1965 in 1948 and had three sons: Alan (BA Hons 1978, MA 1979), Trevor (BCom 1983) and Clive (BSc 1982, BSc Hons 1983, PhD 1989).\nThe family emigrated to Sydney in 1999 where she continued to teach English to international students for a few years until she retired, noting that discipline was not quite the same as back in the day. She is predeceased by Leslie (2021) and Clive (2019) and is survived by her two sons and their families.\nLily had a love for Latin and English literature. She published poems, short stories and one of her proudest achievements was to publish Inyanga (Justified Press, 1993,) a story about Sarah Mashele, one of Soweto’s most famous witch doctors. She was both a serious and humorous writer as in the poem below illustrates:\nStreaker by Lillian Simon\nIt all began when Mrs Plump\nLong established as a frump\nSaid her life was dull and chaste\nAnd surely virtue was a waste\nCome full moon she began to streak\nSuddenly reaching a brand new peak\nDown the road the old bag trotted\nAfter getting nicely potted\nHer sagging breast and flabby belly\nWould never have made it on the telly\nThough not exactly love’s young dream\nShe’d found a way to let off steam\nAnd even when the police stepped in\nTo cart her off to the loony bin\nThe latest mode of good head-shrinking\nFailed to rearrange her thinking\nIn spite of being a tough nut\nShe was glad she’d shown the world her butt\nSource: Simon family\nSenamile Masango (1987-2025)\nOne of South Africa’s trailblazing black female nuclear scientists, Senamile Masango (PDM 2021) died aged 37, from an unknown cause, on 8 February 2025.\nDubbed “the queen of science”by some, Masango was born in KwaNongoma, in KwaZulu-Natal. She demonstrated a passion for learning and her family encouraged her to read extensively from an early age. She enrolled at the University of KwaZulu-Natal atthe age of 16 to pursue a Bachelor of Science in physics and electronics, followed by an honours degree in nuclear physics from the University of the Western Cape, where she conducted research on the B(E2) value in Neon-20. She completed a postgraduate diploma in energy leadership from Wits Business School.\nIn 2017 Masango was part of the first African-led experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), one of the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. Her many accomplishments include being South Africa’s research leader at the BRICS Youth Energy Outlook in 2019, where her foundation led the winning team in 2020. Recognised among the 50 Global Inspirational Women of 2020 and a Women in Tech Global Awards finalist in 2021 and 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community. She was the executive chairperson and founder of Mphathisithele Consulting PTY, and dedicated her career to empowering African women in STEM and advancing sustainable development goals.\nAt the time of her death, she was completing her doctoral studies in nuclear physics and was the founder of Women in Science and Engineering (Wise). Through Wise, Masango provided leadership and role models for young women wishing to enter the fields of science and engineering.\nProceeds made from her speaking engagements went towards raising money to provide science kits for disadvantaged schools. But throughout her career, Masango faced the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender. “The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think! There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,” she said.\nMehnaaz Ally (1980-2025)\nDr Mehnaaz Ally (MBBCh 2005) a dedicated paediatric palliative care practitioner, died on 6 February 2025. She was found unresponsive in her home after experiencing a massive internal brain haemorrhage.\nA touching “walk of honour”was held for Ally as an organ donor, as she arrived at Milpark Hospital on the morning after her death. A large crowd of people turned up to show their respects as she was wheeled through the ward. The request had been sent out to “wear bright colours” as homage to her positive and colourful personality.\nAfter completing her undergraduate degree in medicine from Wits in 2005, she pursued postgraduate studies in paediatrics, and then in paediatric palliative care. She successfully completed the post-graduate diploma in paediatric palliative medicine through the University of Cape Town in 2017, with distinction.\nShe worked at various palliative care NGOs, including WitsPal (Wits Palliative Care at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital), the Lambano Sanctuary, a paediatric step-down unit and hospice faculty in Germiston, the Rare Diseases South Africa as well as PatchSA.\nAccording to her colleagues, her empathetic approach to care extended beyond clinical practice, she understood the importance of listening and advocacy. She was passionate about educating fellow healthcare workers about paediatric pain and had a special interest in neonatal pain and palliation. She also ran support groups and debriefing workshops for healthcare workers burdened by burnout and compassion fatigue.\nSources: Rare Diseases South Africa, Lambano Sanctuary and PatchSA\nHarold Luntz (1937-2025)\nHarold Luntz (BA 1957, LLB 1959), who was Emeritus Professor at Melbourne Law School, died at the age of 87 on 29 January 2025. He was one of the world’s foremost scholars and theoreticians of torts and damages law. A much-loved colleague and lecturer, he authored numerous articles, incisive case notes, engaging book reviews, comments on the direction of the law and other publications.\nLuntz was born in Johannesburg, matriculating from Athlone Boys High School. After completing a Bachelor of Arts at Wits, he studied towards his LLB, serving articles of clerkship at the same time as undertaking the degree; both took three years. In 1960, he was employed for a brief period as a solicitor in a firm of solicitors in Johannesburg and then took a Bachelor of Civil Law at Lincoln College at the University of Oxford. He began publishing in academic journals in the early 1960s.\nHe emigrated to Australia in 1965, joining the Faculty of Law as a senior lecturer. He excelled as a writer and teacher. In 1970, he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1976 was appointed George Paton Professor of Law, a position he held until his retirement in 2002. He also served as a successful Dean at the Melbourne University Law School from 1986 to 1988. Following his retirement, he continued to teach in the postgraduate programme until 2008.\nLuntz took time off in 1970 to pursue his interests in comparative law as visiting associate professor at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada. Later, in 1971, he was visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. But his commitment was to Melbourne and Australia. He returned as Reader in Law in July 1971. His professorial chair came in July 1976, and he served as dean over three years from 1986–88. He was twice a visiting fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford, where he was attached on each occasion to the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies.\nHe was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Melbourne in 1983. In 2000 he was the inaugural recipient of the John G Fleming Memorial Award for Torts Scholarship, and in 2003 he was awarded the AILA Insurance Law Prize. From 2007, the Harold Luntz Graduate Research Thesis Prize commemorating Luntz’s achievements as a “world expert on torts law” has been awarded annually to the Melbourne Law School graduate research student judged to have presented the best thesis in the previous year, provided that the nominee meets an overall level of excellence required for the award. The prize specifically honours Luntz’s contribution on the international stage and as a former dean. Luntz was made an Officer in the general division in the Order of Australia in the Australia Day 2019 Honours List “for distinguished service to legal education, as an academic and editor, to professional development and to the community”.\nAfter Luntz’s retirement, Justice Michael Kirby wrote a tribute in the Melbourne University Law Review in 2003 titled Harold Luntz: Doyen of the Australian Law of Torts, saying Luntz was a lawyer who, unusually, “listened before he spoke”, a man with a reputation for “reading everything”; loved by his students “because he was a good storyteller”; and throughout his long, illustrious career displayed three great strengths: commonsense, practical wisdom and plain speaking.\nJustice Kirby noted that Luntz’s childhood and experiences in South Africa shaped his outlook on justice profoundly: “His childhood and youth in that country had a profound effect upon his view of the world and of the law.\nSouth Africa was never a lawless state. That, indeed, was the central problem. It embalmed in law rules that anyone with sensitivity (and particularly anyone who was from a minority) could see were offensive to human equality, to personal autonomy and to the effective operation of law as an instrument of justice. I venture to suggest that those early years left a mark on Harold Luntz that has stayed with him ever since. They help to explain his sense of urgency, his great energy, his pursuit of justice through law and his search for a better home to give voice to these ideals.”\nSources: The University of Melbourne, Wikipedia, Melbourne University Law Review\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        1643 Results for taxed\n- \"Wet Yard\" Not Shown To Be Part Of The Manufacturing Process\n- November 25, 2025 - Bulletin Print Report\n- Taxpayer, (\"TP\"), contends that large pieces of equipment...were purchased for the exclusive use of moving logs through a manufacturing process...

No paywall. No agenda. No corporate filter.\nSeven candidates are running to lead Milwaukee and replace former Mayor Tom Barrett, who was first elected to the position in 2004 and left in December to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg.\nThe primary election Tuesday will determine which two top vote-getters will face off in the April 5 special election. The winner will finish out the last two years of Barrett’s term.\nQ&As from interviews with candidates that air on WPR’s “The Morning Show” will be published here. This story was edited for brevity and clarity.\nKate Archer Kent: What are your top priorities for the city?\nBob Donovan: First and foremost, there are three immediate challenges that whoever is Milwaukee’s next mayor, (they will) have to tackle head-on, right from the start.\nNo. 1: To provide the appropriate level of leadership that, in my estimation, hasn’t existed in Milwaukee for quite some time.\nNo. 2: The public safety crisis that we’re dealing with, from reckless driving to record-breaking homicides two years in a row … We’re dealing with this public safety crisis that is strangling the life out of Milwaukee.\nAnd then finally, the fiscal challenges most people aren’t aware of. But Milwaukee is actually teetering on the verge of insolvency. We desperately need a partnership with the state of Wisconsin to address these challenges and move this community forward.\nKAK: How would your administration seek to reduce violence and reckless driving?\nBD: First, I would argue you simply cannot expect order and stability on our streets and neighborhoods unless we have the appropriate level of manpower in the Milwaukee Police Department. They simply cannot keep up with the 911 calls — the calls for help.\nREAD MORE: Milwaukee police chief threatens major cuts without staffing increase\nAnd of course, that’s all reactive policing. We want a force that has the ability to proactively patrol our streets. I’ve always been a big, big believer in foot patrol and bicycle officers connecting with the people they’re protecting and the people connecting with those officers, getting to know one another. There’s no better way to improve police-community relations than that kind of policing … We’ve cut the department’s manpower by hundreds over the last few years. That needs to be turned around.\nKAK: The Milwaukee Police Department has had trouble getting new recruits. How would you approach that problem?\nBD: Even if it takes going to other communities to recruit people, certainly that’s been the case with a lot of departments across the country. But you’re absolutely right. … Are we getting the quality candidates that want to become officers?\nIt’s important that we have officers that reflect the people that they’re protecting. I would want to work closely with the League of Martin and other organizations, retired Black police officers, perhaps, that could help in the recruiting process. Latinos as well. Work with those kinds of organizations to reach out into our schools, into our community groups and make that connection. Oftentimes, a young person may not have a positive connection with a police officer. Let’s face it, oftentimes they see a cop dealing in crisis situations, in very challenging, difficult (and) emotional situations.\nWe had a program here in Milwaukee — it needs to be brought back — called STOP: Students Talking it Over with Police. And I think it was an excellent program. It received national awards. We need to bring efforts like that back. Also, the PAL organization — the Police Athletic League — where police officers were involved in sports and mentoring of young people.\nKAK: How should the city spend roughly $200 million in unallocated federal funding for responding to the pandemic?\nBD: Certainly, I would want to see some of these funds go to our businesses. I think small businesses over the last two years have taken it on the chin with the lockdowns, with the mandates and so on. Some of them have lost their businesses. We need to be a community that helps our small businesses prosper. After all, small businesses are the backbone of any neighborhood. They’re the lifeline. They keep a neighborhood strong. In some instances, they are like an institution, many that have been there for decades. So, it’s important that a certain amount of those funds go to our businesses.\nKAK: In light of the problem with pensions, would you support raising taxes or cutting city services in this type of budget crunch?\nBD: No, I wouldn’t. I think the answer is not more taxes, especially given the inflation that we’re facing currently (and) the fiscal challenges that most families are facing. This is going to have to require a partnership with the state, and I believe I’m the candidate who can get that done. I believe over the years, I’ve developed good working relationships with our state legislators. It’s critical. Also, I might add, Wisconsin is looking at a significant budget surplus to the tune of almost $4 billion.\nREAD MORE: Wisconsin budget balance now projected at $3.8B\nI would hope that our representatives in Madison, including the governor, would recognize the importance of helping Milwaukee because what happens in Milwaukee is spreading to our suburbs. It impacts the region, but it impacts the entire state, as well. So, everyone has a vested interest in a well-run, efficient, successful (and) prosperous city of Milwaukee.\nKAK: No. 1 on your list is leadership. How does that relate to what a caller said about how the city needs a sense of community and economic opportunity more than tough-on-crime policies?\nBD: Without a doubt, he raises a good point, certainly. Having said that, you’re not going to be able to do anything positive in a neighborhood or in the community unless that community is first safe and stable. Once it’s safe and stable, positive things can happen. Businesses will want to come in.\nAlso, I would argue a major concern is our educational system. So, those two major responsibilities of local government, in my opinion, have been neglected over the last many years. We’re suffering the consequences. But without order and stability, you can’t begin to revitalize neighborhoods. So, that’s No. 1. And absolutely, once that occurs, you can then bring in businesses and so much can prosper. But you have to ask yourself: Do you want to move into or open up a business in a neighborhood that is factually unsafe and perceived as unsafe?\nWisconsin Public Radio, © Copyright 2025, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Racial gap found in traffic stops in Milwaukee\nCity's disparities are greater than other large metro police departments\nA black Milwaukee driver is seven times as likely to be stopped by city police as a white resident driver, a Journal Sentinel analysis of nearly 46,000 traffic stops has found.\nSimilarly, Milwaukee police pulled over Hispanic city motorists nearly five times as often as white drivers, according to the review, which took into account the number of licensed drivers by race.\nPolice also searched black drivers at twice the rate of whites, but those searches didn't lead to higher rates of seized weapons, drugs or stolen property.\nThe review found that the disparities spanned all seven police districts. The two with the greatest racial discrepancies - Districts 1 and 6 - have the lowest crime rates, and both have predominantly white populations.\nThe disparities found in Milwaukee are greater than other large metro police departments where traffic stop data is collected, including Charlotte, Kansas City, Raleigh and St. Louis.\nIn those jurisdictions, black drivers were stopped between 1.6 and 2.2 times as often as white drivers, according to 2010 data from North Carolina and Missouri. Hispanic drivers in those cities were between 0.7 and 1.2 times as likely to be stopped as whites, taking into account the overall driving-age population. Using that same measure, Milwaukee's disparities were 3.9 for blacks and 2.1 for Hispanics.\nThe Journal Sentinel's review is the first of its kind here. It is based on data from a since-repealed state law that required law enforcement agencies to collect detailed information on every traffic stop.\nState Rep. Tamara Grigsby (D-Milwaukee), who helped draft the traffic data provision, said the newspaper's findings confirm her belief that minority drivers are treated unfairly by police here.\n\"Is racial profiling real?\" said Grigsby, who represents a district on the city's north side. \"It's like water to a fish in my world. There is a feeling, there is an understanding, an unsaid knowledge that this is part of the experience of being a person of color in Wisconsin. It feels like a standard practice in this state.\"\nMilwaukee police officials did not dispute the newspaper's findings, but said traffic stop rates track more closely with suspect and victim demographics than with driving population estimates.\nIn an interview at police headquarters, Police Chief Edward Flynn acknowledged the department's targeted crime-fighting approach can result in disparities because high-crime neighborhoods tend to have larger minority populations.\n\"I would say it's not an unexpected consequence,\" Flynn said. \"If we are going to heavily engage with those communities that are both victimized and from whence a significant majority of our offenders come, we are going to generate disparities because of where we're physically located.\"\nThe findings come as the annual number of traffic stops conducted by Milwaukee police has nearly quadrupled in the past four years, increasing to almost 200,000 stops last year. Police figures through October show the department is on track to make almost as many stops this year.\nThe increase in traffic enforcement is a cornerstone of Flynn's data-driven strategy, which relies on targeted patrols in crime-ridden neighborhoods to disrupt lawbreakers and reduce crime.\nAmong the findings of the Journal Sentinel analysis:\nMilwaukee police stopped 45,703 city residents during the first four months of this year. Nearly 69% of drivers stopped were black. White drivers accounted for 16% of stops, while 14% were stops of Hispanic motorists. The remaining stops were for drivers of other races. Wider disparities emerge when the stop rates are compared to Milwaukee's driving population, based on the number of licensed drivers by race and ethnicity.\nAfter the stop, Milwaukee police searched the vehicles of black drivers twice as often as whites, or one search for every 12 stops. But police found contraband items in searches involving black drivers at almost the same rate as whites - about 22% of the time.\nThe greatest disparity found was in District 1, which encompasses downtown and the east side , where black drivers were stopped 12.6 times as often as whites, and Hispanics were stopped four times as often when the driving-age population was taken into account. Also, black drivers were searched nearly five times as often as white drivers there.\nBlack and Hispanic drivers were arrested at twice the rate of whites after getting stopped, which follows trends in other big cities, researchers said. Meanwhile, white drivers were issued traffic citations at a slightly lower rate than black or Hispanic drivers and were let off with written or oral warnings more often.\nPolice stopped black and Hispanic drivers about five times as often as white drivers solely for equipment violations. Police have wide discretion when enforcing equipment violations such as a broken taillight or overly tinted windows.\nThe disparities found in the Milwaukee police stops are higher than those found for the Wisconsin State Patrol, along with the Milwaukee County and Dane County sheriff's departments - the other law enforcement agencies that made enough traffic stops in the first half of this year to draw conclusions about stop trends.\nThe Journal Sentinel shared its findings with researchers who have studied racial profiling data in Wisconsin and other states. All confirmed the methodology and results of the newspaper's analysis.\nWisconsin's data collection law, which was passed when Democrats controlled the state Legislature and governor's office, was created to determine if minorities were disproportionately stopped or searched. The data include information on the race, age and gender of drivers; reasons for stops and searches; and whether a driver was arrested, cited or given a warning during a traffic stop.\nThe statute went into effect in January but was repealed in June after Republicans had gained control of state government and responded to complaints from some law enforcement agencies that the form used to record traffic stops created unnecessary paperwork and took too much time to complete.\nNo bias, officials say\nMilwaukee police submitted traffic stop data for the first four months of the year, but not for May and June, a review of the database compiled by the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance shows. Police officials said data for May and June was collected, but not sent to the state due to a mistake.\nIn July, Flynn said that his department would continue to collect racial data on traffic stops despite the repeal of the law.\nFlynn credited his department's proactive patrolling approach as a key factor in driving down the city's crime rate. Since he took over in 2008, the Police Department has reported double-digit declines in violent and property crimes.\nFlynn said he is willing to admit that his more aggressive strategy can lead to drivers being stopped more often in high-crime areas. He likened the situation to being frisked at an airport security checkpoint - a necessary safeguard.\n\"Yes, of course we are going to stop lots of innocent people. The point is, do folks understand what their role is as a cooperative citizen in having a safe environment.\" Flynn said.\n\"That level of inconvenience, if it's coupled with respectful treatment, is something communities will accept to be safe. If the price of me walking down my neighborhood in safety is once a month (a police officer stops me), people are going to say 'That's OK with me, it's about time we saw the cops here.' \"\nThe stop data does not provide evidence of police bias or racial profiling by his officers, Flynn said.\n\"Drawing a conclusion of bias is a great stretch just because there is disparity of police intervention,\" he said.\nMayor Tom Barrett said he anticipated that citizen complaints would increase with the dramatic rise in traffic stops conducted by police.\nBut they haven't - traffic stop complaints have dropped 18%, from 40 to 33, through the first 10 months of this year compared with the same period in 2009, when detailed data on complaints related to traffic stops was first collected, police records show. Overall, citizen complaints have fallen 45% since 2007 for the same time period.\n\"I'm very sensitive to the issue of racial profiling,\" Barrett said. \"I don't want a situation where people are being targeted because of their race. At the same time, I do want a community where those who live in the poorest neighborhoods can feel safe. The bottom line question is do people want to have more police presence in their neighborhood. I would venture to guess the answer is yes.\"\nCommon Council President Willie Hines Jr. said there is a delicate balance between effectively policing high-crime areas and respecting the civil rights of residents.\n\"Just because there is increased police presence in a community doesn't mean that innocent people's civil rights should be violated - that shouldn't happen,\" said Hines, who represents a north side district. \"With that said, residents have welcomed the Police Department and appreciate seeing them in the neighborhood.\"\nChris Ahmuty, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, was a member of the advisory committee that assisted in creating the state's traffic stop data collection program.\nWhen told of the Journal Sentinel's findings, Ahmuty said he was concerned residents in minority neighborhoods of Milwaukee are having their rights violated.\n\"It's clear that citywide there is disparity, and when you deploy your people within a segregated city, the impact on some of those communities is going to be felt,\" Ahmuty said. \"If you live in a community where you are constantly being stopped, you are being harmed.\"\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said he understands the difficulties of policing a big city with a high volume of crime and has no reason to doubt the motives of Milwaukee police.\n\"But the police and community have to continue to work to ensure the strategies don't unnecessarily abridge people's rights,\" he said.\nThe higher search rate for black Milwaukee drivers is compelling because they were no more likely to have illegal drugs or weapons than whites, Rosenfeld said.\n\"That's an important piece of information to interpret . . . why are there such vast differences in the stop rates when one does not see differences in contraband found?\" said Rosenfeld, former president of the American Society of Criminology. \"That suggests that at least some of the stops made of blacks might have been unnecessary.\"\nBut Flynn said for a metro police department, finding drugs and weapons is not the sole purpose of searches - the intent is to disrupt criminal activity.\n\"I would say the similarity of hit rates is based on the fact that cops are doing a pretty good job identifying who needs to have their car searched,\" he said. \"If the hit rates are similar, it means they are applying similar judgments to where the questions they're asking are taking them.\"\nTrends in districts\nThe Journal Sentinel mapped where resident traffic stops occurred in the city and compared stop rates to the driving-age population of each of the seven police districts.\nCriminologists who study traffic stop trends suggested breaking data up into subareas because racial and ethnic disparities might be very strong in some areas but go undetected in a citywide analysis.\nAld. Nik Kovac, whose district falls mostly within police District 1, which had the greatest racial disparity, said he stands behind the department's efforts to reduce crime.\n\"I think in the full context of all the data the police are dealing with, the most alarming thing about your data is how segregated our city is, not that our Police Department is acting with inappropriate bias,\" he said. \"I think they are focusing on where the crime is happening.\"\nDistrict 6 on the south side had the second-highest level - the black-to-white disparity was 10 to 1, and the Hispanic-white disparity was nearly four.\nMeanwhile, District 5 on the north side had the smallest traffic stop difference - the black-to-white disparity was three, and there was no difference between Hispanic and white drivers. District 5 has led the city in violent crime since 2007, police data show.\nIn response to the newspaper's analysis, the Police Department shared suspect and victim demographics for each of the seven police districts broken down by race. Flynn said these demographics are a better gauge of stop activity than the driving-age population.\nFor example, police records for the first 10 months of this year show that at least 90% of crime suspects in districts 3, 4, 5 and 7 were black. Meanwhile, black drivers constituted 80% or more of the stops conducted in those districts during the same period, according to department records.\nBy comparison, the driving-age population of those districts is between 48% and 74% black, according to census data analyzed.\n\"The disparities we are generating, we believe, are well within what we would expect given the victimization data and the offender data,\" Flynn said.\nBut letting criminal suspect demographics guide enforcement activity can lead to innocent minorities being caught up in the police net, Rosenfeld said.\n\"The problem is if the suspect profile is so crude to only include the race and gender and age of individuals, then inevitably you are going to stop lots and lots of innocent black people, particularly black men,\" he said. \"Lots of individuals who are stopped will be guilty of nothing other than fitting a crude suspect profile and happening to be in the area where lots of crimes occur. And that's not enough.\"\nAn aggressive patrolling strategy can damage the often fragile relationship between police and residents who could be their allies in high-crime neighborhoods, Rosenfeld said.\nOne of the key reasons Flynn was selected as police chief in late 2007 was that he was well-versed in the community-policing model that Barrett and other local leaders favored. A community policing strategy emphasizes increased interaction and cooperation between police and residents to fight crime.\nDavid Crowley, a legislative aide to Milwaukee County Supervisor Nikiya Harris, said he and his friends feel that Milwaukee police officers have become more antagonistic in how they conduct patrols in recent years.\n\"It seems like they are getting more aggressive, and their intimidation is really what is making people turn off to these police officers now,\" Crowley said.\nRacial profiling has become an accepted fact of life for black residents in the city, he said.\n\"It's been going on so long, a lot of black men don't consider it racial profiling because it's just something that happens automatically if you are black - which is a problem,\" said Crowley, 25.\nHe said profiling sometimes occurs when someone on foot or a bike is questioned, known as a subject stop.\nThose type of stops have also increased dramatically under Flynn's direction, more than tripling from 2007 to last year, records show. Commanders push officers to make them, as they gather information that can lead to arrests, police said.\nIn one incident in September, Crowley said he was walking to the store from his grandparents' house near the intersection of N. 10th and W. Burleigh streets with another young black man. As they rounded the corner, they saw a group of four Milwaukee police squad cars driving down the street. All four squads swerved over to their side of the street, which struck Crowley as a menacing tactic.\n\"Why do you intimidate us?\" he said. \"Why do you have to make us feel like we aren't supposed to be here?\"\nSouth side incident\nIn October 2009, Milwaukee resident Dennis Walton was picking up three friends from a south side nightclub located in District 6, which is largely white.\nHe said was playing reggae music on the factory radio of his Chevy Tahoe when he was stopped by Milwaukee police just after 2 a.m. in the 2900 block of S. 13th St.\nWalton, who is black, said he feels strongly that he was the victim of racial profiling in the incident.\nHe was particularly upset about the stop because he felt he wasn't breaking any laws - his license and registration were valid, and neither he nor his passengers had any outstanding arrest warrants.\n\"Because (the officer) saw four black men on the south side, it was automatically assumed we had some type of warrant or there were some drugs or something,\" said Walton, 37, community outreach director for the Milwaukee Fatherhood Initiative.\nThe officer ran Walton's name and found that he had a valid license and no warrants, the municipal citation shows.\nWalton was issued a $221 ticket for excessive noise because the officer said the music could be heard from more than 50 feet away. Walton disputes that.\nWhile Walton's incident did not happen during the period the data was collected, his story and those of other black men illustrate a long-running concern, he said.\n\"The embarrassment and insult of being totally disrespected in that manner is one of the most dehumanizing experiences that you have. . . . It creates a bitter taste in your mouth and gives you a different perspective of the police,\" Walton said\nFlynn position supported\nFlynn's position on traffic stop activity is generally supported by groups such as the Milwaukee NAACP and the Felmers Chaney Advisory Board, which oversees the Felmers O. Chaney Correctional Center on the north side.\nJames Hall Jr., president of the local NAACP chapter, attended a recent briefing by the Police Department where he was given an explanation of the patrolling tactics used.\nThe NAACP opposes racial or ethnic profiling of any kind, but Hall said his organization has not seen an increase in racial profiling complaints received in recent years.\n\"We believe a factor that directly contributes to the disparity in traffic stops between racial and ethnic groups is the confluence of concentrated poverty and residential segregation,\" Hall said in a statement. \"We must collectively make it a priority to ameliorate these conditions.\"\nR.L. McNeely, chairman of the Felmers Chaney Advisory Board, said that his group is not opposed to the significant increase in traffic stop activity by Milwaukee police, but said the racial discrepancies raise \"possible concern.\"\nA lawyer and a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, McNeely said he was concerned specifically with the finding that the disparities are greatest in Police District 1.\n\"Although the data appear potentially disturbing in several respects, our overarching concern is a reduction in crime,\" McNeely said in a statement, \"because the street crime being abated by MPD's concentrated presence is the type of crime that ultimately disrupts, destabilizes and destroys black neighborhoods.\"\nPrimitivo Torres, president of Voces de la Frontera in Milwaukee, said his immigrant rights organization has noticed an increase in ethnic profiling complaints in the past year in the city.\n\"It was always there, but never to this extent,\" Torres said. \"We are seeing cases almost on a weekly basis. We ask why they are being stopped, and we can't find out why.\"\nFlynn encouraged anyone to come forward to the police if they have specific information about a racial profiling incident or wish to file a complaint.\nAny racial profiling or harassment by police diminishes the quality of life for minorities in the city, Walton said.\n\"It's beyond civil rights, it's human rights,\" Walton said. \"That distinction really needs to be made when we talk about violations that people are suffering. You are obstructing people's rights to move freely and to live their life.\"\nGot a story tip?\nEmail, call 414-224-2318 or use our tip form.\nMeet the Watchdog team\nFollow our work on Twitter @js_watchdog\nAdvertisement\nDogged Blog\nNo Quarter Blog\nDaniel Bice, the Journal Sentinel's watchdog columnist, holds politicians and the powerful accountable\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening.

L. 111–5 (text) (PDF)), nicknamed the Recovery Act, was a stimulus package enacted by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2009. Developed in response to the Great Recession, the primary objective of this federal statute was to save existing jobs and create new ones as soon as possible. Other objectives were to provide temporary relief programs for those most affected by the recession and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy.\nThe approximate cost of the economic stimulus package was estimated to be $787 billion at the time of passage, later revised to $831 billion between 2009 and 2019.[1] The ARRA's rationale was based on the Keynesian economic theory that, during recessions, the government should offset the decrease in private spending with an increase in public spending in order to save jobs and stop further economic deterioration.\nThe politics around the stimulus were very contentious, with Republicans criticizing the size of the stimulus. On the right, it spurred the Tea Party movement and may have contributed to Republicans winning the House in the 2010 midterm elections.[2][3][4] Not a single Republican member of the House voted for the stimulus,[5] and only three Republican senators voted for it.[6] Most economists agree that the stimulus was smaller than needed.[3][7][8] Surveys of economists show overwhelming agreement that the stimulus reduced unemployment,[9][10] and that the benefits of the stimulus outweigh the cost.[9]\nLegislative history\n[edit]Both the House and the Senate versions of the bills were primarily written by Democratic congressional committee leaders and their staffs.[11] Because work on the bills started before President Obama officially took office on January 20, 2009, top aides to President-Elect Obama held multiple meetings with committee leaders and staffers. On January 10, 2009, President-Elect Obama's administration released a report[12] that provided a preliminary analysis of the impact to jobs of some of the prototypical recovery packages that were being considered.\nHouse of Representatives assembly\n[edit]The House version of the bill, H.R. 1, was introduced on January 26, 2009[13] by Dave Obey, the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, and was co-sponsored by nine other Democrats. On January 23, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the bill was on track to be presented to President Obama for him to sign into law before February 16, 2009.[14] Although 206 amendments were scheduled for floor votes, they were combined into only 11, which enabled quicker passage of the bill.[15]\nOn January 28, 2009, the House passed the bill by a 244–188 vote.[16] All but 11 Democrats voted for the bill, but not a single Republican voted in favor: 177 Republicans voted against it, while one Republican (Ginny Brown-Waite) did not vote.[17]\nSenate\n[edit]The Senate version of the bill, S. 1, was introduced on January 6, 2009, and later substituted as an amendment to the House bill, SA 570. It was sponsored by Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, co-sponsored by 16 other Democrats and Joe Lieberman, an independent who caucused with the Democrats.\nThe Senate then began consideration of the bill starting with the $275 billion tax provisions in the week of February 2, 2009.[14] A significant difference between the House version and the Senate version was the inclusion of a one-year extension of revisions to the alternative minimum tax, which added $70 billion to the bill's total.\nRepublicans proposed several amendments to the bill directed at increasing the share of tax cuts and downsizing spending as well as decreasing the overall price.[18] President Obama and Senate Democrats hinted that they would be willing to compromise on Republican suggestions to increase infrastructure spending and to double the housing tax credit proposed from $7,500 to $15,000 and expand its application to all home buyers, not just first-time buyers.[19] Other considered amendments included the Freedom Act of 2009, an amendment proposed by Senate Finance Committee members Maria Cantwell (D) and Orrin Hatch (R) to include tax incentives for plug-in electric vehicles.[20]\nThe Senate called a special Saturday debate session for February 7 at the urging of President Obama. The Senate voted, 61–36 (with 2 not voting) on February 9 to end debate on the bill and advance it to the Senate floor to vote on the bill itself.[21] On February 10, the Senate voted 61–37 (with one not voting)[22] All the Democrats voted in favor, but only three Republicans voted in favor (Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, and Arlen Specter).[23] Specter switched to the Democratic Party later in the year. At one point, the Senate bill stood at $838 billion.[24]\nComparison of the House, Senate and Conference versions\n[edit]Senate Republicans forced a near unprecedented level of changes (near $150 billion) in the House bill, which had more closely followed the Obama plan. A comparison of the $827 billion economic recovery plan drafted by Senate Democrats with an $820 billion version passed by the House and the final $787 billion conference version shows huge shifts within these similar totals. Additional debt costs would add about $350 billion or more over 10 years. Many provisions were set to expire in two years.[25]\nThe main funding differences between the Senate bill and the House bill were: More funds for health care in the Senate ($153.3 vs $140 billion), renewable energy programs ($74 vs. $39.4 billion), for home buyers tax credit ($35.5 vs. $2.6 billion), new payments to the elderly and a one-year increase in AMT limits. The House had more funds appropriated for education ($143 vs. $119.1 billion), infrastructure ($90.4 vs. $62 billion) and for aid to low income workers and the unemployed ($71.5 vs. $66.5 billion).[24]\nSpending (Senate – $552 billion, House – $545 billion)\n[edit]- Aid to low-income workers and the unemployed\n- Senate – $47 billion to provide extended unemployment benefits through December 31, increased by $25 a week, and provide job training; $16.5 billion to increase food stamp benefits by 12 percent through fiscal 2011 and issue a one-time bonus payment; $3 billion in temporary welfare payments.\n- House – Comparable extension of unemployment insurance; $20 billion to increase food stamp benefits by 14 percent; $2.5 billion in temporary welfare payments; $1 billion for home heating subsidies and $1 billion for community action agencies.\n- Direct cash payments\n- Senate – $17 billion to give one-time $300 payments to recipients of Supplemental Security Income and Social Security, and veterans receiving disability and pensions.\n- House – $4 billion to provide a one-time additional Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance payment to the elderly, of $450 for individuals and $630 for married couples.\n- Conference – $250 one-time payment to each recipient of Supplemental Security Income, Social Security (Regular & Disability) Insurance, Veterans pension, Railroad Retirement, or State retirement system[26]\n- Infrastructure\n- Senate – $46 billion for transportation projects, including $27 billion for highway and bridge construction and repair and $11.5 billion for mass transit and rail projects; $4.6 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers; $5 billion for public housing improvements; $6.4 billion for clean and drinking water projects.\n- House – $47 billion for transportation projects, including $27 billion for highway and bridge construction and repair and $12 billion for mass transit, including $7.5 billion to buy transit equipment such as buses; and $31 billion to build and repair federal buildings and other public infrastructures.\n- Health care\n- Senate – $21 billion to subsidize the cost of continuing health care insurance for the involuntarily unemployed under the COBRA program; $87 billion to help states with Medicaid; $22 billion to modernize health information technology systems; and $10 billion for health research and construction of National Institutes of Health facilities.\n- House – $40 billion to subsidize the cost of continuing health care insurance for the involuntarily unemployed under the COBRA program or provide health care through Medicaid; $87 billion to help states with Medicaid; $20 billion to modernize health information technology systems; $4 billion for preventive care; $1.5 billion for community health centers; $420 million to combat avian flu; $335 million for programs that combat AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.\n- Conference – A 65% COBRA subsidy for 9 months will apply to workers laid off between Sep 1, 2008 and Dec 31, 2009. Those already laid off have 60 days to apply for COBRA.[27]\n- Education\n- Senate – $55 billion in state fiscal relief to prevent cuts in education aid and provide block grants; $25 billion to school districts to fund special education and the No Child Left Behind K–12 law; $14 billion to boost the maximum Pell Grant by $400 to $5,250; $2 billion for Head Start.\n- House – Similar aid to states and school districts; $21 billion for school modernization; $16 billion to boost the maximum Pell Grant by $500 to $5,350; $2 billion for Head Start.\n- Conference – The Conference Report merged most education aid with the State Fiscal Stabilization fund (administered by the Department of Education) and gave power over the funds to each governor under voluminous restrictions. The Governor is \"Required\" to spend $45 billion of the money on education to restore funding to 2008 levels but the mechanisms to enforce state maintenance of effort at 2005–06 levels are complex and potentially impossible to implement.[28] Hard hit states such as Nevada cannot possibly find enough funds to get to the 2005–06 state funding levels for education.[29] Some states with no current budget cuts for education, such as Arkansas and North Carolina, may get nothing.[30] This will result in a monumental 50 state legal and political fight over how to re-budget to best take advantage of the federal legislation. Many states will further reduce state funds for education to the 2005–06 minimum so these state resources can be used for other state priorities and the net gain for education will be far less than the total federal appropriation.\n- Energy\n- Senate – $40 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including $2.9 billion to weatherize modest-income homes; $4.6 billion for fossil fuel research and development; $6.4 billion to clean up nuclear weapons production sites; $11 billion toward a smart electricity grid to reduce waste; $8.5 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy projects; and $2 billion for advanced battery systems.\n- House – $28.4 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including $6.2 billion to weatherize homes; $11 billion to fund a smart electricity grid.\n- Homeland security\n- Senate – $4.7 billion for homeland security programs, including $1 billion for airport screening equipment and $800 million for port security.\n- House – $1.1 billion, including $500 million for airport screening equipment.\n- Law enforcement\n- Senate – $3.5 billion in grants to state and local law enforcement to hire officers and purchase equipment.\n- House – Comparable provision.\nTax changes ($275 billion)\n[edit]- House – About $145 billion for $500 per-worker, $1,000 per-couple tax credits in 2009 and 2010. For the last half of 2009, workers could expect to see about $20 a week less withheld from their paychecks starting around June. Millions of Americans who do not make enough money to pay federal income taxes could file returns next year and receive checks. Individuals making more than $75,000 and couples making more than $150,000 would receive reduced amounts.\n- Senate – The credit would phase out at incomes of $70,000 for individuals and couples making more than $140,000 and phase out more quickly, reducing the cost to $140 billion.\n- Conference – Tax Credit reduced to $400 per worker and $800 per couple in 2009 and 2010 and phaseout begins at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. Note retirees with no wages get nothing.[31]\n- Alternative minimum tax\n- House – No provision.\n- Senate – About $70 billion to prevent 24 million taxpayers from paying the alternative minimum tax in 2009. The tax was designed to make sure wealthy taxpayers cannot use credits and deductions to avoid paying any taxes or paying at a far lower rate than would otherwise be possible. But it was never indexed to inflation, so critics now contend it taxes people it was not intended to. Congress addresses it each year, usually in the fall.\n- Conference – Includes a one-year increase in AMT floor to $70,950 for joint filers for 2009.[31]\n- Expanded child credit\n- House – $18.3 billion to give greater access to the $1,000 per-child tax credit for low income workers in 2009 and 2010. Under current law, workers must make at least $12,550 to receive any portion of the credit. The change eliminates the floor, meaning more workers who pay no federal income taxes could receive checks.\n- Senate – Sets a new income threshold of $8,100 to receive any portion of the credit, reducing the cost to $7.5 billion.\n- Conference – The income floor for refunds was set at $3,000 for 2009 & 2010.[32]\n- Expanded earned income tax credit\n- House – $4.7 billion to increase the earned income tax credit – which provides money to low income workers – for families with at least three children.\n- Senate – Same.\n- Expanded college credit\n- House – $13.7 billion to provide a $2,500 expanded tax credit for college tuition and related expenses for 2009 and 2010. The credit is phased out for couples making more than $160,000.\n- Senate – Reduces the amount that can be refunded to low-income families that pay no income taxes, lowering the cost to $13 billion.\n- Homebuyer credit\n- House – $2.6 billion to repeal a requirement that a $7,500 first-time homebuyer tax credit be paid back over time for homes purchased from Jan 1 to July 1, unless the home is sold within three years. The credit is phased out for couples making more than $150,000.\n- Senate – Doubles the credit to $15,000 for homes purchased for a year after the bill takes effect, increasing the cost to $35.5 billion.\n- Conference – $8,000 credit for all homes bought between 1/1/2009 and 12/1/2009 and repayment provision repealed for homes purchased in 2009 and held more than three years.[32]\n- Home energy credit\n- House – $4.3 billion to provide an expanded credit to homeowners who make their homes more energy-efficient in 2009 and 2010. Homeowners could recoup 30 percent of the cost up to $1,500 of numerous projects, such as installing energy-efficient windows, doors, furnaces and air conditioners.\n- Senate – Same.\n- Conference – Same.\n- Unemployment\n- House – No similar provision.\n- Senate – $4.7 billion to exclude from taxation the first $2,400 a person receives in unemployment compensation benefits in 2009.\n- Conference – Same as Senate\n- Bonus depreciation\n- House – $5 billion to extend a provision allowing businesses buying equipment such as computers to speed up its depreciation through 2009.\n- Senate – Similar.\n- Money-losing companies\n- House – $15 billion to allow companies to use current losses to offset profits made in the previous five years, instead of two, making them eligible for tax refunds.\n- Senate – Allows companies to use more of their losses to offset previous profits, increasing the cost to $19.5 billion.\n- Conference – Limits the carry-back to small companies, revenue under $5 million[33]\n- Government contractors\n- House – Repeal a law that takes effect in 2011, requiring government agencies to withhold three percent of payments to contractors to help ensure they pay their tax bills. Repealing the law would cost $11 billion over 10 years, in part because the government could not earn interest by holding the money throughout the year.\n- Senate – Delays the law from taking effect until 2012, reducing the cost to $291 million.\n- Energy production\n- House – $13 billion to extend tax credits for renewable energy production.\n- Senate – Same.\n- Conference – Extension is to 2014.\n- Repeal bank credit\n- House – Repeal a Treasury provision that allowed firms that buy money-losing banks to use more of the losses as tax credits to offset the profits of the merged banks for tax purposes. The change would increase taxes on the merged banks by $7 billion over 10 years.\n- Senate – Same.\n- House – $36 billion to subsidize locally issued bonds for school construction, teacher training, economic development and infrastructure improvements.\n- Senate – $22.8 billion to subsidize locally issued bonds for school construction, industrial development and infrastructure improvements.\n- Auto sales\nConference report\n[edit]Congressional negotiators said that they had completed the Conference Report on February 11.[35] On February 12, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer scheduled the vote on the bill for the next day, before wording on the bill's content had been completed and despite House Democrats having previously promised to allow a 48-hour public review period before any vote. The Report with final handwritten provisions was posted on a House website that evening.[36][37] On February 13, the Report passed the House, 246–183, largely along party lines with all 246 Yes votes given by Democrats and the Nay vote split between 176 Republicans and 7 Democrats.[38][39]\nThe Senate passed the bill, 60–38, with all Democrats and Independents voting for the bill along with three Republicans. On February 17, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Recovery Act into law.\nProvisions of the act\n[edit]Section 3 of the ARRA listed the basic intent behind crafting the law. This Statement of Purpose included the following:\n- To preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery.\n- To assist those most impacted by the recession.\n- To provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health.\n- To invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits.\n- To stabilize State and local government budgets, in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases.\nThe act specifies that 37% of the package is to be devoted to tax incentives equaling $288 billion and $144 billion, or 18%, is allocated to state and local fiscal relief (more than 90% of the state aid is going to Medicaid and education). The remaining 45%, or $357 billion, is allocated to federal spending programs such as transportation, communication, wastewater, and sewer infrastructure improvements; energy efficiency upgrades in private and federal buildings; extension of federal unemployment benefits; and scientific research programs. The following are details to the different parts of the final bill and the selected citizen to receive this Government Grants have to come up with $350 for the activation and they must clear the state tax according to the state percentage that will be refund it back along with the Grants.:[44][45][46][43]\nTax incentives for individuals\n[edit]Total: $237 billion\n- $116 billion: New payroll tax credit of $400 per worker and $800 per couple in 2009 and 2010.

This only applies to first-time homebuyers.[47]\n- $4.7 billion: Excluding from taxation the first $2,400 a person receives in unemployment compensation benefits in 2009.\n- $4.7 billion: Expanded earned income tax credit to increase the earned income tax credit – which provides money to low income workers – for families with at least three children.\n- $4.3 billion: Home energy credit to provide an expanded credit to homeowners who make their homes more energy-efficient in 2009 and 2010. Homeowners could recoup 30 percent of the cost up to $1,500 of numerous projects, such as installing energy-efficient windows, doors, furnaces and air conditioners.\n- $1.7 billion: for deduction of sales tax from car purchases, not interest payments phased out for incomes above $250,000.\nTax incentives for companies\n[edit]Total: $51 billion\n- $15 billion: Allowing companies to use current losses to offset profits made in the previous five years, instead of two, making them eligible for tax refunds.\n- $13 billion: to extend tax credits for renewable energy production (until 2014).\n- $11 billion: Government contractors: Repeal a law that takes effect in 2012, requiring government agencies to withhold three percent of payments to contractors to help ensure they pay their tax bills.

Sherbrooke Mayor Jean Perrault, president of the federation, stated, \"This U.S. protectionist policy is hurting Canadian firms, costing Canadian jobs and damaging Canadian efforts to grow in the world-wide recession.\" On February 16, 2010, the United States and Canada agreed on exempting Canadian companies from Buy American provisions, which would have hurt the Canadian economy.[65][66]\nRecommendations by economists\n[edit]Economists such as Martin Feldstein, Daron Acemoğlu, National Economic Council director Larry Summers, and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winners Joseph Stiglitz[67] and Paul Krugman[68] favored a larger economic stimulus to counter the economic downturn. While in favor of a stimulus package, Feldstein expressed concern over the act as written, saying it needed revision to address consumer spending and unemployment more directly.[69] Just after the bill was enacted, Krugman wrote that the stimulus was too small to deal with the problem, adding, \"And it's widely believed that political considerations led to a plan that was weaker and contains more tax cuts than it should have – that Mr. Obama compromised in advance in the hope of gaining broad bipartisan support.\"[70] Conservative economist John Lott was more critical of the government spending.[71]\nOn January 28, 2009, a full-page advertisement with the names of approximately 200 economists who were against Obama's plan appeared in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. This included Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates Edward C. Prescott, Vernon L. Smith, and James M. Buchanan. The economists denied the quoted statement by President Obama that there was \"no disagreement that we need action by our government, a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy\". Instead, the signers believed that \"to improve the economy, policymakers should focus on reforms that remove impediments to work, saving, investment and production. Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth.\"[72] The funding for this advertisement came from the Cato Institute.[73]\nOn February 8, 2009, a letter to Congress signed by about 200 economists in favor of the stimulus, written by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said that Obama's plan \"proposes important investments that can start to overcome the nation's damaging loss of jobs\", and would \"put the United States back onto a sustainable long-term-growth path\".[74] This letter was signed by Nobel Memorial laureates Kenneth Arrow, Lawrence R. Klein, Eric Maskin, Daniel McFadden, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow. The New York Times published projections from IHS Global Insight, Moodys.com, Economy.com and Macroeconomic Advisers that indicated that the economy may have been worse without the ARRA.[75][76]\nA 2019 study in the American Economic Journal found that the stimulus had a positive impact on the US economy, but that the positive impact would have been greater if the stimulus had been more frontloaded.[77]\nCongressional Budget Office reports\n[edit]The CBO estimated ARRA would positively impact GDP and employment. It projected an increase in the GDP of between 1.4 percent and 3.8 percent by the end of 2009, between 1.1 percent and 3.3 percent by the end of 2010, between 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent by the end of 2011, and a decrease of between zero and 0.2 percent beyond 2014.[78] The impact to employment would be an increase of 0.8 million to 2.3 million by the end of 2009, an increase of 1.2 million to 3.6 million by the end of 2010, an increase of 0.6 million to 1.9 million by the end of 2011, and declining increases in subsequent years as the U.S. labor market reaches nearly full employment, but never negative.[78] Decreases in GDP in 2014 and beyond are accounted for by crowding out, where government debt absorbs finances that would otherwise go toward investment.[78] A 2013 study by economists Stephen Marglin and Peter Spiegler found the stimulus had boosted GDP in line with CBO estimates.[79]\nA February 4, 2009, report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said that while the stimulus would increase economic output and employment in the short run, the GDP would, by 2019, have an estimated net decrease between 0.1% and 0.3% (as compared to the CBO estimated baseline).[80]\nThe CBO estimated that enacting the bill would increase federal budget deficits by $185 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $399 billion in 2010, and by $134 billion in 2011, or $787 billion over the 2009–2019 period.[81]\nIn a February 11 letter, CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf noted that there was disagreement among economists about the effectiveness of the stimulus, with some skeptical of any significant effects while others expecting very large effects.[78] Elmendorf said the CBO expected short term increases in GDP and employment.[78] In the long term, the CBO expects the legislation to reduce output slightly by increasing the nation's debt and crowding out private investment, but noted that other factors, such as improvements to roads and highways and increased spending for basic research and education may offset the decrease in output and that crowding out was not an issue in the short term because private investment was already decreasing in response to decreased demand.[78]\nIn February 2015, the CBO released its final analysis of the results of the law, which found that during six years:[82]\n- Real GDP was boosted by an average ranging from a low of 1.7% to a high of 9.2%\n- The unemployment rate was reduced by an average ranging from a low of 1.1 percentage points to a high of 4.8 percentage points\n- Full-time equivalent employment-years was boosted by an average ranging from 2.1 million to 11.6 million\n- Total outlays were $663 billion, of which $97 billion were refundable tax credits\nRecovery.gov\n[edit]A May 21, 2009, article in The Washington Post stated, \"To build support for the stimulus package, President Obama vowed unprecedented transparency, a big part of which, he said, would be allowing taxpayers to track money to the street level on Recovery.gov...\" But three months after the bill was signed, Recovery.gov offers little beyond news releases, general breakdowns of spending, and acronym-laden spreadsheets and timelines.\" The same article also stated, \"Unlike the government site, the privately run Recovery.org is actually providing detailed information about how the $787 billion in stimulus money is being spent.\"[83]\nReports regarding errors in reporting on the Web site made national news. News stories circulated about Recovery.gov reporting fund distribution to congressional districts that did not exist.[84][85]\nA new Recovery.gov website was redesigned at a cost estimated to be $9.5 million (~$13.3 million in 2024) through January 2010.[86]\nOn July 20, 2009, the Drudge Report published links to pages on Recovery.gov that Drudge alleged were detailing expensive contracts awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for items such as individual portions of mozzarella cheese, frozen ham and canned pork, costing hundreds of thousands to over a million dollars. A statement released by the USDA the same day corrected the allegation, stating that \"references to '2 pound frozen ham sliced' are to the sizes of the packaging. Press reports suggesting that the Recovery Act spent $1.191 million to buy \"2 pounds of ham\" are wrong. In fact, the contract in question purchased 760,000 pounds of ham for $1.191 million, at a cost of approximately $1.50 per pound.\"[87]\nAs of 2016, the servers for recovery.gov have been shut down and the site is unavailable.[88]\nDevelopments under the act and estimates of the act's effects\n[edit]The Congressional Budget Office reported in October 2009 the reasons for the changes in the 2008 and 2009 deficits, which were approximately $460 billion and $1.41 trillion, respectively. The CBO estimated that ARRA increased the deficit by $200 billion (~$283 billion in 2024) for 2009, split evenly between tax cuts and additional spending, excluding any feedback effects on the economy.[89]\nOn February 12, 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which regularly issues economic reports, published job-loss data on a month-by-month basis since 2000.[90] Organizing for America, a community organizing project of the Democratic National Committee, prepared a chart presenting the BLS data for the period beginning in December 2007. OFA used the chart to argue, \"As a result [of the Recovery Act], job losses are a fraction of what they were a year ago, before the Recovery Act began.\"[91] Others argue that job losses always grow early in a recession and naturally slow down with or without government stimulus spending, and that the OFA chart was misleading.\nIn the primary justification for the stimulus package, the Obama administration and Democratic proponents presented a graph in January 2009 showing the projected unemployment rate with and without the ARRA.[12] The graph showed that if ARRA was not enacted the unemployment rate would exceed 9%; but if ARRA was enacted it would never exceed 8%. After ARRA became law, the actual unemployment rate exceeded 8% in February 2009, exceeded 9% in May 2009, and exceeded 10% in October 2009. The actual unemployment rate was 9.2% in June 2011 when it was projected to be below 7% with the ARRA. However, supporters of the ARRA claim that this can be accounted for by noting that the actual recession was subsequently revealed to be much worse than any projections at the time when the ARRA was drawn up.[citation needed]\nAccording to a March 2009 Industry Survey of and by the National Association of Business Economists, 60.3% of their economists who had reviewed the fiscal stimulus enacted in February 2009 projected it would have a modest impact in shortening the recession, with 29.4% anticipating little or no impact as well as 10.3% predicting a strong impact. The aspects of the stimulus expected by the NABE to have the greatest effectiveness were physical infrastructure, unemployment benefits expansion, and personal tax-rate cuts.[92]\nOne year after the stimulus, several independent macroeconomic firms, including Moody's and IHS Global Insight, estimated that the stimulus saved or created 1.6 to 1.8 million jobs and forecast a total impact of 2.5 million jobs saved by the time the stimulus is completed.[93] The Congressional Budget Office considered these estimates conservative.[93] The CBO estimated according to its model 2.1 million jobs saved in the last quarter of 2009, boosting the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by up to 2.1 percent.[94] The CBO projected that the package would have an even greater impact in 2010.[94] The CBO also said, \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"[95] The CBO's report on the first quarter of 2010 showed a continued positive effect, with an employment gain in that quarter of up to 2.8 million and a GDP boost of up to 4.2 percent.[96] Economists Timothy Conley of the University of Western Ontario and Bill Dupor of the Ohio State University found that while the stimulus' effects on public sector job creation were unambiguously positive, the effects on private sector job creation were ambiguous.[97] Economist Dan Wilson of the Federal Reserve, who used similar methodology, without the same identified errors, estimates that \"ARRA spending created or saved about 2 million jobs in its first year and over 3 million by March 2011.\"[98]\nThe CBO also revised its assessment of the long-term impact of the bill. After 2014, the stimulus is estimated to decrease output by zero to 0.2%. The stimulus is not expected to have a negative impact on employment in any period of time.[99]\nIn 2011, the Department of Commerce revised some of its previous estimates. Economist Dean Baker commented:\n[T]he revised data ... showed that the economy was plunging even more rapidly than we had previously recognised in the two quarters following the collapse of Lehman. Yet, the plunge stopped in the second quarter of 2009 – just as the stimulus came on line. This was followed by respectable growth over the next four quarters. Growth then weakened again as the impact of the stimulus began to fade at the end of 2010 and the start of this year. In other words, the growth pattern shown by the revised data sure makes it appear that the stimulus worked. The main problem would seem to be that the stimulus was not big enough and it wasn't left in place long enough to lift the economy to anywhere near potential output.[100]\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) established a \"Hypocrisy Hall of Fame\" to list Republican Representatives who had voted against ARRA but who then sought or took credit for ARRA programs in their districts. As of September 2011, the DCCC was listing 128 House Republicans in this category.[101] Newsweek reported that many of the Republican legislators who publicly argued that the stimulus would not create jobs were writing letters seeking stimulus programs for their districts on the grounds that the spending would create jobs.[102]\nThe stimulus has been criticized as being too small. In July 2010, a group of 40 prominent economists issued a statement calling for expanded stimulus programs to reduce unemployment. They also challenged the view that the priority should be reducing the deficit: \"Making deficit reduction the first target, without addressing the chronic underlying deficiency of demand, is exactly the error of the 1930s.\"[103]\nIn July 2010, the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated that the stimulus had \"saved or created between 2.5 and 3.6 million jobs as of the second quarter of 2010\".[104] At that point, spending outlays under the stimulus totaled $257 billion and tax cuts totaled $223 billion.[105] In July 2011, the CEA estimated that as of the first quarter of 2011,[106] the ARRA raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between 2.4 and 3.6 million. The sum of outlays and tax cuts up to this point was $666 billion. Using a straight mathematical calculation, critics reported that the ARRA cost taxpayers between $185,000 to $278,000 per job that was created, though this computation does not include the permanent infrastructure that resulted.\nIn August 2010, Republican Senators Tom Coburn and John McCain released a report listing 100 projects it described as the \"most wasteful projects\" funded by the act. In total, the projects questioned by the two senators amounted to about $15 billion, or less than 2% of the $862 billion. The two senators did concede that the stimulus has had a positive effect on the economy, though they criticized it for failing to give \"the biggest bang for our buck\" on the issue of job creation. CNN noted that the two senators' stated objections were brief summaries presenting selective accounts that were unclear, and the journalists pointed out several instances where they created erroneous impressions.[107]\nOne of the primary purposes and promises of the act was to launch a large number of \"shovel ready\" projects that would generate jobs.[108] However, a sizable number of these projects, most of which pertained to infrastructure, took longer to implement than they had expected by most.[109] By 2010, Obama said he had come to realize 'there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects.'[110]\nSome of the tax incentives in the act, including those related to the American opportunity tax credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, were extended for a further two years by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.[111]\nIn November 2011, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) updated its earlier reports concerning the act. The CBO stated that \"the employment effects began to wane at the end of 2010 and have continued to do so throughout 2011.\" Nevertheless, in the third quarter of 2011, the CBO estimated that the act had increased the number of full-time equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million.[112] Section 1513 of the Recovery Act stated that reports on the impact of the act were to be submitted quarterly, however the last report issued occurred for the second quarter of 2011.[113] As of December 2012, 58.6% of Americans are employed.[114][115]\nIn 2013, the Reason Foundation, an American libertarian group, conducted a study of the results of the ARRA. Only 23% of the 8,381 sampled companies hired new workers and kept all of them when the project was completed. Also, just 41% of sampled companies hired workers at all, while 30% of sampled companies did hire but laid off all workers once the government money stopped funding.[116] These results cast doubt on previously stated estimates of job creation numbers, which do not factor those companies that did not retain their workers or hire any at all.\nIn February 2014, the White House stated in a release that the stimulus measure saved or created an average of 1.6 million jobs a year between 2009 and 2012, thus averting having the recession descend into another Great Depression. Republicans, such as House speaker John Boehner of Ohio, criticized the report since, in their views, the act cost too much for too little result.[117]\nOversight and administration\n[edit]In addition to the Vice President Biden's oversight role, a high-level advisory body, the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board (later renamed and reconstituted as the \"President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness\"), was named concurrent to the passage of the act.\nAs well, the president named Inspector General of the United States Department of the Interior Earl Devaney and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) to monitor administration of the act, and prevent low levels of fraud, waste and loss in fund allocation.[118][119] Eleven other inspectors general served on the RATB, and the board also had a Recovery Independent Advisory Panel.\nIn late 2011, Devaney and his fellow inspectors general on RATB, and more who were not, were credited with avoiding any major scandals in the administration of the act, in the eyes of one Washington observer.[120]\nIn May 2016, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), launched the first steps of an investigation into a part of the stimulus law that gave grants to solar and green energy companies. Hatch sent a letter to the IRS and Treasury Department with a list of questions about the program. According to the Wall Street Journal, letters from senior senators who chair committees can lead to formal investigations by Congress.[121]\nOne part of the stimulus law, Section 1603, gave cash grants to solar companies to encourage investment in solar technology. Because many companies did not yet make a profit in 2009 in that industry, they were offered cash instead of tax credits. In September 2015, the U.S. government asked that a Spanish company return $1 million (~$1.29 million in 2024) it had received from the program. The company issued a statement saying it fully complied with the request.[121]\nSee also\n[edit]- Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998\n- 2008 financial crisis\n- Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\n- 2009 energy efficiency and renewable energy research investment\n- 2010 United States federal budget\n- Build America Bonds\n- Economic Recovery and Middle-Class Tax Relief Act of 2009\n- Energy law of the United States\n- 2008 European Union stimulus plan\n- Federalreporting.gov\n- Pathways out of Poverty (POP)\n- Race to the Top\n- School Improvement Grant\n- Tax Credit Assistance Program\n- American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Estimated Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Employment and Economic Output from October 2011 Through December 2011\" (PDF).

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way.

Dallas, which has added more than 50,000 high-skill professional, scientific and technical industry jobs in the last five years, came in third.\nOverall, six Florida and four California cities ranked among the top-25 Best-Performing Cities. California’s Inland Empire (Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario) jumped 24 places and made the top-20 for the first time in a decade. Also posting double-digit gains were the Florida regions of Sarasota-Bradenton, West Palm Beach-Boca Raton, and Tampa-St. Petersburg.\nSan Jose, CA, last year’s top city, is showing signs of slowing and dropped ten places to #11 overall.\nBest-Performing Cities Ranking (Large Cities/Metropolitan Areas)\n- Provo-Orem, UT\n- Raleigh, NC\n- Dallas-Plano-Irving, TX\n- San Francisco-Redwood City-South San Francisco, CA\n- Fort Collins, CO\n- North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, FL\n- Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL\n- Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN\n- Austin-Round Rock, TX\n- Salt Lake City, UT\n- San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA\n- West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach, FL\n- Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC\n- Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA\n- Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL\n- Oakland-Hayward-Berkeley, CA\n- Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, WA\n- Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL\n- San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX\n- Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA\n- Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach, FL\n- Charleston-North Charleston, SC\n- Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO\n- Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA\n- Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR-MO\nBest-Performing Cities Ranking (Small Cities/Metropolitan Areas)\n- Bend-Redmond, OR\n- St. George, UT\n- Gainesville, GA\n- San Rafael, CA\n- Wenatchee, WA\n- Elkhart-Goshen, IN\n- Yuba City, CA\n- Bellingham, WA\n- Columbus, IN\n- Auburn-Opelika, AL\nThe Milken Institute Best-Performing Cities Index has been published annually since 1999. The index uses fact-based metrics in nine categories to evaluate the relative growth of metropolitan areas. Metrics include growth in jobs, wages and salaries, and technology output over time. The index also measures high-tech fields whose concentrations in a metropolitan area are higher than the national average.\n“Provo-Orem, UT outperformed all other metros by a wide margin,” said Minoli Ratnatunga, Milken Institute director of regional economic research. “Home to Brigham Young University (BYU) and a growing technology and entrepreneurial community, the region is adding to its workforce and reaping the rewards of a vibrant industry on the broader economy.”\nSalt Lake City also ranked among the top 10 large cities, while St. George, UT ranked second among Best-Performing Small Cities, making three Utah communities in the top tier of more than 400 regions evaluated.\n\"Utah's strong entrepreneurial spirit and business-friendly environment allow companies to grow in communities big and small,\" said Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah. \"As we invest in our skilled workforce and diverse economy, we continue to improve job opportunities and quality of life for residents statewide.\"\nThe Milken Institute’s Best-Performing Cities index (www.best-cities.org) provides an objective benchmark for examining which regional strategies are succeeding.\n“Metropolitan areas are crucial drivers of growth in the American economy, taking different paths to prosperity depending on their industry mix, policy choices, and available resources. While some parts of the country are thriving, others are falling behind,” explains Kevin Klowden, executive director of the Milken Institute’s Center for Regional Economics. “Our goal is to help businesses, investors, industry associations, development agencies, government officials, academics, and public-policy groups monitor and evaluate how well their region is adapting to and planning for both current and future economic trends.”\nThe full report, including tables with all 401 large and small regions evaluated, is available online at www.milkeninstitute.org.\nAbout the Center for Regional Economics\nThe Center for Regional Economics promotes prosperity and sustainable growth by increasing understanding of the dynamics that drive job creation and fosters industry expansion. The Center’s research and programs develop and disseminate innovative, actionable economic and policy solutions that provide change makers with the tools to create jobs and improve access to capital.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

When lawmakers passed these new requirements, particularly voter ID laws, they claimed it was to safeguard against voter fraud and protect election integrity. But occasionally we have seen politicians slip — and reveal a more strategic motive for these laws.\nWisconsin Congressman Admits Voter ID Will Help GOP Win in 2016\nResponding to an interview question about Republican’s chance at the presidency in 2016, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothmann (R-Wisc.) responded, “Hilary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever out up, and now we have voter ID and I think voter ID is going to make a little bit of a difference as well.” Grothman helped passed the voter ID law in 2011 when he served as assistant majority leader in the State Senate. In 2012, he claimed voter ID would help Mitt Romney win Wisconsin, saying, “[I]nsofar as there are inappropriate things, people who vote inappropriately are more likely to vote Democrat.”\nLegislative Leaders “Giddy” About Preventing Minorities and Students from Voting\nAt a May 2016 trial on Wisconsin’s voting restrictions, former Republican staffer Todd Allbaugh testified that some Wisconsin legislative leaders were “giddy” that the state’s strict photo ID law could keep minority and young voters from the polls. When the law was being considered in 2011, he said, State Sen. Mary Lazich (R) argued in favor of the bill: “She got up out of her chair and hit her fist or her finger on the table and said, ‘Hey, we’ve got to think about what this would mean for the neighborhoods around Milwaukee and the college campuses.’” State Sen. Dale Schultz, Allbaugh’s boss, said they should consider how it would hurt people’s ability to vote. Glenn Grothman, a state senate leader at the time, replied, “What I’m concerned about here is winning, and that’s what really matters here.”\nConservative Leader Argues Voter ID Skews Elections Toward Conservatives\nHeritage Foundation president and former U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) said in an April 2016 radio interview, “[Voter ID laws are] something we’re working on all over the country, because in the states where they do have voter ID laws you’ve seen, actually, elections begin to change towards more conservative candidates.”\nGeorgia Politician Complains When Early Voting Location Opens in Black Neighborhood\nGeorgia State Sen. Fran Millar (R) vented on social media following the state’s opening of a new early voting location in 2014. “This location is dominated by African American shoppers and near several large African American mega churches such as New Birth Missionary Baptist,” he wrote in a Facebook post.\nOhio Republican Says Early Voting Shouldn’t Cater to African-Americans\nIn 2012, in response to a state-level battle over early voting hours, Doug Preisse, chairman of Franklin County, Ohio’s Republican Party, told The Columbus Dispatch, “I guess I really actually feel we shouldn’t contort the voting process to accommodate the urban — read African-American — voter turnout machine.”\nPennsylvania House Leader Asserts Voter ID Will Secure Victory for Romney\nState Rep. Mike Turzai, an architect of the state’s then-existing strict voter ID law, said at a 2012 Republican State Committee meeting that “voter ID [would] allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania” — presumably by disenfranchising people who would vote against him.\nFlorida Lawmaker: Our Voting System is Too Easy, Because People in Africa Walk 200 Miles to Vote\nIn arguments over a 2011 Florida Senate bill that eliminated a provision allowing voters who moved to update their registration information on Election Day, State Sen. Mike Bennett (R) said the state made voting too easy and “people in Africa… literally walk two and three hundred miles so they can have the opportunity to do what we do [vote], and we want to make it more convenient?” PolitiFact found that most people in Africa walk a maximum of just over a mile to vote.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Betty Riddle grew up in Sarasota, Florida, in a segregated neighborhood that people back in the nineteen-sixties called Black Bottom. She was raised by her mother, Idella, in a wooden house on Central Avenue. When she was twelve, Idella was murdered—“killed by a woman over a man,” Riddle recalled—and so she moved in with her aunt. Riddle learned early how to fight. When she was fifteen years old and seven months pregnant, she stabbed a taunting rival in the eye with a hooked knife.\nIn 1975, Riddle was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, and given three years’ probation. After she had her baby, a daughter named Leola, she turned to drugs, especially crack cocaine. “I saw crack in everything,” she said. “Whatever I could sell, I sold.” She had another baby by another man, but mostly forgot about her children, resorting to robbery and prostitution to pay for crack. Riddle was in and out of prison, for drugs and for theft; she had two more babies by two more men. “Every boyfriend I ever had was a drug dealer,” she said. In 2002, she was sentenced to a fifth term—ten years this time, for selling cocaine.\nIn the Gadsden Correctional Facility, in northern Florida, Riddle started listening to radio sermons by a pastor with a soothing voice. At first, the sermons were just a curiosity, something other inmates listened to, but after a time the pastor’s gentle prodding made her examine herself. “I was watching my kids have kids and visit me in prison,” she remembered. One day, while Riddle was writing a letter to her children, the pastor came on the radio with a new message. “God doesn’t change who you are,” he said. “He changes what you have become.” The words startled Riddle. “I put my pen down and said, Damn, that’s me. I was a good person, I used to be a leader, and I’ve become a drug addict. I’m tired of hurting my kids.”\nWhen Riddle got out, she and her daughter opened a food truck, called No Place Like Home, that served Southern cooking. She began attending classes in Bradenton, one county over, to earn a paralegal degree. Between working and studying, Riddle volunteered in the public defender’s office, where the staff knew her from her criminal days. “I’d cussed out the lawyers so bad, that’s why they remembered me,” she said. Now, though, the attorneys found that her patient manner put defendants at ease, and in 2016 the office hired her. She bought a house and a car. “I learned I can do anything if I put my mind to it,” she said. But one thing she could not do was vote.\nIn 1877, after Reconstruction, legislators across the old Confederacy initiated a sweeping system of laws, known as Jim Crow, that made it virtually impossible for Black people to vote. From 1888 to 1968, not a single Black person was elected to the Florida legislature. The state’s constitution imposed an additional stricture: felons were banned for life from voting.\nThe ban survived the dismantling of Jim Crow, in the nineteen-sixties and seventies. While many states imposed waiting periods and other restrictions on felons voting, Florida, along with a few other states, maintained a lifetime ban. Black people are arrested at disproportionate rates for felonies, especially drug-related ones; as recently as 2016, the ban disenfranchised one out of every five Black adults in the state.\nDesmond Meade, a former felon who had earned a law degree, launched a petition to abolish the voting prohibition on all but the most violent felons. Meade and his allies collected eight hundred thousand signatures, enough to put the question on a statewide ballot, in 2018, as Amendment Four. The campaign to encourage its passage began with volunteers painting logos on bedsheets, but it soon attracted significant funding, and in November the amendment was approved by nearly sixty-five per cent of Florida’s voters. As Meade told me, “White people, Black people, Republicans, Democrats—a whole bunch of conservatives supported us.” More than a million people who voted to elect the current governor, Ron DeSantis, an ally of President Trump, also supported the measure. Amendment Four represented the largest act of enfranchisement since 1971, when the Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered the voting age to eighteen.\nOn March 17, 2020, the day of the Florida Presidential primary, Riddle rose at 6 A.M. and put on a T-shirt with an inscription that she’d devised: “First in Line, First Time Voting.” At the Robert L. Taylor Community Center, she signed her name to the voting roll and, at the age of sixty-two, cast her first ballot. “Like a gift from Heaven,” she said.\nBut, after voting in the primary, Riddle may not be able to vote in the upcoming general election. Six months after Amendment Four passed, the Republican-dominated legislature approved a law dictating that ex-felons could vote only if they first paid all the fines, restitution, and fees imposed at their sentencing. The law may affect as many as seven hundred and seventy thousand Florida residents, about half of whom are Black. In many cases, the totals came to thousands of dollars. The burden was not just large but uncertain: state officials testified that they had no way of knowing how much money felons owe, or whether they have paid; those calculations would take six years or so to complete. The legislation gutted Amendment Four, but DeSantis claimed that he was merely enforcing the language that voters had approved. “The amendment does not apply to a felon who has failed to complete all the terms of his sentence,” he maintained.\nRiddle and sixteen other former felons sued DeSantis, arguing that the requirement amounted to a poll tax, which is prohibited by the Constitution. The case, filed with support from the A.C.L.U., became known as Jones v. DeSantis. In May, a federal judge ruled against DeSantis’s legislation, which he described as a “pay-to-vote system.”\nDeSantis appealed, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to take up the case. The Eleventh Circuit Court is one of the country’s most conservative appellate panels. Two of the judges, Robert Luck and Barbara Lagoa, were DeSantis appointees, recently elevated from the Florida Supreme Court by President Trump. On that court, they had participated in oral arguments that resulted in an advisory decision supporting DeSantis’s view of Amendment Four. By legal custom, they should have recused themselves. They declined to do so, even after the ten sitting Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to remind them of the ethics breach.\nThe decision to hear the case pushed any final resolution closer to the voter-registration deadline, on October 5th; even if the judgment goes in the felons’ favor, they will have to scramble to register. Until then, any convicted felon who wants to vote must first pay his fines—meaning, in all likelihood, that the overwhelming majority of them will sit out the November election.\nRiddle figures that her bill amounts to at least two thousand dollars. “I can’t pay,” she said. She told me that she wanted to address the Eleventh Circuit herself, in oral arguments, to explain what she believes to be the real motivation behind the new Florida law. “It’s not about the money,” she said. “Not all the Republicans are bad. But they don’t want us to vote. Because they think they’re going to lose.”\nFor candidates in the coming Presidential election, Florida presents a singular opportunity and a vexing challenge. While other big states, such as Texas and California, reliably go to Republicans or Democrats, Florida is unpredictable. Polling suggests that Joe Biden could plausibly lose there and win the election, though the state’s twenty-nine electoral votes would surely make a victory easier; Trump, by most analyses, cannot win without them.\nStretching eight hundred miles from end to end, Florida encompasses the Deep South counties of the panhandle and the urban centers of Miami, Palm Beach, and Fort Lauderdale, where Jewish and Latino voters predominate. There are growing Puerto Rican enclaves around Orlando, and main-line Republican areas in Naples and Tampa, linked demographically and culturally with the Midwest. This mixture creates an almost perfectly divided electorate. Statewide races are often decided by a few thousand votes, out of millions cast.\nEven though Florida is closely split, Republican leaders dominate state politics; since 1999, they have controlled both houses of the legislature and the governor’s mansion. One key to their success has been restricting access to the polls. Lower turnout, particularly among Black voters, has usually favored their side. “Older and more affluent voters tend to be more conservative, and they tend to vote more often,” Daniel Smith, a professor of politics at the University of Florida, told me. That fact has motivated a relentless campaign to tamp down voter turnout. The most overt efforts were hindered by the Voting Rights Act, which until 2013 obligated places with a history of racial discrimination to get Justice Department approval before making major changes in electoral laws. But the less conspicuous efforts have had momentous effects. In 2000, they arguably helped decide the race for the Presidency.\nThat year’s election, between George W. Bush and Al Gore, was the most bitterly contested in modern American history, a template for decades of partisan strife to come. Both candidates needed to win Florida, but the vote was too close to call, and the counting and recounting dragged on for thirty-five days. People argued over “hanging chads” (scraps of paper that clung to ballots that weren’t punched all the way through) and about “overvotes” (ballot designs that prompted voters to choose more than one candidate, disqualifying themselves). Amid the dispute, the former Nixon operative Roger Stone assembled Republican activists in Miami, to protest what he called a “left-wing power grab by Gore, the same way Fidel Castro did it in Cuba.” In what became known as the Brooks Brothers riot, the activists attempted to force their way into the office of the county’s election supervisor. The chaos subsided only when the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling along partisan lines, stopped the recount. Bush was awarded Florida’s electoral votes, and the Presidency. An official tally later showed that he had won the state by five hundred and thirty-seven votes. Gore had won the national popular vote by half a million.\nThe scrutiny that followed focussed on Florida’s balloting problems. Another factor received far less attention: a Republican effort, beginning before the election, that prevented thousands of eligible voters from casting ballots.\nIn the late nineties, after a scandal in which the ballots of about a hundred felons were counted in a Miami mayoral election, state officials began looking for a way to scour voter-registration records for felons. They hired a company called Database Technologies, which was founded by Hank Asher, a former cocaine smuggler and a self-taught computer entrepreneur who sometimes consulted with Rudolph Giuliani on anti-terrorist ventures. Database Technologies presented Florida officials with a choice: they could run a precisely focussed search or a broader one. “The state dictated to us that they wanted to go broader,” George Bruder, a D.B.T. executive, later testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “And we did it in the fashion that they requested.”\nUsing the looser criteria, D.B.T. technicians compiled a list of approximately sixty thousand names. As the 2000 election approached, the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris sent lists of presumed felons to the supervisors of elections in the state’s sixty-seven counties, advising them to purge the names from voter rolls.\nIn Leon County, Ion Sancho was skeptical. The list that he received enumerated nearly seven hundred suspected felons, and he doubted that his voter rolls contained so many. Looking more closely, he found that most of the names didn’t match. “We were being told to purge a voter named Johnston, even though the felon’s name was Johnson,” he told me. Fewer than forty turned out to be felons.\nThe lists caused mayhem on Election Day. In some counties, many people who had never been convicted of anything discovered that they could not vote. Wallace McDonald, a commercial shrimp fisherman, went to his precinct, in Ybor City, in Tampa, as he had done for more than forty years. McDonald, who is Black, was told that he had been disqualified by an unspecified felony conviction. The son of a former New York City police officer, McDonald had once been rousted by cops in Jim Crow-era Tampa for sleeping on a public bench, but he’d never been convicted of a felony. He finally went home. “I was doing whatever I could do, and saying whatever I could say, but it didn’t make a bit of difference—I couldn’t vote,” McDonald, who is eighty-three, told me.\nLinda Howell, the supervisor of elections in Madison County, was notified that she herself was a convicted felon. Howell later gave indignant testimony about the state officials who had launched the purge: “The law said they had to verify this, but they were not taking it seriously—and that could destroy a person’s life. You get that on your record, how do you get it off?”\nAfter the election, a group of Floridians who had been prevented from voting sued Harris and other state officials. David Klausner, a computer-forensics expert who worked with the plaintiffs, told me that D.B.T. had used almost inconceivably sloppy methods, flagging voters with different Social Security numbers, and even genders, from the felons they were being matched with. The roster had been expanded by using names of felons from ten other states. “There were infants on the list,” he told me. “There were dead people.” Klausner calculated that about forty per cent of the people identified as potential felons were Black. “The project was explicitly racial—as Jim Crow as you can get,” he said.\nOfficials from D.B.T., forced to reëxamine the list, admitted that at least twenty thousand voters had been improperly flagged—roughly forty times the number of votes separating Bush and Gore. Klausner believes that the actual number was much higher, but said that there was no way to determine an exact figure. “The state’s records were a mess, and they were hiding things from us—they were lying,” he told me. “I think they wanted to do it to insure a margin of victory for Bush.”\nThe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded, “Florida’s overzealous efforts to purge voters from the rolls, conducted under the guise of an anti-fraud campaign, resulted in the inexcusable and patently unjust removal of disproportionate numbers of African American voters.” It’s unclear how many improperly flagged voters were prevented from casting ballots on Election Day. Edward Hailes, who was the commission’s general counsel at the time, told me that he believed there were thousands. “As far as I’m concerned, that purge swung the Presidential election,” he said.\nAfter the chaos of the 2000 election, Florida’s legislators enacted reforms to make voting and counting more efficient. Among the most popular was an expansion of early voting, which enabled people to cast ballots at specified locations before the election. Early voting was especially widespread in Black communities, where people often found that the extra days made it easier to vote without having to take time off from work.\nIn the state’s most populous counties, early voting included the two Sundays before Election Day. Around the state, pastors in predominantly Black churches urged their congregants to cast ballots after services were over. In 2008, when Barack Obama carried Florida and won the Presidency, the largest share of Black votes in the state came from those who voted early. The practice, known as Souls to the Polls, has spread across the country. “Souls to the Polls was an innovative way to tap into the strength of the Black church,” the Reverend R. B. Holmes, Jr., of the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Tallahassee, told me.\nThe results of the 2008 election startled Republican leaders. Obama’s coalition, which included African-Americans, the college-educated, and the young, seemed built for the future. The G.O.P.’s older, whiter voters belonged to demographic sectors that seemed certain to shrink. Republicans across the country began an extended push to reduce voter turnout. “The Republicans realize that voting rules can be changed in a way to achieve a partisan end,” Marc Elias, a voting-rights lawyer for the Democratic Party, said. “Florida becomes a host of that virus—and an exporter.”\nIn 2010, Florida voters elected Rick Scott, a hard-edged conservative, as governor. Scott was the former chief executive of Columbia/HCA Healthcare, which he had helped to build into the country’s largest for-profit hospital chain. On his watch, though, the F.B.I. found that HCA was defrauding Medicare by, among other things, systematically overcharging the government and paying huge kickbacks to physicians. Federal prosecutors chose not to indict Scott, but, after the F.B.I. raided the company’s offices, HCA pleaded guilty to at least fourteen felonies and was fined $1.7 billion, which was then the largest settlement for health-care fraud in American history. Scott resigned, having accumulated a net worth of more than two hundred million dollars, and financed his run for governor largely with his personal fortune.\nWhen Scott took office, he and the Republican-controlled legislature embarked on a series of initiatives that curtailed access to the polls. In previous elections, state rules had allowed fourteen days of early voting; the legislature eliminated six of those days, including the Sunday before elections, and restricted the hours of early-voting sites. It also sharply tightened the use of third-party groups, such as the League of Women Voters, to register voters, and imposed criminal penalties for such lapses as registering voters without a permit. Under one of the more exacting requirements, volunteers who registered people to vote were given exactly forty-eight hours to submit each form to the state. Those who missed the deadline were fined.\nThe next year, a federal judge, Robert Hinkle, scaled back the restrictions on voter registration, wryly dismissing the idea that they had been intended to prevent the system from being abused. “If the goal is to discourage voter-registration drives and thus also to make it harder for new voters to register, this may work,” he wrote. But Republican legislators portrayed the strictures as a victory for civic spirit. During one floor debate, the state senator Mike Bennett said, “Do you ever read the stories about the people in Africa—the people in the desert, who literally walk two and three hundred miles so they can have an opportunity to do what we do? And we want to make it more convenient? . . . Do we want to go to their house? Take the polling booth with us?” He went on, “I want them to fight for it. I want them to know what it’s like. I want them to go down there and have to walk across town to go over and vote.” Bennett later became the supervisor of elections in Manatee County. In the weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, he closed dozens of polling sites, forcing more than half the county’s Black population to find a new place to vote.\nBefore Amendment Four passed, the Florida constitution provided only one avenue to felons who wanted their voting rights restored: clemency from the state. Jeb Bush granted clemency to seventy-six thousand felons during his eight years as governor; Charlie Crist approved a hundred and fifty-five thousand requests in four years. Scott, in eight years, gave clemency to barely three thousand felons.\nClemency hearings are held four times a year in the capitol, in an auditorium where the Florida cabinet meets. The governor and his officials sit on an elevated platform. The felons appear one at a time, and have five minutes apiece to make their case. The law does not require the governor to give a reason for denying clemency, and Scott was unabashed about not having any. “Let me first explain how the process works,” he told one group of felons. “There are absolutely no standards. So we can make any decisions we want. . . . There’s really no law that says you deserve anything.”\nIn June, 2011, Scott heard the case of Leon Gillis III, a former drug addict who had served several years in prison for drug and robbery convictions. Since then, Gillis had founded a rehabilitation program and worked as a counsellor to seven hundred recovering heroin addicts in the Daytona Beach area. Gillis, who was sixty-two, told Scott that he took full responsibility for his crimes and asked that his voting rights be restored. Scott told him that he’d have to keep waiting.\n“How long is that?” Gillis asked.\n“I’m not sure,” Scott said. “I think every case is different.”\nGillis persisted: “What else am I supposed to do? If I am doing everything I am supposed to do, and I am making sure I do the right thing I’m supposed to do, then how long am I supposed to wait?”\n“I couldn’t tell you that answer,” Scott said. “I don’t feel comfortable doing it.”\nIn the summer of 2012, with a Presidential election approaching, Scott initiated Project Integrity, a statewide program that he said was meant to safeguard the electoral system against noncitizen voters. “You don’t get to vote in Florida if you’re a non-U.S. citizen,” he said. An initial sweep flagged a hundred and eighty-two thousand people, but the methodology was so shoddy—officials compared voter registrations with driver’s licenses—that it apparently ensnared thousands of legal voters. Among those who received letters informing them that they weren’t citizens was Bill Internicola, a ninety-one-year-old who had won a Bronze Star at the Battle of the Bulge. Officials later whittled the list of suspected noncitizens down to twenty-six hundred, but an analysis by the Miami Herald found that it was still dominated by likely Democratic voters. A federal appellate court nullified Project Integrity, ruling that it violated laws against political purges.\nIn the Presidential election that year, Scott and other Republican lawmakers found that the restrictions on early voting had backfired. Polling places were overwhelmed by heavy turnout, forcing many voters to wait in line for hours and causing several well-publicized cases of fainting. Facing an outcry, legislators repealed some restrictions, including the ban on voting the Sunday before elections, which they made optional by county.\nBut each failing strategy seemed only to inspire Republican leaders to look for another. In 2014, officials in Scott’s administration banned early voting on college campuses. Florida’s public colleges and universities had eight hundred and thirty thousand students, and nearly a third of them had voted early in the previous election; like many young voters, they tended to support Democratic candidates. Scott’s officials expressed concern that a lack of parking spaces would disrupt campus life. A federal judge, Mark Walker, rejected that argument, writing that the ban was “unexplainable on grounds other than age.”\nNevertheless, the legislature voted again in 2019 to require that early-voting sites have “sufficient non-permitted parking.” Since most college campuses allow parking only by permit, advocates said that the state was obviously trying again to quash early voting. Early this year, under the threat of another lawsuit, the state agreed to allow early-voting sites on campus. “We think it’s finally in place now,” Patricia Brigham, the president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, told me.\nEven the weather became the basis for a fight over ballot access. When hurricanes struck before the elections in 2016 and 2018, Scott refused to extend registration deadlines. In the first storm, a federal judge forced him to keep registration open; in the second, another judge allowed him to close it in unaffected areas.\nLegislators who sought to tighten ballot access often spoke of preventing fraud, even if they rarely produced evidence of it. But occasionally they described their efforts forthrightly as a matter of partisanship. In 2012, James Greer, a former chairman of the state Republican Party, told a Florida newspaper, “The Republican Party, the strategists, the consultants—they firmly believe that early voting is bad for Republican Party candidates. It’s done for one reason and one reason only . . . because early voting is not good for us.” Greer added that his fellow-Republicans hadn’t discussed voter fraud. “They never came in to see me and tell me we had a fraud issue,” he said. “It’s all a marketing ploy.” (Greer later pleaded guilty to funnelling two hundred thousand dollars from the Party into a shell company called Victory Strategies.)\nRepublican legislators were aided by the landmark Supreme Court decision in Shelby v. Holder, in 2013, which invalidated the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that had made it harder to enact discriminatory voting laws. “The Shelby decision opened the floodgates,” Myrna Pérez, who runs a voting-rights program at New York University’s Brennan Center, said. North Carolina’s legislature quickly passed a voter-I.D. law that disallowed several forms of identification disproportionately used by Black people, including those for students, government employees, and people receiving public assistance. An appeals court struck down the law, calling it an effort to “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” Soon afterward, Texas imposed a similarly stringent voter-I.D. law.\nIn Florida, Democratic legislators sometimes objected to the Republican efforts, but they were perpetually in the minority. Some found that they couldn’t even discuss the matter with their peers across the aisle. “I can have a reasonable conversation with any Republican elected official about any issue—except voting,” Dan Gelber, a former House minority leader who is now the mayor of Miami Beach, told me. “When you bring up voting, the Darth Vader mask comes up right away. You can tell—their consultants have said to them, ‘This is how you win.’ ”\nFor years, lawyers close to the G.O.P. have battered the state with lawsuits seeking to restrict voting. In 2016, a conservative group called the American Civil Rights Union sued Broward County, the state’s most Democratic area, charging that election officials had failed to purge felons and other ineligible voters from their rolls. The suit was handled by J. Christian Adams, a leading conservative activist. Adams didn’t claim to have discovered any instances of fraud. Instead, he invoked a novel legal theory: because the number of registered voters in Broward County exceeded the voting-age population, the county must be maintaining illegal voters on its rolls. A federal court threw out the suit; excess enrollment is typically the result of voters who have moved or died. But, earlier this year, another high-profile conservative voting-rights lawyer, William Consovoy, made a nearly identical argument to the Florida secretary of state, threatening to sue unless the state embarked on a vigorous purge. Consovoy wrote, “Florida’s failure to provide accurate voter rolls violates federal law, jeopardizes the integrity of the upcoming 2020 federal election, and signals to voters that elections in Florida are not being properly safeguarded.”\nConsovoy is also part of a team that is trying to prevent New York prosecutors from examining Trump’s tax records. He and the President seem aligned in their views on electoral fraud. After Trump failed to win the popular vote in 2016, he claimed, without citing any evidence, that millions of people had voted illegally. In office, he formed a commission to investigate voter fraud. The commission was disbanded after eight months, having found no evidence of widespread cheating.\nIn November, 2018, Scott ran for the U.S. Senate, and he and the incumbent, Bill Nelson, were caught in a virtual tie. When the ballots were counted, Scott led by about twelve thousand votes, out of eight million cast. Under state law, that triggered an automatic recount. Decorum quickly collapsed.\nStanding outside the governor’s mansion, Scott vowed, “I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.” Then he flew to Washington, D.C., to preëmptively join in a photo op for new senators.\nUnder Florida law, a recount may take no longer than five days; after that time, only a court order can reopen the process. That year, three statewide races were close enough to trigger recounts, and election officials worked around the clock. In Palm Beach County, vote-counting machines overheated and malfunctioned. In local election offices, lawyers for each side disputed the validity of ballots. In Bay County, which had been ravaged by Hurricane Michael, the supervisor of elections took votes, illegally, by e-mail and by fax. Nelson’s team filed federal lawsuits disputing counting rules, hoping to capture rejected ballots. “It was a gut-wrenching, soul-crushing experience,” Marley Wilkes, his campaign manager, told me.\nAs the recount proceeded, Scott raised the possibility that he would not accept the outcome if he lost. Before all the votes were tallied, he sued two of the state’s largest counties, which were mostly Democratic. “Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,” Scott said, offering no proof. Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman from the panhandle, flew to Fort Lauderdale to hold press conferences outside the office of the supervisor of elections, in which he accused Democrats of an elaborate scheme. “If the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and don’t work, what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones aren’t, then it gives them a road map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,” he said.\nEarlier in the campaign, Nelson had warned about the possibility of Russian intelligence officers breaking into Florida’s election systems. “They have already penetrated certain counties in the state, and they now have free rein to move about,” he said. Nelson had been briefed on the subject by the chairmen of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the briefing was classified, and he was constrained in what he could reveal. Scott ridiculed him, calling him “confused.” In case voters didn’t get the hint about Nelson’s age—he was seventy-five—Scott’s campaign manager called him “rambling, incoherent, confused, disjointed.” A few months later, the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller revealed that the Russians had indeed hacked the election systems of at least one Florida county in 2016; a subsequent Senate report indicated that at least one more had been hacked and two more targeted.\nAs in 2000, any problem that affected even a handful of votes was potentially decisive—and several problems emerged that were large enough to swing the race. One of them was late mail-in ballots. In Florida, as in most states, ballots must arrive before the polls close, no matter when they were mailed. In 2018, according to an analysis by the Dartmouth professor Michael Herron, about two hundred thousand ballots arrived on Election Day or the day before, and more kept coming after the deadline passed. “There were thousands of ballots arriving every day, for days after the election,” John Devaney, a voting-rights lawyer who represents progressive organizations, told me. Nelson sued to compel the state to count any ballot postmarked before the election, as his lawyers offered statistical analyses showing that early deadlines were significantly more likely to exclude poor voters and minority voters. They failed, and some fifteen thousand absentee ballots went uncounted.\nFlorida law allows campaigns to appoint observers to monitor voting and counting, with the power to challenge voters or ballots that are thought to be invalid. Each absentee ballot must be opened by hand, and the signature on the ballot must match the voter’s signature on file with the election authority. If an observer succeeds in challenging the signature, the ballot is rejected. In the 2018 race, according to Herron, about eleven thousand ballots were rejected because their signatures did not match, or because they were not signed. (Some ballots didn’t arrive at all: after the election, a box containing two hundred and sixty-six ballots was found in a U.S. Postal Service distribution center that had been evacuated the previous month, after processing packages sent by Cesar Sayoc, a right-wing terrorist who mailed bombs to thirteen prominent Trump opponents.)\nFor Nelson, the harshest disappointment involved “undervotes.” In the Democratic stronghold of Broward County, thirty thousand voters did not vote for either Senate candidate. It turned out that, because of a faulty design, the Senate race had been buried at the bottom of the ballot’s first column, after a long list of voting instructions. Voters skipping over the instructions had evidently failed to see it. “That was the whole race right there,” Nelson told me. “Those were my votes.” After recounts by machine and by hand, Scott won by ten thousand and thirty-three votes—one-tenth of one per cent of the eight million cast.\nNelson and his aides suggest that the long Republican campaign to restrict voter turnout had finally come to fruition. They look forward to a time when the state’s population has changed too much for such tactics to make a difference. “There is a systematic effort to suppress what Republicans believe are going to be Democratic votes,” Nelson told me. “It’s driven by demographics—but it’s only a matter of time before demographics catch up with them.”\nIn December, 2017, Ron DeSantis, a little-known congressman from Florida’s east coast, appeared on Fox News, to talk with Laura Ingraham about the investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia. On the show, DeSantis espoused an extreme—and unsupported—view of the inquiry, saying that it had been cooked up by F.B.I. agents to keep Trump from getting elected. “This is actually taking a bias and basically saying you’re going to use the machinery of government to prevent the American people from making a choice,” he said. “That’s very disturbing.” It was the third time that month that he had appeared on Fox to portray the President as a victim.\nAt the time, DeSantis was running in the Republican primary for governor, and he trailed Adam Putnam, the state’s genial agriculture commissioner, by a wide margin. Trump saw DeSantis on Fox, and nine days later endorsed him, calling him a “brilliant young leader” who “loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!” DeSantis campaigned as Trump’s surrogate, telling supporters that he had taught his young children to say, “Build the wall.” Trump sometimes appeared at his side, and his backing helped DeSantis surge past Putnam and win the general election.\nDeSantis was forty years old, with an eclectic background: he captained the baseball team at Yale, graduated from Harvard Law School, and served as a legal adviser to a Navy Seal commander in Falluja, Iraq. In Congress, he reinvented himself as a populist. (As a Florida lobbyist told me, “You won’t hear him talk much about Harvard and Yale.”) DeSantis helped found the Freedom Caucus, and signed a pledge, promoted by the Koch brothers, to vote against any legislation to slow global warming which required new taxes.\nIn the months after DeSantis was elected governor, he demonstrated fealty to Trump, appearing in the Oval Office and receiving him in Florida. Trump rewarded him with generous federal aid, for hurricane relief and Everglades restoration. Rodney Barreto, a Miami businessman who speaks to DeSantis regularly, told me, “Ron has made it clear that he’s the guy who can call up the President and get what we need.”\nWhen the coronavirus struck, DeSantis disregarded the counsel of epidemiologists. He issued an order for people to stay at home for a month but declined to mandate masks and rarely wore one himself. He was slow to close beaches and parks, even as spring-break revellers gathered in Fort Lauderdale and in Miami. He ordered nonessential businesses to close but defined the term so broadly that it lost its meaning; among the enterprises deemed too important to shut down was professional wrestling.\nFlorida began reopening on May 4th, and, as the rate of infection initially stayed low, DeSantis was celebrated among conservatives. Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, wrote an op-ed titled “Where Does Ron DeSantis Go to Get His Apology?” Lowry proclaimed that DeSantis, by ignoring the experts and the media, had allowed Florida to reopen at a relatively low cost. DeSantis told Lowry that he regularly reviewed virus data and, with his team, charted a course that differed substantially from that of New York and other coastal cities, cordoning off retirement homes and allowing local officials to decide their own containment plans. He rejected criticism that he was flying without instruments: “I view it more as a badge of honor.” Lowry affirmed that DeSantis had outsmarted the experts, writing, “The disaster so widely predicted hasn’t materialized.”\nWithin weeks, DeSantis’s strategy collapsed. Hospitals were flooded with patients; many began bringing in nurses from other states, for wages as high as thirty thousand dollars a month. The state’s vast population of retirees, the backbone of Republican dominance, was suddenly threatened. Mayors began to close their cities.\nJennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, told me that DeSantis’s strategy suffered from a misplaced faith that the state could protect its most vulnerable. “People drive, they go to the grocery store, their families come and visit them,” she said. What’s more, the elderly were not the only group at risk; there were the obese, people with diabetes and heart conditions. “The at-risk population is half the country,” she said. The plan’s other flaw was its lack of an aggressive contact-tracing campaign. “That’s not really happening in Florida,” Nuzzo said.\nFacing catastrophe, DeSantis declared in late June, “We’re not going back.” Schools would reopen and Disney World would welcome visitors. At a press conference in Tampa, he and Vice-President Mike Pence emphasized that there was no trade-off between fighting the virus and reopening the economy. DeSantis attributed the spectacular rise in infections to increased testing, and assured Florida residents that the situation was under control. “If everyone is, you know, enjoying life but doing it responsibly,” he said, “we’re going to be fine.” Soon afterward, the editorial board of the South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote, “Your daily upbeat message is hopelessly at odds with what Floridians are going through.” The headline was “Help Us Out, Gov. DeSantis. We’re Dying Here.” By mid-July, the state was recording nearly twelve thousand new cases a day.\nFrom the beginning, questions were raised about how truthful DeSantis’s administration had been regarding the epidemic. In May, Rebekah Jones, who managed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, was fired for refusing, in her words, “to manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” (A DeSantis spokesperson has said that Jones was fired for a pattern of insubordination.) When death counts compiled by county medical examiners began to regularly exceed those released by the Florida Department of Health, the state withheld the higher number. After weeks of assurances that a vigorous contact-tracing campaign was reaching more than ninety per cent of infected people, workers in Miami-Dade County discovered that the rate was closer to seventeen per cent. “You can’t spin the pandemic away,” Gelber, the Miami Beach mayor, told me.\nThe chaos made folk heroes of people, like Jones, who insisted on getting reliable information to the public. Another was Mike Chitwood, the sheriff of Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach. In March, Chitwood began posting the latest local virus statistics, including places where there had been large outbreaks, on social media. Every night, Chitwood got data from the Department of Health and updated the tally. The posts became hugely popular with residents; some fifty thousand people regularly viewed them, he said. But Chitwood became increasingly skeptical of the information he was getting. “We knew from people inside the state government that they were not accurately reporting the statistics,” he told me.\nIn early July, he posted a disclaimer, saying that he could not guarantee the veracity of the information. The next day, officials informed Chitwood that the data would no longer be available. “I went ballistic—absolutely batshit,” he said. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Why are we giving out less information?” He posted an apology and discontinued the updates. An outcry ensued, and the officials backed down. Chitwood is a DeSantis supporter, but he concluded that the Governor had been less than forthright. He recalled a lesson he had learned years before, as a police officer in Philadelphia. “When there’s trouble getting the information, it’s because the information is troubling,” he said.\nThe pandemic upended calculations of political self-interest. For much of the past two years, DeSantis has been expected to deliver Florida to Trump in November. But, with the virus dominating the public conversation, it seemed increasingly uncertain whether he could—or even wanted to.\nBy late summer, most polls showed Trump trailing Biden in the state. As DeSantis’s approval rating plummeted, too, he tried to distance himself from the President. A lawyer who speaks regularly with both men told me that DeSantis had decided to provide as little help as possible. He stopped appearing with Trump, stopped visiting the Oval Office, and dragged his feet on raising money for him. DeSantis even tried to undermine efforts to stage the Republican Convention in Jacksonville, which Trump ultimately cancelled. “Ron will tell you he’s doing everything he can for the President, and he’ll sound believable,” the lawyer told me. “But there’s zero evidence for that, and the President notices.” Alan Rubin, a lobbyist who works in both Washington and Florida, told me that DeSantis was increasingly worried that Trump could lose Florida, and was positioning himself to be able to work with a Biden Administration. People around DeSantis believe that he intends to run for President in 2024 and isn’t convinced that having Trump in the White House improves his chances. “He’s a very smart operator,” Rubin said. “Ron’s going to do what he needs to do.”\nIn April, election supervisors from every county in Florida wrote to DeSantis, urging him to help minimize the effects of the coronavirus on voting in November. The supervisors said that the statewide primary, in March, had presented “significant challenges,” including “substantial numbers” of poll workers who had dropped out at the last minute. They told DeSantis flatly that they were not capable of conducting an election entirely through the mail, and were concerned that they lacked the resources necessary to conduct even limited in-person voting.\nThe supervisors asked DeSantis to adopt several measures: increase the number of places where early ballots could be cast; give supervisors more time to send voters mail-in ballots and more time to count early ballots; and allow early-voting sites to be reused as polling places on Election Day, to eliminate the need to erect new ones. “As counties are preparing and making staffing and logistical decisions now, the flexibility and authority provided as soon as possible would be of great benefit,” the supervisors said.\nDeSantis waited two months to respond, and then granted one of the requests: election workers could begin counting mail-in ballots as early as forty days before the election, instead of twenty-two. He offered to make state employees available to work at polling places, and to “coördinate” with supervisors to supply hand sanitizer and protective gear. On the other requests, one election supervisor told me, “the governor basically ignored us.”\nAs DeSantis stalled on preparations, Trump was pursuing a campaign against voting by mail. “The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-in Voting is allowed to take place, & everyone knows it,” he tweeted. During the summer, his Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, removed high-speed sorting machines and instituted other changes that radically diminished the capacity of the Postal Service. Testifying before Congress, DeJoy promised that the mail would be delivered “fully and on time” on Election Day. But in Florida’s elections in 2016 and 2018, even with mail delivery operating normally, thousands of ballots didn’t make it on time.\nIn Florida, and across the United States, the coronavirus pandemic is inspiring fears that voting in person could be dangerous. What happens if a voter shows up without a mask, angering those who are wearing them? Under Florida law, election supervisors have a responsibility to maintain order at polling places, but they cannot make arrests or prevent anyone from lawfully voting. “The bouncer at the precinct is typically a seventy-five-year-old lady sitting at a card table,” Jon Mills, a former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, said.\nSince the spring, when the epidemic took hold, a team of lawyers led by Marc Elias, the Democratic voting-rights lawyer, has been presiding over lawsuits in eighteen states, spurring changes to make it easier to vote and in some cases overturning Republican-backed laws that have been in place for years. Elias has sought what he calls the “four pillars” of voting by mail: all mail-in ballots will have prepaid postage; any ballot postmarked by Election Day will be counted; voters whose signatures don’t match will be given a chance to explain themselves; and community groups will be allowed to deliver ballots for others. Elias’s team has won complete victories in three states and partial victories in four; the other cases are ongoing. “I have won in more states than I thought I would,” he said. One case involved the Wisconsin primary, in April, when tens of thousands of ballots were postmarked on or before Election Day but arrived late. Elias sued election officials, and the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the votes.\nIn Elias’s suit in Florida, the state agreed to a settlement: it would launch a voter-education campaign and allow the maximum number of days for early voting. But on the central issue—counting all mail-in ballots that are postmarked before Election Day—Elias and his plaintiffs lost. Trump soon posted a bizarre tweet, urging Florida Republicans to vote by mail, a position that contradicted his earlier tirades. Mindy Finn, the C.E.O. of an analytics firm called Citizen Data, said her organization projected that far more Democrats than Republicans would vote by mail in Florida. “By polarizing vote by mail, Trump appears to have been depressing his own turnout,” she said.\nFinn’s firm is predicting 4.2 million absentee ballots in Florida, and some observers worry that—given the unprecedented volume, the need to open each ballot by hand, and the shortage of workers—it will be nearly impossible to get them all processed before the deadline, on the Saturday after the election. Eddie Perez, of the Open Source Election Technology Institute, which focusses on elections and voting, told me, “My fear is that people will be drowning on Election Day.”\nIntelligence analysts have assured Trump that there is no evidence that foreign adversaries will try to falsify mail-in ballots. But the spectre of interference lingers. According to the Mueller report, Russian agents made Florida a focus in 2016. Before the election, they sent spear-phishing e-mails to a hundred and twenty officials, attempting to hack into local election systems. A Senate intelligence report found that in at least two counties they gained entry to voter-registration rolls. The Russians also successfully hacked a Florida-based company that makes software for voter registration and check-in. Experts say that registration systems are especially vulnerable, because they are linked to the Internet. “If the Russians had pulled the trigger, there would have been utter chaos on Election Day,” Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told me.\nAccording to a former senior Obama Administration official, there was concern that Russian agents were also apparently experimenting with their capability to alter vote tallies. “That’s just what they do in elections in Russia,” another former senior official said. American intelligence officials say they have no evidence that the Russians changed any totals. It’s more likely, according to several former Obama Administration officials, that they were probing vulnerabilities in election systems across the country. “This was a sort of dry run,” one said.\nBut it’s not clear that officials looked very hard for evidence of vote tampering. After the 2016 election, only a handful of states conducted audits that would determine if electronic voting machines had been penetrated; the federal government did none. After an inquiry from Senator Ron Wyden, of Oregon, the Department of Homeland Security responded that it had no “mandate” to examine state voting machines. Wyden was indignant: “On what basis can the Administration make its claims regarding a lack of evidence of foreign interference if it hasn’t looked for it?”\nA foreign adversary who wanted to sow dissension wouldn’t necessarily need to change the election results—which, given the decentralized nature of voting in the United States, would be difficult to do. “I don’t think changing the counts is what they are aiming for,” Laura Rosenberger, a foreign-policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, told me, of the Russians. “They want to cause doubt and confusion, so that you have a situation where everyone is fighting and no one accepts the legitimacy of the election.”\nAt the Reverend Holmes’s church, in Tallahassee, the congregants are anticipating November with a mixture of fear and hope. On a recent Sunday, Holmes said from the pulpit that the election would be a defining moment in American history, and that his parishioners should let nothing—not voter suppression, not the coronavirus—stand in the way of their casting ballots.\nDrawing on the Book of Daniel, Holmes told the story of three Hebrew boys who refused to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar, even at the threat of being burned alive, because he was not the true and only God. “Nebuchadnezzar was so full of himself that he wanted his own statue—on Mt. Rushmore,” he said, eliciting knowing laughs from the pews. “But the three boys would not bow down to this paranoid, insecure king.” Quoting John Lewis, the late congressman and civil-rights leader, Holmes told the congregants that the boys who defied Nebuchadnezzar were getting into “good trouble”—the kind that people make when they refuse to yield to a tyrant. “Never be afraid to make noise,” he said, “to get into good trouble—necessary trouble.”\nHolmes’s right-wing counterparts have been spreading a more combative message. In north Florida, which Trump dominated in the 2016 elections, white evangelists fill the airwaves with apocalyptic prophecies. One such commentator is the Reverend Gene A. Youngblood, the pastor of the First Conservative Baptist Church in Jacksonville, who hosts a radio show called “Let’s Face the Issues.”\nIn a recent broadcast, Youngblood warned of a country besieged by the forces of Marxism, state control, and anarchy. The summer’s protests against police brutality, he said, had brought a flood of chaos and crime. “We’ve seen blocks and blocks and blocks of our major cities burned and destroyed by vandals and thugs of Black Lives Matter,” he said. “Ladies and gentlemen, it is like a cancer—it is spreading across the whole body that we call the United States of America.”\nYoungblood’s darkest vision was of the coronavirus, which the “socialist-Marxist-B.L.M.-communist Democratic Party” had used to “bring in fear and anxiety in America as never before.” The purpose, he maintained, was to impose forced vaccinations, which Bill Gates and the government would use to implant a chip that allowed them to control citizens. Youngblood said that it was imperative for Christians to vote in November. If they failed to turn out, he said, “we will lose the battle, and we will have a socialist, communist, dictatorship form of government in America.”\nTo prepare for the elections, each side is assembling an army of volunteers and lawyers to observe voting and counting. Juan Peñalosa, the executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, told me that he was deploying at least three thousand lawyers, trained in election law, to weigh in on ballot disputes in the state’s nearly six thousand precincts. The Trump campaign says that it is marshalling fifty thousand poll watchers to work in fifteen key states, presumably including Florida.\nThis November marks the first Presidential election since 1980 in which the Republican National Committee will not be bound by a court decree that has tightly limited its activities around voting sites. The decree arose from a Democratic lawsuit charging that, in a New Jersey governor’s race, off-duty police officers, some carrying guns and wearing armbands that read “National Ballot Security Task Force,” had intimidated Black voters. “We fully expect Trump volunteers to be at every polling place in the state on Election Day,” Peñalosa said.\nThe Reverend Holmes seemed unswayed. For years, he has urged his congregation to take part in the early voting of Souls to the Polls. After his sermon, he led about a hundred members on a walk to the county courthouse, where many of them cast early ballots for the statewide primary on August 18th. Holmes’s march was given a police escort, and many candidates came along to solicit parishioners’ support.\nOne member of the congregation, an eighty-year-old named William Brown, grew up in Mulberry, a phosphate-mining town in central Florida. The white neighborhoods, he recalled, were demarcated by hedgerows and railroad tracks, which no sane Black person would go past. For years, the center of Mulberry was marked by a hulking tree where many Black men were lynched. In the nineteen-fifties and sixties, Brown told me, voting was impossible for a Black person in Mulberry. “There was never any issue,” he said. “I didn’t even think about it.”\nBrown joined the Army and saw the world, and while he was away America changed a little. In 1984, at the age of forty-four, he went to the polls for the first time—to vote, he said, for “whichever Democrat was running against Reagan.” His candidate, Walter Mondale, lost badly. But he hasn’t missed an election since, and he looks forward to voting in November. “Oh, Lord,” he said. “I’m not done yet.”♦\nRead More About the 2020 Election\n- Can Joe Biden win the Presidency based on a promise of generational change?\n- The fall and rise of Kamala Harris.\n- When a sitting President threatens to delay a sacrosanct American ritual like an election, you should listen.\n- To understand the path Donald Trump has taken to the 2020 election, look at what he has provided the executive class.\n- What happens if Trump fights the election results?\n- The refusal by Mitch McConnell to rein in Trump is looking riskier than ever.\n- Sign up for our election newsletter for insight and analysis from our reporters and columnists.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Remarks by President Biden in Address to a Joint Session of Congress\nU.S. Capitol\n(April 28, 2021)\n**See correction below, marked by an asterisk.\n9:06 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. And Mitch and Chuck will understand it’s good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all.\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President — (applause) — no President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it’s about time. (Applause.)\nFirst Lady — (applause) — I’m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different — a reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in.\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities.\nTonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.\nI stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day\nof my administration — 100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation — we all did — that was in crisis.\nThe worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again — (applause) — turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.\nWe all know life can knock us down. But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.\nWe have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America — none.\nOne hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor- — Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people — Democrats, independents, and Republicans — we did act.\nTogether we passed the American Rescue Plan — one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. (Applause.) We’re already seeing the results.\nAfter I promised we’d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. (Applause.)\nThanks to all the help of all of you, we’re marshalling — with your help, everyone’s help — we’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000\npharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.\nToday, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16 — everyone\nis now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. (Applause.) Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They’re available. You’re eligible now.\nWhen I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected — fully protected.\nSenior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January — down 80 percent because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse — I said, “What’s it like?” She looked at me and she said, “It’s like every shot is giving a dose of hope” — was the phrase. “A dose of hope.”\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease — wrote to me, said she’s worried — that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a — at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated, and just cried — cried out of joy and cried out of relief.\nParents see the smiles on their kids’ faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.\nGrandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye.\nIt means everything. Those things mean everything.\nYou know, there’s still — you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans — there’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down.\nBut tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements — logistical achievements this country has ever seen.\nWhat else have we done in those first 100 days?\nWe kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than one — 160 million checks out the door. It’s making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.\nA single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn’t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.\nA grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she said she put off for months because she didn’t have the money.\nOne of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up — cars lined up for miles. And not — not people who just barely ever start those cars — nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.\nI don’t know about you, but I didn’t ever think I’d see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own these people are in this position.\nThat’s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.\nWe’re also providing rental assistance — you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand — keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that — 800,000 in that period.\nWe’re making one of the largest one-time ever investments — ever — in improving healthcare for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. (Applause.)\nAnd in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days — more jobs in the first — (applause) — more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.\nThe International Monetary Fund — (applause) — the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.\nAmerica is moving — moving forward — but we can’t stop now. We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We’re at a great inflection point in history.\nWe have to do more than just build back better — I mean “build back.” We have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have.\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America — our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.\nThe transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.\nUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.\nScientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon — now we’re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more.\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.\nThat’s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two.\nIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.\nIt’s clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water — a clear and present danger to our children’s health.\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. (Applause.)\nAnd in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn’t have it.\nThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.\nAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.\nTHE PRESIDENT: — because I know it will get done. (Applause.)\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures — with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.\nThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that. (Applause.)\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.\nTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic — two million. And too often because they couldn’t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it’s not important, check out in your own district.\nDemocrat or Republican — Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern — almost as much as their children — is taking care of an elderly loved one who can’t be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\nFor too long, we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: “jobs.” Jobs. Jobs. (Applause.)\nFor me, when I think “climate change,” I think “jobs.”\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers — IBEW members — installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own — (applause) — so we can own the electric car market. (Applause.)\nFarmers — farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. (Applause.)\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. (Applause.)\nSo, folks, there’s no reason why American — American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have this capacity. (Applause.) We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs — jobs Americans can raise a family on — as my dad would then say, “with a little breathing room.”\nAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.\nAnd I might note, parenthetically — (applause) — that does not — that does not violate any trade agreement. It’s been the law since the ’30s: Buy American.\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. (Applause.)\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited. It will be American products.\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of you — so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing. It’s frightening.\nI want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is a — it is an eight-year program. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. That’s what it is. (Applause.)\nAnd it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other. Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. (Applause.)\nSo that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize. (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk — (laughs) — let’s raise the minimum wage to $15. (Applause.)\nNo one — no one working 40 hours a week — no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well — equal pay. It’s been much too long. And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record. We will see more technological change — and some of you know more about this than I do — we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\nAnd we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America — 2 percent of our gross domestic product — in research and development.\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:\nadvanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you — and those of you on — who work on national security issues know — the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here — and that’s been a long time ago — to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job. And it’s a semi-separate agency; it’s under the Defense Department. It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.\nThe National Institute of Health — the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. (Applause.)\nAnd that would — here’s what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.\nI’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President — almost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning — saying you’d name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So, let’s end cancer as we know it. (Applause.) It’s within our power. (Applause.) It’s within our power to do it. (Applause.)\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we’re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.\nSo, let’s get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different — they think are better. I welcome those ideas.\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. (Applause.)\nLook, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi — traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion. He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others — autocrats — think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.\nFirst is access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world. It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st — in the 20th century.\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.\nThat’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school — not daycare — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\nWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. (Applause.) We can do that. (Applause.)\nAnd we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\nJill was a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said — (applause). She has long — (applause). If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.” She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee — (applause). And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave — family and medical leave. We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause).\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half. (Applause.) And we can afford it.\nSo we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. (Applause.)\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle. (Laughter.) But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. (Applause.)\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families.\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) And let’s lower prescription drug costs. (Applause.)\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now. (Applause.)\nWe’ve talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America. (Applause.)\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Just their fair share.\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.\nA recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It’s not right.\nWe’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. (Applause.)\nWe’re going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans — those making over $400,000 or more — back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That’s where it was when George W. was President.\nWe’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action. Three tenths of 1 percent.\nAnd the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden — an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They’re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair — (applause) — fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.\nWhen you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: “Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?”\nLook, the big tax cut of 2017 — remember, it was supposed to pay for itself — that was how it was sold — and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\nInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the — below a hundred.\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic — working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion — in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion.\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down — trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.)\nYou know, there’s a broad consensus of economists — left, right, center — and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation.\nI’ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.\nIn my conversations with world leaders — and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now — I’ve made it known — I’ve made it known that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, “We see America is back but for how long? But for how long?”\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but that we’re back to stay and that we aren’t going to go it alone. (Applause.) We’re going to do it by leading with our allies. (Applause.)\nNo one nation can deal with all the crises of our time — from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi- — what we’re experiencing now with pandemics.\nThere’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply — as it grows to meet our needs; and we’re meeting them — will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world — (applause) — and in consequence, influenced the world. (Applause.)\nBut every American will have access before that occur- — every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 — from the vaccines we have.\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it’s a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That’s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord — because if we do everything perfectly, it’s not going to ultimately matter.\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world — China, Russia, India, the European Union — and I said I’d do it in my first 100 days.\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had — my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus — the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.\nIf you’ve watched any of it — and you were all busy; I’m sure you didn’t have much time — that’s what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren’t doing their fair share.\nThe investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.\nIn my discussions — in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, “We welcome the competition. We’re not looking for conflict.” But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America’s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state — to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.\nI also told President Xi that we’ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe — not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. (Applause.)\nI told him what I’ve said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments — our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President — President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea — the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal. It’s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we’re dealing with the American idea.\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we’re not going to seek esca- — ecala- — exc- — excuse me — escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true. And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia’s interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.\nBut we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we’re working to do it on climate change. But he understands we will respond.\nOn Iran and North Korea — nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world — we’re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di- — through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.\nAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. (Applause.) We have — (applause) — we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone.\nToday we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.\nThe War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists — the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 — and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it. If you’ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you’ve kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of value — valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring those troops home. (Applause.)\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has — terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.\nAnd we won’t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We’re not going to ignore that either.\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago, before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. She’s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said, “My daddy changed the world.” Well, after the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was if — if we have the courage to act as a Congress.\nWe’ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want — (applause) — I know they want to help meet this moment as well.\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already.\nI know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. (Applause.)\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act — should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice — real justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity — good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans — Black, white, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. (Applause.) You acted decisively. (Applause.) And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we’ve seen over the past year — this past year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. (Applause.) To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.\nAnother thing: Let’s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. (Applause.) Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it. It’ll close the — the act that has to be authorized now will close the “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said, “This is an abuser. You can’t own a gun.” It’s to close that loophole that existed.\nYou know, it’s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America — 50 a month. Let’s pass it and save some lives. (Applause.)\nAnd I need not — I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.\nThe flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.\nAnd in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America — 250 shot dead.\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the ’90s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report in over 10 years. But in the early twe- — 2000s, the law expired, and we’ve seen daily bloodshed since. I’m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn’t see bloodshed.\nMore than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know — the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence — I laid out several of the Department of Justice a- — actions that are being taken to — impact on this epidemic.\nOne of them is banning so-called “ghost guns.” These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes and they can’t be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon that’s lethal. But no more.\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it’s time for Congress to act as well. (Applause.)\nLook, I don’t want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don’t tell me it can’t be done. We did it before, and it worked.\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think — deer are wearing Kevlar vests? (Laughter.) They’ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners. The country supports reform and is — and Congress should act.\nThis shouldn’t be a red or blue issue. And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can’t yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever.\nWe’re not changing the Constitution; we’re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; I think it’s an American issue.\nAnd here’s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we’ve done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it.\nOn day one of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks — the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually — if you actually want to solve a problem, I’ve sent a bill to take a close look at it.\nWe have to — also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to — to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.\nWhen I was President, my President — when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it.\nI’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she’ll get the job done. (Applause.)\nNow, look, if you don’t like my plan, let’s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMers — the young people who have only known America as their home. (Applause.)\nAnd permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster. (Applause.)\nAs well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. (Applause.)\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let’s argue over it, let’s debate it, but let’s act. (Applause.)\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Most people — (applause).\nMore people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated. Instead, it’s being attacked.\nCongress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away. (Applause.) The country supports it. The Congress should act now. (Applause.)\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.\nLives were put at risk — many of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis –- a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic — still vital today.\nCan our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?\nCan our democracy deliver the most — to the most pressing needs of our people?\nCan our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?\nAmerica’s adversaries –- the autocrats of the world –- are betting we can’t. And I promise you, they’re betting we can’t. They believe we’re too full of anger and division and rage.\nThey look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.\nWe have to prove democracy still works — that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.\nIn our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We’re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice — that’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action.\nOur Constitution opens with the words — as trite as it sounds — “We the People”. Well, it’s time to remember that “We the People” are the government — you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the People.”\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, “In America, we do our part.” We all do our part. That’s all I’m asking: that we do our part, all of us.\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to America.\nAs I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America — not because I’m President, because what’s happening with the American people.\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and “We the People” did not flinch.\nAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together. We united.\nWith light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America.\nFolks, as I told every world leader I’ve ever met with over the years, it’s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn’t. (Applause.)\nWe are the United States of America. (Applause.) There is not a single thing — nothing — nothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. (Applause.) So let’s begin to get together. (Applause.)\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. (Applause.)\n10:12 P.M.
