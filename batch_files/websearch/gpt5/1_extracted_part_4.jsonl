Unemployment insurance will be in the program. I am still of the opinion expressed in my message of June eighth that this part of social insurance should be a cooperative federal-state undertaking.” In contrast, of national health insurance he said, “Whether we came to this form of insurance soon or later on I am confident that we can devise a system which will enhance and not hinder the remarkable progress which has been made and is being made in the practice of the professions of medicine and surgery in the United States.”\nSimilarly, in his 1941 State of the Union, Roosevelt was quite specific that “we should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance\" while keeping health care objectives vague: “We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care.”\nFor more detail: Kooijman, Jaap. “Soon or Later On: Franklin D. Roosevelt and National Health Insurance, 1933-1945.” Presidential Studies Quarterly 29, no. 2 (1999): 336–50. http://www.jstor.org/stable/27551992.\nHarry Truman\nAfter seeing the United States through to the end of World War II, Harry Truman faced the question of how to approach his predecessor's New Deal legacy. In September 1945, he made clear his intentions when he delivered a rambling 21-point economic plan that called for new public works programs, legislation guaranteeing \"full employment,\" a higher minimum wage, extension of the Fair Employment Practices Committee, a larger Social Security System, and a national health insurance system. Two months later, he delivered a Special Message to the Congress Recommending a Comprehensive Health Program, in which he said, “In the past, the benefits of modern medical science have not been enjoyed by our citizens with any degree of equality. Nor are they today. Nor will they be in the future—unless government is bold enough to do something about it.”\nTruman laid out his preferred plan for how a national health system would work:\nEveryone should have ready access to all necessary medical, hospital and related services.\nI recommend solving the basic problem by distributing the costs through expansion of our existing compulsory social insurance system. This is not socialized medicine.\nEveryone who carries fire insurance knows how the law of averages is made to work so as to spread the risk, and to benefit the insured who actually suffers the loss. If instead of the costs of sickness being paid only by those who get sick, all the people—sick and well—were required to pay premiums into an insurance fund, the pool of funds thus created would enable all who do fall sick to be adequately served without overburdening anyone. That is the principle upon which all forms of insurance are based.\nDuring the past fifteen years, hospital insurance plans have taught many Americans this magic of averages. Voluntary health insurance plans have been expanding during recent years; but their rate of growth does not justify the belief that they will meet more than a fraction of our people's needs. Only about 3% or 4% of our population now have insurance providing comprehensive medical care.\nA system of required prepayment would not only spread the costs of medical care, it would also prevent much serious disease. Since medical bills would be paid by the insurance fund, doctors would more often be consulted when the first signs of disease occur instead of when the disease has become serious. Modern hospital, specialist and laboratory services, as needed, would also become available to all, and would improve the quality and adequacy of care. Prepayment of medical care would go a long way toward furnishing insurance against disease itself, as well as against medical bills.\nSuch a system of prepayment should cover medical, hospital, nursing and laboratory services. It should also cover dental care—as fully and for as many of the population as the available professional personnel and the financial resources of the system permit.\nThe ability of our people to pay for adequate medical care will be increased if, while they are well, they pay regularly into a common health fund, instead of paying sporadically and unevenly when they are sick. This health fund should be built up nationally, in order to establish the broadest and most stable basis for spreading the costs of illness, and to assure adequate financial support for doctors and hospitals everywhere. If we were to rely on state-by-state action only, many years would elapse before we had any general coverage. Meanwhile health service would continue to be grossly uneven, and disease would continue to cross state boundary lines.\nMedical services are personal. Therefore the nation-wide system must be highly decentralized in administration. The local administrative unit must be the keystone of the system so as to provide for local services and adaptation to local needs and conditions. Locally as well as nationally, policy and administration should be guided by advisory committees in which the public and the medical professions are represented.\nSubject to national standards, methods and rates of paying doctors and hospitals should be adjusted locally. All such rates for doctors should be adequate, and should be appropriately adjusted upward for those who are qualified specialists.\nPeople should remain free to choose their own physicians and hospitals. The removal of financial barriers between patient and doctor would enlarge the present freedom of choice. The legal requirement on the population to contribute involves no compulsion over the doctor's freedom to decide what services his patient needs. People will remain free to obtain and pay for medical service outside of the health insurance system if they desire, even though they are members of the system; just as they are free to send their children to private instead of to public schools, although they must pay taxes for public schools.\nLikewise physicians should remain free to accept or reject patients. They must be allowed to decide for themselves whether they wish to participate in the health insurance system full time, part time, or not at all. A physician may have some patients who are in the system and some who are not. Physicians must be permitted to be represented through organizations of their own choosing, and to decide whether to carry on in individual practice or to join with other doctors in group practice in hospitals or in clinics.\nOur voluntary hospitals and our city, county and state general hospitals, in the same way, must be free to participate in the system to whatever extent they wish. In any case they must continue to retain their administrative independence.\nVoluntary organizations which provide health services that meet reasonable standards of quality should be entitled to furnish services under the insurance system and to be reimbursed for them. Voluntary cooperative organizations concerned with paying doctors, hospitals or others for health services, but not providing services directly, should be entitled to participate if they can contribute to the efficiency and economy of the system.\nNone of this is really new. The American people are the most insurance-minded people in the world. They will not be frightened off from health insurance because some people have misnamed it “socialized medicine.”\nI repeat—what I am recommending is not socialized medicine.\nSocialized medicine means that all doctors work as employees of government. The American people want no such system. No such system is here proposed.\n. . .\nPremiums for present social insurance benefits are calculated on the first $3,000 of earnings in a year. It might be well to have all such premiums, including those for health, calculated on a somewhat higher amount such as $3,600.\nA broad program of prepayment for medical care would need total amounts approximately equal to 4% of such earnings. The people of the United States have been spending, on the average, nearly this percentage of their incomes for sickness care. How much of the total fund should come from the insurance premiums and how much from general revenues is a matter for the Congress to decide.\nThe plan which I have suggested would be sufficient to pay most doctors more than the best they have received in peacetime years. The payments of the doctors' bills would be guaranteed, and the doctors would be spared the annoyance and uncertainty of collecting fees from individual patients. The same assurance would apply to hospitals, dentists and nurses for the services they render.\nFederal aid in the construction of hospitals will be futile unless there is current purchasing power so that people can use these hospitals. Doctors cannot be drawn to sections which need them without some assurance that they can make a living. Only a nation-wide spreading of sickness costs can supply such sections with sure and sufficient purchasing power to maintain enough physicians and hospitals.\nWe are a rich nation and can afford many things. But ill-health which can be prevented or cured is one thing we cannot afford.\nLike much of Truman's program, his plan to insure Americans went nowhere. Still, he continued to make the case, offering another special message to Congress on the subject in May 1947, “The total health program which I have proposed is crucial to our national welfare. The heart of that program is national health insurance. Until it is a part of our national fabric, we shall be wasting our most precious national resource and shall be perpetuating unnecessary misery and human suffering.” And on the 1948 campaign trail he said, “Only 20 percent–one-fifth of our population is able to afford the medical care they need. Now that means that there are 110 million people in this country who can’t afford proper medical attention. That is a disgrace to the richest country in the world.”\nThe Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association has approved the expenditure in October of $1,100,000 in a newspaper and radio advertising campaign in an effort to deliver a knockout blow to the Administration pro gram for compulsory health insurance.\nWilliam Laurence, New York Times, June 27, 1950\nFollowing a surprising and close victory in the 1948 election (he won a plurality but not a majority of the popular vote) Truman continued to argue for national health insurance:\n- Many people are concerned about the cost of a national health program. The truth is that it will save a great deal more than it costs. We are already paying about four per cent of our national income for health care. More and better care can be obtained for this same amount of money under the program I am recommending. Furthermore, we can and should invest additional amounts in an adequate health program-for the additional investment will more than pay for itself. [April 22, 1949]\n- Now, personally, I have always understood that the Constitution of the United States imposes upon the Government of the United States a responsibility with respect to the general welfare of its citizens. And certainly no one can pretend that good health is not a matter of first importance so far as the general welfare is concerned. That is why, ever since I have been President, I have recommended programs which I believe will provide better medical and health services for all our people. Some groups have received these proposals enthusiastically. Others have been strongly against them. [September 16, 1952]\n- The health of the American people is one of our basic national resources. It is as important to the welfare of our country as our land, our water, and our minerals. Our National Government has been concerned about the preservation and development of these resources for decades. It is just as logical, and just as important, for us to be concerned about health. [November 19, 1952]\nUltimately, Truman had to admit defeat, writing towards the end of his presidency, “These ‘skin flint’ loan companies who charge the people from twenty-seven to fifty per cent interest on small loans, I think are the worst vultures we have to contend with—they and the American Medical Association are the very reason there has been such a howl about health insurance. One of their sources of ill-gotten income would be dried up. I can see very well why these loan companies wouldn't want health insurance but for the life of me I can't get the doctors [sic] point of view because the objective is to help these people have a nest egg so the doctors and hospitals can be paid.”\nDwight Eisenhower\nDuring his successful 1952 campaign for the presidency, Dwight Eisenhower stated his opposition to “socialized medicine,” a reflection of the language used to defeat Truman's comprehensive national health insurance plan. But Ike, assumed by many Democrats before the 1948 campaign to be one of them, considered himself a “modern Republican.” He had no desire to roll back the New Deal even as he criticized Truman's plans to expand it. He signed legislation that expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and he championed increased investment in the nation's infrastructure. His goals for health care were more restrained, but even as a candidate he balanced his opposition to government intervention in the health care system with the observation that, “Too many of our people live too far from adequate medical aid; too many of our people find the cost of adequate medical care too heavy.”\nDuring his 1954 State of the Union, Eisenhower professed his faith that “The great need for hospital and medical services can best be met by the initiative of private plans.” But he did suggest a role for the Federal Government.\nIt is unfortunately a fact that medical costs are rising and already impose severe hardships on many families. The Federal Government can do many helpful things and still carefully avoid the socialization of medicine. The Federal Government should encourage medical research in its battle with such mortal diseases as cancer and heart ailments, and should continue to help the states in their health and rehabilitation programs. The present Hospital Survey and Construction Act should be broadened in order to assist in the development of adequate facilities for the chronically ill, and to encourage the construction of diagnostic centers, rehabilitation facilities, and nursing homes. The war on disease also needs a better working relationship between Government and private initiative. Private and non-profit hospital and medical insurance plans are already in the field, soundly based on the experience and initiative of the people in their various communities. A limited Government reinsurance service would permit the private and non-profit insurance companies to offer broader protection to more of the many families which want and should have it.\nOn January 31, 1955, Eisenhower offered a Special Message to the Congress Recommending a Health Program:\nI recommend, consequently, the establishment of a Federal health reinsurance service to encourage private health insurance organizations in offering broader benefits to insured individuals and families and coverage to more people.\nIn addition, to improve medical care for the aged, the blind, dependent children, and the permanently and totally disabled who are public assistance recipients, I recommend the authorization of limited Federal grants to match State and local expenditures.\nReinsurance: The purpose of the reinsurance proposal is to furnish a system for broad sharing among health insurance organizations of the risks of experimentation. A system of this sort will give an incentive to the improvement of existing health insurance plans. It will encourage private, voluntary health insurance organizations to provide better protection—particularly against expensive illness—for those who now are insured against some of the financial hazards of illness. Reinsurance will also help to stimulate extension of private voluntary health insurance plans to millions of additional people who do not now have, but who could afford to purchase, health insurance.\nThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has been working with specialists from the insurance industry, with experts from the health professions, and with many other interested citizens, in its effort to perfect a sound reinsurance program—a program which involves no Government subsidy and no government competition with private insurance carriers. The time has come to put such a program to work for the American people.\nI urge the Congress to launch the reinsurance service this year by authorizing a reasonable capital fund and by providing for its use as necessary to reinsure three broad areas for expansion in private voluntary health insurance:\n1. health insurance plans providing protection against the high costs of severe or prolonged illness,\n2. health insurance plans providing coverage for individuals and families in predominantly rural areas,\n3. health insurance plans designed primarily for coverage of individuals and families of average or lower income against medical care costs in the home and physician's office as well as in the hospital.\nMedical care [or public assistance recipients. Nearly 5 million persons in the United States are now receiving public assistance under State programs aided by Federal grants. Present arrangements for their medical care, however, are far from adequate. Special provision for improving health services for these needy persons must be made.\nI recommend to the Congress, therefore, that it authorize separate Federal matching of State and local expenditures for the medical care needed by public assistance recipients. The separate matching should apply to each of the four Federally-aided categories--the aged, the permanently and totally disabled, the blind and children deprived of parental care.\nThough Ike did succeed in providing tax cuts for employers who gave their workers health insurance, the national reinsurance plan was not a priority and was never realized.\nFor more detail:\nDerickson, Alan, “Health Security for All?

Graduate Student Theses, Dissertations, & Professional Papers. 4492.\nhttps://scholarworks.umt.edu/etd/4492\nJohn Kennedy\nJFK's narrow victory over Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, gave him the opportunity to pursue a domestic agenda he called the “New Frontier.”B Kennedy was unable to call on the Democratic majority in Congress to support his most progressive legislative reforms, with many Southerners in his own party deeply suspicious of him. Among other social programs, he proposed medical care for the elderly through an expansion of Social Security.\nWhat we are now talking about doing, most of the countries of Europe did years ago.\nKennedy took his case to the American public through a rally held at Madison Square Garden in New York on May 20, 1962.\nAs were his predecessors, however, the president was at odds with the American Medical Association, which again launched a campaign against “socialized medicine.” When the bill failed in July by two votes in the Senate, JFK was left to lament, “I believe this is a most serious defeat for every American family, for the 17 million Americans who are over 65, whose means of support, whose livelihood, is certainly lessened over what it was in their working days, who are more inclined to be ill, who are more likely to be in hospitals, who are less able to pay their bills.”\nLyndon Johnson\nLyndon Johnson assumed the presidency following the stunning assassination of his predecessor, and his first months in office would be oriented by JFK's policies. But having felt sidelined as vice president, Johnson was anxious to put his formidable political skills to work, to succeed where Kennedy had not. “I do understand power,” he once said about himself. “I know where to look for it, and how to use it.” He swiftly moved beyond the Kennedy legacy to an ambitious domestic agenda he called “The Great Society.” Among other issues, health care was squarely in his sights.\nRather than address the health care system as a whole, Johnson pushed for the passage of Medicare for the elderly before the 1964 election. He was unsuccessful in the short-term but used the issue in his campaign against Barry Goldwater.\nAfter Johnson's landslide victory, passage of national health insurance for the elderly appeared imminent. The idea was popular, Democrats held solid majorities in both houses of Congress, and moderate Republicans were seeking to move toward the political center. Still, the particular form of the program, how much it would cost, and how it would be payed for were very much up for debate—and there were several proposals circulating around Capitol Hill.\nYou just tell them not to let it lay around; they can do that if they want to, but they might not. Then that gets the doctors organized, then they get the others organized, and they damn near killed my education bill lettin’ it lay around. And it stinks. It’s just like a dead cat on the door. When the committee reports it, you better either bury that cat or give it some life.\nLyndon Johnson, pushing for passage of Medicare, March 3, 1965\nRepublicans criticized the lack of coverage for physicians' fees and prescriptions and offered plans to add those benefits. Other members were concerned that the rising costs of health care would leave the Social Security trust fund vulnerable. Thus in its final form, the bill included coverage of physicians' fees and provided for a separate trust fund for Medicare. And to decrease the opposition of the AMA, the final bill left physicians and insurance companies with a substantial amount of control over fees. But Johnson also was able to include Medicaid, which covered poorer Americans. Thus, much like Civil Rights, his final triumph went beyond what Kennedy had proposed.\nOn July 30, 1965, Johnson traveled to the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri, to sign the bill and pay homage to the man who had pushed so hard for a Federal health plan. He presented the first two Medicare cards to President Truman and his wife, Bess, and addressed his remarks to the 33rd president and tracing the roots of the bill back to FDR.\nThere are more than 18 million Americans over the age of 65. Most of them have low incomes. Most of them are threatened by illness and medical expenses that they cannot afford.\nAnd through this new law, Mr. President, every citizen will be able, in his productive years when he is earning, to insure himself against the ravages of illness in his old age.\nThis insurance will help pay for care in hospitals, in skilled nursing homes, or in the home. And under a separate plan it will help meet the fees of the doctors.\nNow here is how the plan will affect you:\nDuring your working years, the people of America—you—will contribute through the social security program a small amount each payday for hospital insurance protection. For example, the average worker in 1966 will contribute about $1.50 per month. The employer will contribute a similar amount. And this will provide the funds to pay up to 90 days of hospital care for each illness, plus diagnostic care, and up to 100 home health visits after you are 65. And beginning in 1967, you will also be covered for up to 100 days of care in a skilled nursing home after a period of hospital care.\nAnd under a separate plan, when you are 65—that the Congress originated itself, in its own good judgment—you may be covered for medical and surgical fees whether you are in or out of the hospital. You will pay $3 per month after you are 65 and your Government will contribute an equal amount.\nThe benefits under the law are as varied and broad as the marvelous modern medicine itself. If it has a few defects—such as the method of payment of certain specialists-then I am confident those can be quickly remedied and I hope they will be.\nNo longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years. No longer will young families see their own incomes, and their own hopes, eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents, and to their uncles, and their aunts.\nAnd no longer will this Nation refuse the hand of justice to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to the progress of this progressive country.\nAnd this bill, Mr. President, is even broader than that. It will increase social security benefits for all of our older Americans. It will improve a wide range of health and medical services for Americans of all ages.\nIn 1935 when the man that both of us loved so much, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, signed the Social Security Act, he said it was, and I quote him, \"a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but it is by no means complete.\"\nWell, perhaps no single act in the entire administration of the beloved Franklin D. Roosevelt really did more to win him the illustrious place in history that he has as did the laying of that cornerstone. And I am so happy that his oldest son Jimmy could be here to share with us the joy that is ours today. And those who share this day will also be remembered for making the most important addition to that structure, and you are making it in this bill, the most important addition that has been made in three decades.\nRichard Nixon\nNow it is time that we move forward again in still another critical area: health care.\nRichard Nixon tried not once, but twice to make major changes to the American health care system. A mandate for employer-provided heath insurance was a key foundations of his 1971 health strategy. During his State of the Union address in January, Nixon set out his goals:\nI will offer a far-reaching set of proposals for improving America's health care and making it available more fairly to more people.\nI will propose:\n—A program to insure that no American family will be prevented from obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay.\n—I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical schools, to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health personnel.\n—Incentives to improve the delivery of health services, to get more medical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately served, to make greater use of medical assistants, and to slow the alarming rise in the costs of medical care.\n—New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking the causes of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors to keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick.\nI will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later for whatever additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease. Let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.\nAmerica has long been the wealthiest nation in the world. Now it is time we became the healthiest nation in the world.\nNixon's initial proposal included the following:\n- Employers would be required to provide basic health insurance with specific coverage requirements.\n- Employees would share the cost up to a cap.\n- For the self-employed and others, special insurance programs at reasonable rates would be made available.\n- A completely federal plan open to any family below a certain income level would replace Medicaid—cost-sharing would rise with income.\nNixon's efforts during his first term, however, went nowhere.\nIn 1974, following his re-election, like Truman before him, he tried again. When he launched the effort in his State of the Union, however, he was at pains to suggest that no taxes would be required and that he would not “put our whole health care system under the heavy hand of the Federal government.” And in February, Nixon delivered a Special Message to the Congress Proposing a Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan—the third special message on health care of his presidency.\nBeyond the question of the prices of health care, our present system of health care insurance suffers from two major flaws :\nFirst, even though more Americans carry health insurance than ever before, the 25 million Americans who remain uninsured often need it the most and are most unlikely to obtain it. They include many who work in seasonal or transient occupations, high-risk cases, and those who are ineligible for Medicaid despite low incomes.\nSecond, those Americans who do carry health insurance often lack coverage which is balanced, comprehensive and fully protective:\n—Forty percent of those who are insured are not covered for visits to physicians on an out-patient basis, a gap that creates powerful incentives toward high cost care in hospitals;\n—Few people have the option of selecting care through prepaid arrangements offered by Health Maintenance Organizations so the system at large does not benefit from the free choice and creative competition this would offer;\n—Very few private policies cover preventive services;\n—Most health plans do not contain built-in incentives to reduce waste and inefficiency. The extra costs of wasteful practices are passed on, of course, to consumers; and\n—Fewer than half of our citizens under 65—and almost none over 65—have major medical coverage which pays for the cost of catastrophic illness.\nThese gaps in health protection can have tragic consequences. They can cause people to delay seeking medical attention until it is too late. Then a medical crisis ensues, followed by huge medical bills—or worse. Delays in treatment can end in death or lifelong disability.\nCOMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN (CHIP)\nEarly last year, I directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prepare a new and improved plan for comprehensive health insurance. That plan, as I indicated in my State of the Union message, has been developed and I am presenting it to the Congress today. I urge its enactment as soon as possible.\nThe plan is organized around seven principles:\nFirst, it offers every American an opportunity to obtain a balanced, comprehensive range of health insurance benefits;\nSecond, it will cost no American more than he can afford to pay;\nThird, it builds on the strength and diversity of our existing public and private systems of health financing and harmonizes them into an overall system;\nFourth, it uses public funds only where needed and requires no new Federal taxes;\nFifth, it would maintain freedom of choice by patients and ensure that doctors work for their patient, not for the Federal Government.\nSixth, it encourages more effective use of our health care resources;\nAnd finally, it is organized so that all parties would have a direct stake in making the system work--consumer, provider, insurer, State governments and the Federal Government.\nBy August, Watergate had consumed the Nixon presidency, and with it, any hopes for health care reform.\nGerald Ford\nNixon's vice president, Gerald Ford, had a host of problems to consider when he assumed the presidency on August 9, 1974, not least of which was to restore the nation's trust in the highest office in the land. Three days later, in an address to a joint session of Congress, Ford kept his plans vague, saying, “As vice president, I studied various proposals for better health care financing. I saw them coming closer together and urged my friends in the Congress and in the administration to sit down and sweat out a sound compromise. The comprehensive health insurance plan goes a long ways toward providing early relief to people who are sick. Why don't we write—and I ask this with the greatest spirit of cooperation—why don't we write a good health bill on the statute books in 1974, before this Congress adjourns?”\nWe cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans.\nFurther efforts on health care were similarly restrained. Inflation began to soar in the Ford years, and it is not surprising that he saw the issue through the lens of cost. In his 1976 State of the Union, he focused more on health care costs than on quality or expansion of coverage.\nHospital and medical services in America are among the best in the world, but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a family's lifetime savings. Increasing health costs are of deep concern to all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living. The burden of catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society. We must eliminate this fear from every family.\nI propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by Medicare. To finance this added protection, fees for short-term care will go up somewhat, but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than $500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care, nor more than $250 for one year's doctor bills.\nWe cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans. The experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of such plans. But I do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer more middle-income families high quality health services at prices they can afford and shield them also from their catastrophic illnesses.\nWe have built a haphazard, unsound, undirected, inefficient nonsystem which has left us unhealthy and unwealthy at the same time.\nJimmy Carter, April 16, 1976\nJimmy Carter\nJimmy Carter ran for the presidency in 1976 at the head of a Democratic Party that had been pushing for a national health insurance plan during the early 1970s. At the head of the effort was Senator Edward Kennedy, who would become a major opponent of the president. Kennedy was passionate about his bill to establish a single-payer insurance system to cover all Americans, and had lined up supporters among labor unions and other core groups. During the campaign, Carter endorsed the idea, but once in office began to grapple with the financial and political realities. The issue brought out the stark personality differences between himself and Kennedy, who grew deeply frustrated at Carter's unwillingness to move decisively.\nEverybody in the Democratic Party wanted a health care bill. The issue was what kind of a health care bill.\nJoseph Califano, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1977–1979\nBelieving it was politically unfeasible to change the healthcare system in one fell swoop, Carter focused on a plan that would keep costs down and gradually cover all Americans, recalled Joseph Califano, Carter's secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, during his interview for the Miller Center's Edward M. Kennedy Oral History: \"We would have combined Medicare and Medicaid into one program. The government would have paid for the poor and the old, and we would have mandated employers—starting the way [Franklin] Roosevelt started the minimum wage—we'd mandate the big employers, who were already providing more than the mandate, to provide mandated coverage, and then gradually, over a period of time, cover everybody.”\nThat wasn't good enough for Kennedy, who thought an incremental, piecemeal approach was a formula for failure. Though willing to negotiate with Carter, by 1978 the senator had broken with the president and prepared not only to introduce his own health care bill but also to mount a primary challenge to a second Carter term. Needless to say, there was no real way to pass legislation as the Carter years came to an end.\nStuart Eizenstat, a Carter assistant for domestic affairs and policy, pointed to something else. “It’s interesting and ironic that during a Republican President—Ford and then Nixon—you had a very activist Congress,” he told Miller Center historians during a Jimmy Carter Oral History interview. “And here a Democrat comes into office, committed to furthering that, and you’ve got a Democratic Congress which begins to resist. I think that what happened is that even though they were Democrats, they began to reflect what was happening out there in their districts, which was a growing sense of conservatism.”\nRonald Reagan\nIn the most well-known line of his inaugural address, Ronald Reagan expressed a philosophy diametrically opposed to the New Deal: “In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” This move away from involving government in major problems had actually begun with his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, who had himself centered his most famous speech around a “growing crisis of confidence.” (In contrast, the 1972 Democratic standard-bearer George McGovern told Miller Center historians, “I’ve always thought that every major problem facing the United States cannot be solved without the full and active support of the United States government, and that far from being the problem, government is our only hope to deal with the healthcare crisis, the environmental crisis, educational problems, and other things.”)\nNonetheless, in a 1983 message to Congress, Reagan outlined his view of the health care issues facing the nation:\nRising health care costs are a problem that affects everyone. The elderly, who are covered by Medicare, face the threat of catastrophic illness expense, against which Medicare offers no protection. The poor on Medicaid have seen coverage reduced as States have been forced by rising costs to make cutbacks. Workers with employment-based health insurance have received lower cash wages, because of the unchecked cost increases for health benefits. Americans pay for health care costs in other hidden forms, including higher costs for the merchandise they buy, since the costs of employee health care benefits must be included in the price of products.\nBut he immediately added, “As is the case with many of our national difficulties, past Federal policy has been a part of the problem. These policies have thwarted normal incentives for efficiency in health care.”\nThe Reagan administration began by limiting Federal contributions to Medicare and Medicaid and pushing administration of the programs to the states through block grants. Reimbursement to providers was also limited to a set fee schedule based on geographic area.\nReagan did address a specific health care issue in his 1986 State of the Union: “After seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family, I am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis Bowen, to report to me by year end with recommendations on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes.”\nThe result was the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, which was intended to protect the elderly from the cost of ongoing hospital care, prescription drugs, and copayments to physicians. However, with beneficiaries paying a fee the additional coverage, the law came under criticism and was repealed the following year.\nFor more detail: Combs-Orme, Terri and Guyer, Bernard (1992) \"America's Health Care System: The Reagan Legacy,\" The Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare: Vol. 19: Issue 1, Article 6. https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/jssw/vol19/iss1/6\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

They also maintain the responsibility is not theirs to keep track of injuries and deaths.\n“CCSD does not govern/manage streets and roadways, thus the district is not the repository of incidents that occur on roadways,” a spokesperson wrote in an email.\nBut the district does oversee the Safe Routes to School program, a countywide initiative tasked with identifying improvements and policies to protect students who walk and bike to campus.\nAt Greenspun Junior High School in Henderson, a parent said she was concerned that the district was not keeping tabs on crashes.\n“I would lose my mind if the police didn’t report it so the school could protect our kids,” Jessica Flores said. “We as adults have an obligation to our kids to keep them safe, no matter what the cost is.”\nNo government agency is aggressively tracking the information, even as traffic fatalities involving pedestrians and bicyclists of all ages are up in Clark County. There have been 46 pedestrian deaths through August, a 15 percent jump compared to the same time period last year.\nReporting crashes near campuses to CCSD is at the discretion of valley officers, according to law enforcement officials.\nSouthern Nevada’s largest city and county police departments said they are not required by the state to determine whether children hit by vehicles are students, nor are they required to alert school district police when they do learn of crashes involving pupils.\nInformation that officers do pass along to CCSD police is not automatically shared with the district’s risk management department, which cultivates its own crash list from school administrators and parents.\nUNLV Traffic Safety Coalition coordinator Erin Breen said the Review-Journal’s findings demand officials create a better tracking system.\n“If we don’t know where kids are being hit, how do we know where to put our efforts?” she asked. “How do we know where we need to make changes?”\nCrash numbers don’t match\nCCSD provided a list of crashes to the Review-Journal that showed zero students were killed while walking or biking to school from 2015 through 2019.\nBut several were killed, including 17-year-old Daniel Benavides in September 2015, 11-year-old Jazmin Espana in February 2017 and 12-year-old Jonny Smith in March 2019. All three were walking home from CCSD schools, according to police records and media reports.\nDaniel was struck crossing Commerce Street outside a crosswalk near Mojave High School; Jazmin, walking with a friend from Woodbury Middle School, was hit by a garbage truck in a crosswalk; and Jonny, walking with two boys, was hit outside of a crosswalk near Faiss Middle School. A fourth student, Niccoli Franklin, 9, was killed while riding his bike in March 2018 behind Silvestri Junior High School. An SUV struck him about a half hour after classes ended at nearby Cartwright Elementary, where Franklin was a student, records show.\nThe crash that fractured Alex Wigg’s skull also was not included.\nIn April 2017, a Mercedes-Benz sedan collided with Alex as the fifth grader’s mountain bike entered a city crosswalk not far from Givens Elementary School, where he was headed. The impact flung him through the air and onto the asphalt, a witness told police.\nThe then-11-year-old spent three days heavily sedated and on a ventilator as doctors at University Medical Center reduced the swelling in his brain. Now 17, Alex is a junior in high school with his own driver’s license, but he still lives with lingering effects from a traumatic brain injury.\nHis mom, Jena Antonchuk, said she was surprised her son’s name was not on the district’s list. She said Alex’s principal checked on him in the hospital, and CCSD later included him in a video promoting bike safety.\n“Clearly the school is very aware of it,” she said. “Why would he not show up?”\nCases like Alex’s show what’s at stake when it comes to traffic safety and children, Las Vegas trauma surgeon Dr. Paul Chestovich said.\nThis summer, Chestovich helped publish research showing UMC’s trauma center saw clear spikes in children hit by cars on school days. An average of 25 to 30 were treated each year from 2011 to 2019.\n“First and foremost, these should be counted closely,” he said. “Just to make sure that some sort of investigation is done to find out why it happened, and if it can be prevented in the future.”\nMost vulnerable: Middle schoolers\nThe most vulnerable were children ages 11 to 13. More than 150 were struck by cars near schools.\nThey accounted for about half of the injuries identified in the Review-Journal’s data analysis, despite junior high and middle school students making up about 25 percent of CCSD’s total enrollment.\nParents, school district officials and traffic safety experts blamed a mix of impatient drivers, impulsive students and distractions, like smartphones. They also noted that middle schools typically have more students than elementary schools, intensifying chaos during pickup and drop-off times, and that middle schoolers who bike or walk home are less likely to be accompanied by an adult.\nAt Greenspun Junior High School in mid-September, the afternoon dismissal bell rang out like a starter’s pistol.\nWithin minutes, hundreds of students had spilled out of the Henderson campus and toward a line of cars parked along either side of Valle Verde Drive.\nThe exodus was frenetic. Some children zipped down the four-lane street on bikes and scooters, while others loudly chased their friends down the sidewalk.\nCars merged in and out of traffic heading in either direction. Drivers made illegal U-turns and parked illegally next to red curbs. Some parents complained they’d seen vehicles speed through the marked school zone before.\nSpeed limits in Nevada school zones are posted at 15 to 25 mph.\n“It’s an absolute madhouse,” said Flores, who arrived early to pick up her son.\nVehicles struck and injured at least four children walking or biking near Greenspun from 2015 through 2019. In the most recent crash, occurring at an intersection just north of the school, two teenage boys told police a Tesla struck the bicycle they were riding and then fled the scene, leaving their arms scraped and swollen, records show.\nGreenspun parent Lynne Serrano said the school’s enrollment last year — 1,400 students — was more than triple her son’s elementary school. She arrives an hour early each afternoon so her sixth grader can get into her pickup truck without crossing the street.\n“It’s not that I don’t trust him,” she said. “I don’t trust the drivers.”\nPrincipal Jackie Carducci said she’s worked with Henderson police to improve safety conditions. Orange traffic cones block her school’s entrance so children can safely cross the parking lot, and city officials installed a crosswalk with flashing beacons on Valle Verde Drive in April 2019.\nNoticeably missing, Carducci said, is the presence of neon-clad crossing guards,\n“I think crossing guards would be beneficial to all junior high schools,” Carducci said. “They’re easily seen. Parents tend to pay more attention.”\nCCSD police Lt. Bryan Zink said collisions inside and near crosswalks is the “No. 1” traffic safety problem facing students, “just because people are not paying attention.”\nHowever, guards are only present at elementary schools, a decision made by city and county governments, not the school district.\nThe fifth-largest school district in the country, CCSD includes more than 300 campuses in the Las Vegas Valley.\nPleas to expand the services have grown louder this school year after a bus driver shortage forced changes in class start and end times across the district. As a result, some middle schools have lost the spillover benefit of being near campuses with crossing guards.\nUNLV will host a meeting between city and county officials Thursday to discuss how crossing guards are allocated and whether their services can be expanded to middle schools, Breen said.\nStaffing the more than 700 existing positions has proved difficult due to rising gasoline prices and the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Baron Farwell, general manager of The Crossing Guard Company.\n“With the average age of our employees being close to 70 years old, our losses have been staggering,” he wrote in a letter to local officials this June.\nMany vacancies were filled after the position’s hourly wage was raised from $15 to $15.50, but recruiting remains a year-round process, said regional manager Lisa Morrison.\nHenderson spokeswoman Kathleen Richards said the city will continue “prioritizing crossing guard services at elementary schools, where younger children need more assistance from an adult to cross certain roadways.”\nMore enforcement\nLocal government officials say they are working hard to protect students from getting hit.\nPolice conduct traffic enforcement campaigns near schools each fall, the most recent resulting in hundreds of tickets. The school district regularly holds safety education events for students. Public works departments continue to improve dangerous roadways and devised suggested routes for pedestrians.\nThe Safe Routes to School program is also aggressively recruiting more middle schools to voluntarily enroll, coordinator Jennifer Grube said.\nApproximately 240 schools are part of the program, but less than half of those are actively participating. Grube, who took the program’s helm in 2021, said she’s reorganizing the program to improve that.\n“At the end of the day we are working with our community and our administration and our families, making sure that we get the word out,” she said.\nOne of the federally funded program’s duties is to monitor arrivals and dismissals at schools to identify safety problems.\nThat was important for Antonchuk, the mother whose son, Alex, was hospitalized biking to school. She recalled the myriad of near misses and unchecked bad drivers she’s seen around schools over the years, those that police never had the chance to investigate.\n“Numbers say only so much,” she said. “It doesn’t capture the entire experience of what’s going on on the streets with the kids.”\nUNLV’s Breen said it was critical for officials across Southern Nevada to create a clearer picture about how often and where students are hit.\nFor now, even the school district’s limited data indicates students are more at risk.\nDuring the 2021-2022 school year, CCSD reported 23 students were injured, more than it recorded the previous six years combined. An additional five crashes occurred this August.\n“If people don’t know what the problem is then they aren’t tuned into it,” Breen said. “Working in a vacuum isn’t conducive to making the problem better.”\nEditor’s note: Michael Scott Davidson wrote this story and completed the data analysis with Teghan Simonton.\nDavidson was a member of the Review-Journal’s investigative team. Staff writer Briana Erickson contributed to this report. Teghan Simonton was a summer intern for the Review-Journal. Have feedback? Send emails to rprast@reviewjournal.com.\nHow we reported this story\nThe Review-Journal sought to evaluate how frequently vehicles injured children walking and biking near Las Vegas Valley public schools, around times that classes began and ended.\nStatewide crash data from 2015 through 2019 was obtained from the Nevada Department of Transportation.\nThe newspaper focused on crashes in the Las Vegas Valley where vehicles struck pedestrians or bicyclists who were ages 5 to 17 years old. The children must have reported some level of injury to police to be included in the analysis.\nThe results were narrowed to crashes within one-quarter mile of Clark County School District campuses in the Valley, a radius approximately the length of a single lap around an outdoor track. Special education schools, alternative programs and schools that opened after the 2019-2020 school year were not included. Roughly 300 campuses remained.\nThe Review-Journal narrowed its focus to crashes that happened on scheduled school days, during hours when students likely would have been traveling to or from school. That ranged from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.\nStruck children were grouped by their ages. Ages 5 to 10 were categorized as elementary school, ages 11 to 13 as middle school, and ages 14 to 17 as high school.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        School Bus Safety\nSchool Buses are Unlike Other Vehicles\nSchool buses have bigger blind spots, take longer to stop, and need more room to maneuver than a standard vehicle. Buses should be treated differently than you would treat an average-sized vehicle. It is important for drivers to know how to react to a school bus in operation.\nWhen you encounter a school bus:\n-\nSlow down. School buses make frequent stops, so be patient and drive at a reasonable speed. Remember, in addition to picking up and dropping off students, school buses are required by law to stop at railroad crossings.\n-\nBe alert. Always be aware of children and parents that may be waiting at a school bus stop or perhaps running to catch the bus before it departs.\n- Come to a complete stop at least 20 feet away from the bus.\n-\nBe extra careful to look around before moving your vehicle, as children may be walking in front of, behind, or on the side of school buses. Check for pedestrians - especially near schools, bus stops, playgrounds, parks, and behind parked cars.\nThe Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee (GTSC) reports that in New York State, 2.3 million children are transported by more than 50,000 school buses annually.\nLaws protect students who are getting on and off a school bus by making it illegal for drivers to pass a school bus while the school bus is stopped for the purpose of dropping off or picking up passengers and the red lights on the school bus are flashing, regardless of the direction of approach.\nYoungest Students at Risk\nThe New York State Education Department, Department of Pupil Transportation, states that the youngest students are most at risk.\nChildren ages 4 to 8 (grades K-3) are most susceptible to a school bus fatality. These children, though they represent less than 35% of the student population, were involved in 69% of the fatalities (79 out of 114). Factors that likely contribute to these statistics:\n-\nThe smaller stature of younger children makes them more difficult for bus drivers and motorists to see.\n-\nThese younger students are unable to see over or around objects such as parked cars or bushes.\nRight of Way\nWhen a school bus stops and flashes its red lights, traffic approaching from either direction must stop before reaching the bus:\n- on a two-lane road\n- on multi-lane highways\n- on divided highways\nFatalities Caused by Passing Motorists\nFatal crashes involving students who were struck by passing motorists typically involved one or more of the following factors:\n- Motorists attempted to pass the bus, claiming they did not have time to wait.\n- Motorists claimed they couldn’t see the flashing lights because the lights were dirty or because sun, rain, snow, or fog blinded them.\n- The bus driver waved the car through the red flashing lights, unaware a child was crossing the road at that time. Even if the bus driver waves you ahead, you should still remain vigilant and keep to slower speeds.\n- The motorist, demonstrating disregard for the law and/or children’s safety, did not stop for the flashing red lights.\nConsequences\nVehicle Operators - There are legal and financial consequences for vehicle operators who pass a school bus while the school bus is stopped for the purpose of dropping off or picking up passengers and red lights on the school bus are flashing.\n- First conviction - fine of $250-$400 and/or up to 30 days in jail\n- Second conviction within 3 years - fine of $600-$750 and/or up to 180 days in jail\n- Third conviction (or more) within 3 years - fine of $750-$1,500 and/or up to 180 days in jail\nFive points will be added to the operator's driving record for each conviction.\nVehicle Owners - A law was passed in 2019 (VTL 1174-A) that authorizes school districts and municipalities to use stop-arm cameras on school buses to impose penalties on the owners of vehicles which pass a school bus while the school bus is stopped for the purpose of dropping off or picking up passengers and red lights on the school bus are flashing.\n- First violation - penalty of $250\n- Second violation within 18 months - penalty of $275\n- Third violation (or more) within 18 months - penalty of $300\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The 2013–14 budget assumed that 2012–13 would end with a $254 million reserve. Our General Fund revenue forecast for 2012–13 now projects $1.65 billion in higher revenues for 2012–13, compared to the budget act’s assumptions. Revenues for 2012–13 ended stronger than was assumed, principally due to personal income tax (PIT) collections. Our higher revenue forecast results in $1.75 billion in additional General Fund expenditures under the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. That is, for every $1.00 of extra revenue, state spending for schools and community colleges on average is projected to grow by $1.07. This is due to the manner in which the budget plan makes so called “maintenance factor payments” to schools and community colleges. Assuming only minor changes in the entering fund balance, we estimate that 2012–13 ended with a $234 million reserve. While this small reserve equals only 0.2 percent of 2012–13 spending, it nevertheless would be the first positive year–end reserve since 2007–08.\nThe 2013–14 budget assumed the state would end the fiscal year with a reserve of $1.1 billion. We now estimate that the reserve will more than double—to $2.4 billion—primarily as the net result of the following factors:\n- $4.7 Billion in Higher Revenues. Largely due to a higher forecast of capital gains and stronger–than–expected stock price growth, our forecast of PIT revenues for 2013–14 is about $5.2 billion higher than was assumed in the 2013–14 budget. That increase in revenues is partially offset by lower projections of sales and use tax (SUT) and corporation tax (CT) revenues of about $200 million for each of these two tax sources.\n- $3.1 Billion in Higher General Fund Proposition 98 Spending. Most of the increased spending in our forecast for 2013–14 is for schools and community colleges. Specifically, we estimate that the Proposition 98 General Fund spending will be $3.1 billion higher than the amount provided in the budget due to our forecast of higher state revenues.\n- $0.3 Billion in Other Spending. We estimate that other General Fund spending will be nearly $300 million higher than assumed in the 2013–14 budget. For example, in September 2013 the Legislature passed Chapter 310, Statutes of 2013 (SB 105, Steinberg), which appropriated additional funding to address a federal court order requiring the state to reduce the prison population. We estimate that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will have net additional spending of nearly $250 million in 2013–14.\nThese changes have the effect of increasing the 2013–14 operating surplus from the $817 million assumed in the budget to $2.2 billion.\nBasis for Our Projections\nPurpose of Our Forecast. This forecast does not attempt to predict the budgetary decisions that will be made by the state’s elected leaders. Rather, it is our office’s best estimate of the state’s fiscal condition if current law and current policies remain unchanged through 2019–20. In the near term, therefore, the purpose of this forecast is to provide the Legislature with our best estimate of the resources that will be available in next year’s budget deliberations. Beyond 2014–15, the forecast aims to provide lawmakers with a general sense of the future health of the General Fund budget.\nUses Standard Economic Forecasting Practices. Economic conditions affect not only tax revenues that the state collects, but also state spending levels. For example, the state’s Proposition 98 minimum guarantee for schools and community colleges is determined based on changes in state revenues and economic factors. Further, state spending for health and human services tends to change along with factors such as unemployment, age, and income. Consistent with other mainstream economic forecasts, our forecast assumes that the economy will grow throughout the forecast period. We do not presume that we can predict the timing of recessions.\nForecast Generally Based on Current Laws. Our estimates generally are based on current laws, including those in the State Constitution (such as the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee for schools and community colleges), state statutes, and federal law. In general, this means that we assume taxes and programs operate throughout the forecast period consistent with current law. For example, if state law authorizes a certain tax or program through only part of our forecast period, we generally assume that the law is allowed to play out and that the tax or program expires. For instance, our forecast assumes that the temporary taxes approved by voters in Proposition 30 will expire during the forecast period because it would take a future action either by the Legislature or by voters to extend those taxes.\nForecast Also Considers Certain Recent State Practices. In some cases, we have relied on what has been recent state practice in forecasting revenues and spending. For example, although the state’s hospital quality assurance fee—which offsets General Fund Medi–Cal costs—expires in 2016, the Legislature has extended the fee three times since its initial adoption. In this case, we assume that the current state practice is to continue reauthorizing that fee. Similarly, transfers to the Budget Stabilization Account, the state’s rainy–day fund created by Proposition 58 (2004), have been suspended each year since 2008–09. We assume those suspensions continue throughout the forecast period. Later in this chapter, we discuss how the state might build a comparable reserve under an alternate scenario.\nCOLAs and Inflation Adjustments Generally Omitted. Consistent with the state laws adopted in 2009 that eliminated automatic cost–of–living adjustments (COLAs) and price increases for most state programs, our forecast generally omits such inflation–related cost increases. This means, for example, that budgets for the universities have not been adjusted for general price increases throughout the forecast period. We include inflation–related cost increases when they are required under federal or state law, as is common in health programs.\nMany State Liabilities Remain Unpaid Under Current Law. In the case of state liabilities with repayment dates in state law, we generally assume those liabilities to be repaid according to schedule. For example, our forecast assumes that the deficit–financing bonds authorized by Proposition 57 (2004) continue to be repaid under their established financing mechanism. Other liabilities, however, are not required to be repaid by the state General Fund on any specific timeline under today’s laws and policies. These include some of the items on the Governor’s “wall of debt” (a collection of various budgetary liabilities), along with unfunded liabilities of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. If the state were to make additional payments toward repaying these liabilities, the operating surpluses projected in our forecast would be reduced by like amounts.\nWe project that the General Fund operating surplus in 2014–15 will be $3.2 billion, an increase of about $1 billion from our forecast of the 2013–14 operating surplus. Generally, the larger operating surplus is the result of our forecast of revenues growing faster than our forecast of expenditures. In 2014–15, we project that General Fund revenues and transfers will grow 5.7 percent and that spending will grow 4.8 percent. Specifically, our forecast reflects the following:\n- $5.8 Billion in Higher Revenues. While revenue growth is expected to be somewhat depressed in 2013–14—due mainly to higher income taxpayers accelerating 2013 income into 2012—we expect revenues to bounce back in 2014–15, principally related to PIT growth. Specifically, we forecast PIT growth in 2014–15 to be 8.1 percent for a year–over–year increase of $5.4 billion. Further, we forecast 2014–15 growth in the CT and SUT to be 6.9 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.\n- $3.3 Billion in Higher General Fund Proposition 98 Spending. Our forecast of healthy revenue growth in 2014–15 produces additional growth in Proposition 98 spending. We estimate that General Fund spending needed to satisfy the Proposition 98 guarantee will increase $3.3 billion over our revised projection of 2013–14 spending levels.\n- $1.5 Billion in Higher Spending in Other Parts of the Budget. Outside of Proposition 98, we forecast that spending will increase by $1.5 billion in 2014–15. Most notably, this includes increases of $630 million in debt service on infrastructure bonds and about $600 million in health and human services (excluding California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids [CalWORKs]). The higher spending is offset by increased savings of $650 million related to a decision in the 2013–14 budget to redirect certain realignment funds to help pay for what otherwise would be state costs for CalWORKs.\nAs shown in Figure 2, we project that operating surpluses will grow at a rate of between about $1 billion and $3 billion each year between 2014–15 and 2017–18, at which point we estimate that they will reach $9.6 billion under current laws and policies. As the temporary taxes authorized by Proposition 30 phase out over several fiscal years near the end of our forecast period, we project that operating surpluses will remain stable as revenues and expenditures grow at similar rates. All this is premised upon our assumption of continuing economic growth through 2020.\nIn the Near and Medium Term, Strong Revenue Growth. Proposition 30 increased PIT rates on high–income taxpayers from 2012 through 2018, and SUT rates from 2013 through 2016. Under our forecast, Proposition 30 greatly influences revenue growth, particularly in the case of the PIT. Because taxable income has been growing faster for high–income taxpayers, by increasing the marginal PIT rates on those individuals, Proposition 30 has the effect of boosting PIT growth higher than it would be otherwise. In 2014–15 and 2015–16, we forecast total General Fund revenues and transfers to grow 5.7 percent in each year. We project revenue growth to slow thereafter to 4.6 percent in 2016–17 and 4.3 percent in 2017–18, due largely to the phase out of the Â¼–cent sales tax increase authorized by Proposition 30.\nAs Proposition 30 PIT Increases Phase Out—Much Slower Revenue Growth Forecasted. Under Proposition 30, the increase in PIT rates for high–income taxpayers generates a much greater proportion of revenue than the sales tax increase. As a result, the phase out of the higher rates in 2018–19 and 2019–20 has a much more significant impact on revenue growth. Over these two fiscal years, we project that General Fund revenues grow at an average annual rate of only 1.9 percent. As shown in Figure 2, this has the effect of stabilizing the projected trend of annual operating surpluses, as revenues and expenditures grow at similar rates in those two years. In fact, the phase out of Proposition 30 would have had the effect of reducing those operating surpluses in 2018–19 and 2019–20, were it not for projected property tax growth and the end of the “triple flip,” as described below.\nGeneral Fund Benefits From Property Taxes, End of Triple Flip in Our Forecast. The Proposition 98 minimum guarantee is funded by two revenue streams—state General Fund support and local property tax revenue distributed to schools. In most years, this local property tax revenue offsets the amount that the state must spend on schools and community colleges, resulting in dollar–for–dollar savings for the General Fund. We project that in the later years of our forecast increases in the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee will largely be paid from school property tax growth. Specifically, while we project that General Fund Proposition 98 spending will increase by 7.8 percent in 2014–15 and 4.4 percent in 2015–16, we forecast it to slow thereafter to an average annual rate of just 0.9 percent for the remainder of the forecast period. The property tax–related factors include:\n- Healthy Local Property Tax Growth. As described in Chapter 3, over the next several years, we project underlying local property taxes to grow, on average, about 7 percent each year. This is consistent with average historical growth, but above levels seen in recent years.\n- Increased Property Taxes Due to Redevelopment Dissolution. We project that school property taxes related to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies (RDA) will increase from $763 million in 2013–14 to $1.9 billion in 2019–20. These state savings will be offset somewhat by decreases in the revenues from RDA assets over the period.\n- End of Triple Flip. Finally, we project that the triple flip—a complex financing mechanism created to repay the state’s deficit–financing bonds of the 2000s—will turn off in 2016–17, resulting in an annual General Fund benefit of about $1.6 billion beginning in 2016–17.\nForecast Reflects Continued Improvement in State’s Finances. In our November 2012 Fiscal Outlook report, we projected that with continued growth in the economy and restraint in new program commitments, the state budget could experience multibillion–dollar operating surpluses within a few years. Since that time, our forecast of General Fund revenues and transfers has increased by a few billion dollars for 2013–14 and 2014–15, and by between $2 billion and $3 billion for each of 2015–16 through 2017–18. In the June budget package for 2013–14, the Legislature and the Governor limited new commitments to a small handful of areas. These factors produce a budgetary situation for 2014–15 that is even more promising than we projected last year.\nSurpluses Dependent on Several Key Assumptions. Despite the large reserve that we are projecting for the 2014–15 budget process, the state’s continued fiscal recovery is dependent on a number of assumptions that may not come to pass. Specifically, our forecast assumes:\n- Continued Economic Growth. Our forecast assumes steady, moderate economic growth, typical of that seen during a mature economic expansion. This growth drives the increase in revenues and contributes to lower General Fund spending in some areas of the budget (such as CalWORKs grant payments). This assumed economic growth also informs our forecast of local property tax growth, which as mentioned earlier offsets General Fund spending required to meet the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Economic growth, therefore, is probably the most important assumption in our forecast.\n- Many Budgetary and Retirement Liabilities Remain Unpaid. As described earlier, our forecast assumes that some of the state’s budgetary and retirement liabilities are repaid. For example, we assume that the state increases payments to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) as required by the CalPERS board, which will reduce the state’s unfunded liabilities for state employee pension benefits over time. Other liabilities, however, are not required to be repaid from the state General Fund on specific timelines under today’s laws and policies. These include some of the items on the Governor’s wall of debt, along with massive retirement liabilities related to the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. If additional payments are made in the future to repay these various liabilities, the operating surpluses in our forecast would be reduced by a like amount. (Besides support from the General Fund, other sources of funding—from school districts and teachers, for example—and other policy decisions may be needed to address some of these liabilities over time.)\nRecession Possible During Forecast Period. Like other economic forecasters, we are unable to predict the timing of either a major slowdown in the economy or an actual recession. The severity of the most recent recession may result in a longer–than–average economic expansion. However, it is possible that a recession will occur before 2020. In fact, the current U.S. economic expansion is already over four years old. Since World War II, the average expansion has been just under five years.\nSketch of Hypothetical Recession. To demonstrate the budgetary effects of a possible recession, we have produced one hypothetical recession scenario, as displayed in Figure 3. We developed this scenario to simulate how a moderate recession could affect state finances, but this is merely an illustration of one possible scenario—the severity of an actual recession sometime during the future could be stronger or weaker than that portrayed in Figure 3. In the scenario displayed in Figure 3, revenues fall 10 percent below what our forecast would otherwise be for 2015–16, and then 15 percent below forecasted levels for 2016–17. The revenue losses would be offset somewhat by lower Proposition 98 minimum requirements, and we assume that the state would reduce spending to the lower allowed spending levels. Specifically, the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee would decline 8 percent below what our forecast would otherwise be in 2015–16, and then 12 percent below for 2016–17.\nHypothetical Moderate Recession Would Produce Operating Deficits. In 2013–14 and 2014–15, Figure 3 starts with the same $2.4 billion “carry–in balance” from 2013–14 and the same $3.2 billion operating surplus for 2014–15 as under our standard forecast. Aside from the factors mentioned above, we assume the same set of current laws and policies as under our standard forecast. As such, we assume that no additional ongoing commitments are made in either 2013–14 or 2014–15 and that the entire $5.6 billion is effectively held in reserve. Under this scenario, the state would face a roughly $900 million operating deficit in 2015–16, which would then grow to about $2.4 billion in 2016–17.\nA $5.6 Billion Reserve Could Absorb Deficits Under Hypothetical Scenario. As we mentioned earlier, this is merely a sketch of one hypothetical recession. The severity of an actual recession during our forecast period could be stronger or weaker. Nevertheless, absent additional ongoing commitments, the $5.6 billion reserve that we project for the state budget by the end of 2014–15 could more than absorb the combined $3.3 billion in operating deficits over the two–year period of this hypothetical recession. On the other hand, if the entire $5.6 billion were committed to ongoing spending prior to 2015–16, under this scenario the operating deficits would grow by a similar amount (to perhaps $6.5 billion in 2015–16 and $8 billion in 2016–17), requiring the Legislature and the Governor to address large budget shortfalls. This illustration demonstrates the importance of building a sizable reserve in preparation for the next economic downturn. Caution, therefore, is appropriate in weighing new spending both within Proposition 98—as total funding for schools and community colleges would decline under this scenario—and on the non–Proposition 98 side of the budget. Absent a prudent reserve, the Legislature could well face during the next economic downturn some of the same difficult decisions that it was required to make during the past decade.\nThe state’s budgetary condition is stronger than at any time in the past decade. The state’s structural deficit—in which ongoing spending commitments were greater than projected revenues—is no more. Furthermore, assuming continued economic growth, the Legislature and the Governor will have choices for how to allocate multibillion dollar surpluses. Our forecast indicates that there is room in the budget for new ongoing spending commitments. (In fact, Proposition 98 will require major additional spending for schools.) But as discussed earlier, committing too much too soon could create budget shortfalls in the event of an economic downturn. Further, the state has commitments that were made in the past—principally retirement liabilities and, to a lesser extent, budgetary liabilities—that have yet to be funded. And the state in recent years has not provided many of our existing programs with inflation adjustments. As inflation increases—as may occur in the next few years—it will be harder to ignore its limiting effects on purchasing power for state programs. Figure 4 displays one rough approach for using potential surpluses that prepares for the next economic downturn while paying for past commitments, maintaining existing programs, and making new commitments.\nFigure 4\nAn Approach to Using Possible Surpluses\nGeneral Fund and Education Protection Account Combined (In Billions)\n|\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n2016–17\n|\n2017–18a\n|\n2018–19a\n|\n2019–20a\n|\n|\nLAO Operating Surpluses\n|\n$2.4b\n|\n$3.2\n|\n$5.6\n|\n$8.3\n|\n$9.6\n|\n$9.6\n|\n$9.8\n|\n|\nPrepare for Next Downturn\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBuild $8 billion reserve by 2016–17\n|\n2.4\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nPay off remainder of “wall of debt”c\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n1.2\n|\n2.3\n|\n3.1\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nPay for Past Commitments\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPay down unfunded retirement liabilities (CalSTRS, retiree health, and UC pensions)\n|\n—\n|\n0.5\n|\n1.0\n|\n1.5\n|\n2.0\n|\n2.5\n|\n3.0\n|\n|\nMaintain Existing Programs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nInflation increases for various state programsd\n|\n—\n|\n0.4\n|\n0.6\n|\n1.2\n|\n1.8\n|\n2.5\n|\n3.2\n|\n|\nCreate New Commitments\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nProgram expansions, tax reductions, and infrastructure\n|\n—\n|\n0.5\n|\n1.0\n|\n1.5\n|\n2.0\n|\n2.5\n|\n3.0\n|\nPreparing for the Next Economic Downturn. In our view, this is the most important category in Figure 4 during the early years of our forecast. Building a strong reserve and repaying some of our budgetary liabilities would enhance the state’s fiscal condition in preparation for the next economic downturn. In Figure 4, we suggest the state aim for an $8 billion reserve in the state’s Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties by 2016–17. (We chose a target of $8 billion based on the size of the reserve envisioned by Proposition 58 [2004].) We suggest that the Legislature begin building this reserve by maintaining the entire $2.4 billion carry–in reserve from 2013–14 that we forecast. Given that we are nearly halfway through 2013–14, the strategy for other categories in Figure 4 would begin with the 2014–15 fiscal year. As discussed in Chapter 3, if the Legislature used all of the additional funds that would be provided to Proposition 98 in our forecast for 2012–13 and 2013–14, along with half of the growth in 2014–15, the state could retire at least three–quarters of the Proposition 98 obligations in the Governor’s wall of debt. In 2015–16, we show how the state could begin to pay down the non–Proposition 98 items in the wall of debt not already assumed to be repaid under our forecast, including settle–up payments to schools and community colleges. This approach satisfies the dual goals of (1) building a strong reserve and (2) eliminating the budgetary liabilities before the temporary taxes authorized by Proposition 30 expire at the end of 2018.\nPaying for Past Commitments. While our recent fiscal forecasts have indicated a sharp turnaround in the state’s budgetary condition, we have continued to highlight various retirement obligations that remain unaddressed. Most notably, these include the $71 billion unfunded liability for pension benefits already earned by the state’s teachers and administrators. The University of California’s (UC’s) pension plan also must continue addressing a significant funding issue, and state and California State University (CSU) retiree health benefits are not being funded as employees earn those benefits. The approach outlined in Figure 4 would commit an additional $500 million each year to address these liabilities, which would result in $3 billion of total new annual funding for these liabilities by 2019–20. Even if the state provides this added annual funding, additional payments from other units of government and public employees—or other policy changes—would be required to address these unfunded retirement obligations over the next three decades or so.\nMaintaining Existing Programs. State laws adopted in 2009 ended automatic inflation adjustments for many state programs. (Some programs are either exempt from this requirement or must provide adjustments by federal rules.) If a program’s budget is held constant over a given period, public services are in a sense reduced by inflation for that period. This is because as the price of goods and services increase over time, a fixed dollar amount is able to purchase less goods and services. Over the past few years, this has been a minor problem because inflation rates have been very low. Over the next few years, however, inflation may return closer to historical norms. When this occurs, there will be more spending pressures on state–funded programs. Figure 4 shows the cost of providing inflation adjustments to programs that do not already receive such adjustments in our forecast. These programs include UC, CSU, State Supplementary Payment (SSP) grants, and the judicial branch. (Amounts listed in Figure 4 for 2014–15 and 2015–16 are net of costs in recently negotiated pay increases for state employees.)\nCreating New Commitments. The Legislature has implemented billions of dollars in cuts over the past decade. Clearly, there is pent up demand for restoring some of those cuts, as well as creating new commitments. It is appropriate for the Legislature to begin debating how to prioritize the use of possible surpluses for new commitments beginning in 2014–15. We estimate that the 2014–15 Proposition 98 minimum guarantee will increase $6.4 billion compared with the 2013–14 spending level. Outside of Proposition 98, gradual spending increases would avoid overcommitting state resources, thereby reducing the possibility of future budget imbalances in the event of an economic downturn. As a rough example, the approach in Figure 4 provides $500 million in new commitments each year above totals already assumed in our forecast for program restorations/expansions, tax reductions, and infrastructure spending (including any future bond authorizations, such as a water bond). By 2019–20, this would result in $3 billion for such new commitments.\nOvercommitting Now Could Bring Back Budget Shortfalls. The state’s elected leaders have made very difficult choices in recent years that were necessary to eliminate the state’s structural budget deficit. These choices included reductions in ongoing spending commitments, as well as the temporary taxes authorized by the voters in Proposition 30. The state’s actions, combined with modest economic growth over the past few years, have put the state budget on the verge of a possible multibillion dollar surplus. Continuing to improve the state’s fiscal health will require a balanced strategy of building reserves, retiring budgetary liabilities, and paying for past commitments. Such a strategy would also allow our current programs to keep up with inflation and provide an opportunity to make new program commitments. If, however, too many ongoing spending commitments are made too soon, and a prudent reserve is not built up in the next few years, the state budget could be unprepared for the next economic downturn. In that case the state’s elected leaders could be faced with many of the same difficult choices that they were forced to make over the past decade.\nFigure 1 summarizes our current forecast assumptions for the U.S. and California economies between now and 2020. Our forecast assumes continuation of the current economic recovery, but at a somewhat faster pace than recent years. The recovery is projected to be driven by the following key factors:\n- The recovery of housing markets (discussed later in this section).\n- Little or no additional fiscal contraction by the federal government over the next few years and a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (also discussed in this section).\n- Improving job markets, accompanied by a decline in national and state unemployment rates.\nFigure 1\nLAO Economic Forecast Summary\n|\nUnited States\n|\n2013\n|\n2014\n|\n2015\n|\n2016\n|\n2017\n|\n2018\n|\n2019\n|\n2020\n|\n|\nPercent change in:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nReal gross domestic product\n|\n1.5%\n|\n2.5%\n|\n3.2%\n|\n3.2%\n|\n3.1%\n|\n2.9%\n|\n2.8%\n|\n2.5%\n|\n|\nPersonal income\n|\n2.8\n|\n4.7\n|\n4.9\n|\n5.2\n|\n5.4\n|\n5.1\n|\n4.8\n|\n4.5\n|\n|\nWage and salary employment\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.7\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.2\n|\n0.9\n|\n0.7\n|\n|\nConsumer price index\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.7\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n2.0\n|\n|\nUnemployment rate\n|\n7.5%\n|\n7.1%\n|\n6.5%\n|\n6.0%\n|\n5.7%\n|\n5.4%\n|\n5.1%\n|\n5.0%\n|\n|\nHousing starts (thousands)\n|\n914\n|\n1,152\n|\n1,481\n|\n1,611\n|\n1,605\n|\n1,613\n|\n1,634\n|\n1,615\n|\n|\nPercent change from prior year\n|\n16.7%\n|\n26.1%\n|\n28.5%\n|\n8.8%\n|\n–0.4%\n|\n0.5%\n|\n1.3%\n|\n–1.2%\n|\n|\nS&P 500 average monthly levela\n|\n1,637\n|\n1,780\n|\n1,850\n|\n1,930\n|\n1,992\n|\n2,055\n|\n2,128\n|\n2,203\n|\n|\nAverage target federal funds rate\n|\n0.1%\n|\n0.2%\n|\n0.4%\n|\n2.2%\n|\n3.8%\n|\n4.0%\n|\n4.0%\n|\n4.0%\n|\n|\nCalifornia\n|\n2013\n|\n2014\n|\n2015\n|\n2016\n|\n2017\n|\n2018\n|\n2019\n|\n2020\n|\n|\nPercent change in:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPersonal income\n|\n2.1%\n|\n5.4%\n|\n5.5%\n|\n5.5%\n|\n5.6%\n|\n5.4%\n|\n5.4%\n|\n5.2%\n|\n|\nWage and salary employment\n|\n1.7\n|\n2.2\n|\n2.0\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.2\n|\n1.4\n|\n1.3\n|\n|\nConsumer price index\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.7\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n2.0\n|\n|\nUnemployment rate\n|\n8.9%\n|\n7.8%\n|\n7.1%\n|\n6.5%\n|\n6.0%\n|\n5.7%\n|\n5.3%\n|\n4.9%\n|\n|\nHousing permits (thousands)\n|\n88\n|\n120\n|\n136\n|\n149\n|\n155\n|\n158\n|\n160\n|\n161\n|\n|\nPercent change from prior year\n|\n50.4%\n|\n36.1%\n|\n13.9%\n|\n9.6%\n|\n3.7%\n|\n1.8%\n|\n1.3%\n|\n0.9%\n|\n|\nSingle–unit permits (thousands)\n|\n40\n|\n61\n|\n68\n|\n76\n|\n78\n|\n79\n|\n78\n|\n78\n|\n|\nMulti–unit permits (thousands)\n|\n48\n|\n59\n|\n68\n|\n74\n|\n77\n|\n79\n|\n82\n|\n84\n|\n|\nPopulation growth rate\n|\n0.8%\n|\n0.9%\n|\n0.9%\n|\n0.8%\n|\n0.7%\n|\n0.7%\n|\n0.7%\n|\n0.7%\n|\nComparisons With Recent Economic Forecasts. Figure 2 compares some key forecast assumptions for the U.S. and California in 2013 and 2014 with those of some other recent forecasts by our office, the state’s Department of Finance, and the UCLA Anderson Forecast, a research effort of the UCLA Anderson School of Management. All of these forecasts assumed the same three factors—described above—helped fuel this recovery. In general, however, we now forecast somewhat weaker economic growth for the nation and California in 2013 and 2014, as compared to our last forecast in May. Federal fiscal and tax policies—and, to a minor extent, the uncertainty resulting from last month’s shutdown and debt ceiling debate—seem to be slowing economic growth somewhat in 2013. (Significant methodological changes affecting the calculation of personal income and various other national and state economic data—especially changes to state personal income calculations implemented by federal data agencies in late September 2013—make it difficult to compare our current personal income forecast to prior forecasts.)\nFigure 2\nComparing LAO November Forecast With Other Recent Forecasts\n|\n|\n2013\n|\n|\n2014\n|\n|\nLAO May 2013\n|\nDOF May 2013\n|\nUCLA Sept. 2013\n|\nLAO Nov. 2013\n|\nLAO May 2013\n|\nDOF May 2013\n|\nUCLA Sept. 2013\n|\nLAO Nov. 2013\n|\n|\nUnited States\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPercent change in:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nReal gross domestic product\n|\n2.0%\n|\n2.0%\n|\n1.5%\n|\n1.5%\n|\n|\n2.8%\n|\n2.8%\n|\n2.8%\n|\n2.5%\n|\n|\nPersonal income\n|\n2.8\n|\n2.8\n|\n2.6\n|\n2.8\n|\n|\n5.1\n|\n5.1\n|\n5.1\n|\n4.7\n|\n|\nWage and salary employment\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.6\n|\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.7\n|\n|\nConsumer price index\n|\n1.4\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.5\n|\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.7\n|\n1.6\n|\n|\nCalifornia\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPercent change in:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPersonal incomea\n|\n3.3%\n|\n2.2%\n|\n3.8%\n|\n2.1%\n|\n|\n5.9%\n|\n5.7%\n|\n5.7%\n|\n5.4%\n|\n|\nWage and salary employment\n|\n2.0\n|\n2.1\n|\n1.7\n|\n1.7\n|\n|\n2.5\n|\n2.4\n|\n1.9\n|\n2.2\n|\n|\nUnemployment rate\n|\n9.3%\n|\n9.4%\n|\n8.9%\n|\n8.9%\n|\n|\n8.3%\n|\n8.6%\n|\n7.9%\n|\n7.8 %\n|\n|\nHousing permits (thousands)\n|\n91\n|\n82\n|\n79\n|\n88\n|\n|\n123\n|\n121\n|\n104\n|\n120\n|\nWhile several key economic variables are weaker than assumed in our most recent forecast, stock prices were considerably stronger through early November 2013 than our office assumed earlier this year. This has important implications for the state’s personal income taxes, which we discuss later in this report.\nThe Possibility of a Future Recession. A recession occurs when there is a significant decline in economic activity that spreads across the economy and lasts at least a few months. Our economic forecast currently does not assume that a recession occurs between now and 2020, but of course, one is possible. Consistent with other mainstream economic forecasters, we generally assume in our forecast the continuation of the current economic expansion cycle in line with projected long–term trends. In other words, like most economic forecasters, we do not presume that we can predict the timing of future recessions or significant economic downturns.\nThe current, slow national economic expansion began in June 2009. Since the Civil War, the longest U.S. economic expansion lasted ten years (from March 1991 to March 2001). Since World War II, the average U.S. economic expansion has lasted just under five years. The severity of the most recent recession—the longest and deepest since World War II—may give rise to a longer than average economic expansion that lasts well into the late 2010s or early 2020s. In other words, with growth currently so slow and so many unemployed, it may be a while before the economy “overheats” again and then contracts. On the other hand, recessions could be triggered by various causes that are difficult to predict (such as a terrorist attack or international conflict), and therefore, a recession could occur at any time. In Chapter 1, for example, we discussed how one future, hypothetical recession scenario might affect state finances.\nThe federal government is the nation’s largest employer and purchaser of health care services. It levies considerably more taxes than either state or local governments. Federal regulations also affect most parts of the economy. The U.S. government’s fiscal, policy, and monetary decisions, therefore, affect virtually every element of our economic forecast. This section discusses the effects of the October 2013 federal government shutdown and debt ceiling debates, how currently restrained federal fiscal policy affects our forecast, and our forecast assumptions concerning monetary policy.\nAssumed Slowdown in Growth in Late 2013. Two key events—the partial shutdown of federal government operations in October 2013 and uncertainty about whether federal leaders would increase the government’s maximum authorized debt levels (the “debt ceiling”)—are believed to have slowed U.S. economic growth during the current quarter (October through December 2013). Our office’s economic forecast—largely developed in the first half of October during the shutdown—assumes that 2013 annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points lower than it otherwise might be due to the various negative effects of the shutdown and debt ceiling debate. (Other actions of the federal government earlier this year—discussed later in this section—resulted in an additional drag on 2013 growth.)\nThe main effects of the shutdown and debt ceiling on economic growth may have been the loss of some economic activity and hiring by federal contractors during the current quarter, as well as increased consumer and business uncertainty. Because the shutdown has affected federal economic data gathering (and is resulting in one–time changes to certain economic statistics for the month of October), it will take some time before the effects of the federal debates can be known with a higher degree of confidence.\nShutdown and Debt Ceiling Deadlines Not Assumed to Affect Economy in 2014. Enactment of a continuing appropriations act on October 17 ensured that the federal government avoided defaulting on debt or its other spending commitments until at least a few weeks after the next formal debt ceiling deadline: February 7, 2014. As occurred this year, the U.S. Treasury will be able to use “extraordinary measures” in other federal accounts to avoid default until a few weeks after the February 7 deadline—likely until some point in March, a period during which the Treasury typically sends out large amounts of individual income tax refunds. The act also funds the federal government until January 15 at current spending levels—reduced earlier this year under the U.S. government’s sequestration process for automatic spending reductions. Accordingly, after January 15, another partial government shutdown is possible.\nWhile these federal deadlines create the possibility of additional economic disruptions in early 2014, our forecast assumes little or no economic slowdown next year related specifically to those deadlines. Financial markets and many other participants in the economy seem desensitized to the recurring budget debates in Washington, and with the last shutdown, federal leaders acted on a bipartisan basis to repay federal workers who were prohibited from working during the period. (If such repayments occurred after any future shutdowns, the economic impact would be minimized.) Our forecast assumption—for little or no economic effect next year due to these federal debates—will more likely prove to be correct if federal leaders either come to agreement quickly on 2014 budget matters or pass yet another continuing appropriations bill and debt ceiling expansion in advance of the current deadlines. If our assumption proves incorrect and the 2014 deadlines result in additional drags on economic growth, various economic metrics—GDP, personal income, employment, stock prices, and other assumptions—could be negatively affected, and California’s fiscal situation could be weakened to an unknown extent.\nForecast Could Be Affected by Major Tax, Budget, and Other Policy Choices. Our forecast also could be affected to the extent that federal leaders come to agreement soon on some of the major policy issues they have been discussing, including changes to the nation’s tax code, alterations to future health and Social Security benefits, modifications to the 2010 health care law known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), and changes to immigration policies. These types of changes could affect various aspects of the economy in significant ways—either positively or negatively.\nSpending on health care makes up 18 percent of U.S. GDP. Implementation of the ACA will affect many decisions by businesses and employers, state and local governments, insurance companies, and health care providers. Both our state spending and economic forecasts contain various assumptions about health care costs in future years. It is likely that the significant changes resulting from the new law will result in economic changes that differ from those assumed in mainstream forecasting models, such as those in our forecast. This will affect both the U.S. and California economic forecasts in the future—either positively or negatively.\nThe U.S. government runs annual budget deficits in most years. It issues sovereign debt—U.S. Treasuries—to the investing public and to certain government accounts (such as the Social Security trust fund) to fund those deficits. The annual budget deficits and total federal debt each are expressed as a percentage of GDP in any given year. Currently, the annual budget deficit of the federal government totals about 4 percent of GDP, and total federal debt held by the public totals 73 percent of GDP.\nShrinking Recently, Deficits Expected to Grow in the Future. In recent months, as a result of various federal tax and spending actions, the end of spending for recession stimulus programs, and the recovery of the economy, the federal government’s annual budget deficits have shrunk considerably—from 10 percent of GDP in 2009 to roughly 4 percent of GDP now. Health care inflation also has been slowing, contributing to lower annual deficits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that deficits would decline further under current federal policies to 2 percent of GDP by 2015. Deficits are forecast to gradually rise again thereafter due to projected increases in interest rates (which increases interest costs on the national debt), spending pressures resulting from the nation’s rapidly aging population, and continued inflation in health care costs. According to the CBO, these gradual increases in deficits could take total federal debt held by the public to near–record levels—around 100 percent of GDP—by the late 2030s. As its sovereign debt levels rise, the U.S. economy and federal budgets could become more vulnerable to economic shocks. For example, the federal government could be less able to run deficits, as it did in recent years, to aid state and local government finances during recessions.\nFederal Fiscal Policy Has Slowed the Recent Economic Recovery. In the past few years, federal fiscal and policy decisions have slowed the rate of U.S. economic growth. In September, Moody’s Analytics, an economic advisory firm, estimated that the drag on the economy from (1) recent sequestration and other federal spending cuts, (2) increases in payroll taxes, (3) increases in taxes on high–income earners, and (4) other fiscal actions that went into effect this year is reducing 2013 real GDP growth by about 1.5 percentage points. This federal fiscal policy drag is greater than in any other year since the defense drawdown that followed World War II, according to that firm. Other estimates vary. If, however, one assumes that the Moody’s analysis is correct, this would mean that, if federal fiscal policy were economically neutral (producing no fiscal drag), our forecast might be for real GDP growth in 2013 of about 3 percent—roughly double the level of economic expansion we are currently projecting.\nForecast Assumes No Additional Major Federal Fiscal Restraints. With the federal sequestration policy scheduled to ramp up in the coming months, it appears that the economic drag from federal fiscal restraint is approacing its peak, assuming no further substantial increases in taxes or decreases in spending in the near term. Our forecast assumes that federal policymakers act in the coming months to relax the currently scheduled sequestration cuts a bit—for example, by reducing scheduled defense cuts. For federal fiscal year 2014, the forecast assumes a federal budget slightly higher than the $967 billion for annually appropriated domestic and defense programs that was approved by the House of Representatives. Federal spending is forecast to grow in future years at less than the rate of nominal GDP growth. Our economic forecast also assumes the gradual elimination of extended unemployment insurance benefits over several years, rather than having them disappear entirely in 2014.\nBudget Adjustments Will Affect Future Economic Growth. There is general consensus that the federal government will have to implement fiscal and/or tax policy changes to reduce its debt levels in future decades. There are, however, substantial disagreements over when and how such changes should be implemented and on the size of such adjustments. As CBO has noted, federal leaders face trade–offs in deciding how quickly to implement policies to moderate the future growth of federal debt. For example, to reduce projected federal debt in the late 2030s to about 70 percent of GDP, the combination of increased revenues and decreased spending would have to equal about 1.9 percent of GDP per year if implemented beginning in 2025, rather than 0.9 percent of GDP per year if implemented beginning in 2014. (Those simulations omit the effects that deficits and debt would have on economic growth and interest rates. Incorporating such effects would make the impact of delaying policy changes even larger, CBO says.) To the extent that these policy changes affect the overall economy, economic growth for California and the nation may slow in the future, relative to past trends.\nAccommodative Monetary Policy Still in Place. In September 2013, the Federal Reserve surprised many financial market participants by opting to keep in place its current monetary policy for the time being. That policy involves both short–term interest rates (specifically, the federal funds rate) of near zero and regular purchases by the Federal Reserve of both mortgage–backed and longer–term U.S. Treasury bonds. These purchases—known as “quantitative easing”—are intended to maintain downward pressure on long–term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and generally boost the slow economic recovery. At the same time, inflation remains very low, such that the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee has noted that “inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance.”\nForecast Assumes Gradual Tightening of Monetary Policy. As the economy expands, gradual tightening of federal monetary policy is likely. Our forecast assumes that “tapering”—the gradual elimination of the Federal Reserve’s bond purchase programs—starts in late 2013 or early 2014. Further, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep its near–zero federal funds rate target until late 2015, when the U.S. unemployment rate is assumed to decline to about 6.5 percent. In the later years of our forecast, the federal funds rate is assumed to rise again to around 4 percent in 2017. (The federal funds rate was last above 4 percent in January 2008.)\nBy most measures, the recent collapse of California’s housing market was more widespread and severe than downturns in other parts of the country. From the peak of the market in 2006 and 2007 to the low point during the housing crisis, a key measure of home values suggests that they fell about 50 percent. The median home sales price—a common measure that is influenced by which homeowners choose to sell—plummeted from a peak of $600,000 to $245,000. Over roughly the same period, California shed nearly 1.4 million jobs, a contraction of 9 percent. For many, the interaction of these two declines represented an unprecedented shock to household net worth and monthly finances. Households have slowly repaired their balance sheets since then while home prices, especially since early 2012, have made up substantial lost ground. In this section, we discuss housing’s role in the California economy, recent trends, and our forecast of housing activity.\nThe housing market affects the economy in three major ways: household net worth, migration trends, and construction activity. First, rising home prices improve homeowners’ financial standing, often leading them to increase spending. On average, each dollar increase in home values leads to a three–cent increase in spending. By contrast, each dollar decline in home value leads to a 10–cent reduction in other spending. Through this channel, home prices affect consumption of goods and services, which has ripple effects throughout the economy. Home prices also affect migration trends—that is, where people decide to live and work. For example, a localized increase in house prices beyond what occurs in the rest of the country makes residing in California comparatively more expensive, resulting in a negative effect on population growth. The final way housing prices affect the economy is more indirect. Rising prices encourage new construction. An increase in construction jobs typically spurs job growth in other sectors that are dependent on local demand such as retail and restaurants.\nAlthough construction activity and employment are crucial to the state’s near–term prospects, construction itself cannot sustain a local economy over the long–term. This is because economic growth, including demand for new housing, relies on increased overall income in an area. This, in turn, can be spurred by such sectors as manufacturing and technology, which sell products in national and international markets, thereby capturing outside income.\nCalifornia’s housing sector improved broadly during 2012 and the first half of 2013. One year ago, we noted that a sustainable housing recovery appeared imminent. After losing ground throughout 2011, California single–family home prices have climbed 25 percent. Though initially led by the state’s coastal areas, home price appreciation is now widespread, with year–to–date increases that exceed 8 percent in each of the state’s 28 metropolitan regions. These gains indicate healthy housing demand, but also help to mend household balance sheets as price appreciation boosts homeowner equity. Equity improvements reduce the number of “underwater” homeowners, whose outstanding mortgage balances exceed the value of their homes and should, albeit slowly, increase the inventory of homes up for sale (a critical transition if the housing market is to normalize). Though strong price increases come as comforting news for many homeowners, we view the pace of the recent gains as having more to do with short–term supply constraints than with underlying growth in the state’s economy.\nWhy Have Home Prices Grown So Quickly? In the short–term, job growth and wage gains boost demand for single–family housing, putting upward pressure on prices. Higher prices tend to compel more owners to put their homes on the market. The supply of additional homes absorbs existing demand, causing price increases to slow or stop altogether. In step with an improving economy, the demand for housing increased in early 2012, yet the supply of homes did not respond accordingly. Instead, short–term factors limited the number of available homes, driving prices up 25 percent since January 2012. These factors include:\n- Cash Investors. Nationwide, 6 million owner–occupied single–family homes converted to rental units over the course of the housing crisis. In most of these cases, investors purchased distressed homes in cash and converted them to rentals, sometimes purchasing hundreds of homes at one time. In Los Angeles, cash purchases as a portion of all home sales increased from 5 percent in 2005 to 34 percent in May 2013, the largest increase in the country. Other areas of California have similarly high all–cash sales rates. Investor demand pushed prices upward—a helpful boost for many distressed areas of the state—but also contributed to reductions in the inventory of owner–occupied homes for sale, which, as shown in Figure 3, has contracted significantly since January 2012.\n- Strategic Sellers. The supply of homes for sale depends primarily on the eagerness of current homeowners to sell. Short supplies indicate a general unwillingness or an inability to sell. Unwilling owners may wait to list their homes so as to benefit from expected upward price trends, especially as price gains are accelerating. A national survey of homeowners from earlier this year found that only 25 percent of owners felt it was a good time to sell (whereas two–thirds agreed it was a good time to buy), a sign that potential sellers are waiting. On the other end, more than 15 percent of California homeowners remain underwater on their homes. This means some would–be sellers are unable to do so, keeping a sizable share of the state’s housing stock off the market.\n- Cautious Homebuilders. Responding to rising home prices, construction activity has begun to improve. Authorized single–family permits, the first step in constructing a new home, increased from less than 15,000 in the first seven months of 2012 to more than 21,000 in the first seven months of 2013. Though large in percentage terms, this gain represents a historically small response relative to the price increases seen over the same period. (For comparison, the first seven months of 2002 saw 72,000 single–family permits.) In our view, it appears that single–family homebuilders, and, perhaps, their lenders, have remained cautious, wary that increased supply in the short term could dampen prices, threatening the profitability of newly constructed homes. Restricted credit, as well as land–use and development constraints in some areas, also may be holding back some new construction. Until homebuilding quickens, home demand will not be tempered much by new home construction.\nLatest Data Suggest Home Prices Are Decelerating to More Normal Trends. Recent price gains appear to be decelerating. Rising mortgage rates and expanding inventories have likely contributed to this deceleration. Interest rates on a 30–year fixed rate mortgage have climbed 1 percentage point since May, equating to a 15 percent increase in the monthly payment on a $200,000 loan. In turn, increased mortgage costs have cooled housing demand. In August and September, home inventories expanded for the first time in a year. These data inform our home price forecast for 2014, which is described below.\nWe view the pace of recent price gains as unsustainable, and accordingly expect housing inventories to expand as more homeowners feel it is a good time to sell, as cash investor purchases decline, and new housing construction begins to ratchet up, each of which should absorb existing demand and therefore slow price increases. In particular, we expect home price growth to decelerate significantly, to 7 percent in 2014. We project that construction activity, responding to recent price and rent increases, will post strong gains in 2014 (as shown in Figure 4). In 2014, we forecast residential housing permits to increase by 31,000 units to 120,000 permits total. Permits are projected to increase to 136,000 units in 2015 before stabilizing around 160,000 units annually by the end of our forecast period. Compared to past years, multi–family unit permits are projected to make up a larger portion of newly constructed housing stock. Our residential permits forecast has been lowered notably since our prior forecast, released in May 2013, due primarily to our lower expectation for new single–family home construction. We caution, given the sizable shifts taking place in today’s housing market, that actual price gains and construction activity in the coming years could vary widely—either above or below—our office’s forecast over the next few years.\nFigure 5 summarizes our November 2013 multiyear General Fund revenue forecast.\nFigure 5\nLAO November 2013 Revenue Forecast\nGeneral Fund and Education Protection Account Combined (In Billions)\n|\n|\n2012–13\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n2016–17\n|\n2017–18\n|\n2018–19\n|\n2019–20\n|\n|\nPersonal income tax\n|\n$65.0\n|\n$66.0\n|\n$71.4\n|\n$75.9\n|\n$79.6\n|\n$83.2\n|\n$82.9\n|\n$84.1\n|\n|\nSales and use tax\n|\n20.5\n|\n22.8\n|\n23.6\n|\n24.9\n|\n25.4\n|\n25.8\n|\n27.0\n|\n28.2\n|\n|\nCorporation tax\n|\n7.7\n|\n8.3\n|\n8.9\n|\n9.5\n|\n10.1\n|\n10.6\n|\n11.2\n|\n11.8\n|\n|\nSubtotals, “Big Three” taxes\n|\n($93.2)\n|\n($97.1)\n|\n($103.8)\n|\n($110.3)\n|\n($115.1)\n|\n($119.6)\n|\n($121.1)\n|\n($124.1)\n|\n|\nInsurance tax\n|\n$2.2\n|\n$2.2\n|\n$2.3\n|\n$2.4\n|\n$2.5\n|\n$2.6\n|\n$2.7\n|\n$2.8\n|\n|\nOther revenues\n|\n2.7\n|\n2.3\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.9\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.8\n|\n|\nNet transfers and loans\n|\n1.7\n|\n0.3\n|\n–0.4\n|\n–0.8\n|\n–0.4\n|\n0.2\n|\n0.3\n|\n0.3\n|\n|\nTotals, Revenues and Transfers\n|\n$99.8\n|\n$101.8\n|\n$107.6\n|\n$113.8\n|\n$119.0\n|\n$124.2\n|\n$125.8\n|\n$128.9\n|\nIn June 2013, the Legislature approved the 2013–14 Budget Act.

In developing the 2013–14 budget, the Legislature considered both our office’s May 2013 revenue forecast, as well as the May 2013 revenue forecast of the administration. Compared to the administration’s forecast, our office’s May 2013 forecast projected $3.2 billion more in General Fund revenues and transfers across the three fiscal years (2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013–14), due principally to our higher assumptions for capital gains–related personal income taxes in 2013 and 2014. The Legislature and the Governor agreed to base the 2013–14 budget plan on the administration’s May 2013 revenue forecast. Figure 6 compares our November 2013 revenue forecasts by fiscal year with those assumed in the 2013–14 budget.\nFigure 6\nComparing LAO November 2013 Revenue Forecast With 2013–14 Budget Act Forecast\n(General Fund and Education Protection Account Combined, in Millions)\n|\n|\n2012–13\n|\n|\n2013–14\n|\n|\n2013–14 Budget Act Forecast\n|\nLAO Nov. 2013 Forecast\n|\nDifference\n|\n|\n2013–14 Budget Act Forecast\n|\nLAO Nov. 2013 Forecast\n|\nDifference\n|\n|\nPersonal income tax\n|\n$63,901\n|\n$65,030\n|\n$1,129\n|\n|\n$60,827\n|\n$66,002\n|\n$5,175\n|\n|\nSales and use tax\n|\n20,240\n|\n20,482\n|\n242\n|\n|\n22,983\n|\n22,809\n|\n–174\n|\n|\nCorporation tax\n|\n7,509\n|\n7,669\n|\n160\n|\n|\n8,508\n|\n8,278\n|\n–230\n|\n|\nSubtotals, “Big Three” taxes\n|\n($91,650)\n|\n($93,181)\n|\n($1,531)\n|\n|\n($92,318)\n|\n($97,089)\n|\n($4,771)\n|\n|\nInsurance tax\n|\n$2,156\n|\n$2,249\n|\n$93\n|\n|\n$2,200\n|\n$2,163\n|\n–$37\n|\n|\nOther revenues\n|\n2,641\n|\n2,664\n|\n23\n|\n|\n2,249\n|\n2,254\n|\n6\n|\n|\nNet transfers and loans\n|\n1,748\n|\n1,748\n|\n—\n|\n|\n331\n|\n342\n|\n10\n|\n|\nTotals, Revenues and Transfers\n|\n$98,195\n|\n$99,841\n|\n$1,646\n|\n|\n$97,098\n|\n$101,847\n|\n$4,749\n|\nHigher Revenues Now Projected, Compared to 2013–14 Budget Assumptions. Our office’s projections for General Fund revenues in 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013–14 combined have increased since May by over $3 billion. As shown in Figure 6, we now project that General Fund revenues and transfers for 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013–14 combined will be $6.4 billion higher than the amounts assumed in the 2013–14 state budget plan. For 2012–13, state collections exceeded forecasts. For 2013–14, most of the increase in our forecast since May results from higher assumptions concerning capital gains and some other categories of taxable income attributable largely to higher–income personal income tax (PIT) filers. Our increased capital gains assumptions result primarily from stronger stock market and real estate market performance since May.\nPIT Collections Running Stronger Than 2013–14 Budget Act Forecast. In 2012–13, revenue collections were stronger than projected by either our office or the administration in May 2013. Through the end of October, 2013–14 PIT estimated payments—tied in large part to capital gains and business income—have exceeded the administration’s monthly projections by 34 percent. Several key PIT payment dates remain during the fiscal year, but to date, the available information suggests that PIT revenues are running considerably stronger than was assumed in the budget act.\nUncertainty remains, however, given that 2012 income tax collections were elevated for a variety of reasons, as discussed below, and preliminary tax agency data on what was reported on 2012 PIT returns will not begin to be made available until a few weeks from now. (Final tax agency data related to 2012 returns will not be available until several months from now.) Moreover, the performance of the stock market has been much stronger than our office assumed in May, and stock performance in the coming few weeks will affect 2013 capital gains to some extent. Uncertainty also results from the state’s complicated revenue accrual methodologies, which move some PIT and other revenues from one fiscal year to a prior one for budgetary accounting purposes.\nLegislative Action Needed to Oversee Complex Accrual Process\nPrior–Year Revenue Estimates Now Change for at Least Two Years Thereafter. As the 2014–15 budget process begins, we think it is important to emphasize that, under the new “net final payment” accrual process authorized in recent annual budgets for Proposition 30 revenues, personal income tax revenues essentially are still changing for 2011–12. As we understand the accrual process, 2011–12 revenue estimates should keep changing until at least May 2014, given that estimates of 2012 capital gains—a key driver of Proposition 30 revenues for that year—will change until at least that point in time, as tax agencies review and “sample” for statistical purposes more and more 2012 tax returns. Total 2012–13 revenues will change until May 2015, and so on. Even as legislators make budget decisions and weigh various uncertainties about 2013–14 and 2014–15 revenue and spending, they may know less than ever before about the previous two fiscal years’ budget results and the state budget reserves remaining therefrom. We acknowledge that our revenue estimates may be too high or too low by hundreds of millions of dollars per year—or, in some scenarios, over $1 billion per year—due simply to the challenges we face in making projections concerning this complex part of the budget process.\nRevenue Calculations Will Affect Future Budgeting. If the administration follows its past practice, it will not display in its 2014 budget publications up–to–date estimates of 2011–12 revenues based on these accrual changes. Based on past practice, 2011–12 revenues would have been “closed” in 2013. Any changes to prior–year revenues—often minor under past accrual policies—would be listed, along with many expenditure reconciliations, as changes to the incoming General Fund balance. If the administration sticks to this past practice, the Legislature will lack complete, transparent access to information that would be important to budgeting—especially information that will help them decide whether Proposition 98 obligations have been appropriately estimated.\nWe recommend that the Legislature require the administration to display publicly for budgetary decision–making purposes the adjusted prior–year revenue amounts included in its adjustments to the incoming General Fund balance. Such prior–year revenue changes should be incorporated in all historical documents related to state revenues—otherwise, the reliability of that historical data could decline significantly. Finally, we recommend that the Legislature require the administration—at least once a year on its website—to describe in plain English each of the calculations used to move revenue from one fiscal year to a prior year via the accrual process.\n2012–13 PIT Collections Were Elevated . . . PIT collections grew substantially in 2012–13 due to voters’ approval of Proposition 30, large one–time withholding payments related to the initial public offering (IPO) of stock by Facebook, Inc., and one–time accelerations of various types of income in 2012 by high–income taxpayers—especially accelerated realizations of capital gains. (Such accelerations of income allowed some taxpayers to avoid higher federal tax rates that went into effect for some in 2013.) For tax year 2012, by our office’s estimation, capital gains seem to have produced slightly over $10 billion of revenue for the state—around 15 percent of the current annual PIT base. We now estimate that 2012–13 PIT revenues will end higher than the levels projected in both the LAO and administration May 2013 forecasts. Specifically, our current estimate of 2012–13 PIT revenues—$65 billion—is $1.1 billion above the 2013–14 Budget Act assumption, which was based on the administration’s May 2013 forecast.\n. . . Which Means PIT Growth to Be Much Slower in 2013–14 . . . In our May 2013 Forecast, we projected that PIT collections would fall by 0.2 percent in 2013–14—an unusual assumption since PIT revenues typically fall only in recession years. Because so much income was accelerated from 2013 to 2012 to avoid higher federal taxes, we assumed that net capital gains realizations by California residents would fall by 30 percent in 2013, affecting both estimated payments in late 2013 and January 2014. Since May, however, the performance of the stock market has exceeded our prior assumptions. While we continue to assume a large drop in net capital gains realized by California taxpayers in 2013, our capital gains assumption for that year is now a few percentage points higher than it was in May. Moreover, our 2014 capital gains assumption—which also affects 2013–14 PIT collections—has risen by over 10 percent, given the recent growth in stock prices. Our new forecast also assumes stronger growth for PIT withholding—revenue collections that result mainly from Californians’ wage income. This assumption seems more consistent with recently strong year–over–year PIT withholding growth (after adjusting for the one–time withholding payments resulting from the Facebook IPO in October 2012). After accounting for accruals, we now forecast that 2013–14 PIT revenues will rise by 1.5 percent to $66 billion. This is $5.2 billion above the amount assumed in the budget approved in June.\n. . . And PIT Should Bounce Back in 2014–15. The acceleration of large amounts of revenue from 2013 to 2012 artificially depresses growth in PIT revenues in 2013–14. Accordingly, both our office’s forecast and the administration’s forecast have projected that the growth rate for PIT revenues will bounce upward in 2014–15. In this forecast, we project that PIT revenues grow by 8 percent to $71 billion in 2014–15.\n2015–16 and Beyond. Our forecast assumes roughly 5 percent average annual growth in PIT revenues between 2015–16 and 2017–18. This rate of annual growth is consistent with what we would expect in a mature economic expansion—such as that assumed in our multiyear economic forecast through 2020—accompanied by some growth in stock and house prices. We then project much slower growth in 2018–19 and 2019–20 due primarily to the expiration of Proposition 30’s higher PIT rates for high–income taxpayers at the end of 2018. This means that the PIT revenue loss from Proposition 30’s expiration will not occur all at once, but instead will be spread over those two fiscal years. We now project that PIT revenues will fall by 0.4 percent in 2018–19 to under $83 billion before rising by 1.4 percent in 2019–20 to $84 billion.\nPIT Revenues Make Up Bigger Percentage of General Fund Than Ever Before. Prior to the first fiscal year affected by Proposition 30, the PIT’s share of total General Fund revenues and transfers had exceeded 60 percent only once—at the end of the “dot–com” bubble in 2000–01. We are now projecting that PIT revenues will comprise two–thirds of total General Fund revenues in 2014–15—the highest such percentage recorded to date in California history. Proposition 30—with its temporary marginal tax rate increases for high–income households—has increased PIT revenues recently. The percentage of the budget paid for from PIT revenues also has risen recently due to other tax policy changes. Specifically, the shift of a portion of the state’s sales and use tax (SUT) from the General Fund to local realignment accounts and a few other changes have reduced the percentage of the General Fund paid from other revenue sources, thereby increasing the share of the General Fund paid by the PIT. Finally, the amount of taxable income received by the top 20 percent of taxpayers has, in real terms, grown much faster than the amounts for middle–income and lower–income taxpayers in recent decades. As these higher–income taxpayers pay the highest marginal tax rates, the increasing concentration of income in that group tends to generate significant growth in PIT revenues over time.\nOur forecast projects that PIT will maintain that two–thirds share of annual General Fund revenues. (As our forecast assumes a fairly modest level of capital gains—compared to the size of the economy—in future years, this amount could be higher in particularly strong capital gains years, and it could be weaker when capital gains are very low.) We note, however, that the proportion of the General Fund supported by PIT revenues likely would be growing even if Proposition 30 were not in effect due to more income concentration among the highest–income taxpayers and the other factors described earlier.\nHigher Stock Market Driving Higher PIT Projections in the Near Term. The change from year to year in the state’s net capital gains has proven over time to be closely correlated with changes in stock and house prices, as well as stock trading volume. Recently, both stock and house prices have been growing rapidly. Our office’s May 2013 forecast assumed that the S&P 500 index remained close to its May 14, 2013 level of 1650 through the rest of 2013. As of October 25, when we finalized our economic assumptions for this forecast, it closed at 1760 (7 percent above our prior assumptions). This is the key reason for the higher capital gains in our forecast in the near term and a major reason for our higher forecast of 2013–14 PIT revenues.\nStock Market Valuations Near Historical Norms. In general, key stock market valuation metrics—such as the price–to–earnings (PE) ratio for the S&P 500—are in line with historical norms. Some such metrics are somewhat above norms, and some are below. We note, however, that PE ratios are considerably below the levels experienced during the dot–com bubble, when Californians’ net capital gains realizations peaked as a percentage of personal income in the state at 10.6 percent. Our forecast assumes that net capital gains total 5.9 percent of personal income in 2012, 4.3 percent in 2013 (lower due to the income accelerations described earlier), and 6 percent in 2014. This incorporates an assumption that stock prices remain stable—at or near their October 25 level—through March 2014. Thereafter, we assume that stock prices grow slower than the overall growth of the U.S. economy, which results in net capital gains falling to 4.4 percent of personal income by the end of our forecast period in 2020. This forecasting assumption is intended, in the context of the economic expansion we assume through 2020, to keep stock prices near historical norms throughout the period.\nVolatile Stock Prices Certainly Cannot Be Predicted With Precision. Because PIT is the state’s largest revenue source, and a significant, volatile portion of that tax is generated from capital gains on the sales of stocks and other assets, every forecast of California’s public finances must reflect an assumption—either explicit or implicit—about the direction of the stock market. Our forecasting methodology attempts to use the most realistic assumptions possible about stock performance in the near term and, to the extent that these assets seem overpriced relative to historical norms, to bring them closer to those norms over time. Currently, there is not clear evidence that stocks are overpriced significantly compared to those norms. Accordingly, we assume stable stock prices in the near term and modest growth thereafter.\nNevertheless, over any given forecast period—even the next few quarters—stock prices can be expected to differ from any set of assumptions. They may be lower in some periods, and they may be higher in others. This volatility—as well as fundamental changes in stock prices that occur during bull and bear markets—may cause actual capital gains to differ significantly from any forecast. In the near term, for example, annual PIT revenues can be $2 billion higher or lower than forecast based on differing capital gains results alone. (Other forecasting differences could produce additional changes in revenues.) State leaders should consider all of this information when making budgetary commitments and determining the level of financial reserves for the state to have at any given time.\nEstimated General Fund SUT revenue totaled $20.5 billion in 2012–13, about $240 million higher than the amount assumed in the 2013–14 budget. In 2013–14, we expect SUT receipts to increase by 11 percent to $22.8 billion (about $170 million below the 2013–14 budget assumption). The projected growth in 2013–14 reflects (1) the full–year effect of Proposition 30’s temporary one–quarter cent SUT increase and (2) projected growth in underlying taxable sales of 6.9 percent. In 2014–15, we forecast SUT revenue to increase by 3.3 percent to $23.6 billion. This lower revenue growth is largely due to the new tax credit for manufacturing equipment established by Chapter 69, Statutes of 2013 (AB 93, Committee on Budget), which begins in 2014–15. (Underlying revenue growth—that is, without the impacts of the credit—is 5.4 percent, in line with projected growth in taxable sales.) Projected SUT revenues then increase by 5.6 percent in 2015–16 before growing more slowly over the following two years as the one–quarter cent Proposition 30 SUT increase expires at the end of 2016. Revenue growth stabilizes towards the end of our forecast, closely tracking projected growth in taxable sales.\nHousing Permits Play a Major Role in the Sales Tax Forecast. The main determinant of SUT receipts is taxable sales. For a variety of reasons, taxable sales and housing permits tend to move together, making housing permits a useful economic indicator for forecasting taxable sales. House construction generates some taxable sales directly (through purchases of construction materials and other goods), but it also acts as a proxy for consumer confidence, which is difficult to measure directly. As a result, housing permits can account for year–to–year variation in taxable sales that cannot be explained by variation in personal income or nationwide retail sales. For taxable sales and housing permits, we project significant growth from 2012–13 to 2013–14 and slower growth thereafter. Specifically, we expect taxable sales to grow about 7 percent in 2013–14 before falling to below 5 percent later in the forecast period. Similarly, we expect housing permits to grow by 36 percent from 2013 to 2014, with slower growth in later years.\n2011 Realignment and Other Local Sales Taxes. Roughly half of California’s sales tax revenue is distributed to counties, cities, and special districts through various mechanisms, including the funding stream established to support the 2011 realignment plan. Some factors that affect the growth in state General Fund sales tax revenue—such as the Proposition 30 quarter–cent SUT rate increase and the new sales tax exemption for certain equipment purchases—do not affect local sales tax revenues. Instead, growth in taxable sales is the primary driver of changes in local sales tax revenue. As shown in Figure 7, we expect steady growth in 2011 Local Revenue Fund sales tax revenue despite the fluctuations in General Fund sales tax revenue. Specifically, we estimate that 2011 realignment sales tax revenues will grow by 7 percent in 2013–14 and by 5.4 percent in 2014–15. Annual growth in these revenues is expected to increase slightly to 5.5 percent in 2015–16 and then decelerate to 4.4 percent by the end of the forecast period.\nEstimated General Fund corporation tax (CT) revenue totaled $7.7 billion in 2012–13, $160 million above the 2013–14 Budget Act assumption. We forecast that CT revenue will increase to $8.3 billion in 2013–14, $230 million below the budget act assumption. Thereafter, our forecast projects that CT revenue will increase steadily, reaching $11.8 billion in 2019–20. This reflects an average annual growth rate of 6 percent.\nForecasting Complicated by Continued Uncertainty. As we have noted in prior years, the Legislature and voters (with passage of Proposition 39) have recently enacted major changes in business tax policy that have drastically changed the relationships between economic and tax data. In the near term, it is easy to imagine actual annual revenues for this tax being hundreds of millions of dollars higher or lower than our forecast in any given year. It may take several years before data is available to help us address these forecasting uncertainties.\nNationally, Corporate Profits Have Recovered . . . The vast majority of California CT revenue is paid by large multistate and multinational corporations that apportion (allocate) a share of their profits to California. Corporate profits, both nationally and in California, declined significantly during the 2007–2009 recession. National corporate profits, as estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, have recovered to their prerecession levels and then some. Further, our forecast assumes that U.S. profits will grow by 12 percent in 2014.\n. . . But California CT Revenues Remain Depressed. Taxable corporate profits apportioned to California have recovered somewhat but have not returned to their prerecession levels. Despite the strong growth trend in U.S. profits, California CT revenues have declined in several recent years. The precise reasons for this are likely varied and will take more time to assess. The weakness in California CT collections is partially the result of budget actions passed by the Legislature in recent years to collect revenues earlier and delay the use of certain tax credits and deductions. These measures had the net effect of moving revenue forward to 2008–09 and 2009–10 from future years. While the effects of some of these measures may have run their course, the state is only now beginning to feel the full impact of others, such as the suspension of net operating loss (NOL) deductions. In addition, in 2011 and 2012 corporations were permitted to choose their preferred method for allocating profits to California. We tentatively estimate that this reduced the CT base by about 13 percent in 2011 and 2012. Proposition 39 changed this policy by requiring most corporations to use the “single sales factor” method of apportioning multistate and multinational profits to taxation in California beginning in 2013. (The Franchise Tax Board is unlikely to be able to determine the impact of Proposition 39 with precision until the spring of 2015, when preliminary CT data for tax year 2013 becomes available.) If the net revenue change resulting from all of these apportionment changes is negative, this could help explain some of the recent weakness in CT collections.\nNOL Deductions Assumed to Increase Tenfold in 2012. The use of NOL deductions—in which corporations deduct a prior loss from current tax year profits—were suspended for most corporations for tax years 2008–2011. As a result, 2012 was the first year in which large corporations were able to use NOL deductions since the recession. We assume that increasing profits will be somewhat offset by widespread use of NOL deductions. Our forecast assumes that $30 billion in NOLs were deducted in tax year 2012, declining to around $21 billion per year by 2020. Should this level of NOL deductions not materialize, CT revenue could exceed our forecast. On the other hand, a higher level of NOL deductions could reduce CT revenue.\nUse of Tax Credits Projected to Increase. As profits continue to increase, businesses will be more able to use new or previously generated tax credits to reduce taxes owed. We assume that businesses will use a total of $3 billion in tax credits in 2013 and that this level steadily rises to a total of $3.5 billion in 2020. Increases of CT credit usage are slowed, compared to what they would be otherwise, by our assumptions related to the replacement of enterprise zones with different tax provisions. The research and development tax credit accounts for the majority of the credits used to offset CT liability. We assume that businesses will use about $2.3 billion in research and development tax credits in 2013 and that this will rise to $3.2 billion by 2020.\nLAO Forecast Assumes Current–Law Special Fund Repayments. In recent years, to help balance the General Fund budget, the Legislature approved billions of dollars of loans from several dozen of the state’s special funds—funds for specific programs that are often supported by dedicated fee revenues related to the programs themselves. As of the end of 2012–13, $4.6 billion of these loans remained outstanding. Payments to retire the principal amounts of these loans are booked as transfers out of the General Fund, so that when the state repays significant amounts of such loans, the net transfers and loans displayed in Figure 5 tend to be a negative amount. Some special fund loans have specific repayment dates in prior budget acts, and, consistent with case law, it is state practice to repay funds in cases when they have an imminent fiscal need for such repayment. Based on these criteria, our forecast assumes $696 million of special fund loan repayments in 2013–14, $630 million in 2014–15, $1 billion in 2015–16, $660 million in 2016–17, and $100 million in 2017–18. Thus, in our forecast showing future state surpluses, we assume—consistent with these criteria—that $1.5 billion of special fund loans remain outstanding as of the end of the 2019–20 fiscal year.\nThe Governor’s wall of debt proposal anticipates a faster retirement of special fund loans than indicated in our forecast. His proposal would make special fund loan repayments the focus of the Legislature’s discretionary, non–Proposition 98 wall of debt payments over the next few years. Specifically, the Governor would dedicate about $1 billion more of General Fund resources to special fund repayments through 2016–17—principally in 2015–16. If the Legislature were to adopt the Governor’s proposal, therefore, this would reduce the operating surpluses displayed in some years of our forecast, especially in 2015–16. (The approach we discuss in Chapter 1 for using possible General Fund surpluses would repay all special fund loans—and other parts of the wall of debt—within a few years.)\nIn this chapter, we discuss our estimates of spending for 2012–13 and 2013–14, as well as our spending projections for 2014–15 through 2019–20. Figure 1 displays our expenditure forecast for the General Fund and the Education Protection Account (EPA) created by Proposition 30 (2012).\nFigure 1\nProjected General Fund and Education Protection Account Spending\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\nEstimates\n|\n|\nForecast\n|\nAverage Annual Growtha\n|\n|\n2012–13\n|\n2013–14\n|\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n2016–17\n|\n2017–18\n|\n2018–19\n|\n2019–20\n|\n|\nEducation programs\n|\n|\nProposition 98\n|\n$42,212\n|\n$42,123\n|\n|\n$45,409\n|\n$47,414\n|\n$47,448\n|\n$48,747\n|\n$48,627\n|\n$49,103\n|\n2.6%\n|\n|\nQEIA payment\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\n410\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nChild Care\n|\n751\n|\n742\n|\n|\n756\n|\n778\n|\n804\n|\n844\n|\n885\n|\n925\n|\n3.7\n|\n|\nCSU\n|\n1,991\n|\n2,242\n|\n|\n2,242\n|\n2,242\n|\n2,242\n|\n2,242\n|\n2,242\n|\n2,242\n|\n0.0\n|\n|\nUCb\n|\n2,166\n|\n2,844\n|\n|\n2,844\n|\n2,844\n|\n2,844\n|\n2,844\n|\n2,844\n|\n2,844\n|\n0.0\n|\n|\nCSAC\n|\n708\n|\n1,039\n|\n|\n1,162\n|\n1,206\n|\n1,370\n|\n1,448\n|\n1,453\n|\n1,459\n|\n5.8\n|\n|\nHealth and Social Services\n|\n|\nMedi–Cal\n|\n14,929\n|\n16,255\n|\n|\n16,509\n|\n17,127\n|\n18,757\n|\n20,050\n|\n21,336\n|\n23,048\n|\n6.0\n|\n|\nCalWORKsc\n|\n1,521\n|\n1,195\n|\n|\n716\n|\n651\n|\n602\n|\n565\n|\n536\n|\n509\n|\n–13.2\n|\n|\nSSI/SSP\n|\n2,753\n|\n2,787\n|\n|\n2,825\n|\n2,865\n|\n2,906\n|\n2,948\n|\n2,991\n|\n3,036\n|\n1.4\n|\n|\nIHSS\n|\n1,772\n|\n1,842\n|\n|\n1,893\n|\n1,996\n|\n2,070\n|\n2,139\n|\n2,209\n|\n2,280\n|\n3.6\n|\n|\nDDS\n|\n2,648\n|\n2,789\n|\n|\n2,951\n|\n3,088\n|\n3,230\n|\n3,336\n|\n3,446\n|\n3,560\n|\n4.2\n|\n|\nDSH\n|\n1,278\n|\n1,408\n|\n|\n1,445\n|\n1,451\n|\n1,458\n|\n1,465\n|\n1,471\n|\n1,471\n|\n0.7\n|\n|\nOtherd\n|\n1,458\n|\n1,465\n|\n|\n1,520\n|\n1,554\n|\n1,578\n|\n1,590\n|\n1,602\n|\n1,615\n|\n1.6\n|\n|\nCDCR\n|\n8,347\n|\n8,746\n|\n|\n8,702\n|\n8,808\n|\n8,819\n|\n8,864\n|\n8,912\n|\n8,960\n|\n0.4\n|\n|\nJudiciary\n|\n750\n|\n1,184\n|\n|\n1,199\n|\n1,191\n|\n1,182\n|\n1,174\n|\n1,165\n|\n1,154\n|\n–0.4\n|\n|\nInfrastructuree\n|\n4,677\n|\n5,156\n|\n|\n5,790\n|\n6,299\n|\n6,399\n|\n6,952\n|\n6,899\n|\n7,056\n|\n5.4\n|\n|\nOther programs\n|\n9,391\n|\n7,823\n|\n|\n8,062\n|\n8,709\n|\n8,989\n|\n9,327\n|\n9,584\n|\n9,821\n|\n3.9\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$97,352\n|\n$99,639\n|\n|\n$104,436\n|\n$108,224\n|\n$110,698\n|\n$114,535\n|\n$116,205\n|\n$119,085\n|\n3.0%\n|\n|\nPercent change\n|\n—\n|\n2.3%\n|\n|\n4.8%\n|\n3.6%\n|\n2.3%\n|\n3.5%\n|\n1.5%\n|\n2.5%\n|\n—\n|\nHigher Revenue Forecast Increases Proposition 98 Spending. As discussed in Chapter 2, our forecast of General Fund revenues for 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013–14 combined is about $6.4 billion higher than the 2013–14 budget assumptions. As described below, this results in about $4.8 billion in higher General Fund Proposition 98 spending in 2012–13 and 2013–14 combined. In total, our spending estimates for 2012–13 and 2013–14 combined are $5 billion higher than the 2013–14 budget assumptions, 2.6 percent above the combined enacted total for those years.\nSpending Projected to Slow Considerably Near End of Forecast. We project spending to grow at an average annual rate of 3 percent from 2013–14 through 2019–20. Spending is projected to slow considerably in the outer years of the forecast. This is principally due to healthy growth in local property taxes and the end of the “triple flip,” both of which reduce General Fund spending necessary to meet the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Across the rest of the budget, we project that Medi–Cal spending will grow at an average annual rate of 6 percent from 2013–14 through 2019–20. Growth in Cal Grants spending (5.8 percent annually) is almost entirely due to implementation of a new scholarship program beginning in 2014–15. As discussed later in this chapter, spending on California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) is projected to decline at a yearly rate of 13.2 percent during the forecast period due largely to a decision in the 2013–14 budget to offset a significant portion of General Fund program costs with certain realignment funds. General Fund spending on Proposition 98—the single largest state program—is projected to grow at only 2.6 percent a year over the period. Total Proposition 98 spending, however, grows at the more rapid annual pace of 4.1 percent, as property tax revenues are assumed to grow at healthy rates over the period.\nOverview of Education Forecasts. Below, we discuss three education–related expenditure projections. Our Proposition 98 forecast projects spending for preschool, elementary, and secondary education (commonly referred to as K–12 education), and the California Community Colleges. Our higher education forecast projects spending for the California State University (CSU), the University of California (UC), Hastings College of the Law, and state financial aid programs. Our child care forecast projects spending on subsidized care for CalWORKs families and other low–income working families.\nProposition 98 “Minimum Guarantee” for Schools and Community Colleges. State budgeting for schools and community colleges is governed largely by Proposition 98, passed by voters in 1988. The measure, modified by Proposition 111 in 1990, establishes a minimum funding requirement, commonly referred to as the minimum guarantee. Both state General Fund (including EPA) and local property tax revenue apply toward meeting the minimum guarantee. In addition to Proposition 98 funding, schools and community colleges receive funding from the federal government, other state sources (such as the lottery), and various local sources (such as parcel taxes).\nCalculating the Minimum Funding Guarantee. The Proposition 98 minimum guarantee is determined by one of three tests set forth in the State Constitution. These tests are based on several inputs, including changes in K–12 average daily attendance, per capita personal income, and per capita General Fund revenue. Though the calculation of the minimum guarantee is formula–driven, a supermajority of the Legislature can vote to suspend the formulas and provide less funding than the formulas require. This happened in 2004–05 and 2010–11. In some cases, including suspensions, the state creates a future obligation referred to as a “maintenance factor.” The state is required to make maintenance factor payments when year–to–year growth in state General Fund revenues is relatively strong, such that increases in education funding are accelerated. The state can always provide more than the minimum guarantee in any given year.\nMinimum Guarantee $1.7 Billion Higher in 2012–13. Figure 2 compares our updated estimates of the minimum guarantee in 2012–13 with what was assumed for that year at the time the 2013–14 spending plan was enacted. As the figure shows, we estimate the minimum guarantee has increased $1.7 billion. The increase results from our estimate that 2012–13 General Fund revenues are $1.6 billion higher than assumed in the spending plan. The higher state revenues result in more than a dollar–for–dollar increase in the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee because of the way the state has decided to make maintenance factor payments when Test 1 is operative. In total the state will be making a $5.4 billion maintenance factor payment in 2012–13 (leaving $5.6 billion in outstanding maintenance factor).\nFigure 2\nIncreases in 2012–13 and 2013–14 Minimum Guarantees\n(In Millions)\n|\n|\n2012–13\n|\n|\n2013–14\n|\n|\n2013–14 Budget Plan\n|\nNovember LAO Forecast\n|\nChange\n|\n2013–14 Budget Plan\n|\nNovember LAO Forecast\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nMinimum Guarantee\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGeneral Fund\n|\n$40,454\n|\n$42,212\n|\n$1,758\n|\n|\n$39,055\n|\n$42,123\n|\n$3,068\n|\n|\nLocal property tax\n|\n16,011\n|\n15,994\n|\n–17\n|\n|\n16,226\n|\n15,833\n|\n–393\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$56,465\n|\n$58,206\n|\n$1,741\n|\n$55,281\n|\n$57,956\n|\n$2,675\n|\nMinimum Guarantee $2.7 Billion Higher in 2013–14. Also shown in Figure 2, we project the 2013–14 minimum guarantee to be $58 billion—$2.7 billion higher than the 2013–14 Budget Act estimate. The higher minimum guarantee is primarily due to our projected increase in the year–to–year growth of General Fund revenues. Although the minimum guarantee increases by $2.7 billion, General Fund Proposition 98 spending increases by $3.1 billion as a result of our local property tax forecast being $393 million lower than the budget act estimate. We forecast redevelopment agency (RDA) property tax revenues will be $332 million lower, while other local property tax revenues will be $61 million below budget act estimates. In 2013–14, we estimate that $941 million in maintenance factor will be created (bringing the state’s outstanding maintenance factor up to $6.8 billion). The 2013–14 budget plan assumed $2.6 billion in maintenance factor was created, but the amount has decreased due to the stronger projected growth in General Fund revenues.\nAdditional 2012–13 and 2013–14 Funding Can Be Used to Pay Down Outstanding Obligations. We estimate that the minimum guarantees for 2012–13 and 2013–14 will be up a combined $4.4 billion. Given the 2012–13 school year has been completed and the 2013–14 school year is underway, the additional funding in practical terms is available for one–time purposes, including paying down the state’s still sizeable outstanding school and community college obligations. Of the $11.5 billion in outstanding Proposition 98 obligations, the state has $6.2 billion in outstanding deferrals, $4.8 billion in unpaid mandate claims, and $462 million owed for the Emergency Repair Program (ERP). Using the additional 2012–13 and 2013–14 funds for these purposes would reduce the state’s outstanding obligations by almost 40 percent.\nPaying Down Different Types of Obligations Has Different Distributional Effects. Paying down deferrals would provide some benefit to most districts (about 850 of 958 school districts and 68 of 72 community college districts), but districts that rely most heavily on state funding would receive the greatest benefit. These districts tend to be ones that have low property values or are located in counties that historically have distributed a greater share of property tax revenues to cities, counties, and special districts. By having state payments provided to them on schedule, these districts’ cash flow situations would improve and they would have less need to borrow either internally or externally.\nPaying down the mandate backlog also would benefit virtually all school and community college districts but would have different distributional effects. This is because some districts file more claims and claim much higher costs (in per–pupil terms) than other districts. In addition, school districts serving high school students would benefit greatly from the state’s pay–off of the high school graduation requirements mandate. All school districts would be eligible to benefit notably from the pay–off of the Behavioral Intervention Plan mandate. In all these cases, as school and community college districts already paid the costs associated with the original mandated activities, they benefit from additional general purpose funds that they could use for any high–priority, one–time purpose. For example, school districts could use the funding to help further implement the Common Core State Standards or address deferred maintenance.\nPaying down the ERP obligation would affect only those schools in the bottom three deciles of the state’s academic accountability index that filed repair requests with the Office of Public School Construction several years ago. (Schools no longer can submit applications, as previously approved projects exceed the amount owed for the program.) Given these schools likely already undertook the emergency repairs, they would be able to use new ERP funding for any current high–priority, one–time purpose (including other maintenance needs).\n2014–15 Guarantee $4.2 Billion Higher Than Updated 2013–14 Guarantee. Our forecast projects a minimum guarantee of $62.2 billion in 2014–15. This is a $4.2 billion increase from our projected 2013–14 minimum guarantee. The increase in the guarantee is driven primarily by the year–to–year growth in General Fund revenues. We project that Test 1 will be operative in 2014–15 and a large maintenance factor payment will be required ($3.6 billion). This large maintenance factor payment is a result of a projected decline in per capita personal income (–0.8 percent) coupled with a large projected increase in per capita General Fund revenues (6.4 percent). (The maintenance factor payment is driven primarily by the difference between these two factors, with the payment increasing as growth in General Fund revenues outpaces growth in personal income.) This situation is very similar to what the state faced in 2012–13, with the minimum guarantee and the required maintenance factor payment very sensitive to changes in General Fund revenues.\n2014–15 Guarantee Almost $8 Billion Higher Than Current Ongoing Programmatic Spending Level. As Figure 3 shows, of the $55.3 billion in Proposition 98 funding the state provided in the 2013–14 spending plan, it designated almost $900 million for one–time purposes, leaving $54.4 billion for ongoing purposes. Hence our estimate of the 2014–15 minimum guarantee is almost $8 billion (14 percent) higher than the current ongoing Proposition 98 spending level.\nFigure 3\nConsiderable New Proposition 98 Funding Projected for 2014–15\n(In Millions)\n|\n2013–14 Budget Act Spending Level\n|\n$55,281\n|\n|\nBack out one–time actions:\n|\n|\n|\nDeferral pay downs\n|\n–272\n|\n|\nCommon Core implementation\n|\n–250\n|\n|\nCareer Pathways program\n|\n–250\n|\n|\nGovernor vetoes\n|\n–35\n|\n|\nCCC building maintenance\n|\n–30\n|\n|\nCCC adult education planning grants\n|\n–25\n|\n|\nCCC technology initiative adjustment\n|\n–7\n|\n|\nTotal One–Time Actions\n|\n–$869\n|\n|\n2013–14 Ongoing Spending\n|\n$54,412\n|\n|\nNew Funds Available in 2014–15\n|\n$7,748\n|\n|\n2014–15 Minimum Guarantee\n|\n$62,160\n|\nBalancing One–Time and Ongoing Spending Key to 2014–15 Budget Planning. Given such a large projected year–to–year funding increase, we recommend the Legislature use the additional funds for a combination of one–time and ongoing purposes. The state, for example, could provide roughly half (about $4 billion) for one–time purposes (including further paying down existing one–time obligations) and roughly half for ongoing purposes. Under this approach, K–12 per–pupil programmatic funding still would increase about $600 (7 percent) year over year. Balancing one–time and ongoing spending in 2014–15 can help districts plan for and accommodate programmatic growth. It also can minimize the adverse effect on schools and community colleges if General Fund revenues do not materialize as expected (due either to an economic slowdown or typical volatility in revenues from capital gains). This is of particular concern in 2014–15 given the guarantee would be extremely susceptible to swings in revenues (as described above). If revenues fall short in 2014–15, one–time funding could be rescinded with minimal or no effect on ongoing school and community college programs. If revenues fall short in 2015–16, ongoing programs also would experience little or no reduction, as the prior–year one–time funding commitments would impose no ongoing cost pressure. That is, the state’s decision to moderate ongoing programmatic commitments in 2014–15 would make having to cut those programs less likely the following year in the event General Fund revenues came in weaker than projected.\nSlower Growth When Proposition 30 Revenues Expire. Figure 4 displays our estimates of the minimum guarantee throughout the forecast period. As the figure shows, we project annual increases in the minimum guarantee of about $3 billion from 2015–16 through 2017–18. In 2018–19 and 2019–20, we project more modest annual growth in the minimum guarantee as the PIT revenues enacted by Proposition 30 phase out over 2018–19 and 2019–20.\nFigure 4\nProposition 98 Forecast\n(Dollars in Billions)\n|\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n2016–17\n|\n2017–18\n|\n2018–19\n|\n2019–20\n|\n|\nMinimum Guarantee\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGeneral Fund\n|\n$45.4\n|\n$47.4\n|\n$47.4\n|\n$48.7\n|\n$48.6\n|\n$49.1\n|\n|\nLocal property tax\n|\n16.8\n|\n17.9\n|\n20.6\n|\n21.9\n|\n23.1\n|\n24.6\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$62.2\n|\n$65.3\n|\n$68.1\n|\n$70.7\n|\n$71.7\n|\n$73.7\n|\n|\nYear–to–Year Change in Guarantee\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAmount\n|\n$4.2\n|\n$3.2\n|\n$2.8\n|\n$2.6\n|\n$1.1\n|\n$1.9\n|\n|\nPercent change\n|\n7.3%\n|\n5.1%\n|\n4.2%\n|\n3.8%\n|\n1.5%\n|\n2.7%\n|\n|\nProposition 98 Obligations\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMaintenance factor created/paid (+/–)\n|\n–$3.6\n|\n–$0.2\n|\n—\n|\n$0.6\n|\n$2.1\n|\n$1.3\n|\n|\nOutstanding maintenance factor\n|\n3.2\n|\n3.1\n|\n$3.2\n|\n3.9\n|\n6.2\n|\n7.8\n|\n|\nKey Factors\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nProposition 98 “Test”\n|\n1\n|\n2\n|\n3\n|\n3\n|\n3\n|\n3\n|\n|\nK–12 average daily attendance\n|\n–0.1%\n|\n–0.2%\n|\n–0.3%\n|\n–0.4%\n|\n–0.3%\n|\n–0.3%\n|\n|\nPer capita personal income (Test 2)\n|\n–0.8\n|\n4.9\n|\n4.6\n|\n5.0\n|\n4.8\n|\n4.8\n|\n|\nPer capita General Fund (Test 3)\n|\n6.4\n|\n5.8\n|\n4.1\n|\n3.7\n|\n1.1\n|\n2.3\n|\n|\nK–14 cost–of–living adjustment\n|\n0.9\n|\n2.2\n|\n2.3\n|\n2.6\n|\n2.6\n|\n2.5\n|\nSchool Property Taxes Grow Quickly Over Forecast Period. Over the next several years, we project underlying local property taxes to grow, on average, about 7 percent each year. Though above levels seen in recent years, our estimates are in line with average historical growth. In addition to growth from underlying local property taxes, a couple of specific factors will result in additional school property tax growth in the coming years. First, we project that school and community college property tax revenues will increase by $1.6 billion, beginning in 2016–17, after the state’s Economic Recovery Bonds—approved by voters in 2004 to help close the state budget gap—are repaid. (Under the so–called triple flip, the state effectively diverted local sales taxes to pay off the bonds and reimbursed cities and counties with school and community college property taxes. The state then automatically backfilled the lost property tax revenues to schools and community colleges with additional Proposition 98 General Fund revenues. With the end of the triple flip, these local property tax revenues will return to schools and colleges.) Second, we project that residual RDA property tax revenues—the amounts left over after RDAs pay their various obligations—increase from $763 million in 2013–14 to $1.9 billion in 2019–20. The growth in residual RDA revenues is somewhat offset by the steady decrease in revenues from RDA assets. We forecast schools and community colleges will receive $402 million in RDA asset revenues in 2013–14, with decreases annually through 2017–18 and no RDA asset revenues projected thereafter.\nIncreases in Guarantee Largely Covered by Local Property Tax Growth. Over the last four years of the forecast period, we project the minimum guarantee increases by $5.6 billion, yet the General Fund contribution to Proposition 98 increases only $1.7 billion. This is because local property tax revenues received by schools and community colleges apply towards meeting the minimum guarantee, such that increases in this revenue stream typically reduce the state’s Proposition 98 General Fund contribution. Given the strong projected growth in property tax revenues described above, the state’s General Fund Proposition 98 requirement bears little of the growth in the guarantee over this period. Absent this growth in property tax revenues, the state’s General Fund costs would be notably higher over the forecast period and would result in significantly lower budgetary surpluses.\nState Could Make Progress but Likely Not Fully Implement LCFF by End of Forecast Period. The administration estimated the state could afford to fully implement the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) for county offices of education (COEs) by 2014–15 and the LCFF for school districts by 2020–21. Under our forecast, the state would meet its time frame for COEs but likely would be unable to meet the time frame for school districts, even given the projected increases in the minimum guarantee. The appropriation provided in the 2013–14 budget was sufficient to fund roughly 70 percent of the total cost of LCFF for school districts. By 2019–20, we forecast the state could fund roughly 90 percent of the full LCFF cost, suggesting the state would need a few more years than originally planned to fully implement the LCFF for school districts. (Our estimate assumes the state funds at the minimum guarantee, no new categorical programs are created under the forecast period, and existing categorical programs receive only growth and cost–of–living adjustments [COLA]. We also assume community colleges continue to receive roughly 11 percent of all Proposition 98 funds.)\nIn addition to community colleges (which are part of the Proposition 98 forecast), the state’s higher education system includes CSU, UC, and California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). The CSU educates about 430,000 undergraduate and master’s students at 23 campuses. The UC is a comprehensive research university educating about 240,000 undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students at ten campuses. Both universities receive support for their core instructional programs primarily from a combination of state funds and student tuition revenue. The CSAC is responsible for administering state financial aid programs—most notably, the Cal Grant program—with support from the state General Fund, federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds, and the Student Loan Operating Fund (SLOF).\nForecast Sensitive to Underlying Assumptions. Unlike many other areas of the state budget that are constrained by constitutional or federal requirements, the Legislature has significant discretion over university and financial aid expenditures. At the same time, the universities have greater control over their total operating budget than most state agencies because they have the ability to raise additional revenue by increasing student tuition. These factors mean that expenditures on the universities and financial aid are very sensitive to future legislative actions and the systems’ future decisions on tuition levels.\nAssumes No COLA or Enrollment Changes for Universities. Our forecast assumes the state does not provide COLAs for the universities, consistent with state law regarding no automatic COLAs for most state programs. In addition, we assume no enrollment changes at either CSU or UC. Changes in enrollment at CSU and UC typically are driven by changes in the college–age population and the universities’ eligibility policies. Our demographic projections show declines in the traditional college–age population in each year of the forecast period, with the number of 18–24 year olds 7 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2014. Regarding the universities’ eligibility targets, the state’s Master Plan for Higher Education calls for CSU and UC to draw from the top 33 percent and 12.5 percent of high school graduates in the state, respectively. Though the state no longer conducts eligibility studies, recent research from the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) suggests that both universities are drawing from beyond their Master Plan eligibility pools. Both CSU and UC, however, report unmet enrollment demand. CSU reports more than 20,000 eligible students annually being denied admission in recent years, while UC reports an increase in the number of eligible students being denied admission to their preferred campus. The apparent conflict between the PPIC study and university admissions reports may result from different ways of measuring the eligible pool of students. Though a more refined study examining CSU and UC’s current eligibility, admission, and enrollment trends would offer the Legislature better guidance in making enrollment decisions, the totality of available data suggest CSU and UC enrollment pressures will be low over the forecast period.\nAssumes No Participation or Award Changes for Cal Grants. Our forecast also assumes no changes in Cal Grant participation rates. Cal Grant participation historically has been driven primarily by the number of high school graduates in the state, though the number of students completing federal financial aid applications and the condition of the economy also can influence Cal Grant participation. The number of high school graduates is expected to decline somewhat over the forecast period. The number of aid applications, which has grown significantly in recent years, also appears to be leveling off. Though we assume flat Cal Grant participation over the period, significant improvement in the economy—especially in employment—could somewhat reduce future demand for financial aid. Our forecast also assumes no changes in Cal Grant award amounts. Cal Grant award amounts would increase automatically only if tuition at UC and CSU increased during the forecast period.\nAssumes Continued General Fund Offsets. In recent years, the state has used two funding sources—TANF and SLOF—to offset some General Fund Cal Grant costs. Our forecast assumes the state continues to use $542 million in TANF funding annually throughout the forecast period for Cal Grants. We also assume the state continues to rely on SLOF contributions for the next two years. The SLOF, which is funded by proceeds from California’s federal student loan program, helped to support Cal Grant costs in some years prior to the loan program’s 2010 transfer to Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC)—a national loan servicing organization. As part of the transfer, ECMC agreed to continue sharing a portion of its proceeds for a few years. ECMC set a goal of $500 million in total contributions for Cal Grants, has paid $345 million since 2010, and has signaled its intention to make two additional contributions. Accordingly, our forecast includes $77 million SLOF support in each 2014–15 and 2015–16, followed by a General Fund backfill of this amount in 2016–17.\nState Spending on Universities Projected to Be Flat Over Entire Forecast Period. Specifically, we project that state spending for CSU and UC will be $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, each year from 2013–14 through 2019–20. (Consistent with current state policy, our forecast assumes that spending on debt service for state–supportable capital outlay projects at UC is paid from UC’s support budget, while CSU’s state–supportable debt–service costs are paid separately by the state and included in our statewide debt–service projections.)\nState Spending on Cal Grants Also Flat. Following steady increases that have more than doubled Cal Grant expenditures since 2007–08, we expect costs to remain relatively level at $1.7 billion over the forecast period. This forecast reflects our baseline assumptions regarding enrollment and tuition, as well as cost increases and savings resulting from prior–year policy actions. The California Dream Act of 2010—Chapter 604, Statutes of 2010 (AB 131, Cedillo)—makes some nonresident students eligible to receive state financial aid beginning in 2013–14. Dream Act costs will increase as current recipients renew their awards and additional cohorts of high school graduates and community college transfer students qualify for new awards. We anticipate these costs will level off at about $85 million beginning in 2016–17. These cost increases are largely offset by savings resulting from two policy changes enacted in recent years: (1) reductions in Cal Grant maximum award amounts at private colleges and universities and (2) the phase out of loan assumption programs for teachers and nurses.\nNew Scholarship Program Drives Budget Growth. The 2013–14 budget package created the Middle Class Scholarship Program, a new financial aid program for certain CSU and UC students. Under the new program, students with family incomes up to $150,000 will qualify for scholarships that cover up to 40 percent of their tuition (when combined with all other public financial aid). The program is to be phased in over four years, beginning in 2014–15. Budget legislation provides $107 million for the program in 2014–15, $152 million in 2015–16, and $228 million in 2016–17, with funding for the program capped at $305 million beginning in 2017–18.\nGovernor’s Multiyear Funding Plan for the Universities Would Increase Costs Significantly. Though our forecast shows no increases in state spending on the universities over the coming six years, the Governor already has indicated an interest in augmenting the universities’ budgets. As part of his 2013–14 budget plan, the Governor proposed providing CSU and UC with an unallocated base increase of 5 percent in 2013–14 ($125 million for each segment) and 5 percent in 2014–15 ($142 million for each)—followed by 4 percent increases in 2015–16 ($120 million each) and 2016–17 ($124 million each). (The proposed increases are the same for each university because the Governor bases them both on UC’s budget.) The final budget package included only the base increase for 2013–14 without any commitment by the state for out–year funding. Nevertheless, our understanding is that the administration intends to maintain the multiyear plan in 2014–15. If the Legislature were to adopt the Governor’s plan, state expenditures on both universities combined would increase by $284 million above 2013–14 levels in 2014–15, growing to $772 million annually by 2016–17.\nLegislature Could Take Alternative Approach and Consider Funding Universities’ Main Cost Drivers. During last year’s budget deliberations, we expressed various concerns with the Governor’s multiyear funding plan—such as the rationales for providing the specific base increases proposed for CSU and UC and for treating the two university systems identically. The Legislature could take a different, more traditional approach to building the universities’ budgets that focuses on major cost drivers, including deferred costs and inflationary pressures. One particularly notable deferred cost is UC’s unfunded liability in its pension plan. If the Legislature were to provide the full amount requested by UC to fund these liabilities, state costs for UC would increase by over $230 million annually.\nAddressing Inflationary Pressures on University Budgets. One main cost driver for the universities is inflation. In 2014–15, inflation is estimated at 2.2 percent. (Throughout the remainder of the forecast period, inflation is projected to hover around 2.5 percent.) In the past, we have recommended that inflationary cost increases be shared by the state and students (in the form of tuition increases). This provides an incentive for students to hold universities accountable for cost increases. Augmenting state funding for the universities by 2.2 percent in 2014–15 would cost a total of $111 million whereas increasing student tuition at the universities by 2.2 percent would generate a total of $96 million in additional tuition revenue. (Higher tuition would indirectly increase Cal Grant awards for CSU and UC students. Of the $96 million, $26 million would come in the form of larger Cal Grant awards.) The universities could use this COLA–related funding to cover a number of cost increases, such as those related to health care premiums, utilities, and faculty and staff salaries. In addition, UC could use its funding to cover increased debt–service costs.\nThe state subsidizes child care for some low–income, working families, including those families participating in the CalWORKs program. Generally, for CalWORKs families the state subsidizes child care over the course of several years, with Stage 1 care provided for families seeking employment, Stage 2 care provided for families that have gained stable employment and are transitioning off of cash assistance, and Stage 3 care provided for families who have been off of cash assistance for at least two years. Families may continue receiving Stage 3 subsidized care until their children turn 13 or their income exceeds the eligibility threshold (70 percent of the state median income). Low–income, working families not currently or previously participating in CalWORKs may access subsidized child care slots through the General Child Care, Alternative Payment, and Migrant Child Care programs. (Waiting lists for accessing non–CalWORKs child care are common.) The state also administers activities to support the child care system, including professional development for child care providers and referral services to help parents find child care.\nPotential 2013–14 Funding Shortfall Likely Can Be Covered by Unspent Prior–Year Funds. As shown in Figure 1, the 2013–14 Budget Act included $742 million in non–Proposition 98 General Fund for subsidized child care and related support services. (This amount excludes funding for the State Preschool and Stage 1 programs, which are contained within our Proposition 98 and CalWORKs forecasts, respectively.) Based on data from the first quarter of 2013–14, we project combined costs for the CalWORKs Stage 2 and Stage 3 programs will exceed the budget act appropriation by $22 million. These higher–than–anticipated costs appear due to a larger proportion of families opting for care in licensed child care centers rather than by license–exempt providers. (The subsidy for licensed care is higher, with license–exempt care capped at 60 percent of the subsidy for licensed providers.) Based on California Department of Education estimates, unspent prior–year funds likely are available to cover this shortfall should it materialize. (The Legislature would need to authorize this additional spending through legislation.)\n2014–15 Costs Projected to Be Slightly Lower Than Revised 2013–14 Costs. We project subsidized child care costs will be $756 million in 2014–15. This reflects a 2 percent increase over the 2013–14 Budget Act amount but a 1 percent decrease from our revised estimate of 2013–14 costs ($764 million). We project caseload in the Stage 2 program will decrease slightly in 2014–15 and Stage 3 caseload will remain virtually flat. (Our forecast assumes the Legislature provides sufficient funding for all eligible children in CalWORKs Stage 3.) We assume the average per–child cost of care for the Stage 2 and Stage 3 programs does not change from our revised 2013–14 estimates. For the non–CalWORKs child care programs, we assume costs decline by less than 1 percent in 2014–15. This reflects a small decline in the population of children under age five and no COLA through 2014–15, as specified in current law. (Our forecast assumes the state maintains the $10 million augmentation made to non–CalWORKs programs in 2013–14.)\nChild Care Costs to Steadily Rise Over the Forecast Period. We project annual cost increases for subsidized child care of 3 percent to 5 percent over the remainder of the forecast period. By 2019–20, we anticipate costs of $925 million, a 25 percent increase over the 2013–14 appropriation. We project annual growth rates of about 2 percent for Stage 2 and Stage 3 as the state phases out CalWORKs work–exemption policies that curbed child care caseload in recent years. For the non–CalWORKs programs, we project annual growth rates of about 3 percent due to the resumption of statutory COLAs in 2015–16 (averaging about 2 percent) and slow growth in the population of children under age five.\nTwo Factors Could Increase Costs of Providing Child Care. Our projections assume the average cost of care for a child in a CalWORKs child care program will remain at 2013–14 levels throughout the forecast period. Two factors could increase these per–child costs. First, should the share of CalWORKs families opting for licensed rather than license–exempt child care continue to increase above the trend displayed in the first quarter of 2013–14, the cost of the CalWORKs programs would rise compared to our forecast. Second, our forecast assumes the state makes no changes to existing provider reimbursement rates, which have been flat since 2006. Should the Legislature increase the provider reimbursement rates, costs also would increase.\nPotential Changes to Federal Funding and Requirements Could Affect State Costs. In addition to state funding, subsidized child care and support services are supported with federal funding. Our forecast assumes California’s federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) allotment remains level across the period, with the recent $8 million annual sequestration reduction maintained. (Our forecast assumes the state continues to backfill this sequestration cut every year of the forecast period.) Because CCDF dollars generally are used interchangeably with state General Fund to support the state’s child care programs, additional reductions to the CCDF likely would create similar pressure for the state to backfill. Moreover, the federal government recently released draft regulations that would require states to provide additional training and oversight for child care providers. Furthermore, the regulations would require many providers to meet higher standards. Because the federal government has not indicated that increased requirements would be accompanied by an increase to the CCDF, implementing these regulations could increase overall state costs for child care programs or result in a reduction in the number of children served.\nOverview of Services Provided. California’s major health programs provide health coverage and additional services for various groups of eligible persons—primarily poor families and children as well as seniors and persons with disabilities. The federal Medicaid program, known as Medi–Cal in California, is the largest state health program both in terms of funding and number of persons served. As of December 2013, the bulk of the population formerly served by the Healthy Families Program (HFP)—a health care insurance program for children—will have transitioned to Medi–Cal. In addition, the state supports various public health programs and community services and state–operated facilities for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. Beyond these health programs, the state provides a variety of human services and benefits to its citizens. These include income maintenance for the aged, blind, or disabled; cash assistance and welfare–to–work services for low–income families with children; protection of children from abuse and neglect; and the provision of home–care workers who assist the aged and disabled in remaining in their own homes. Although state departments oversee the management of these programs, the actual delivery of many services is carried out by county welfare and child support offices, and other local entities. Health programs are largely federally and state funded, while most human services programs have a mixture of federal, state, and county funding.\nOverall Spending Trends. The 2013–14 budget provided $28.1 billion in General Fund spending for health and human services (HHS) programs. We now estimate that these General Fund costs in 2013–14 will be slightly higher—by $130 million, primarily reflecting assumed savings in Medi–Cal that will not occur for a variety of reasons. Based on current law requirements, we project that General Fund spending for HHS programs will increase to $28.3 billion in 2014–15 and $29.1 billion in 2015–16. This modest growth in General Fund spending over these years is not primarily due to a slowing down in program growth, but rather is largely reflective of changes in how programs are funded and an increase in limited–term savings. For example, over these years, more General Fund spending in CalWORKs is being offset with realignment revenues and there is an increase in savings in Medi–Cal associated with provider payment reductions and the Managed Care Organization (MCO) tax. Over the final four years of the forecast, we project that spending will increase on average by about $1.6 billion each year, eventually reaching $35.6 billion. The bulk of the spending increases in 2016–17 through 2019–20 reflect Medi–Cal increases in caseload and the per–person cost of providing health care services. Medi–Cal General Fund spending grows faster in the latter part of the forecast period as savings that offset costs in the earlier years of the forecast are reduced and as the state’s share of costs for the Medi–Cal expansion under federal health care reform ramp up.\nAlthough the average annual increase in HHS spending is 3.9 percent during the forecast period, there is substantial variation in spending growth rates by program. General Fund spending for Medi–Cal averages 6 percent per year during the forecast period. The Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program (SSI/SSP) is projected to have average annual growth of 1.4 percent, while General Fund spending for the CalWORKs program is projected to decline at an average annual rate of about 13 percent. (As will be discussed below, this decline reflects both projected caseload declines as well as the infusion of non–General Fund funding sources to support the program over the forecast period.)\nAnticipated Lower Caseload Growth in Some Programs Reduces Cost Pressures. The recession in the latter part of the 2000s raised unemployment and reduced income, resulting in historically high numbers of Californians enrolling in certain state HHS programs. As a result, caseload growth for several HHS programs from 2007–08 (the beginning of the recession) to 2011–12 (post–recession) was well above historical trends. For example, the CalWORKs caseload increased by 27 percent over this period. Our economic forecast calls for healthy employment growth over the next six years (although unemployment rates are projected to remain at relatively elevated levels). Accordingly, our caseload projections for several HHS programs reflect substantially lower growth rates compared to the experience of the recent recessionary years, and in some cases—such as CalWORKs—we are projecting caseload declines over some or all of the forecast period. This in turn reduces costs pressures. Below, we discuss spending trends in the major HHS programs.\nThe ACA, also referred to as federal health care reform, is far–reaching legislation that makes significant changes to health care coverage and delivery in California. The scope of the ACA is so broad that it will be years before all of its provisions will be fully implemented and its overall ramifications fully understood. Our forecast includes significant budgetary adjustments to account for the future implementation of several significant ACA provisions, most of which affect the Medi–Cal Program and are discussed below. Some of these adjustments result in cost increases for the state while others result in cost reductions.\nOverall Spending Trends. We estimate that 2013–14 General Fund spending for Medi–Cal local assistance administered by the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) will be $16.3 billion—approximately 1 percent higher than what was assumed in the 2013–14 Budget Act. The higher current–year spending estimate reflects, among other things, the delay of the Coordinated Care Initiative (CCI) from January 2014 to April 2014 and updated estimates of the savings related to provider rate reductions (discussed in more detail below). We project that General Fund support will grow to $16.5 billion in 2014–15, a 1.6 percent increase from estimated current–year expenditures. As noted above, the relatively small growth rate is largely reflective of an increase in savings associated with provider payment reductions and the MCO tax (discussed in more detail below). On average, we project that General Fund spending will increase by about 6 percent annually over the forecast period, reaching a total of $23 billion by 2019–20. Some of the most significant factors contributing to the estimated net increases in spending over the forecast period are: (1) increases in caseload and the per–person cost of providing health care services, (2) the full implementation of recently enacted budget reductions, (3) the restoration of certain services that were eliminated in previous years’ budgets, (4) the continuation of two recently enacted fees/taxes that leverage additional federal funds to offset state General Fund spending, and (5) the fiscal effects associated with implementing the ACA.\nProjected Changes in Caseload and Average Costs Per Enrollee. Absent the effects of the ACA (which we discuss in more detail below), we project that the cost per person for Medi–Cal health care services will grow at an average annual rate of 4.6 percent and the number of individuals enrolled in Medi–Cal will grow 1.4 percent annually over the forecast period.\nImplementation of Recent Actions to Reduce General Fund Spending. Our forecast makes important assumptions about the ongoing General Fund cost reductions associated with recently passed legislation. Some of these key assumptions include:\n- Provider Payment Reductions. In 2011, budget–related legislation authorized a reduction in certain Medi–Cal provider payments by up to 10 percent. However, until recently, federal court injunctions prevented the state from implementing many of these reductions. In May 2013, a federal court ruled in favor of the state and the injunctions were lifted in June. Since the 2013–14 budget was enacted, several types of providers have been exempted from the payment reduction through either an administrative decision by DHCS or recently enacted legislation. Payment reductions for some of the non–exempt providers were implemented in September 2013 and the remaining reductions are expected to be implemented by early 2014. Our forecast assumes the payment reductions result in $365 million General Fund savings in 2013–14, or roughly $50 million less than what was assumed in the 2013–14 budget. Our forecast assumes about $700 million in annual General Fund savings associated with the payment reductions in 2014–15 and 2015–16 (including the retroactive recoupment of payments back to June 2011) and roughly $500 million in annual savings thereafter.\n- CCI. The 2012–13 budget package authorized the CCI as an eight–county demonstration project intended to integrate physical health care services and long–term services and supports for Medi–Cal beneficiaries through managed care plans. The 2013–14 budget assumed a net General Fund cost of $21 million related to the first six months of CCI implementation beginning January 1, 2014. In August 2013, the administration announced that CCI implementation would begin no sooner than April 1, 2014. Our forecast reflects this implementation delay and assumes additional related costs of $27 million General Fund in 2013–14. Our forecast assumes the CCI will begin to generate savings of nearly $80 million in 2014–15 and over $140 million annually once fully implemented in 2015–16.\nRestoration of Certain Medi–Cal Benefits That Were Previously Eliminated. The 2013–14 budget restored some Medi–Cal benefits that were eliminated or restricted in recent years. Beginning May 2014, orally consumed enteral nutrition products and a portion of the dental services for adult beneficiaries will be restored. Our forecast assumes the costs associated with these restorations will be roughly $17 million in 2013–14 and over $100 million annually in the following years.\nContinuation of Hospital Fee and MCO Tax. Our forecast assumes the continuation of two recently enacted fees/taxes that are used to leverage additional federal funds to offset state General Fund spending.\n- Hospital Fee. The hospital quality assurance fee generates revenue that is used to increase Medi–Cal payments to hospitals and offset General Fund costs for providing children’s health coverage. Under current law, the fee expires on December 31, 2016. However, the Legislature has extended the fee three times since its initial enactment and, in the current version of the fee, the Legislature established some parameters for future fees that are authorized after 2016. Our forecast assumes that a fee will be reauthorized in 2016 and fee revenue will continue to offset General Fund monies—reaching over $1 billion annually toward the end of the forecast period.\n- MCO Tax. Current state law authorizes a 3.9 percent (equal to the current state General Fund sales tax rate) tax on premium revenues collected by Medi–Cal MCOs through 2015–16. The revenue from these taxes will be matched with federal Medicaid funds and will be used to: (1) increase Medi–Cal managed care capitated rates by an amount that offsets the tax paid by MCOs and (2) fund Medi–Cal managed care payments. The Legislature has authorized several similar taxes on MCOs since 2010, but all prior taxes were at the state’s 2.35 percent gross premiums insurance tax rate rather than the 3.9 percent state General Fund sales tax rate. Our forecast assumes federal approval of the new MCO tax, which will generate over $300 million General Fund savings in 2012–13 and growing to nearly $800 million General Fund savings by 2015–16—largely due to the significant increase in the number of people expected to enroll in Medi–Cal managed care plans and the additional services that will be delivered through those plans. In addition, our forecast assumes that the MCO tax is extended from 2016–17 through 2019–20, but at the lower 2.35 percent gross premiums insurance tax rate. This assumption reflects the current policy of reauthorizing the MCO tax, but at a rate that is more consistent with past MCO taxes. We estimate that such an extension would result in General Fund savings of about $500 million to $600 million annually.\nACA Implementation. Our spending projections assume that implementation of the ACA will have several significant fiscal effects on the Medi–Cal Program.\n- Medi–Cal Expansion. Beginning January 1, 2014, California will expand Medi–Cal coverage to include most adults under age 65 with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level who are not currently eligible for Medi–Cal—hereafter referred to as the Medi–Cal expansion. The federal matching rate for coverage of the expansion population will be 100 percent for the first three years, but will decline between 2017 and 2020, with the state eventually bearing 10 percent of the additional cost of health care services for the expansion population. While the expansion will add at least several hundred thousand enrollees beginning in 2014—potentially growing to over a million additional enrollees within a couple of years—the federal government will pay the large majority of the costs of the expansion during our forecast period. However, our forecast projects costs in the low hundreds of millions of dollars beginning in 2016–17 and increasing to over $500 million in 2019–20. The Medi–Cal expansion will have other significant fiscal effects on state and local governments due to changes that were made to 1991 health realignment funding to adjust for the effects of the ACA. We discuss these changes and the associated state fiscal effects in more detail below.\n- Increased Costs for Persons Currently Eligible, but Not Enrolled. We project that several ACA provisions—such as the individual mandate to obtain health insurance coverage and streamlined Medi–Cal eligibility processes—will increase the demand for Medi–Cal by persons who are currently eligible but have not enrolled in the program. Unlike the expansion population, the state will be responsible for 50 percent of the costs for services provided to persons who are eligible for Medi–Cal under current standards. The 2013–14 budget includes costs of slightly more than $100 million associated with increased enrollment among currently eligible persons. Our revised estimates of costs for additional currently eligible persons in 2013–14 is somewhat higher—nearly $130 million. We project that these costs will increase to roughly $500 million dollars annually within a few years—largely due to projected increases in the number of additional persons enrolling after the ACA is fully implemented.\n- Increased Federal Matching Rate for Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). From October 1, 2015 to October 1, 2019, the ACA authorizes a 23 percentage point increase in the federal CHIP matching rate—from 65 percent to 88 percent in California. Our forecast assumes the enhanced federal matching rate will offset about $230 million in General Fund spending in the Medi–Cal Target Low–Income Children’s Program (formerly HFP) in 2015–16 and roughly $350 million annually prior to its expiration in 2019.\n- Enhanced Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services. As part of ACA implementation and the 2013–14 budget, the Legislature authorized an enhanced set of mental health and substance use disorder services for Medi–Cal beneficiaries beginning January 1, 2014. Our forecast assumes partial–year General Fund costs of about $65 million in 2013–14 and costs of roughly $200 million annually for these enhanced services by the end of the forecast period.\nPotential Issue for Future Legislative Consideration: Access to Care and Provider Rates. The Legislature has expressed some concern about beneficiaries’ access to health care services in the Medi–Cal Program and the degree to which implementation of provider rate reductions may reduce access. In light of the projected operating surpluses outlined in this report, the Legislature may wish to commit some of the surplus to help improve access to care for beneficiaries in Medi–Cal by reversing recent provider rate reductions. As we discussed above, our forecast assumes roughly $500 million in annual General Fund savings associated with prospectively implementing provider rate reductions. To the extent the Legislature is concerned about inadequate access to care in the Medi–Cal Program, it may want to consider making some targeted rate increases for certain types of Medi–Cal providers. To the extent possible, the decision to increase rates and the amount of any such increases should be based on an assessment of several factors, including which types of services Medi–Cal beneficiaries have most difficulty accessing and the degree to which access to those services appears to be inadequate.\n2013–14 Budget Established a Structure to Redirect Some Health Realignment Funds. Historically, counties have had the fiscal and programmatic responsibility for providing health care for low–income populations without public or private health coverage—also known as indigent health care. As part of 1991 realignment, the state provided a dedicated funding stream to counties for indigent health care and public health—hereafter referred to as health realignment funds. Health care services provided by counties to indigents are commonly referred to as the county health care safety net.\nThe Medi–Cal expansion shifts much of the responsibility for indigent health care to the state and federal governments, and counties are likely to experience significant savings. In recognition of the shifting responsibilities for indigent health care under the ACA, the 2013–14 budget established a structure under which a portion of county health realignment funds will be redirected to help pay CalWORKs grant costs previously borne by the state—thereby offsetting state General Fund costs.\nAmount of Redirected Health Realignment Funds Determined on a County–by–County Basis. In recognition of the significant differences among counties and the Legislature’s interest in protecting the county health care safety net, the 2013–14 budget established a complex structure to determine the amount of 1991 health realignment funds that would be redirected to the state. The methods used to determine the redirected amount differ among counties and some counties will have the option to choose between two general approaches—the so–called “60 percent option” or the so–called “shared savings formula.” For more detail on the different methods for determining the redirected amount, see our November report, The 2013–14 Budget: California Spending Plan.\nForecast Assumes State General Fund Savings of Nearly $1 Billion in Some Years. Figure 5 shows our projections of the amount of health realignment funds that will be redirected. Our forecast adopts the 2013–14 budget assumption that $300 million will be redirected from county health programs in 2013–14. Our projections of savings in future years include, among other things, our rough estimates of county savings associated with the Medi–Cal expansion. These savings reflect our estimates of the ACA’s reductions in federal Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments that currently go to county hospitals. The DSH reductions increase significantly in 2017–18 through 2019–20, thereby reducing estimated county savings in those years. Since redirected funds are to be used to offset CalWORKs grant costs, the General Fund offsets are largely reflected in the CalWORKs portion of our forecast. (Please see the CalWORKs section of this chapter for more detail on how these projected savings amounts are reflected in our forecast.)\nFigure 5\nProjected State Savings Associated With the Affordable Care Act and Changes to 1991 Health Realignment\nGeneral Fund (In Millions)\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n2016–17\n|\n2017–18\n|\n2018–19\n|\n2019–20\n|\n|\n$300\n|\n$930\n|\n$955\n|\n$916\n|\n$738\n|\n$708\n|\n$778\n|\nProjected Savings in 2014–15 and Beyond Are Subject to Substantial Uncertainty. Our projections of state savings associated with changes in 1991 health realignment in 2014–15 and beyond are subject to substantial uncertainty—actual savings could be several hundred million dollars higher or lower. At the time of this report, some of the largest sources of uncertainty are:\n- Many Counties Have Not Selected Which Option They Will Use to Determine the Redirected Amount. It is still unclear which counties will select the 60 percent option and which counties will select the shared savings formula to determine the amount of realignment funds that will be redirected.\n- Data Used to Determine Historic County Revenues and Costs Is Still Unavailable. Counties that select the shared savings formula are still in the process of gathering historic data that will be submitted to the DHCS and used to calculate the amount of 1991 realignment funds that will be redirected.\n- Effects of the ACA on County Hospital Patient Volume and Revenue. For counties that own and operate hospitals and select the shared savings formula, the redirected amount will depend on how the ACA affects the number of patients who will receive care from the public hospital system, whether or not these patients have Medi–Cal coverage, and the level of reimbursement for services provided to Medi–Cal enrollees—all of which are subject to uncertainty.\n- Future Federal Funding for County Hospitals. County hospitals currently receive billions of dollars in federal funding from the state’s Section 1115 Medicaid waiver and DSH payments. The amount of funding available from these sources in the future is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty. In some counties, significant changes in the amount of the waiver and/or DSH funding would have a significant effect on the amount of county savings determined by the shared savings formula.\nGiven the various sources of uncertainty described above, we were forced to make a variety of assumptions when projecting state savings. For example, our forecast generally assumes that counties that own and operate hospitals will select the shared savings formula and most other counties will select the 60 percent option. Our forecast assumes no significant changes in county costs and revenues associated with currently eligible Medi–Cal beneficiaries and uninsured patients who remain ineligible for Medi–Cal after 2014. We also assume federal waiver funding for county hospitals will remain relatively steady over the entire forecast period.\nWe estimate the General Fund spending for the department in 2013–14 will be about $1.4 billion, and will grow by about $60 million by 2019–20. The increase in General Fund spending over the forecast period is mainly due to two factors: (1) the startup of the new California Health Care Facility (CHCF) in Stockton accounts for an estimated $30 million increase from 2013–14 to 2014–15, and (2) the annual projected increases in the patient population.\nWe project that General Fund spending for IHSS will increase from about $1.8 billion in 2013–14 to nearly $1.9 billion in 2014–15. For the forecast period, we project costs to increase an average of 3.6 percent each year, resulting in General Fund expenditures of nearly $2.3 billion in 2019–20. These estimated expenditure increases are primarily driven by caseload growth (which we project to be 2 percent annually) and three factors exerting upward pressure on IHSS providers’ wages. These factors include: (1) new federal labor regulations that require employers to pay overtime wages to home care workers (including IHSS providers), (2) the state’s recently authorized increases to the minimum wage, and (3) anticipated wage increases negotiated through the collective bargaining process.\nWe note that in prior years our IHSS forecast included elements of budgetary uncertainty due to pending lawsuits that challenged previously enacted budget reductions. However, an IHSS settlement agreement approved by the court in May 2013—and legislation that effectuated the terms of the agreement—effectively resolves the budgetary uncertainty related to the previously enacted budget reductions. The terms of the agreement replace the previously enacted reductions with a new budget reduction plan that enables the state to realize net General Fund savings of approximately $175 million a year beginning in 2013–14.\nThree Factors Put Upward Pressure on IHSS Providers’ Wages. The U.S. Department of Labor recently released new regulations that require home care workers, including IHSS providers, to be paid overtime of at least one–and–a–half times their regular pay rate. This requirement, which takes effect on January 1, 2015, represents a new General Fund cost estimated to be about $60 million annually. Second, the state’s new minimum wage of $9 per hour (up from $8 per hour) beginning July 1, 2014 and $10 per hour beginning January 1, 2016 further increases wages for IHSS providers who earn less than the new minimum wage level. Because most IHSS providers are currently paid more than $9 but less than $10, the bulk of the costs associated with the minimum wage increase—General Fund costs of approximately $44 million annually—result from the increase from $9 to $10. Finally, future wage increases resulting from collective bargaining between IHSS provider unions and counties would also increase General Fund program costs. With the implementation of the CCI, eight counties will be transitioning from negotiating wages at the county level to statewide collective bargaining for wages and benefits. To the extent that the transition of the eight CCI counties to statewide collective bargaining yields faster wage growth than the historical trend for county–negotiated wages suggests, IHSS program costs would be higher than our forecast projects.\nGeneral Fund Costs Associated With County Maintenance of Effort (MOE) Hold Steady. Budget–related legislation adopted in 2012–13 enacted a county MOE, in which counties generally maintain their 2011–12 expenditure level for IHSS—to be adjusted annually for (1) an inflation factor of 3.5 percent beginning in 2014–15 and (2) a percentage of wage increases negotiated by counties. Under the previous IHSS funding structure, the state and counties each paid a fixed percentage of the nonfederal share of IHSS program costs. Under the new county MOE financing structure, the state General Fund assumes any nonfederal IHSS costs above counties’ MOE expenditure level. To account for known wage increases negotiated by counties in 2012–13 and 2013–14, we estimate that the MOE level for counties increases by $12 million (to about $925 million) in 2012–13 and by $19 million (to an estimated $943 million) in 2013–14. For the remainder of the forecast period, this MOE level will be further adjusted to account for additional wage increases that will be negotiated by counties and to account for the inflation factor of 3.5 percent. Because we estimate that the MOE will be growing at roughly the same rate as the overall IHSS program, we project that the additional costs incurred by the General Fund as a result of the county MOE will hold steady during the forecast period at about $40 million annually. If total IHSS program costs grow faster than counties’ MOE expenditure level, then the additional costs incurred by the General Fund as a result of the MOE would be higher than we estimate.\nWe estimate that General Fund spending for the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) will total about $2.8 billion in 2013–14. We project that General Fund expenditures will grow to $3 billion in 2014–15 and to $3.6 billion by the end of the forecast period in 2019–20 (an average annual increase of 4.2 percent over the forecast period). These projected expenditure increases are mostly due to cost increases for regional centers resulting from (1) a growing caseload (we project 3.4 percent annual growth) and (2) increased costs per case (we project 0.8 percent annual growth). The increased costs per case are primarily due to greater authorization and utilization of services as well as rising costs for community services provided by regional centers. Further, the expenditure increases in the DDS budget are also driven by the new federal labor regulations regarding overtime pay for home care workers as well as the state’s minimum wage increase (please see the IHSS write–up above for more detail on these changes). These expenditure increases are partially offset by reductions in the budget for developmental centers as a result of individuals transitioning to the community and the closure of the Lanterman Developmental Center.\nTotal Program Spending to Remain Relatively Flat. . . The CalWORKs program is funded by a combination of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, the state General Fund, and county funds. The 2013–14 budget provides $5.5 billion (all funds) to support the CalWORKs program, including $2.7 billion TANF, $1.2 billion General Fund, and $1.6 billion county funds (almost entirely realignment revenues). From this current–year base, we estimate that CalWORKs costs will remain relatively steady, with total spending increasing by approximately $140 million in 2014–15 and gradually tapering to around current levels by the end of the forecast period. This steady overall trend masks two underlying trends that are expected to have opposing effects on total spending. First, the CalWORKs caseload is expected to continue to decline as the state of the economy and the labor market improve, ultimately resulting in annual savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars by the end of the forecast period. Second, the 2013–14 budget package redirected a portion of the growth in certain revenues provided to counties under 1991 realignment to pay for gradual increases to the CalWORKs grant level over time, thereby increasing total program spending. (For more information on the statutory mechanism that provides these gradual grant increases, see the CalWORKs write–up in the Human Services section of our publication, The 2013–14 Budget: California Spending Plan.) We estimate that increased spending from a higher level of grants will offset the majority of savings expected from the projected caseload decline over the forecast period.\n. . . While General Fund Spending Projected to Decline. Although total spending in the CalWORKs program is expected to remain relatively flat, General Fund spending in the program is projected to decline from $1.2 billion in 2013–14 to $716 million in 2014–15, gradually declining further to $509 million by the end of the forecast period in 2019–20. Reduced General Fund spending in CalWORKs is driven by two main factors:\n- Caseload Savings Accrue to the General Fund. First, because the TANF block grant is fixed and fully allocated in the state budget, incremental changes in total program spending, including savings that result from a declining caseload, primarily accrue to the General Fund.\n- General Fund Spending to Be Offset With Realignment Funds. Current law provides that health realignment funds be redirected to help pay CalWORKs grant costs in each county as part of the state–based expansion of the Medi–Cal Program. (For more information on the redirection of health realignment funds, see the Medi–Cal write–up in this section of the report.) We project that redirected health realignment funds will be more than enough to fully offset General Fund spending on CalWORKs grants, beginning in 2014–15. The remaining General Fund expenditures displayed in our forecast primarily represent spending on services and administration in the CalWORKs program.\nAssume Legislature Will Make Changes to Current Law to Achieve Full General Fund Savings From Redirected Health Realignment Funds. As noted above, we estimate that the amount of health realignment funds available to be redirected to pay for CalWORKs General Fund grant costs will exceed the amount of costs that are available to be offset beginning in 2014–15. For the purposes of our state General Fund forecast, we have assumed that health realignment funds will be redirected to offset General Fund costs in the CalWORKs program to the extent possible under current law and have treated the remaining redirected health realignment funds as unallocated savings. Our forecast assumes unallocated General Fund savings of approximately $180 million in 2014–15, with this amount growing to as much as $330 million annually over the forecast period. To realize the full General Fund savings that we have assumed in our forecast, the Legislature has various options, including: (1) increasing the amount of the TANF block grant that is spent in CSAC and increasing General Fund spending on CalWORKs grants by an equal amount (our current–law forecast assumes that the amount of the TANF dollars allocated to CSAC remains fixed throughout the forecast period); (2) changing current law to allow redirected health realignment funds to offset General Fund costs for administration and services in the CalWORKs program (in addition to General Fund costs for grants); or (3) changing current law to allow redirected health realignment funds to also offset General Fund costs in programs outside of CalWORKs, such as CalFresh administrative expenditures.\nOther Policy Changes to Affect Program Spending Levels in Short Term. In the short term, year–over–year changes in total and General Fund CalWORKs spending are also driven by the ongoing implementation of recent policy changes. The most significant of these include:\n- Cost of Restoring Funding Due to Expiration of Work Exemptions. In prior years, the Legislature achieved General Fund savings by not providing employment and supportive services to certain CalWORKs recipients who were temporarily exempted from mandatory participation in welfare–to–work activities. Beginning in January 2013, the temporary exemptions were eliminated and counties began the process of gradually requiring the participation of all formerly exempt recipients by January 2015. As this process continues, we estimate that General Fund costs to provide services to formerly exempt recipients will increase by approximately $90 million.\n- Uncertain Savings From 24–Month Time Limit. As a condition of receiving aid, adult CalWORKs recipients must generally comply with work requirements and are limited to a cumulative 48 months of aid. Effective January 2013, state work requirements were made more flexible, but adult recipients were restricted to a cumulative 24 months of aid under the more flexible requirements. Once the 24 months have been exhausted, adult recipients will be required to meet relatively more stringent federal work requirements in order to continue to receive aid (up to the 48 month maximum). Additionally, beginning in 2013–14, new supportive services (comprising the early engagement strategies discussed below) will be made available that are intended to assist recipients to become self–sufficient more quickly. Taken together, these policy changes will likely result in some savings as some recipients (1) respond positively to increased services and work requirement flexibility to obtain employment that allows them to leave the caseload or (2) exhaust their 24 months of participation under state work requirements and fail to comply with federal work requirements, resulting in a decreased cash grant and loss of access to many supportive services. Our forecast assumes that the introduction of the 24–month clock will result in decreased costs to the General Fund, though the timing and magnitude of these savings are uncertain.\n- Cost of Full–Year Implementation of Early Engagement Strategies. In 2013–14, the state began implementing three strategies outlined in statute intended to assist CalWORKs recipients in obtaining self–sustaining employment during their 24 months of participation under state welfare–to–work requirements. These strategies include: (1) the development of a statewide online welfare–to–work appraisal tool, (2) intensive case management and supplemental services for certain CalWORKs families, and (3) additional funding for subsidized employment positions. We estimate that fully implementing these strategies according to current law will result in additional annual General Fund costs of approximately $90 million.\nState expenditures for SSI/SSP are estimated to be $2.8 billion in 2013–14, and increase by an average of $42 million annually through 2019–20, when expenditures are projected to reach an estimated $3 billion. The projected spending increases are primarily due to average annual caseload growth of about 1.1 percent. During the 2013–14 budget development process, the Legislature expressed interest in reinstating a COLA for SSI/SSP grant recipients. While our forecast does not assume the provision of a COLA over the forecast period, we estimate that reinstating a COLA for the state–funded SSP portion of the grant would cost approximately $50 million annually or $300 million more by 2019–20 if provided each year over the forecast period.\nThe major state judiciary and criminal justice programs include support for two departments in the executive branch—the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the Department of Justice—as well as expenditures for the state court system.\nWe estimate that General Fund spending for support of CDCR operations in the current year will be $8.7 billion, which is a net increase of $399 million, or about 5 percent, above the 2012–13 level of spending. This increase primarily reflects (1) costs to comply with a federal court order to reduce the state’s prison population (as discussed in more detail below), (2) additional employee compensation costs due to the expiration of the personal leave program, and (3) costs associated with the activation of the CHCF and the DeWitt Correctional Annex in Stockton. These increases are partially offset by additional savings from the 2011 realignment, which shifted responsibility for managing many lower–level adult offenders from the state to the counties.\nOur forecast projects that General Fund spending on corrections will increase to $9 billion by 2019–20. This increase is primarily due to ongoing costs of accommodating the minor growth projected in the inmate population while complying with the court–ordered population cap, as well as the planned activation of additional prison facilities. However, as we describe below, a few key factors could substantially affect the fiscal impact that compliance with the federal court order will have on the state.\nRecent State Actions to Comply With Federal Court Order. In September 2013, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed Chapter 310, Statutes of 2013 (SB 105, Steinberg), to address the federal three judge panel order requiring the state to reduce the prison population to no more than 137.5 percent of design capacity by December 31, 2013. (Design capacity generally refers to the number of beds CDCR would operate if it housed only one inmate per cell and did not use temporary beds, such as housing inmates in gyms. Inmates housed in contract facilities are not counted toward the population cap.) Chapter 310 provides CDCR with $315 million in General Fund support and authorizes the department to enter into contracts to secure a sufficient amount of inmate housing to meet the court order and to avoid the early release of inmates which might otherwise be necessary to comply with the order. The authority provided to CDCR to expand its contract capacity expires January 1, 2017.\nThe measure also requires that if the federal court modifies its order capping the prison population, a share of the $315 million appropriation in Chapter 310 would be deposited into a newly established Recidivism Reduction Fund for activities designed to reduce the state prison population, including recidivism reduction programs. On September 24, 2013, the three–judge panel issued an order directing the state to meet with inmate attorneys to discuss how to implement a long–term overcrowding solution. The order also prohibits the state from entering into any new contracts for out–of–state housing during this meeting process. A subsequent order moved back the deadline for meeting the population cap to February 24, 2014.\nSeveral Factors Could Alter Fiscal Effect of Compliance With Order. Our forecast assumes that CDCR will use contract beds throughout the forecast period to comply with the population cap and accommodate the projected growth in the prison population. However, there are several circumstances under which the state may not use as much contract bed space as assumed in our forecast. For example, if the state comes to a settlement with inmate attorneys that alters the population cap or the deadline for compliance, the state could purchase fewer contract beds than currently planned. Similarly, the state would also not need as many contract beds over the forecast period if it chooses to comply with the population cap by reducing the size of the inmate population in future years. Depending on (1) the outcomes of negotiations with the plaintiffs, (2) how the state chooses to comply with the population cap in the long term, and (3) the actual growth of the inmate population, the fiscal effect of complying with the cap could be several hundred million dollars less per year than is reflected in our forecast.\nWe estimate that General Fund spending for the support of the judicial branch in the current year will be $1.2 billion, which is about $434 million (or 58 percent) above the amount in 2012–13. This net increase is primarily due to the full restoration of a one–time $418 million General Fund reduction made to the trial courts in 2012–13, as well as an ongoing $60 million augmentation for increasing public access to trial court services. Despite these augmentations, the courts maintain ongoing reductions of a few hundred million dollars allocated in prior years, particularly due to the expiration of one–time actions to address the state’s recent budget problems (such as fund transfers). The Legislature could decide to provide additional General Fund support in the future to offset these reductions. However, our forecast assumes that General Fund spending on the judicial branch will remain roughly flat at about $1.2 billion over the forecast period.\nForecast Reflects Costs of Current Agreements. Our forecast assumes that state General Fund employee compensation costs will increase by $280 million in 2014–15 and an additional $500 million between 2015–16 and 2019–20. These costs result primarily from the state’s existing labor agreements with most of its 21 employee bargaining units. A small portion of these costs—over $20 million in 2014–15 and over $20 million more in 2015–16—results from higher state employee costs required due to California’s upcoming minimum wage increases.\nOver $100 million of the 2014–15 costs results from assumed July 2014 salary increases of about 2 percent for employees in 13 state employee bargaining units, as well as their non–represented managers, plus some other compensation costs for these units. These 13 bargaining units have labor agreements that require Department of Finance (DOF) approval before these 2014–15 pay increases are granted. (Our forecast, therefore, assumes that DOF determines that there are sufficient funds to provide these increases in 2014–15.) Employees in these bargaining units and their managers also are assumed to receive salary increases of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent in July 2015 ($120 million in 2015–16), consistent with the units’ labor agreements. In addition, the forecast reflects salary increases of between 3 percent and 4 percent in January or July 2015 (about $90 million in 2014–15 and an additional $100 million in 2015–16) for four other bargaining units that have approved labor agreements with the state.\nIncreases in the premium costs for state employee health care benefits average over 6 percent per year in our forecast (about $70 million in 2014–15). The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) negotiates health premium rates each year. We assume that these health premiums will increase at a rate exceeding inflation for the foreseeable future.\nAdditional Labor Agreements Could Result in Higher Costs. Our forecast does not include any change in state costs associated with future labor agreements that could be approved by the Legislature, including agreements with the three state employee bargaining units that currently have expired agreements. These three units represent the state’s attorneys, scientists, and stationary engineers.\nOur forecast reflects current–law increases in the state’s annual payments to (1) pension programs for state and CSU employees, (2) teachers’ pensions, (3) state and CSU retiree health benefit programs, and (4) pension programs for judges. (The teachers’ pension program is administered by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System [CalSTRS], and the other three programs are administered by CalPERS.)\nCalPERS Contributions Driven by Pay Raises, Investments, and Actuarial Methods. Our forecast assumes that the state’s required General Fund contribution to CalPERS for state and CSU pensions rises from $2.3 billion in 2013–14 to $2.8 billion in 2019–20. Our forecast incorporates the requirement that CSU pays (from CSU resources) all CalPERS pension costs related to growth in the CSU payroll after 2013–14. Our forecast further assumes that (1) CalPERS investment returns hit the system’s assumed investment target of 7.5 percent per year during the forecast period and (2) the state does not approve any pay increases for state workers beyond those included in its current labor agreements. These assumptions limit the growth of the state’s CalPERS contribution rates. If, by contrast, salary levels were to increase faster than we assume, investment returns were to be significantly less, and/or actuarial methods of CalPERS were to change, the state’s required payments to CalPERS could be hundreds of millions of dollars more than we forecast by 2019–20.\nCalSTRS Contribution Driven by Rates Set in Statute and Teacher Compensation Growth. The forecast assumes that the state’s contributions to CalSTRS grow from $1.4 billion in 2013–14 to $1.8 billion in 2019–20. State contributions in 2013–14 are based on 2011–12 statewide payroll levels for K–12 and community college teaching and administrative personnel of $26.1 billion. The preliminary estimate for 2012–13 statewide payroll (upon which the state’s 2014–15 contributions will be based) is essentially identical. We assume that statewide payroll increases by 3 percent to 6 percent annually beginning in 2013–14.\nThe state pays about 4 percent of teacher payroll (calculated based on a two–year lag) to CalSTRS, as required in state law. The system also receives payments from school districts and teachers to cover pension program costs, which also are fixed in law. The state also contributes additional funds each year when certain unfunded liabilities emerge, as they did after the decline of world financial markets in 2008. In our forecast, these supplemental contributions total about 1 percent of compensation in 2013, rising to roughly 1.5 percent in 2015 and thereafter. (These additional state contributions are very small compared to the billions of dollars of additional funding per year that CalSTRS needs to pay its unfunded liabilities. Because our forecast assumes only current–law state payments to CalSTRS, the forecast does not assume additional payments to retire the system’s large unfunded liabilities—or other pension policy changes—beyond these amounts required under law.)\nRetiree Health Costs to Continue Rapid Increases. The forecast assumes continued pay–as–you–go payments for the vast majority of state and CSU retiree health costs. The bulk of these payments are contained in two General Fund line items for the state’s retiree health benefit payments. We project that these costs will grow from $1.8 billion in 2013–14 to $3.3 billion in 2019–20. This represents a more than 10 percent annual growth rate during the forecast period. This growth is driven by two elements: (1) projected annual growth in state employee and retiree health plan premiums and (2) a rising population of state and CSU retirees.\nOver the last several years, the Legislature has taken various actions to reduce or defer costs for state mandates on local governments. These actions include permanently repealing mandates and suspending statutory requirements to implement mandates. Our forecast assumes that the Legislature continues to suspend all mandates it suspended in 2013–14. Beginning in 2015–16, our forecast also assumes that the state makes annual payments to retire the backlog of mandate claims incurred prior to 2004–05, as specified in current law. No payments are assumed, however, for the backlog of mandate claims incurred since 2004–05 as no plan to retire these debts has been adopted. Under these assumptions, state costs for mandates will be around $60 million in 2014–15, increasing to about $230 million in 2015–16 and about $260 million by the end of the forecast period.\nInterest Payments on Federal Loan. California’s UI Trust Fund has been insolvent since 2009, requiring the state to borrow from the federal government to continue payment of UI benefits. California’s outstanding federal loan is estimated to be $9.7 billion at the end of 2013. The state is required to make annual interest payments on this federal loan. These interest costs total $259 million in 2013–14 (about $2.5 million less than what was appropriated in the 2013–14 Budget Act). The budget authorizes this interest payment from the General Fund. Based upon our projections of the future unemployment rate and the Employment Development Department’s projections of benefit payments and UI Trust Fund revenues, we project that the General Fund annual interest payments will gradually decline each year—from $259 million in 2013–14 to $2.5 million in 2019–20 (when we estimate the loan will be completely paid off).\nOur projections do not incorporate any potential actions, such as an increase in UI taxes or decrease in benefits, that could be taken during the forecast period to address the underlying UI Trust Fund insolvency and reduce the state’s interest payment obligation to the federal government. For forecast purposes, we also do not assume that the General Fund interest obligation would be met in future years by creating new alternative funding sources or through special fund loans to the General Fund. We note, however, that pursuant to federal law and beginning in tax year 2011, the federal unemployment tax credit for which employers are eligible (up to 5.4 percentage points of the total 6 percent tax on employee wages up to $7,000) began to be reduced incrementally for each year that the state continues to have an outstanding federal loan to the UI Trust Fund. The increase in federal unemployment taxes paid by California employers due to the tax credit reduction—approximately $600 million in 2013 and $935 million in 2014—is used to make principal payments that reduce the federal loan balance. (The state, however, remains responsible to pay the interest payments on any outstanding loan balance.)\nThe FI$Cal project seeks to build an integrated financial information system for the state—in the areas of budgeting, accounting, procurement, and cash management—to replace the current fragmented and outdated systems. The FI$Cal project implemented the new financial information system within the first group of departments, as scheduled in July 2013, without incident. The project will continue to implement the system in a growing number of departments through subsequent deployments. The FI$Cal project is estimated to cost $617 million (all funds) and is planned to be fully implemented in July 2016.\nWe project that General Fund spending for FI$Cal will increase dramatically from $2 million in 2013–14 to $114 million in 2015–16, decrease to $80 million as the project comes to a close in 2016–17, and then transition towards a net savings in 2018–19 and 2019–20 as the recovery of federal funds over these two years outpaces maintenance and operation costs (estimated to be $16 million annually from the General Fund). The increase in General Fund contributions during the forecast period compensates for accelerated special fund contributions in prior years. The project is also expected to recover federal funds for some of the development costs, but not until the system is fully implemented and in use by federally funded programs.\n21st Century Project\nIn February 2013, the California Technology Agency (now the Department of Technology) suspended the 21st Century Project, an information technology effort by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) to replace the state’s aging human resources management and payroll systems. The state suspended the project because the initial pilot phase of the project was unable to issue accurate payroll. System errors included under– and over–compensation of wages, failure to issue payments to retirement accounts, and erroneous deductions related to employee insurance. At the same time, SCO terminated its contract with the project’s primary vendor, SAP Public Services Inc. To date, the state has spent over $266 million of the estimated $373 million total project costs.\nThe suspension of the 21st Century Project means that the state’s need for an updated human resources management and payroll system remains unmet. We expect that during the forecast period an assessment of the project will be conducted, which will inform a decision on how to proceed in addressing the state’s unmet need. While we expect General Fund expenditures for a modernized system during the forecast period, we assume no project costs in our forecast given the uncertainty surrounding that decision.\nGeneral Fund Debt–Service Costs Have Not Increased Significantly Since 2009–10. The state uses General Fund revenues to pay debt–service costs for principal and interest payments on two types of bonds used primarily to fund infrastructure—voter–approved general obligation bonds and lease–revenue bonds approved by the Legislature. We estimate that General Fund costs for debt service on these bonds will be $5.4 billion in 2013–14. While there has been some variation in costs in recent years, this amount is roughly equal to the annual costs for debt service since 2009–10. General Fund debt–service costs have not increased significantly over this period for a few reasons. Most notably, the Legislature and Governor enacted legislation to permanently offset some General Fund debt–service costs with transportation funds. In addition, legislation was enacted to offset some housing–related debt–service costs in 2011–12 through 2013–14 with proceeds from the National Mortgage Settlement. Additionally, the 2013–14 budget enabled UC to reissue under its own authority the lease–revenue bonds previously issued on its behalf by the state. This decreases the amount of debt service that is now backed by the state General Fund. Finally, the administration slowed the pace of bond sales over the last three years and refinanced some existing debt at lower interest rates.\nDebt Service Expected to Grow Modestly. Over the forecast period, General Fund debt service is projected to grow 5 percent annually, reaching $7.3 billion by 2019–20. Projections of debt–service costs depend primarily on the volume of future bond sales, their interest rates, and their maturity structures. The exact timing of bond sales depends upon when various programs will need bond funds and the accessibility of financial and credit markets. During the entire forecast period, we assume that a total of about $33 billion of already authorized general obligation and lease–revenue bonds will be sold as currently approved projects move forward. A large share of this—about $25 billion—is from the nearly $54 billion in infrastructure bonds authorized by voters in 2006 and 2008. We also expect that transportation debt–service costs will exceed available transportation funds during the forecast period and the General Fund will pay the remaining costs. Our forecast is based on the expected sale of bonds that have already been authorized—that is, it does not include any additional bonds that may be authorized by the voters or Legislature during the forecast period (such as the water bond scheduled for the November 2014 ballot).\nDebt–Service Ratio (DSR) Expected to Remain Just Under 6 Percent. The DSR for general obligation and lease–revenue bonds—that is, the ratio of annual General Fund debt–service costs to annual General Fund revenues and transfers—is often used as one indicator of the state’s debt burden. There is no one “right” level for the DSR. The higher it is and more rapidly it rises, however, the more closely bond raters, financial analysts, and investors tend to look at the state’s debt practices and the more debt–service expenses limit the use of revenues for other programs. Figure 6 shows what California’s DSR has been in the recent past and our DSR projections for the forecast period. We estimate that the DSR will remain just under 6 percent throughout the forecast period. This is because General Fund debt service and General Fund revenues are expected to grow at similar rates. To the extent additional bonds are authorized and sold in future years beyond those already approved, the state’s debt–service costs and DSR would be higher than projected in Figure 6.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

Here's who they are\nThe nominees make up the richest presidential administration in modern history.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has assembled the wealthiest presidential administration in modern history, with at least 13 billionaires set to take on government posts.\nThey include a wrestling magnate, a private space pioneer, a New York real estate developer, the heir to a small appliance empire, and the wealthiest man on the planet -- with several being donors and close personal friends of the incoming president.\nIn total, the combined net worth of the wealthiest members of his administration could surpass $460 billion, including Department of Government Efficiency co-head Elon Musk -- whose net worth of more than $400 billion exceeds the GDP of mid-sized countries.\nEven discounting Musk, Trump's cabinet is still expected to be the wealthiest in history, with reported billionaires Howard Lutnick nominated as commerce secretary, Linda McMahon nominated as education secretary, and Scott Bessent nominated as treasury secretary. Together, Trump's expected cabinet is worth at least $7 billion.\nTrump's ambassador picks also include several billionaires, including financier Warren Stephens, who has been tapped to serve as the ambassador to the United Kingdom, Conair executive Leandro Rizzuto Jr., tapped to serve as the ambassador to the Organization of American States, Charles Kushner, named the ambassador to France, and Tom Barrack, named the ambassador to Turkey.\n\"It's not a surprise that [Trump] surrounds himself with people who come from the same world that he does,\" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"The billionaire class of businessmen is who he is and who he wants to be seen as, and who he wants to be seen with.\"\nThe wealth of Trump's current cabinet rivals only that of his first-term cabinet -- which had a combined net worth of $3.2 billion -- and dwarfs the $118 million combined net worth of President Joe Biden's cabinet.\nDuring Trump's first term, his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, boasted the highest net worth, with Forbes estimating it to be roughly $2 billion. In contrast, the wealthiest official in the Biden administration is White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, whose disclosures from 2021 showed his net worth ranging between $90 million and $443 million.\nWhile it's common for people with careers in business to serve in government, watchdog groups told ABC News that ultra-rich individuals with complex financial backgrounds and previous business dealings raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\n\"Being wealthy by itself is not a disqualifier,\" said Kedric Payne, senior director of Ethics at Campaign Legal Center, formerly deputy chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics. \"It's just simply the potential conflicts of interest that are the concern.\"\n\"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First,\" Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told ABC News. \"President Trump will continue to appoint highly-qualified men and women who have the talent, experience, and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again.\"\nUnder federal ethics laws, Trump's wealthy nominees and appointees will have to divest themselves of stock holdings that could raise conflict issues, and will be required to release their financial disclosures. It's not yet clear if Musk and Ramaswamy will fall under the disclosure requirements, due to their DOGE positions being described as \"outside\" of the government -- despite the potentially massive impact they could have on the government.\n\"Luckily, there are laws in place that address this specific problem, and they're typically enforced,\" Payne said.\nThe Office of Government Ethics will review presidential nominees and appointees' assets and financial interests before the Senate confirmation process, and provide advice on how to avoid conflicts of interests if they are confirmed, according to Payne.\nHere are the Trump administration's wealthiest members and how much they're reportedly worth.\nElon Musk, Department of Government Efficiency co-head: $439 billion\nMusk is the world's richest person, with his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and artificial intelligence startup xAI making him worth over $400 billion, according to Forbes.

Forbes estimated the family's net worth at approximately $3.5 billion in 2017.\nRizzuto briefly served as Trump's principal officer at the U.S. Consulate General in Bermuda in 2020 after his 2018 nomination to be ambassador to Barbados failed in the Senate.\nWarren Stephens, Ambassador to the United Kingdom: $3.4 billion\nStephens has spent his entire career with his family's Little Rock-based investment bank, becoming the firm's CEO and president in 1986.\nHe spent $2 million in 2016 to support a group that aimed to stop Trump from winning the Republican nomination, but donated to Trump in the 2020 presidential race, and eventually supported Trump 2024 election after initially throwing his support behind other Republican candidates.\nLinda McMahon, Education Secretary: Up to $3 billion\nMcMahon, with her husband Vince McMahon, founded the company that later became World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. Under her leadership, WWE became the world's largest wrestling entertainment company, with Vince McMahon worth over $3 billion in 2024. The McMahons have since separated, and it's unclear how much of the company Linda owns individually.\nA Trump supporter, she was the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term in office.\nHoward Lutnick, Commerce Secretary: $2.2 billion\nLutnick, who has been tapped to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm he joined in 1983. The billionaire businessman has led the investment first since 1991 and owns about 60% of the company, according to Bloomberg.\nCharles Kushner, Ambassador to France: $1.8 billion\nKushner is a real estate developer who made his fortune building thousands of residential units across New Jersey. In 2005, Kushner was sentenced to 24 months in prison after pleading guilty to multiple felonies, including making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, assisting in the filing of a false tax return, and retaliating against a cooperation witness.\nDuring his plea hearing, he admitted to retaliating against his sister for cooperating with law enforcement by having a prostitute seduce her husband and covertly film them having sex.\nAfter serving his sentence, Kushner made a series of successful investments in the New York real estate market, including the purchase of a midtown skyscraper for nearly $2 billion. He was subsequently pardoned by Trump at the end of Trump's first term.\nHis son Jared Kushner is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, and the Kushner family's overall net worth is approximately $1.8 billion according to Forbes.\nJared Isaacman, NASA Administrator: $1.8 billion\nIsaacman is a pioneer in private space exploration who made his fortune by founding the payment processing company Shift4 Payments.\nIn addition to his stake in Shift4 -- which processes a third of the customer payments made to American hotels and restaurants -- Issacman sold his tactical aircraft company Draken International, LLC, to the investment company Blackstone for a reported nine-figure sum.\nThomas Barrack Jr., Ambassador to Turkey: $1 billion\nIn 1991, Barrack founded the private equity real estate firm Colony Capital, which now manages more than $80 billion as DigitalBridge Group.\nA close friend of the president-elect, Barrack chaired Trump's first inaugural committee and in 2022 was acquitted of federal charges accusing him of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.\nSteven Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East: $1 billion\nAfter first meeting Donald Trump in a New York deli in the 1980s, Witkoff climbed New York's real estate ladder alongside Trump, ultimately building a personal fortune of a billion dollars.\nWitkoff has remained close to Trump for decades, testifying as an expert witness at his New York civil fraud trial in defense of the former president, and golfing with Trump during his second assassination attempt in September. Despite his limited experience in foreign affairs, Witkoff was named Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East.\nFrank Bisiganano, Social Security Administration Commissioner: $1 billion\nBisiganano was one of JPMorgan Chase's most influential executives during the 2008 recession, before taking over the financial services company First Data Corporation. Bisiganano became the CEO of Fiserv -- a leading financial technology firm -- when the company bought First Data in 2019. A hefty executive compensation package -- more than $100 million in 2017 -- and his stake in the company contributed to his net worth exceeding $1 billion, according to Fortune.\nScott Bessent, Treasury Secretary: Reported billionaire\nA protege of Democratic megadonor George Soros, Bessent worked as the chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management before founding his own firm, Key Square Group. Bessent developed a reputation for bold bets on macroeconomic trends, including making more than a billion dollars by betting against the British pound in the 1990s, followed by a similar trade against the Japanese yen in 2013 that netted more than a billion dollars in profits.\nAt one point, Bessent's Key Square Group managed more than $5 billion.\nDuring the campaign cycle, Bessent was a major fundraiser and emerged as a key economic adviser to Trump.\nVivek Ramaswamy, Department of Government Efficiency co-head: $1 billion\nRamaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and 2024 presidential candidate, made his fortune through his 10% stake in Roivant Sciences, a biotech company he founded in 2014.

Roosevelt was elected President of the United States four times: 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944. Prior to the third-term election of 1940, it was a presidential tradition set by George Washington that presidents only held the office for two terms. As a result of FDR's unprecedented four terms, the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1951, limiting all future presidents to two elected terms.\nWho were FDR's opponents?\nFDR's Republican Party opponents during the four presidential elections were: 1932, President Herbert Hoover; 1936, Governor Alfred M. Landon of Kansas; 1940, Wendell L. Wilkie of Ohio; 1944, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York.\nWhen was FDR first inaugurated as President of the United States ?\nFDR was first inaugurated as 32nd President on March 4, 1933. The date of March 4 was set by the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Effective in 1937, however, the presidential inauguration date was changed to January 20 by the 20th Amendment.\nWho were FDR's Vice Presidents?\nFDR had three Vice-Presidents during his four terms in office: John Nance Garner of Texas (March 4, 1933 - January 20, 1941), Henry Agard Wallace of Iowa (January 20, 1941 - January 20, 1945), and Harry S. Truman of Missouri (January 20, 1945 - April 12, 1945).\nWho were FDR's Cabinet Officers?\nFDR's Cabinet Officers were as follows:\nSecretary of State\nCordell Hull, 1933-1944\nEdward R.

He considered it most effective to talk to the people as if he had joined them in their living rooms or kitchens for a relaxed, informal conversation about one or two specific topics. The term \"Fireside Chat\" was not coined by FDR, but rather was used by a reporter to describe FDR's speech of May 7, 1933. The term was quickly adopted throughout the media and by FDR. There was no solid definition as to what constituted a Fireside Chat. As a result, there is some dispute as to the total number of Fireside Chats that FDR delivered.\nThe following is a list of the thirty-one speeches that have been identified as Fireside Chats:\n* WH= White House HP= Hyde Park\n1.

Roosevelt:\nFrances Perkins, New York: First woman member of a President's Cabinet. Secretary of Labor.\nRuth Bryan Owen Rohde, New York and Florida: First woman U.S Minister.

Conference of Food and Agriculture.\nWhat was the Good Neighbor Policy?\nThe Good Neighbor Policy was the common name (first expressed in the First Inaugural Address in 1933) for FDR's foreign policy with regard to Latin America. Under the new policy, the United States pledged that it would treat Latin American nations with respect and avoid intervening in their foreign and domestic affairs.\nThe goal of the policy was to strengthen the United States economy by increasing trade with Latin America. A necessary prerequisite to increased trade was the improvement of political relations with those countries and the assurance that the United States would no longer interfere in the affairs of its neighbors. As a by-product of the policy, all Latin American countries eventually joined the United States in the war against the Axis Powers.\nWhat was FDR's role in establishing the United Nations?\nEven as the United States was moving closer to war, FDR began to formulate his ideas for a post-war world. FDR first discussed a \"family of nations\" with Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the Atlantic Charter conference in August 1941. In January 1942, representatives of 26 nations met in Washington, DC and signed the United Nations Declaration that pledged to win the war against the Axis Powers. FDR suggested the name \"United Nations\" for the group, and in October 1943 he sent representatives to Moscow to begin preliminary discussions with their counterparts from the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and China about the structure of a world political organization.\nAt the Yalta Conference in February 1945, FDR, Churchill and Premier Stalin of the Soviet Union agreed that the \"Big Five\" nations (United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France and China) would be permanent members of a United Nations Security Council, a special committee with powers to keep the peace. The leaders also agreed to call a conference in San Francisco, California on April 25, 1945 to prepare a Charter for the new organization. FDR planned to attend the opening of the San Francisco Conference, but he died in Warm Springs, Georgia, on April 12, 1945. Despite this loss, the San Francisco Conference reached final agreement, and delegates from fifty nations signed the Charter on June 26, 1945.\nOn October 24, 1945 the Big Five plus one-half of the other nations had ratified the Charter, and the United Nations was officially born.\nWas there ever an assassination attempt on FDR?\nThere was never an assassination attempt on FDR after he was inaugurated President of the United States. However, after the presidential election of 1932, and before the inauguration in March 1933, FDR nearly lost his life to an assassin's bullet.\nOn February 15, 1933, FDR was in Miami, Florida at a public rally accompanied by Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago. Joseph Zangara, a thirty-three year old disillusioned Italian immigrant jumped onto a park bench and fired four shots towards FDR's car. FDR was not hit, but Mayor Cermak was wounded mortally and died a few weeks later.\nThe public and press hailed FDR's courage in refusing to allow his driver to leave the scene before first attending to the wounded Mayor Cermak and driving him to the hospital. Zangara later stated that he did not hate FDR personally, but rather he hated all government officials and all rich people no matter from which country they came. Zangara was executed for the murder of Mayor Cermak.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Targeting Election Officials and Civil Society\nThe Trump administration, falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, has already targeted organizations and individuals it sees as adverse with baseless or inappropriate retaliatory actions. It now threatens to do the same with certain election officials, civic groups that mobilize voters, and other individuals and entities that protect elections and the rule of law. These kinds of actions can be tools of retribution, intimidation, or coercion.\nWeaponizing Federal Agencies\nA set of new federal task forces — the DOJ’s Weaponization Working Group, the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office Election Integrity Task Force, and the Washington, D.C., Attorney’s Office Special Unit: Election Accountability — establish a federal law enforcement approach to elections focused on targeting voters, election officials, perceived political adversaries, and journalists. The task forces devote resources to search for supposedly widespread voter fraud — a problem that doesn’t exist — and sanction political targeting.\n“They are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.”\nPolitical appointees who have spread falsehoods about the outcome of the 2020 election, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, and FBI Director Kash Patel, have empowered and enabled these task forces. Bondi, Dhillon, and Patel have also made clear they are willing to use the federal government to investigate and prosecute people they claim are responsible for supposed election fraud. Patel has stated, “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections — we’re going to come after you.” Bondi, in one of her first actions as attorney general, created the Weaponization Working Group, whose purpose is to “review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” The administration has instructed the group to investigate some of the president’s perceived enemies, including former Special Counsel Jack Smith and his staff for investigating the January 6 riots, the Manhattan district attorney and the New York state attorney general for their involvement in the prosecution of Trump and his businesses, and anyone who investigated or prosecuted the January 6 rioters.\nImpact: During President Trump’s first term in office, federal agencies and departments occasionally served as a restraint on his unlawful actions. For example, when the president asked the attorney general to seize voting machines after his 2020 election loss, then Attorney General Bill Barr refused. But in his second term, the president’s picks may not hold the line in the same way. Rather, they are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.\nWhy It’s Wrong: The DOJ can and should prosecute fraud in U.S. elections, but these task forces are premised on the false notions that U.S. elections are rigged and that there’s rampant voter fraud. Rather than ensuring election integrity, these task forces undermine it, part of the department’s serious shift away from protecting voting rights.\nStatus: The Constitution and the law serve as a limit on what these political appointees can do. Indeed, courts have already struck down this administration’s attempts to subvert the law. For example, multiple courts have found that the president’s executive orders targeting law firms violate the First Amendment, and two courts have preliminarily stopped the president from unlawfully trying to direct an independent, bipartisan agency to add a citizenship document requirement to the federal voter registration form.\nPenalizing Law Firms\nThe president issued executive orders revoking the federal security clearances of six law firms and prohibiting the federal government from contracting with them. These firms had been involved in litigation protecting voting rights and are associated with people who challenged the January 6 attack on the Capitol, attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and election interference in 2016. The president specifically cited these associations as justification for targeting the firms. For example, the Paul Weiss order was based in part on the firm employing a lawyer who brought a lawsuit against an individual who had participated in the January 6 insurrection. The Perkins Coie order provided that the firm had represented a political opponent of the president, brought challenges to restrictive voter ID laws that made it harder for eligible citizens to vote, and, as the court enjoining the order stated, brought “election-related lawsuits . . . challenging actions supported by the president or his campaign.” Jenner & Block was targeted because it employed Andrew Weissman, who, as the court enjoining the order stated, “drew presidential disdain” for criticizing the president and participating “in a legitimate investigation of election interference” — that is, the investigation and prosecution of the president’s campaign team for crimes related to foreign interference in the 2016 election. The association with Weissman “extended that disdain to the firm,” the court added. And Covington & Burling, according to the executive order, “assisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith.” The firm had provided Smith with free legal advice when he was investigating the January 6 riots.\nImpact: By targeting law firms for providing legal services — including free legal services — to causes the administration disapproves of, including protecting the freedom to vote, the orders have had a chilling effect on firms, including those that have not been directly targeted, diminishing the legal resources available to Americans whose voting rights have been violated. To some extent, the nonprofit sector and state attorneys general have stepped up to provide needed legal support, but gaps remain. This chilling effect extends beyond law firms. For instance, it may compel prosecutors to avoid pursuing charges against election interference. And the administration’s attempt to punish some of the most powerful and well-resourced legal institutions in the country sends a potent message to anyone considering taking a position the administration may oppose.\nWhy It’s Wrong: As multiple courts have found, these actions are illegal. The First Amendment prohibits government officials from retaliating against protected speech or association, including retaliating against law firms that represent or offer legal services to those engaged in protected speech or association whom the president happens to disfavor.\nStatus: Four of the targeted law firms challenged their respective executive orders, and judges have permanently blocked the orders for violating the First Amendment. Despite the clear illegality of the orders, nine firms have entered into agreements with the administration. As part of those agreements, these firms said they would provide free legal services for causes that the president approves of.\nThreatening Election Officials and Nonprofits\nThe president and his DOJ appointees have repeatedly threatened to prosecute the election officials who administered the 2020 election. In a March 14, 2025, speech, President Trump stated, “What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.” The president has also threatened to target nonprofit advocacy groups that play an important role in voter engagement, election monitoring, and litigation to protect the freedom to vote.\nThese threats roughly track a proposal in Project 2025, the controversial conservative policy agenda created by the Heritage Foundation, to prosecute people who protected the 2020 election with federal crimes. Project 2025 proposed charging election officials with criminal conspiracy to injure civil rights for their alleged misapplication of state law to help voters cast ballots during the 2020 election.\n“Federal and state law prohibits anyone, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote.”\nThe extent to which the administration will follow through on that plan is unclear, but it has already begun to target officials involved in protecting the 2020 election and build an infrastructure of task forces and working groups that heightens the threat of criminal prosecution. In one executive order, the president directed the DOJ to review the actions of Chris Krebs, whom the president appointed to lead the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2018, because he “denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.”\nIn addition to its Weaponization Working Group, the DOJ is reportedly exploring ways to criminally charge election officials for failing to maintain proper cybersecurity — based not on evidence but on assumptions driven by false claims of rampant voter fraud.\nImpact: Criminal investigations and prosecutions would impose a severe personal and financial toll on election officials or nonprofit employees for simply doing their jobs to help keep elections free and fair. But beyond that, the harms that stem from targeting the officials and civil society groups that make our elections work are manifold.\nEven if the administration never charges any officials, the threat alone of criminal investigation or prosecution will likely exacerbate the exodus of election officials from their jobs. In 2024 33 percent of local election officials knew at least one colleague who resigned at least in part due to fear for their safety, of increased threats, or of intimidation; 21 percent stated that they were unlikely to continue serving in their role for the 2026 midterms. In 2025 59 percent of officials reported fear of political interference in their ability to do their jobs. And 46 percent were very or somewhat concerned about potential politically motivated investigations of themselves or their peers. Ultimately the drain of experienced officials from U.S. elections will hurt voters.\nThe threat of criminal investigation may also prompt civil society organizations to retreat from their work to engage voters. When Florida recently passed a law threatening organizations conducting voter registration drives with civil and criminal penalties for violating a slew of new restrictive regulations, some organizations curtailed their work or stopped registering voters altogether.\nThe administration may also use the threat of criminal prosecution to pressure election officials to comply with unreasonable or unlawful requests. It may already be engaging in similar quid pro quo arrangements, as evidenced when the DOJ dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the spring of 2025. Though the court ultimately ordered the case dismissed with prejudice (i.e., barring a future claim on the same facts), the DOJ had sought dismissal without prejudice, which would have left open the opportunity for the case to be refiled at a later time, and thus would have allowed the DOJ to hold the threat of prosecution over Adams should he not acquiesce to any requests the administration may make. The U.S. attorney responsible for the prosecution, who had been appointed by the president, resigned in protest, alleging that the decision was motivated by a desire to procure political cooperation from Adams on unrelated matters.\nAn election official fearful of criminal charges might succumb to pressure to aggressively purge voters from the rolls or to engage in outright election subversion. When the president tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election, he and his associates put pressure on state and local election officials — including, famously, in a phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — to assist his efforts. Raffensperger and other officials refused to subvert the results, but an election official facing the prospect of prosecution now might not take the same principled stand.\nWhy It’s Wrong: Threats of criminal charges based on lies about the 2020 election have no legal or factual basis. There is no evidence that the 2020 election was tainted by any kind of fraud or impropriety in election administration. Project 2025 proposes to use a law designed to protect civil rights, including the right to vote, to prosecute state officials for aiding in the exercise of that right, a legal theory that will likely struggle in court.\nThe First Amendment protects election officials and pro-voter groups from retaliation based on their speech and association, just as it protects the speech and association of law firms. If the administration targets officials or groups for publicly declaring elections to be legitimate, safe, and secure or for registering and engaging voters, the targets may be able to block any investigation or prosecution in court before it proceeds, just as those law firms have succeeded in blocking the executive orders leveled at them.\nMoreover, federal and state law prohibits anyone, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote. And though voters rarely do so, they are able to sue DOJ officials under anti-intimidation law in federal court.\nStatus: Thus far these threats have remained just that. For example, DOJ lawyers tasked with finding ways to prosecute election officials for allegedly failing to maintain proper cybersecurity are reportedly struggling to find any criminal statute that will allow them to do so.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The labor market is on a job-creating streak that has rung up more than 110 months straight of employment growth, a record for the post-World War II era. The unemployment rate in November 2019 was 3.5%, a level not seen since the 1960s. Gains on the jobs front are also reflected in household incomes, which have rebounded in recent years.\nBut not all economic indicators appear promising. Household incomes have grown only modestly in this century, and household wealth has not returned to its pre-recession level. Economic inequality, whether measured through the gaps in income or wealth between richer and poorer households, continues to widen.\nHousehold incomes are growing again after a lengthy period of stagnation\nWith periodic interruptions due to business cycle peaks and troughs, the incomes of American households overall have trended up since 1970. In 2018, the median income of U.S. households stood at $74,600.5 This was 49% higher than its level in 1970, when the median income was $50,200.6 (Incomes are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\nBut the overall trend masks two distinct episodes in the evolution of household incomes (the first lasting from 1970 to 2000 and the second from 2000 to 2018) and in how the gains were distributed.\nMost of the increase in household income was achieved in the period from 1970 to 2000. In these three decades, the median income increased by 41%, to $70,800, at an annual average rate of 1.2%. From 2000 to 2018, the growth in household income slowed to an annual average rate of only 0.3%. If there had been no such slowdown and incomes had continued to increase in this century at the same rate as from 1970 to 2000, the current median U.S. household income would be about $87,000, considerably higher than its actual level of $74,600.\nThe shortfall in household income is attributable in part to two recessions since 2000. The first recession, lasting from March 2001 to November 2001, was relatively short-lived.7 Yet household incomes were slow to recover from the 2001 recession and it was not until 2007 that the median income was restored to about its level in 2000.\nBut 2007 also marked the onset of the Great Recession, and that delivered another blow to household incomes. This time it took until 2015 for incomes to approach their pre-recession level. Indeed, the median household income in 2015 – $70,200 – was no higher than its level in 2000, marking a 15-year period of stagnation, an episode of unprecedented duration in the past five decades.8\nMore recent trends in household income suggest that the effects of the Great Recession may finally be in the past. From 2015 to 2018, the median U.S. household income increased from $70,200 to $74,600, at an annual average rate of 2.1%. This is substantially greater than the average rate of growth from 1970 to 2000 and more in line with the economic expansion in the 1980s and the dot-com bubble era of the late 1990s.\nWhy economic inequality matters\nAlternative estimates of economic inequality\nUpper-income households have seen more rapid growth in income in recent decades\nThe growth in income in recent decades has tilted to upper-income households. At the same time, the U.S. middle class, which once comprised the clear majority of Americans, is shrinking. Thus, a greater share of the nation’s aggregate income is now going to upper-income households and the share going to middle- and lower-income households is falling.9\nThe share of American adults who live in middle-income households has decreased from 61% in 1971 to 51% in 2019. This downsizing has proceeded slowly but surely since 1971, with each decade thereafter typically ending with a smaller share of adults living in middle-income households than at the beginning of the decade.\nThe decline in the middle-class share is not a total sign of regression. From 1971 to 2019, the share of adults in the upper-income tier increased from 14% to 20%. Meanwhile, the share in the lower-income tier increased from 25% to 29%. On balance, there was more movement up the income ladder than down the income ladder.\nBut middle-class incomes have not grown at the rate of upper-tier incomes. From 1970 to 2018, the median middle-class income increased from $58,100 to $86,600, a gain of 49%.10 This was considerably less than the 64% increase for upper-income households, whose median income increased from $126,100 in 1970 to $207,400 in 2018. Households in the lower-income tier experienced a gain of 43%, from $20,000 in 1970 to $28,700 in 2018. (Incomes are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\nMore tepid growth in the income of middle-class households and the reduction in the share of households in the middle-income tier led to a steep fall in the share of U.S. aggregate income held by the middle class. From 1970 to 2018, the share of aggregate income going to middle-class households fell from 62% to 43%. Over the same period, the share held by upper-income households increased from 29% to 48%. The share flowing to lower-income households inched down from 10% in 1970 to 9% in 2018.\nThese trends in income reflect the growth in economic inequality overall in the U.S. in the decades since 1980.\nIncome growth has been most rapid for the top 5% of families\nEven among higher-income families, the growth in income has favored those at the top. Since 1980, incomes have increased faster for the most affluent families – those in the top 5% – than for families in the income strata below them. This disparity in outcomes is less pronounced in the wake of the Great Recession but shows no signs of reversing.\nFrom 1981 to 1990, the change in mean family income ranged from a loss of 0.1% annually for families in the lowest quintile (the bottom 20% of earners) to a gain of 2.1% annually for families in the highest quintile (the top 20%). The top 5% of families, who are part of the highest quintile, fared even better – their income increased at the rate of 3.2% annually from 1981 to 1990. Thus, the 1980s marked the beginning of a long and steady rise in income inequality.\nA similar pattern prevailed in the 1990s, with even sharper growth in income at the top. From 1991 to 2000, the mean income of the top 5% of families grew at an annual average rate of 4.1%, compared with 2.7% for families in the highest quintile overall, and about 1% or barely more for other families.\nThe period from 2001 to 2010 is unique in the post-WWII era. Families in all strata experienced a loss in income in this decade, with those in the poorer strata experiencing more pronounced losses. The pattern in income growth from 2011 to 2018 is more balanced than the previous three decades, with gains more broadly shared across poorer and better-off families. Nonetheless, income growth remains tilted to the top, with families in the top 5% experiencing greater gains than other families since 2011.\nThe wealth of American families is currently no higher than its level two decades ago\nOther than income, the wealth of a family is a key indicator of its financial security. Wealth, or net worth, is the value of assets owned by a family, such as a home or a savings account, minus outstanding debt, such as a mortgage or student loan. Accumulated over time, wealth is a source of retirement income, protects against short-term economic shocks, and provides security and social status for future generations.\nThe period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s was beneficial for the wealth portfolios of American families overall. Housing prices more than doubled in this period, and stock values tripled.11 As a result, the median net worth of American families climbed from $94,700 in 1995 to $146,600 in 2007, a gain of 55%.12 (Figures are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\nBut the run up in housing prices proved to be a bubble that burst in 2006. Home prices plunged starting in 2006, triggering the Great Recession in 2007 and dragging stock prices into a steep fall as well. Consequently, the median net worth of families fell to $87,800 by 2013, a loss of 40% from the peak in 2007. As of 2016, the latest year for which data are available, the typical American family had a net worth of $101,800, still less than what it held in 1998.\nThe wealth divide among upper-income families and middle- and lower-income families is sharp and rising\nThe wealth gap among upper-income families and middle- and lower-income families is sharper than the income gap and is growing more rapidly.\nThe period from 1983 to 2001 was relatively prosperous for families in all income tiers, but one of rising inequality. The median wealth of middle-income families increased from $102,000 in 1983 to $144,600 in 2001, a gain of 42%. The net worth of lower-income families increased from $12,3oo in 1983 to $20,600 in 2001, up 67%. Even so, the gains for both lower- and middle-income families were outdistanced by upper-income families, whose median wealth increased by 85% over the same period, from $344,100 in 1983 to $636,000 in 2001. (Figures are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\nThe wealth gap between upper-income and lower- and middle-income families has grown wider this century. Upper-income families were the only income tier able to build on their wealth from 2001 to 2016, adding 33% at the median. On the other hand, middle-income families saw their median net worth shrink by 20% and lower-income families experienced a loss of 45%. As of 2016, upper-income families had 7.4 times as much wealth as middle-income families and 75 times as much wealth as lower-income families. These ratios are up from 3.4 and 28 in 1983, respectively.\nThe reason for this is that middle-income families are more dependent on home equity as a source of wealth than upper-income families, and the bursting of the housing bubble in 2006 had more of an impact on their net worth. Upper-income families, who derive a larger share of their wealth from financial market assets and business equity, were in a better position to benefit from a relatively quick recovery in the stock market once the recession ended.\nAs with the distribution of aggregate income, the share of U.S. aggregate wealth held by upper-income families is on the rise. From 1983 to 2016, the share of aggregate wealth going to upper-income families increased from 60% to 79%. Meanwhile, the share held by middle-income families has been cut nearly in half, falling from 32% to 17%. Lower-income families had only 4% of aggregate wealth in 2016, down from 7% in 1983.\nThe richest are getting richer faster\nThe richest families in the U.S. have experienced greater gains in wealth than other families in recent decades, a trend that reinforces the growing concentration of financial resources at the top.\nThe tilt to the top was most acute in the period from 1998 to 2007. In that period, the median net worth of the richest 5% of U.S. families increased from $2.5 million to $4.6 million, a gain of 88%.\nThis was nearly double the 45% increase in the wealth of the top 20% of families overall, a group that includes the richest 5%. Meanwhile, the net worth of families in the second quintile, one tier above the poorest 20%, increased by only 16%, from $27,700 in 1998 to $32,100 in 2007. (Figures are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\nThe wealthiest families are also the only ones to have experienced gains in wealth in the years after the start of the Great Recession in 2007. From 2007 to 2016, the median net worth of the richest 20% increased 13%, to $1.2 million. For the top 5%, it increased by 4%, to $4.8 million. In contrast, the net worth of families in lower tiers of wealth decreased by at least 20% from 2007 to 2016. The greatest loss – 39% – was experienced by the families in the second quintile of wealth, whose wealth fell from $32,100 in 2007 to $19,500 in 2016.\nAs a result, the wealth gap between America’s richest and poorer families more than doubled from 1989 to 2016. In 1989, the richest 5% of families had 114 times as much wealth as families in the second quintile, $2.3 million compared with $20,300. By 2016, this ratio had increased to 248, a much sharper rise than the widening gap in income.13\nIncome inequality in the U.S has increased since 1980 and is greater than in peer countries\nIncome inequality may be measured in a number of ways, but no matter the measure, economic inequality in the U.S. is seen to be on the rise.\nOne widely used measure – the 90/10 ratio – takes the ratio of the income needed to rank among the top 10% of earners in the U.S. (the 90th percentile) to the income at the threshold of the bottom 10% of earners (the 10th percentile). In 1980, the 90/10 ratio in the U.S. stood at 9.1, meaning that households at the top had incomes about nine times the incomes of households at the bottom. The ratio increased in every decade since 1980, reaching 12.6 in 2018, an increase of 39%.14\nNot only is income inequality rising in the U.S., it is higher than in other advanced economies. Comparisons of income inequality across countries are often based on the Gini coefficient, another commonly used measure of inequality.15 Ranging from 0 to 1, or from perfect equality to complete inequality, the Gini coefficient in the U.S. stood at 0.434 in 2017, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).16 This was higher than in any other of the G-7 countries, in which the Gini ranged from 0.326 in France to 0.392 in the UK, and inching closer to the level of inequality observed in India (0.495). More globally, the Gini coefficient of inequality ranges from lows of about 0.25 in Eastern European countries to highs in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 in countries in southern Africa, according to World Bank estimates.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        ERS provides information on a range of farm labor issues, including:\n- Size and composition of the U.S. agricultural workforce (self-employed versus hired)\n- Recent trends in the employment of hired farmworkers\n- Demographic characteristics of hired farmworkers – including age, sex, and nativity\n- Wages of hired farmworkers\n- Labor cost share of total gross revenues\n- H-2A temporary agricultural program\n- Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR)\n- Legal status and migration practices of hired farmworkers (crop agriculture only)\nFinally, we provide links to key data sources with summaries.\nSize and Composition of the U.S. Agricultural Workforce\nThe U.S. agricultural workforce has long consisted of two groups of workers: (1) self- employed farm operators and their family members, and (2) hired workers. From 1950 to 1990, employment in both groups of workers was in long-term decline, as mechanization contributed to rising agricultural productivity, thereby reducing the need for labor. Since 1990, however, employment levels have stabilized.\nThe reduction in self-employed and family labor through 1990 was more rapid than the decline in hired labor. According to the Farm Labor Survey (FLS) of USDA's National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS), the number of self-employed and family farmworkers declined from 7.60 million in 1950 to 2.06 million in 2000, a 73-percent reduction. Over this same period, the average annual employment of hired farmworkers (including on-farm support personnel and those who work for farm labor contractors) declined from 2.33 million to 1.13 million, a 51-percent reduction. As a result, the proportion of hired workers increased over this period.\nThe rest of this page describes the employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and other information for the hired farm labor force only. Information on the well-being of self-employed farmers and their families may be found on the ERS topic page on Farm Household Well-being.\nHired farmworkers play an essential role in U.S. agriculture, especially in labor-intensive agricultural industries, even though farmworkers make up less than 1 percent of all U.S. wage and salary workers. According to the 2022 Census of Agriculture, wages and salaries (plus contract labor costs) represented 42 percent of production expenses for greenhouse and nursery operations, and 40 percent for fruit and tree nut operations, compared with 12 percent for all farms.\nHired farmworkers are found in a variety of occupations—including field crop workers, nursery workers, livestock workers, graders and sorters, agricultural inspectors, supervisors, and hired farm managers. Most farmworkers are wage and salary workers, hired directly by farmers. However, some are employees of agricultural service companies—including farm labor contractors, custom harvest providers, and management service providers. Some industrywide employment estimates also include support personnel on farms—such as human resource managers, sales agents, and truck drivers.\nMany hired farmworkers in the United States were born in Mexico or Central America, with many lacking authorization to work legally in the United States. In recent years, farmworkers have become more settled, traveling shorter distances from home to work and are less likely to participate in seasonal, “follow-the-crop” migration. The number of young, recent immigrants working in agriculture has fallen, and as a result, the farm workforce is aging. Over the past 30 years, wages for hired farmworkers have gradually risen, both in real terms and in relation to wages for the average nonsupervisory worker in a nonfarm occupation.\nHired farmworkers are employed in both metropolitan (urban) and nonmetropolitan (rural) counties. The statistics presented here refer to farmworkers nationwide, unless otherwise indicated.\nRecent Trends in the Employment of Hired Farmworkers\nAccording to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), wage and salary employment in agriculture stabilized in the first decade of the 21st century and has gradually increased since 2010 (measured as the annual average number of full- and part-time jobs). Notably, QCEW employment includes support industries such as farm labor contracting. Employment rose from 1.07 million in 2010 to 1.18 million in 2024, a gain of 10 percent.\nFrom 2010 to 2024, employment increases were highest in crop-support services (which added about 48,400 jobs, a 17-percent increase) and the livestock sector (which added about 42,000 jobs, a 19-percent increase). It should be noted that the QCEW is based on unemployment insurance records, not on surveys of farms or households. As a result, the QCEW does not cover smaller farm employers in those States that exempt such employers from participating in the unemployment insurance system. However, other data sources (such as the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey) also find rising farm employment since the turn of the 21st century.\nDemographic Characteristics of Hired Farmworkers\nDemographic information on farmworkers can be found in the American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. These data allow us to distinguish among farm laborers, managers/supervisors, and other occupations. Farm laborers have lower levels of educational attainment, are slightly younger, are more likely to be Hispanic of Mexican origin, and are less likely to be U.S. citizens than both workers in other agricultural occupations and the U.S. wage and salary workforce as a whole.\n| Item | Farm laborers, graders and sorters | Farm managers, inspectors, and supervisors | All other occupations in agriculture | Agriculture: All occupations | All U.S. private wage and salary workers |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Percent female | 26 | 17 | 35 | 27 | 44 |\n| Average age in years | 39.6 | 42.4 | 42.3 | 40.8 | 40.5 |\n| Percent under age 25 | 20 | 11 | 15 | 17 | 18 |\n| Percent over age 44 | 39 | 43 | 45 | 41 | 41 |\n| Percent married | 48 | 64 | 55 | 53 | 48 |\n| Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry | |||||\n| Percent White, not Hispanic | 31 | 63 | 62 | 46 | 57 |\n| Percent Black, not Hispanic | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 11 |\n| Percent other, not Hispanic | 4 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 11 |\n| Percent Hispanic: Mexican origin | 55 | 23 | 23 | 40 | 12 |\n| Percent Hispanic: Other | 8 | 6 | 5 | 7 | 8 |\n| Percent born in U.S. (includes Puerto Rico) | 46 | 76 | 79 | 61 | 81 |\n| Percent U.S. citizens | 56 | 83 | 87 | 70 | 91 |\n| Education | |||||\n| Percent lacking high school diploma | 44 | 17 | 15 | 31 | 8 |\n| Percent with high school diploma (includes equivalency) | 33 | 33 | 32 | 33 | 29 |\n| Percent with at least some college | 22 | 50 | 52 | 36 | 63 |\n| Note: This table counts all private sector wage and salary workers employed in the crop, livestock, and agricultural support industries. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service analysis of data from U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, American Community Survey, 2022. |\nDifferences in demographics are also evident between crop and livestock workers (not shown in the table). A larger share of laborers in crops and related support industries are female (28 percent versus 20 percent in livestock). Crop laborers are also less likely to be non-Hispanic White (26 percent versus 49 percent for livestock) and less likely to have been born in the United States (41 percent for crop workers in manual labor occupations versus 65 percent for manual labor livestock workers). Finally, crop laborers have lower levels of educational attainment: 47 percent lack a high school degree, compared with 34 percent in livestock.\nNotably, the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) (discussed below) finds larger shares of foreign-born, Hispanic, and less-educated employees among crop and support workers than does the ACS (livestock workers are not surveyed in NAWS). For example (according to NAWS estimates spanning fiscal years 2020–22), just 32 percent of crop farmworkers in manual labor occupations were U.S. born, compared with 41 percent in the 2022 ACS.\nThe Hired Farm Workforce Is Aging\nAs fewer young immigrants are entering into agriculture, the average age of foreign-born farmworkers has risen, pulling up the average for the farm workforce as a whole. Between 2006 and 2022, the average age of foreign-born farmworkers rose by close to 7 years. In contrast, the average age for U.S.-born farmworkers remained roughly constant over this period.\nWomen Are an Increasing Share of the Hired Farm Workforce\nThe share of farmworkers who are women declined from 20.3 percent to 18.6 percent between 2006 and 2009 and then climbed to 26.4 percent in 2022. The fact that the female share fell during the Great Recession and has risen during the economic recovery is consistent with men moving into agriculture as employment in the nonfarm economy declines and out of agriculture as nonfarm job prospects improve. The rising female share is also consistent with the fact that, as labor costs rise, some growers are adopting mechanical aids which facilitate more women and older workers in performing tasks that traditionally have been performed by younger men. Examples of such mechanical aids include hydraulic platforms that replace ladders in tree-fruit harvesting, and mobile conveyor belts that reduce the distance heavy loads must be carried.\nWages of Hired Farmworkers\nAccording to data from the FLS, real (inflation-adjusted) wages for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers (excluding contract labor) rose at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent per year between 1990 and 2024. In the past 10 years, however, real farm wages grew at 1.9 percent per year, consistent with growers' reports that workers had become harder to find.\nIn 1990, the average real-farm wage for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers was just over half the average real wage in the nonfarm economy for private-sector, nonsupervisory occupations ($12.05 versus $23.87, in 2024 dollars). By 2024, the farm wage equaled about 60 percent of the nonfarm wage ($18.12 versus $30.13). In other words, the gap between farm and nonfarm wages is still substantial, but it is slowly shrinking.\nWages for nonsupervisory occupations ranged from $17.23 for farm, ranch, and aquacultural farmworkers to $19.07 for equipment operators. For five out of the six nonsupervisory occupations, wages were more than 3 percent higher in 2024 than in 2023 (not adjusted for inflation).\nAverage hourly wages for hired agricultural managers stood at $30.70 in 2024, up 6.6 percent from the year before. Supervisor wages averaged $26.83 per hour, up 4.8 percent from 2023 (not adjusted for inflation).\n| Occupation | SOC code | Employment share 2024 (percent) | Average hourly wage 2024 | Nominal wage growth, 2023-24 (percent change) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Graders and sorters, agricultural products | (45-2041) | 2 | 18.31 | 10.45 |\n| Agricultural equipment operators | (45-2091) | 17 | 19.07 | 3.24 |\n| Farmworkers, crop, nursery, and greenhouse | (45-2092) | 44 | 18.24 | 3.61 |\n| Farmworkers, farm, ranch, and aquacultural | (45-2093) | 22 | 17.23 | 4.33 |\n| Agricultural workers, all other | (45-2099) | 1 | 18.14 | 1.78 |\n| Packers and packagers, hand | (53-7064) | 3 | 17.57 | 7.38 |\n| Subtotal, nonsupervisory farmworkers | 88 | 18.13 | 3.89 | |\n| Farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers | (11-9013) | 3 | 30.70 | 6.64 |\n| First-line supervisors | (45-1011) | 3 | 26.83 | 4.78 |\n| Subtotal, supervisory and nonsupervisory occupations | 94 | 18.81 | 3.74 | |\n| All other farm occupations | 6 | 23.70 | -2.86 | |\n| All farm occupations | 100 | 19.10 | 3.09 | |\n| Note: SOC = Standard Occupational Classification (SOC).

As a result, labor costs as a share of gross cash farm income have not shown an upward trend for the sector (as a whole) over the past 20 years. For all farms, labor costs (including contract labor, and cash-fringe benefit costs) averaged 10.4 percent of gross cash income during 2021–23, compared with 11.0 percent during 1998–2000.\nHowever, these trends in labor cost shares differ by commodity. For the fruit and vegetable industries, which tend to be more labor-intensive, labor-cost shares have generally increased in recent years. For the dairy industry, which relies heavily on foreign-born labor, labor costs as a share of income have remained relatively stable over the past 20 years.\nH-2A Temporary Agricultural Program\nThe H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program—often called the H-2A visa program—provides a legal means to bring foreign-born workers to the United States to perform seasonal farm labor on a temporary basis (for a period of up to 10 months). Crop farmers can use this program to meet their seasonal labor needs, but most livestock producers—such as ranches, dairies, and hog and poultry operations—are not legally allowed to use the program to meet year-round labor needs. An exception to this restriction is made for producers of livestock on the range, such as sheep and goat operations, who can use H-2A workers year-round.\nEmployers in the H-2A program must demonstrate, and the U.S. Department of Labor must certify, that efforts to recruit U.S. workers were not successful.\nEmployers must also pay H-2A workers a minimum wage, which may not be lower than a rate established by the Department of Labor, known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) (see next section for details). In addition, employers must provide housing for their H-2A workers and pay for their domestic and international transportation.\nOne of the clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor is the fact that the number of H-2A positions requested and approved has increased more than sevenfold in the past 19 years, from just over 48,000 positions certified in fiscal year (FY) 2005 to around 385,000 in FY 2024. The average duration of an H-2A certification in FY 2024 was 5.75 months, implying that the 385,000 positions certified represented around 184,000 full-year equivalents. A certified job does not necessarily result in the issuance of a visa. This is partly because some employers do not follow through on hiring H-2A workers, and some workers may fill more than one certified job. In fact, in recent years, only about 80 percent of jobs certified as H-2A have resulted in visas. Around 315,500 visas were issued in FY 2024 by the U.S. Department of State.\nAdverse Effect Wage Rate\nH-2A employers must pay no less than the higher of the applicable State or Federal minimum wage, the prevailing wage in that region and occupation, or the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) specified by the U.S. Department of Labor. For field and livestock (non-range) jobs, which make up the vast majority of H-2A positions, the U.S. Department of Labor determines the AEWR using the regional average farm wage observed in the NASS FLS. For FY 2025, this minimum hourly wage ranged from $14.83 (Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) to $19.97 (California), $20.08 (Hawaii), and $22.23 (District of Columbia).\nLegal Status and Migration Practices of Hired Crop Farmworkers\nthe legal immigration status of farmworkers is difficult to measure. Not many surveys ask workers about their legal immigration status, and unauthorized respondents may be reluctant to answer truthfully if asked. The U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) provides data on farmworkers’ legal immigration status. NAWS data, believed to be of high quality, are gathered by trained and trusted enumerators who conduct face-to-face interviews with workers at their job sites and with their employers’ permission. NAWS also queries workers on their inter- and intranational-migration patterns. One limitation of the NAWS, however, is that NAWS excludes H-2A workers, as well as livestock workers.\nOver Forty Percent of Hired Crop Farmworkers Lack Legal Immigration Status\nThe share of hired crop farmworkers who were not legally authorized to work in the United States grew from roughly 14 percent in 1989–91 to almost 55 percent in 1999–2001. In recent years, however, the share has declined to about 40 percent. In 2020–22, 32 percent of crop farmworkers were U.S. born, 7 percent were immigrants who had obtained U.S. citizenship, 19 percent were other authorized immigrants (primarily permanent residents or green-card holders), and the remaining 42 percent held no work authorization. The share of workers who are U.S. born is highest in the Midwest, while the share who are unauthorized is highest in California.\nMore Farmworkers Are Settled, Fewer Are Migrants\nEighty three percent of hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers but instead are considered settled, meaning that the farmworkers work at a single location within 75 miles of their home. This share is up from 41 percent in 1996–98, reflecting a profound change in the nature of the crop farm workforce.\nAmong the small share of remaining migrant workers, the largest group is “shuttlers,” who work at a single farm location more than 75 miles from home and may cross an international border to get to their worksite. Shuttlers made up about 9 percent of hired crop farmworkers in 2022, down from about 24 percent in 1996–98.\nMore common in the past, the \"follow-the-crop\" migrant farmworker, who moves from State to State working on different crops as the seasons advance, is now a relative rarity. These workers made up just 4 percent of those surveyed by the NAWS in 2020–22, down from a high of 14 percent in 1992–94.\nThe final category of hired crop farmworkers is the newcomer to farming, whose migration patterns have not yet been established. The fact that newcomers now represent just 3.6 percent of the crop farm workforce, down from as much as 22 percent in 1998–2000, in part reflects the slowdown in net migration from Mexico to the United States since 2007.\nLinks to Key Data Sources\nFrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture:\n- Farm Labor Survey\nThe Farm Labor Survey (FLS) conducted by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is based on semi-annual phone interviews with a random sample of farm employers (crops and livestock). The employers are asked to provide quarterly data on their wage bill, employment counts, and average weekly hours for all hired workers (by occupation). Contract labor is excluded and no demographic information on the workforce is collected. Each year, the FLS’s estimate of the annual average wage for nonsupervisory field and livestock workers in each of 18 regions is used as the basis for the following year’s Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) for field and livestock non-range occupations. The survey is described here, and its quarterly reports are archived here. Data and statistics can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats. - Census of Agriculture\nEvery 5 years (years ending in 2 and 7), NASS conducts a full census of every farm in the country. Published statistics include national-, State-, and county-level tables on many topics—including land use and ownership, operator characteristics, production practices, income, and expenditures. Information on total employment (a simple head count, not adjusted for full-year or full-time equivalency) and labor expenditures (including contract labor) is also available. However, almost no demographic information on the hired farm work force is collected. The Census is described here. Published tables from the 2022 Census are here. Data from the Census of Agriculture can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats. - Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)\nARMS, jointly administered by ERS and NASS, is an annual survey of roughly 30,000 farms. ARMS serves as the primary source of information on the U.S. farm businesses and the economic well-being of U.S. farm households—to include their financial condition, production practices, and resource use. The field-level phase collects information on production practices and costs (fertilizer, pesticide, labor, tillage, seed, etc.) for target commodities. The farm-level phase collects financial information for farm businesses and a variety of financial and demographic information (age, education, occupation, off-farm income, etc.) for farm operators and their households. The survey collects information from 48 States and is designed to represent the continental United States and to support State-level estimates for 15 key agricultural States. An online web tool permits the creation of various customized reports on farm structure and finance, and crop production practices.\nFrom Other Agencies:\n- National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS)\nNAWS is conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor and is an employment-based, random-sample survey of U.S. crop workers (neither livestock workers nor H-2A workers are covered) that collects demographic, employment, and health data in face-to-face interviews. The NAWS is the source of estimates of legal immigration status of the Nation's crop farmworkers and is the basis for much of the research on farmworker health and well-being. Results are tabulated here, and the underlying microdata files are also available for public use. - American Community Survey (ACS)\nThe ACS is a rolling monthly survey that interviews more than 2 million households annually, collecting basic demographic, labor market, and income data. Results are released annually for the Nation, for States (with separate tallies for their metropolitan and nonmetropolitan components), and for large metro areas. Information on smaller geographic areas is released only for 5-year averages. Although the income questionnaire is less detailed than CPS, its larger sample size makes the ACS a more reliable measure of income and basic labor market outcomes for smaller geographic regions. Results are accessible using the Census data access site. Farmworkers may be identified using industry and occupation codes in the ACS Public Use Microdata (PUMS) files. - Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\nBEA synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide annual industry employment and earnings estimates at the national, State and county levels. Information is reported on: the number of farm proprietors, hired farmworkers, and both self-employed and hired workers in agricultural support services, and their earnings. BEA’s data on self-employment (employment of proprietors) are not comparable to data on self-employment from other sources, because the BEA’s data are not limited to those for whom self-employment is the primary activity. - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)\nThe QCEW provides monthly estimates of employment and earnings for all industries but is limited to employers who are mandated to contribute to State unemployment insurance funds. Thus, the QCEW may exclude some smaller farm employers in States that do not have universal unemployment insurance coverage. The QCEW classifies farm employers by their primary product and then reports employment and earnings for all occupations employed in that industry at the national, State, and county levels.

From ice fishing and hockey to skating, skiing and snowmobiling, icy lakes enable communities to engage in activities that aren’t possible in warmer seasons or climates.\nBut these iconic cold-weather past-times could become a rare winter treat. A new study published today [Jan. 28, 2019] by an international team of researchers, including at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, shows that many northern latitude lakes are at risk of experiencing some ice-free winters in the coming decades. In some places, lake ice will disappear altogether by the end of the century.\nAccording to its authors, the study — led by Professor Sapna Sharma of York University — offers “the first global estimate of how many lakes are likely to lose winter ice cover as climate warms.”\nCo-author John Magnuson, emeritus director of the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, says the team developed a model that allowed them to predict which lakes would lose ice first and how that ice loss would be distributed across different latitudes.\nThe result is a map that shows the extent of winter lake-ice retreat under different global warming scenarios and highlights what could still be saved through efforts to reduce global emissions.\nCurrently, 15,000 lakes sit in a climate zone where they experience intermittent lake ice – some years are cold enough that the lakes freeze over and other years are warm enough that they don’t. These lakes, the researchers write, are a “harbinger of permanent ice loss.” As annual average air temperatures warm, this intermittent ice zone moves north, eventually leaving the lakes south of it looking at an ice-free future.\nIf the world can meet the Paris Agreement’s climate mitigation goals to limit global average temperatures to two degrees Celsius of warming, the study predicts the number of these intermittent ice lakes will increase to 35,300, potentially disrupting the winter experience and traditions of the 394 million people who live within an hour’s drive of their shores.\nHowever, under a “worst-case” climate scenario of eight degrees Celsius warming (predicted by some models as the extreme case if the world does not act to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions) the number of intermittent-ice lakes jumps to 230,400, bringing lake ice impacts close to home for 656 million people spread across more than 50 countries.\nSuch an extreme level of warming would push winter’s ice-covered lake zone out of the United States, well north into Canada, and endanger the ice-cover of most lakes in traditionally frigid countries like Norway and Sweden.\nIt’s important to note, says Sharma, that these changes are happening now: “It’s not one of these climate change predictions where you think, ‘Oh, I have 100 years before this might become my reality,’” she says.\nFrom 1862 through the winter of 1996, southern Wisconsin’s Lake Geneva, a prime destination for regional ice fishermen, froze over each year. But, since 1997, the lake has had four ice-free winters. Lakes from Alaska to Germany and Japan are experiencing similar trends.\nFor instance, over the last three decades, Japan’s Lake Suwa has only been freezing two out of every 10 years. Lake ice records here — the longest-running in the world — go back to 1400 AD and in the first 250 years that data was collected, there were only three years in which the lake did not freeze.\nThe drastic changes in Earth’s climate over the last several decades do more than limit human recreation on frozen lakes, the study authors say. Lakes that don’t freeze over are more susceptible to evaporative water loss during the winter, and warm up faster through spring and summer. This can lead to lower water levels, an increase in potentially harmful algal blooms, and reduced oxygen levels in the water, which can be detrimental to fish and other wildlife. It also threatens human use for drinking water, boating and fishing.\nThe study also found that once regional winter air temperatures reach an average of 8.4 degrees Celsius (about 47 degrees Fahrenheit), lakes tend not to freeze. Lakes don’t all respond to warming equally, Magnuson says.\n“The deeper the lake is, the more heat storage it has and it takes more cold weather to get the lake down to a temperature where it could freeze,” he says.\nA lake’s shoreline also plays a role. The study found that lakes with “simpler” or more circular shorelines receive greater wind shear across their surfaces, which can prevent the formation of ice because it requires calm, flat water.\nMagnuson saw these dynamics in action this year. From his office on the shore of Lake Mendota, the deepest of Madison, Wisconsin’s chain of lakes, he watched as the lake froze and thawed twice in December and January. Meanwhile, nearby and smaller Lake Wingra froze in early December and has maintained its ice. Mendota’s “fits and starts freezing,” he says, illustrates how climate change is expected to affect northern lakes.\n“Lake Mendota’s not going to suddenly have no ice and then have no ice again the next year,” he says. “It’s going to have increasing proportions of years with no ice. It will have good winters for ice activity and winters with no ice activity. This is going to be a gradual process.”\nIt means millions of people will find themselves awaiting the big winter freeze they have come to depend on and turn to each other to ask: “Winter is coming … right?”\nThe study was supported by the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science Early Researcher Award, the York University Research Chair program, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Department of the Interior Northeast Climate Science Center, and the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research program.\nTags: climate change, limnology, research\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Coverage, fish, cube, duration. What connects these four words? That’s right, ice! And when it comes to ice duration and ice coverage, few places have better records than the Wisconsin State Climatology Office. Maintained by assistant state climatologist Ed Hopkins — known among friends and fans as the “Ice Man” — records of freezing and thawing on Lake Mendota date back to 1852. (That’s just three years younger than the university itself.) What can these records tell us about Wisconsin’s changing climate? A recent data analysis from Hopkins offers good news for migratory birds and bad news for ice fishers: less ice, more water.\nFor starters, it’s taking longer for Lake Mendota to freeze over. The UW student experience may have looked entirely different in 1886 than 1986, but Badgers of both centuries got to enjoy icy activities before heading home for break. Compared to 1971, Lake Mendota now freezes over about 15 days later, and this century, the majority of “ice-on” dates have been in January.\nThere have also been seasons where vastly fluctuating temperatures have caused multiple freezes, like the 2024–25 winter. “Lake Mendota has been unusually fickle this winter,” says state climatologist Steve Vavrus. “[We saw] a brief freeze-over on Christmas Day that melted off a couple days later, followed by a long stretch with open water. Despite the really cold weather since the start of January, the recent sustained winds kept ice from reforming lake-wide until January 7.” It’s no wonder the ice is confused this year: it reached 50 degrees on January 17 … and four days later, plummeted to a low of -13.\nAccording to Vavrus, the best trend indicator is duration of coverage, however, rather than ice-on dates. “There have been a lot fewer days with ice cover on Lake Mendota in recent decades as the climate warms,” he summarizes. Since the new millennium, the average duration of ice coverage is 82 days; in the 1800s, it was 114. The longest duration of ice occurred in 1880–81: Mendota froze just before Thanksgiving and didn’t thaw until May 3. Through 1999, the lake would typically stay frozen until April. But since 2000, 57 percent of “ice-off” dates have jumped to March. All told, that’s about 10 fewer days of ice coverage today than there were in 1971.\nWhen you look at the increase in annual temperatures across the Madison area, the loss of ice makes sense: it’s 2.3 degrees warmer than it was in 1971. If that trend continues, Badgers 50 years from now might never get to lace up their skates on the frozen shores of the Terrace. Ice activities aren’t the only winter pastimes at risk. Just last year, northern Wisconsin’s historic Birkebeiner ski race had to shorten its course due to lack of snow for the first time.\nFortunately, groups like the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) are meeting these challenges head on. In fact, its tourism and recreation working group has laid out a series of actionable steps that the state can take to both mitigate the effects of and adapt to our warming world. Offers Vavrus, who also serves as the organization’s codirector, “Proactive approaches like these are increasingly necessary as Wisconsin adjusts to a ‘new normal.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

We've just had a -- wide-ranging discussions on the matter at hand. Like the good folks standing with me, the American people were appalled and outraged at last Tuesday's attacks. And so were Muslims all across the world. Both Americans and Muslim friends and citizens, tax-paying citizens, and Muslims in nations were just appalled and could not believe what we saw on our TV screens.\nThese acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it's important for my fellow Americans to understand that.\nThe English translation is not as eloquent as the original Arabic, but let me quote from the Koran, itself: In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil. For that they rejected the signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule.\nThe face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.\nWhen we think of Islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world. Billions of people find comfort and solace and peace. And that's made brothers and sisters out of every race -- out of every race.\nAmerica counts millions of Muslims amongst our citizens, and Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country. Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with respect.\nWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America. That's not the America I know. That's not the America I value.\nI've been told that some fear to leave; some don't want to go shopping for their families; some don't want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they're afraid they'll be intimidated. That should not and that will not stand in America.\nThose who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don't represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.\nThis is a great country. It's a great country because we share the same values of respect and dignity and human worth. And it is my honor to be meeting with leaders who feel just the same way I do. They're outraged, they're sad. They love America just as much as I do.\nI want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come by. And may God bless us all.\nEND 3:19 P.M.

It represents the largest number of Jews killed in a single day since the Holocaust, and currently ranks as the third-deadliest terrorist attack of all time, exceeded only by Islamic State massacres and the 9/11 attacks. On October 8, Israel declared a state of war for the first time since 1973 and has engaged in a bombing campaign targeting the Gaza Strip, with a ground invasion soon to follow. To date, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza reports that 1,100 Palestinians have been killed and more than 5,340 injured inside the Strip, while Israeli media has reported as many as 1,500 bodies of terrorists recovered from the “envelope” of Israeli communities along the border with Gaza. More than 75 of the confirmed dead in Israel are foreign nationals, including 22 from the United States, 17 from Britain, 18 from Thailand, 10 from Nepal, 10 from France, 7 from Argentina, and many others. Israeli media reports roughly 150 hostages are being held in Gaza by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, including an unconfirmed number of Americans and other foreign nationals.\nAround the globe, representatives of approximately a hundred countries have reacted to the war in varying ways. At least forty-four nations have publicly expressed their unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and explicitly decried its tactics as terrorism. Others, including regional players such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, and Iraq, have placed responsibility on Israel for the attacks. Approximately twenty countries have explicitly stated that Israel has the right to defend itself, while others have called for an immediate de-escalation of violence.\nOver the weekend, several countries altered their initial statements as details of the attack unfolded. The UAE, Bahrain, and China all modified their primary statements to include explicit condemnation of the killing and kidnapping of Israeli civilians. The UAE and Bahrain also revised their initial statements to specifically condemn Hamas.\nThe following is an overview of international reactions to the Hamas attack. In the Middle East and North Africa, a slim majority condemned all violence, with almost an equal number either condemning Israel or offering full-throated support to Hamas. North American and European countries overwhelmingly issued statements in strong support of Israel and its right to defend itself. Very few issued only a general condemnation of all violence or made no statement. While the vast majority of sub-Saharan African countries did not issue a public statement, Kenya, Ghana, and Togo stood out with particularly vociferous criticism of Hamas. The majority of Latin American countries issued statements either in support of Israel or condemning all violence, with the notable exceptions of Belize, Colombia, and Venezuela. Australia and New Zealand offered strong support to Israel, with all other Oceanic countries abstaining from public comment. Most Asian nations condemned violence generally, with India, Georgia, Japan, Singapore, Nepal, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand standing out with their explicit support for Israel and North Korea condemning Israeli aggression.\nBelow is a list of statements from the Middle East and North Africa along with select examples from other regions. As the war evolves, so too will the nature, scope, and tenor of international reactions. (Note that statements from Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, and Syria have been translated into English.)\nDownload a fuller compendium of government statements.\nDownload a compilation of reactions from Islamic and Islamist figures.\nMiddle East and North Africa\nAlgeria: “Algeria is following with great concern the development of the brutal Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, which claimed the lives of dozens of innocent sons and daughters of the Palestinian people who fell as martyrs in light of the Zionist occupation’s persistence in the policy of oppression and persecution that it imposes on the brave Palestinian people. Algeria strongly condemns these policies and practices that violate the most basic humanitarian rules and references to international legitimacy. In this context, Algeria renews its demand for the immediate intervention of the international community through the relevant international bodies to protect the Palestinian people from the arrogance and crime that the Zionist occupation has made a feature of its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Algeria also renews its conviction that the Zionist settlement occupation is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and that ending the misfortunes, scourges and tragedies resulting from this conflict undoubtedly lies in responding to the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people and enabling them to establish their independent state on the 1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital.”\nBahrain: “The Kingdom of Bahrain is closely following the developments taking place between Palestinian groups and Israeli forces, leading to an increase in violence and armed attacks that claimed the lives of a number of people and injured others. It stresses the need for de-escalation among all parties to preserve the lives of people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that the continuation of violence will impede the efforts [aimed] at achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, [and is] calling upon the international community to take its role in ending the armed conflict and protecting civilians in line with the international humanitarian law, in addition to supporting the peace process and establishing the Palestinian state according to the two-state solution and other international legitimacy resolutions.”\nUpdated Bahrain statement, October 9: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed the need to immediately stop the ongoing fighting between the Palestinian Hamas movement and the Israeli forces, warning that the attacks launched by Hamas constitute a dangerous escalation that threatens the lives of civilians, expressing its deep regret for the great loss of life and property, its condolences to the families of the victims, and its wishes for a speedy recovery for the injured. The Ministry also expressed the Kingdom of Bahrain’s denunciation of [the reported] kidnapping of civilians from their homes as hostages, calling for an end to the escalation and the avoidance of violence that threatens regional security and stability and portends dire consequences for the region. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for the international community to intervene and fulfill its responsibilities to stop the fighting and provide full protection for civilians who should not be the target of conflict under international humanitarian law, and to advance efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all the peoples of the region. The Ministry affirmed that the Kingdom of Bahrain supports efforts aimed at stopping the fighting and escalation, and reaching a political solution through dialogue and negotiations and a final peaceful settlement of the conflict in accordance with the two-state solution and international legitimacy resolutions.”\nEgypt: “The Arab Republic of Egypt warns of the dire dangers of the ongoing escalation between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, following a series of attacks against Palestinian cities. Egypt calls for exercising the utmost restraint and avoiding exposing civilians to further risks, warning of serious repercussions as a result of the escalation of violence, which would negatively affect the future of truce efforts. The Arab Republic of Egypt also calls on international actors involved in supporting efforts to resume the peace process to intervene immediately to stop the ongoing escalation, and urges Israel to stop attacks and provocative actions against the Palestinian people, and to adhere to the rules of international humanitarian law with regard to the responsibilities of the occupying state.”\nIran: “Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani reacted to the current developments in occupied Palestine and the attack by the Palestinian resistance groups against the Zionist occupiers, saying Operation Al-Aqsa Flood was a spontaneous move by the resistance groups and the oppressed Palestinian people in defense of their inalienable and undeniable rights. He added that the operation was the Palestinians’ natural reaction to the war-mongering, provocative and incendiary policies of the Zionists, especially the usurping regime’s extremist and adventurous prime minister. Kanaani said the oppressed Palestinian people’s inalienable right to defend themselves, their land and their sanctities against occupation, aggression, daily violations and organized terror on [the] part of the Zionist regime is a natural and legitimate right in line with all recognized international standards and the fundamental principles of international law. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman added that on the one hand, the continuation of the desecration of Islam’s holy sites and the first Qibla [al-Aqsa] of Muslims by extremist and racist Zionists in recent months and weeks, and the persistence of the Zionist regime’s policy of killing, committing crimes and doing acts of aggression against the oppressed Palestinian people, especially women, children and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails amid the silence and inaction of the international community and the fake human rights defenders have left the Palestinian nation and resistance no [choice] but to resist and rely on their inherent strength in the face of the Zionists. Kanaani noted that the Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms the inherent and legal right of Palestinians to defend themselves vis-à-vis the crimes of the usurpers of Palestine that have been going on for 75 years. He said Iran also holds the Zionist occupiers and its supporters responsible for the continuation and escalation of violence and atrocities against the Palestinians. He underlined that Iran calls on Muslim countries to support al-Aqsa Mosque and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.”\nIraq: “Iraq affirms its firm position, as a people and a government, towards the Palestinian issue, and that it stands by the Palestinian people in achieving their aspirations and obtaining their full legitimate rights, and that injustice and the usurpation of these rights cannot produce sustainable peace. The operations carried out by the Palestinian people today are a natural result of the systematic oppression they have been subjected to since ancient times at the hands of the Zionist occupation authority, which has never adhered to international and UN resolutions. Therefore, we call on the international community to take action to put an end to the serious violations and restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, which is still suffering from occupation, policies of racial discrimination, siege, transgression of sacred things, and violation of humanitarian values and principles. We warn of continued escalation within the Palestinian territories; because it will reflect on the stability of the region, we also call on the League of Arab States to convene urgently to discuss developments in the dangerous situation in the Palestinian territories.”\nJordan: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriate Affairs stressed today the need to stop the dangerous escalation in Gaza and its surroundings, and warned of the dangerous repercussions of this escalation, which threatens to further escalate the situation, especially in light of the Israeli attacks and violations witnessed by cities and regions in the West Bank on the Palestinian people, and on Islamic and Christian sanctities and deprivation of the Palestinian people of their rights. The Ministry warned in a statement of the consequences of this escalation on all efforts to achieve comprehensive calm, and stressed the need for restraint, protection of civilians, and respect for international humanitarian law. The Ministry stressed that the escalation of violence in all its forms and the continued escalation will lead to worse and will reflect negatively on everyone. The Ministry stressed that finding a real political horizon to achieve peace on the basis of a two-state solution in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions, in a way that ends the occupation and embodies the independent, sovereign Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the lines of June 4, 1967, so that it can live in security and peace alongside Israel and stop Israeli measures that perpetuate the occupation and undermine opportunities to achieve just and comprehensive peace is the only way to stop the deterioration and achieve security for all.”\nKuwait: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed the State of Kuwait’s deep concern about the developments of recent events and the escalation taking place in the Gaza Strip and the occupied Palestinian territories, which came as a result of the continued violations and blatant attacks committed by the Israeli occupation authorities against the brotherly Palestinian people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms the State of Kuwait’s call on the international community, especially the [United Nations] Security Council, to assume its responsibilities and stop the ongoing violence, provide protection for the brotherly Palestinian people, and end the provocative practices of the occupation authorities, especially the ongoing violations of the sanctity of the Blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the policy of settlement expansion. While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms the firm and principled position of the State of Kuwait in standing by the brotherly Palestinian people and supporting them until they obtain all their rights, the most important of which is their independent state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, it warns that the continuation of the cycle of violence without stopping it and deterring those who caused it would undermine peace efforts and a two-state solution.”\nMorocco: “The Kingdom of Morocco expresses its deep concern over the deteriorating situation and the outbreak of military actions in the Gaza Strip and condemns the targeting of civilians by any party. The Kingdom of Morocco, which has long warned of the repercussions of the political impasse on peace in the region and the dangers of increasing [tension] as a result, calls for an immediate cessation of all acts of violence, a return to calm, and the avoidance of all forms of escalation that would undermine the chances of peace in the region. The Kingdom of Morocco, whose King, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist him, chairs the Al-Quds Committee, affirms that the approach of dialogue and negotiations remains the only way to reach a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue, on the basis of international legitimacy resolutions and the internationally agreed-upon principle of the two-state solution.”\nOman: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is following with interest and concern the ongoing escalation between the Palestinian and Israeli sides as a result of the continued illegal Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the ongoing Israeli attacks against Palestinian cities and villages, which portends serious repercussions and an escalation in violence. The Ministry called on both parties to exercise maximum restraint and the need to protect civilians. The Ministry stressed that the international community and international parties supporting efforts to resume the peace process must intervene immediately to stop the ongoing escalation and resort to the rules of international law, while again alerting and emphasizing the strategic necessity to find a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue on the basis of the two-state solution and the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with its capital in East Jerusalem.”\nQatar: “The State of Qatar expresses its deep concern over the developments in [the] Gaza Strip and calls on all parties to de-escalate, and exercise maximum restraint. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds Israel solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its ongoing violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, the latest of which was the repeated incursions into Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of the Israeli police. The Ministry stresses the need for the international community to act [urgently] to compel Israel to stop its flagrant violations of international law, respect the resolutions of international legitimacy and the historical rights of the Palestinian people, and to prevent these events from being used as a pretext to ignite a new asymmetric war against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterates the firm position of the State of Qatar regarding the justice of the Palestinian cause, and the legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, and to establish their independent state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”\nSaudi Arabia: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely following the developments of the unprecedented situation between a number of Palestinian factions and the Israeli occupation forces, which has resulted in a high level of violence on several fronts there. The Kingdom calls for an immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint. The Kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continuation of the occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities. The Kingdom renews the call of the international community to assume its responsibilities and activate a credible peace process that leads to the two-state solution to achieve security and peace in the region and protect civilians.”\nSyria: “The resistance factions in occupied Palestine recorded a new line on the path to achieving inalienable Palestinian rights, in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which began this morning against the racist Zionist entity. The operation comes one day after the anniversary of the great Arab victory on October 6, 1973. This honorable achievement achieved by the Palestinian people proves once again that the only way to achieve the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is resistance in all its forms and to challenge the arrogant Zionist occupation authorities whose extreme right-wing government has increased its repressive measures against the brotherly Palestinian people...Syria condemns the brutal occupation practices against the Palestinian people, stressing that the resistance’s response to these practices proves the right of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state on their land and exercise their legitimate right of return and build a future worthy of this people, their heritage, and their dignity, which the Zionist colonizers tried to rob. Syria raises its head high in honor of the martyrs of the Palestinian revolution and the heroes who planned and achieved the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, and affirms its standing by the Palestinian people and their fighting forces against terrorism and the Zionist methodology, and stresses that Palestine is getting closer to achieving the desired victory. The Palestinian resistance and its heroes deserve all support from all Arab countries and from those fighting for freedom, progress and independence all over the world.”\nTurkey: “We are deeply concerned about the violence and tension that occurred in Israel and Palestine today (October 7). We attach high importance to the restoration of calm in the region as soon as possible, and strongly condemn the loss of civilian lives. We underline that acts of violence and associated escalations will not benefit anyone, and call on the parties to act with restraint and avoid impulsive steps. As Turkiye, we are always ready to contribute to the best of our ability to ensure that these developments can be taken under control before they escalate further and spread to a wider area. In this regard, we continue our intensive contacts with the relevant parties. These sad developments once again show the importance of the two-state solution vision. We call on the parties to renounce the use of force and work for a lasting solution in line with this vision without further delay.”\nUAE: “The United Arab Emirates has expressed great concern regarding the escalation of violence between Israelis and Palestinians, and stressed the importance of halting escalation and preserving the lives of civilians. The UAE has expressed its sincere condolences to all the victims of the recent crisis. In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) stressed that the UAE has called for exercising the utmost restraint and an immediate ceasefire in order to avoid serious repercussions. The Ministry expressed that the UAE, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, urges the international community to immediately reactivate the international Quartet to revive the path process of Arab-Israeli peace, and increase all efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, and prevent the region from experiencing further violence, tension, and instability.”\nUpdated UAE statement, October 10: “The Ministry stressed that attacks by Hamas against Israeli towns and villages near the Gaza Strip, including the firing of thousands of rockets at population centers, are a serious and grave escalation. The Ministry is appalled by reports that Israeli civilians have been abducted as hostages from their homes. Civilians on both sides must always have full protection under international humanitarian law and must never be a target of conflict. The UAE expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and urges all diplomatic efforts to prevent a wider regional confrontation. Furthermore, the Ministry deeply mourns the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives as a result of the outbreak of violence, and calls on both parties to de-escalate and avoid an expansion of the heinous violence with tragic consequences affecting civilian lives and facilities. The UAE underscored that the international community needs to work together to prevent the violence risking wider instability and spillover, including the involvement by other groups. The UAE reaffirmed that the international community must remain resolute in the face of these violent attempts to derail ongoing regional efforts aimed at dialogue, cooperation, and co-existence, and must not allow nihilistic destruction to overtake a region whose people have already suffered enough war and trauma. The Ministry stressed that the UAE remains in close contact with all regional and international partners to swiftly de-escalate the situation and restore calm in Israel and the OPT [occupied Palestinian territories] and a return to negotiations for a final settlement within the parameters of the two state solution for Palestinians and Israelis, who deserve to live in peace and dignity.”\nNorth America and Europe\nCanada (Prime Minister Justin Trudeau): “Early yesterday, on a Jewish holiday and 50 years after the start of the Yom Kippur War, the terrorist organization Hamas launched a massive, coordinated attack against Israel. Canada unequivocally condemns these terrible attacks in the strongest possible terms and reaffirms its support for Israel’s right to defend itself, in accordance with international law. The images we have seen are horrifying and shocking. As we fully realize the scale and brutality of this violence in the coming days, we extend our deepest condolences to everyone affected. Our hearts break for the hundreds of innocent people whose lives were senselessly taken. We call for the immediate release of those being held hostage and demand they be treated in accordance with international law. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, and we are in touch with our international partners to restore peace and security in the region. We must all work to protect civilian life. To our Israeli friends, Canadians stand with you. The Government of Canada stands ready to support you—our support for the Israeli people is steadfast.”\nUkraine (President Volodymyr Zelensky): “Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated. Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world. Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment. Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable. All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack. All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation. To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner. Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”\nUnited States (President Joe Biden): “This morning, I spoke with Prime Minister [Binyamin] Netanyahu about the horrific and ongoing attacks in Israel. The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering. Jill and I are keeping in our prayers all of the families who have been hurt by this violence. We are heartbroken by the lives that have been tragically cut short and hope for a swift recovery for all those who have been wounded. My team and I are tracking this situation closely, and I will remain in close touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu.”\nUnited States, France, Britain, Italy, and Germany (joint statement): “Today, we—President [Emmanuel] Macron of France, Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister [Giorgia] Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister [Rishi] Sunak of the United Kingdom, and President [Joe] Biden of the United States—express our steadfast and united support to the State of Israel, and our unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism. We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. There is never any justification for terrorism. In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages. Our countries will support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and its people against such atrocities. We further emphasize that this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. All of us recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike. But make no mistake: Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed. Over the coming days, we will remain united and coordinated, together as allies, and as common friends of Israel, to ensure Israel is able to defend itself, and to ultimately set the conditions for a peaceful and integrated Middle East region.”\nAsia\nChina: “China is deeply concerned over the current escalation of tensions and violence between Palestine and Israel. We call on relevant parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and immediately end the hostilities to protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation. The recurrence of the conflict shows once again that the protracted standstill of the peace process cannot go on. The fundamental way out of the conflict lies in implementing the two-state solution and establishing an independent State of Palestine. The international community needs to act with greater urgency, step up input into the Palestine question, facilitate the early resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel, and find a way to bring about enduring peace. China will continue to work relentlessly with the international community towards that end.”\nIndia (Prime Minister Narendra Modi): “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.”\nRussia: “Russia is gravely concerned over a sharp escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In this regard we would like to reaffirm our principled and consistent stance that this conflict, which has continued for 75 years, cannot be resolved by force and can be settled exclusively by political and diplomatic means, by engaging in a full-fledged negotiation process based on the well-known international legal framework stipulating the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with a capital in East Jerusalem that co-exists with Israel in peace and security. We regard the current large-scale escalation as another extremely dangerous manifestation of a vicious circle of violence resulting from chronic failure to comply with the corresponding resolutions of the UN and its Security Council and the blocking by the West of the work of the Middle East Quartet of international mediators made up of Russia, the United States, the EU and the UN. We call on the Palestinian and Israeli sides to implement an immediate ceasefire, renounce violence, exercise restraint and begin, with the assistance of the international community, a negotiation process aimed at establishing a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace in the Middle East.”\nCleary Waldo is a research associate with The Washington Institute’s Koret Project on Arab-Israel Relations.

The international ads warn criminal illegal aliens not to come to America and break its laws or they will be hunted down and deported.\nThis series of ads will run on radio, broadcast, and digital, in multiple countries and regions in various dialects. Ads will be hyper-targeted, including through social media, text message and digital to reach illegal immigrants in the interior of the United States, as well as internationally.\n“Thank you, President Donald J. Trump, for securing our border and putting America first. President Trump has a clear message: if you are here illegally, we will find you and deport you. You will never return. But if you leave now, you may have an opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American Dream,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “If you are a criminal alien considering entering America illegally: Don’t even think about it. If you come here and break our laws, we will hunt you down. Criminals are not welcome in the United States.”\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Over\nPers\nAuteursrecht\nContact\nCreators\nAdverteren\nOntwikkelaars\nVoorwaarden\nPrivacy\nBeleid en veiligheid\nZo werkt YouTube\nNieuwe functies testen\n© 2025 Google LLC\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Este artículo también está disponible en Español.\nIt’s important we squarely face Trump’s victory and what there is to do about it.\nTrump has already signaled the kind of president he will be: revengeful, uncontrolled and unburdened by past norms and current laws. I won’t go through the litany of awful things he’s pledged to do, since that’s been well-established with his words, Project 2025 plans and excellent analyses from authoritarian experts.\nLooking into an even more destabilized future is not easy. If you’re like me, you’re already tired. The prospect of more drama is daunting. But authoritarianism isn’t going away no matter the election results. So here’s some thinking about ways to orient so we can ground ourselves better for these times ahead.\nI am blessed to have spent time writing scenarios about what might happen, developing trainings for a Trump win and working alongside colleagues living under autocratic regimes. One of the things they keep reminding me is that good psychology is good social change. Authoritarian power is derived from fear of repression, isolation from each other and exhaustion at the utter chaos. We’re already feeling it.\nThus, for us to be of any use in a Trump world, we have to pay grave attention to our inner states, so we don’t perpetuate the autocrat’s goals of fear, isolation, exhaustion or constant disorientation.\nI started writing this list with strategic principles (e.g. analyze your opponents weakness and learn to handle political violence), but actually the place to start is with your own self.\nTrump is arriving at a time of great social distrust. Across the board, society has reduced trust in traditional institutions. Yes, there’s more distrust of the media, medical professionals, experts and politicians. But it extends beyond that. There’s reduced trust in most community institutions and membership groups. Whether from COVID or political polarization, a lot of us have experienced reduced trust in friends and family. Even our trust in predictable weather is diminished.\nDistrust fuels the flame of autocracy because it makes it much easier to divide. We can see that in the casual nature of Trump’s rhetoric — telling people to distrust immigrants, Democrats, socialists, people from Chicago, women marchers, Mexicans, the press and so on.\nThis is a social disease: You know who to trust by who they tell you to distrust.\nTrust-building starts with your own self. It includes trusting your own eyes and gut, as well as building protection from the ways the crazy-making can become internalized.\nThis also means being trustworthy — not just with information, but with emotions. That way you can acknowledge what you know and admit the parts that are uncertain fears nagging at you.\nThen take steps to follow through on what you need. If you’re tired, take some rest. If you’re scared, make some peace with your fears. I can point you to resources that support that — like FindingSteadyGround.com — but the value here is to start with trusting your own inner voice. If you need to stop checking your phone compulsively, do it. If you don’t want to read this article now and instead take a good walk, do it.\nTrust all these things inside of you because trust in self is part of the foundation of a healthy movement life.\nI promise I’ll head towards practical resistance strategies. But the emotional landscape matters a great deal. Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism” explored how destructive ideologies like fascism and autocracy grow. She used the word verlassenheit — often translated as loneliness — as a central ingredient. As she meant it, loneliness isn’t a feeling but a kind of social isolation of the mind. Your thinking becomes closed off to the world and a sense of being abandoned to each other.\nShe’s identifying a societal breakdown that we’re all experiencing. Under a Trump presidency, this trend will continue to accelerate. The constant attacks on social systems — teachers, health care and infrastructure — make us turn away from leaning on each other and towards ideologically simple answers that increase isolation (e.g. “distrust government,” “MAGA is nuts,” “anyone who votes that way doesn’t care about you”).\nIn extreme cases, like Chile in the 1970s and ‘80s, the dictatorship aimed to keep people in such tiny nodes of trust that everyone was an island unto themselves. At social gatherings and parties, people would commonly not introduce each other by name out of fear of being too involved. Fear breeds distance.\nWe have to consciously break that distance. In Chile they organized under the guise of affinity groups. This was, as its name suggests, people who shared some connections and trust. Finding just a few people who you trust to regularly act with and touch base with is central.\nFollowing Trump’s win: Get some people to regularly touch base with. Use that trust to explore your own thinking and support each other to stay sharp and grounded.\nFor the last several months I’ve been hosting a regular group at my house to “explore what is up with these times.” Our crew thinks differently but invests in trust. We emote, cry, sing, laugh, sit in stillness and think together.\nI’ve written an agenda for such gatherings right after a Trump win that you can use.\nAll of us will benefit from actively organized nodes to help stabilize us. In a destabilized society, you need people who help ground you.\nNo matter what we try to do, there’s going to be a lot of loss. The human thing to do is grieve. (Well, apparently humans are also very good at compartmentalizing, rationalizing, intellectualizing and ignoring — but the damage it does to our body and psyche is pretty well documented.)\nIf you aren’t a feelings person, let me say it this way: The inability to grieve is a strategic error. After Donald Trump won in 2016, we all saw colleagues who never grieved. They didn’t look into their feelings and the future — and as a result they remained in shock. For years they kept saying, “I can’t believe he’s doing that…”\nAn alternative: Start by naming and allowing feelings that come to arise. The night that Donald Trump won in 2016, I stayed up until 4 a.m. with a colleague. It was a tear-filled night of naming things that we had just lost. The list ranged from the political to the deeply personal:\n“Trump will leave the Paris Climate Agreement and that means much of the world will soft pedal its climate plans.”\n“Ugh, I’m gonna have this man in my dreams. We’re all going to sleep less and wake up to bat-shit crazy headlines each morning.”\n“Trump’s gonna constantly attack immigrants — the wall may or may not happen, but he’s gonna raise the threshold for racism. I don’t think I can take it.”\n“Friends I know who signed up for DACA are never going to trust government again.”\nAnd on and on. It wasn’t only a list, but it was finding the impact inside of us of sadness, anger, numbness, shock, confusion and fear. We alternated between rageful spouts and tears. We grieved. We cried. We held each other. We breathed. We dove back into naming all the bad things we knew we’d lost and things we thought we’d be likely to lose.\nIt wasn’t anywhere near strategizing or list-making or planning. It was part of our acceptance that losing a presidency to an awful man means you and your people lose a lot. Ultimately, this helped us believe it — so we didn’t spend years in a daze: “I can’t believe this is happening in this country.”\nBelieve it. Believe it now. Grief is a pathway to that acceptance.\nGrowing up my mom had a copy of the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.” Notably, that prayer comes from theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as he was watching the rise of Nazis in Germany.\nTrump’s first day likely includes pardoning Jan. 6 insurrectionists, reallocating money to build the wall, pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, and firing 50,000-plus government workers to begin replacing them with loyalists. There’s little reason to believe that day two will get much quieter.\nUnder a Trump presidency, there are going to be so many issues that it will be hard to accept that we cannot do it all. I’m reminded of a colleague in Turkey who told me, “There’s always something bad happening every day. If we had to react to every bad thing, we’d never have time to eat.”\nAn elder once saw me trying to do everything and pulled me aside. “That’s not a healthy lifelong strategy,” she said. She’d been raised in Germany by the generation of Holocaust survivors who told her, “Never again.” She took it personally, as if she had to stop every wrong. It wracked her and contributed to several serious ongoing medical conditions. We can accept our humanity or suffer that lack of acceptance.\nChaos is a friend of the autocrat. One way we can unwittingly assist is by joining in the story that we have to do it all.\nOver the last few months I’ve been testing out a terribly challenging tool. It’s a journaling exercise that invites you to reflect on which issues you’ll spend energy on. It asks: what are issues you’ll throw down on, do a lot for, a little for, or — despite caring about it — do nothing at all for? That last question can feel like a kind of torture for many activists, even while we’re intellectually aware that we cannot stop it all.\nUnaddressed, this desire to act on everything leads to bad strategy. Nine months ago when we gathered activists to scenario plan together, we took note of two knee-jerk tendencies from the left that ended up largely being dead-ends in the face of Trump:\nThe first is where we look around at bad things happening and make sure other people know about them, too. We satisfy the social pressure of our friends who want us to show outrage — but the driving moves are only reactive. The end result wasn’t the intended action or an informed population. It’s demoralizing us. It’s hurting our capacity for action. Public angsting as a strategy is akin to pleading with the hole in the boat to stop us from sinking.\nSymbolic actions may fare little better under a Trump presidency. In whatever version of democracy we had, the logic of rallies and statements of outrage was to build a unified front that showed the opposition many voices were opposed to them. But under an unleashed fascist — if it’s all you do — it’s like begging the suicidal captain to plug the hole.\nLet me be clear. These strategies will be part of the mix. We’ll need public angsting and symbolic actions. But if you see an organization or group who only relies on these tactics, look elsewhere. There are other, more effective ways to engage.\nI’ve been writing scenarios of how a Trump presidency might play out. (You can read the scenarios written as a choose-your-own-adventure-style book at WhatIfTrumpWins.org or order the book.) The initial weeks look chaotic no matter what. But over time some differentiated resistance pathways begin to emerge.\nOne pathway is called “Protecting People.” These are folks surviving and protecting our own — especially those of us directly targeted, such as trans people, folks choosing abortions and immigrants. This might mean organizing outside current systems for health care and mutual aid, or moving resources to communities that are getting targeted. Further examples include starting immigrant welcoming committees, abortion-support funds or training volunteers on safety skills to respond to white nationalist violence.\nAnother pathway is “Defending Civic Institutions.” This group may or may not be conscious that current institutions don’t serve us all, but they are united in understanding that Trump wants them to crumble so he can exert greater control over our lives. Each bureaucracy will put up its own fight to defend itself.\nInsider groups will play a central battle against Trump fascism. You may recall government scientists dumping copious climate data onto external servers, bracing for Trump’s orders. This time, many more insiders understand it’s code red. Hopefully, many will bravely refuse to quit — and instead choose to stay inside as long as possible.\nInstitutional pillars understand a Trump presidency is a dire threat. The military, for one, is well aware that Trump’s potential orders to use them to crack down on civilian protesters would politicize them permanently.\nThese insiders will need external support. Sometimes it’s just folks showing compassion that some of our best allies will be inside, silently resisting. A culture of celebrating people getting fired for the right reasons would help (then offering them practical help with life’s next steps). Other moments will need open support and public activation.\nThen there’s a critical third pathway: “Disrupt and Disobey.” This goes beyond protesting for better policies and into the territory of people intervening to stop bad policies or showing resistance.\nInitially a lot of that prefigurative work may be purely symbolic. In Norway, to create a culture of resistance during World War II people wore innocuous paperclips as a sign they wouldn’t obey. The symbolism is to build preparation for mass strikes and open resistance. In Serbia, protests against their dictator started with student strikes before escalating to strikes by pensioners (which were both largely symbolic) before finally escalating to the game-changing strike of coal miners.\nIn effective “Disrupt and Disobey” type actions the ultimate goal is paving a path for mass noncooperation: tax resistance, national strikes, work shut-downs and other nonviolent mass disobedience tactics — the most effective strategies to displace authoritarians. (Training on how to do that in a new Trump era can be found here.)\nLastly, there’s a key fourth role: “Building Alternatives.” We can’t just be stuck reacting and stopping the bad. We have to have a vision. This is the slow growth work of building alternative ways that are more democratic. It includes grounding and healing work, rich cultural work, alternative ways of growing food and caring for kids, participatory budgeting or seeding constitutional conventions to build a majoritarian alternative to the Electoral College mess we’re in.\nEach of us may be attracted to some pathways more than others.\nMyself, I’m attracted to “Disrupt and Disobey” — though I know when certain moments hit I’ll be pulled into some immediate “Protecting People.” I’m perhaps too impatient for most “Building Alternatives” and too unhappy with the status quo to do “Defend Civic Institutions.” However, I’m delighted others will do that work!\nI’m reminded of another way of finding your role that comes from my friend Ingrid’s grandfather, who lived in Norway under the Nazi regime. He learned that the resistance was hiding people in the basement of a church near a cemetery. As a florist he already traveled to and from the cemetery — so he found a role smuggling messages in funeral wreaths, delivering them all over the city.\nHe didn’t go out designing his perfect role. In fact, I’m not sure he would have looked at the list of possible “roles” and found his political path. Instead, he found his space by circumstance.\nIn other words: Your path may not be clear right now. That’s okay. There will be plenty of opportunities to join the resistance.\nThe Washington Post and Los Angeles Times’ cowardly refusal to endorse a political candidate is, it appears, a classic example of self-censorship. Trump did not have to make a direct threat to these media outlets. Their own leadership told them to “sit this one out.”\nWhy? Because they wanted to stay safe.\nIf autocrats teach us any valuable lesson it’s this: Political space that you don’t use, you lose.\nThis is a message to all levels of society: lawyers advising nonprofits, leaders worried about their funding base, folks worried about losing their jobs.\nI’m not coaching to never self-protect. You can decide when to speak your mind. But it is a phenomenally slippery slope here we have to observe and combat.\nTimothy Snyder has written a helpful book called “On Tyranny” — and turned it into a video series. He cites ceding power as the first problem to tackle, writing: “Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.”\nPut simply: Use the political space and voice you have.\nA few months ago I sat in a room with retired generals, Republicans like Michael Steele, ex-governors and congress people. We were scenario-planning ways to prevent using the Insurrection Act to target civilian protesters, playing step-by-step who would give the orders to whom and how the worst could be avoided.\nFor a committed antiwar activist, the phrase “strange bedfellows” doesn’t begin to describe the bizarre experience I felt.\nI came out of it realizing that a Trump presidency reshapes alignments and possibilities. The bellicose, blasphemous language of Trump will meet the practical reality of governing. When you’re out of power, it’s easy to unify — but their coalition’s cracks will quickly emerge. We have to stay sharp for opportunities to cleave off support.\nHow we position ourselves matters: Are we interested in engaging with people unhappy with the regime — whether because they love the current institutions or are unhappy with Trump’s policies on them? Are we able to tell a story that explains how we got here — and do political education? Or are we only interested in maintaining ideological purity and preaching to our own choir?\nEven if you don’t want to engage with them (which is fine), we’ll all have to give space to those who do experiment with new language to appeal to others who don’t share our worldview of a multiracial true democracy.\nEmpathy will be helpful here. I write all this with a particular moment in mind: At the end of the scenario day, we whipped around the room with conclusions. The generals said “The military cannot stop Trump from giving these orders.” Politicians said “Congress cannot stop it.” The lawyers said “We cannot stop it.”\nI could see a lot of pain in high-ranking people of great power admitting a kind of defeat. I felt a level of compassion that surprised me.\nOnly the left activists said: We have an approach of mass noncooperation that can stop this. But we’d need your help.\nI’m not sure that projected confidence was well-received. But if we’re going to live into that (and I’m far from certain we can), we have to get real about power.\nWaging Nonviolence depends on reader support to produce articles like this. Please become a monthly donor today!\nDonateIn Trump’s first term, the left’s organizing had mixed results. With John McCain’s assistance, we were able to block Trump’s health proposal. Rallies proved less and less effective as time went on. The airport shutdowns showed that disruptive action can activate the public and helped pave the way for the court’s dismissal over the Muslim ban. But Trump was still able to win huge tax cuts and appoint right-wing Supreme Court judges. The narrative lurched, and sizeble chunks of the population have now been captivated by the “Big Lie.” It was elections that ultimately stopped Trump.\nThis time will be much harder.\nThe psychological exhaustion and despair is much higher. Deploying people into the streets for mass actions with no clear outcome will grow that frustration, leading to dropout and radicalized action divorced from strategy.\nTrump has been very clear about using his political power to its fullest — stretching and breaking the norms and laws that get in his way. The movement will constantly be asking itself: “Are you able to stop this new bad thing?”\nWe’re not going to convince him not to do these things. No pressure on Republicans will result in more than the tiniest of crumbs (at least initially). We’re not going to stop him from doing these things just by persuasive tactics or showing that there are a LOT of us who oppose them.\nIt will be helpful to have a power analysis in our minds, specifically that’s known as the upside-down triangle. This tool was built to explain how power moves even under dictatorships.\nThe central tenet is that like an upside-down triangle, power can be unstable. It naturally topples over without anything supporting it. To prevent that, power relies on pillars of support to keep it upright.\nCasually, the left often focuses on pillars of support that include governments, media, corporations, shareholders and policy makers. Describing the pillars of support, Gene Sharp wrote:\nBy themselves, rulers cannot collect taxes, enforce repressive laws and regulations, keep trains running on time, prepare national budgets, direct traffic, manage ports, print money, repair roads, keep markets supplied with food, make steel, build rockets, train the police and army, issue postage stamps or even milk a cow. People provide these services to the ruler though a variety of organizations and institutions. If people would stop providing these skills, the ruler could not rule.\nRemoving one pillar of support can often gain major, life-saving concessions. In response to Trump’s 2019 government shutdown, flight attendants prepared a national strike. Such a strike would ground planes across the country and a key transportation network. Within hours of announcing they were “mobilizing immediately” for a strike, Trump capitulated.\nAnother example comes from the recently deceased long-time activist Dick Taylor. In his book “Blockade,” he writes about how he and a tiny group changed U.S. foreign policy by repeatedly blocking armaments sent to support Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan. The ragtag crew sent canoes to block mighty military shipments leaving from East Coast ports until eventually the International Longshoremen’s Association was persuaded to refuse to load them. This broke the back of national policy.\nFor larger system change we have to look outside of recent U.S. organizing. A good place to start is with Waging Nonviolence’s recent interview series with folks sharing key lessons on fighting autocracies and aiming for system change.\nIn our country, pressuring elite power is reaching its end point. Power will need to emerge from folks no longer obeying the current unjust system. This tipping point of mass noncooperation will be messy. It means convincing a lot of people to take huge personal risks for a better option.\nAs a “Disrupt and Disobey” person, we have to move deliberately to gain the trust of others, like the “Protecting People” folks. Mass noncooperation does the opposite of their goal of protection — it exposes people to more risk, more repression. But with that comes the possibility that we could get the kind of liberatory government that we all truly deserve.\nOtpor in Serbia has provided an abundance of examples on how to face repression. They were young people who took a sarcastic response to regular police beatings. They would joke amongst each other, “It only hurts if you’re scared.”\nTheir attitude wasn’t cavalier — it was tactical. They were not going to grow fear. So when hundreds were beaten on a single day, their response was: This repression will only stiffen the resistance.\nThis is attitude.\nThey were also practical. They would follow their arrested protesters to jail cells and insist on making sure they were being treated well. They would target police who beat them up — showing up outside their houses with pictures of the people they beat up. Their call was rooted in the future they wanted: “You’ll have a chance to join us.”\nHandling fear isn’t about suppressing it — but it is about constantly redirecting. One activist described to me two motions in the universe: shrinking or expansion. When Donald Trump directs the Justice Department to use sedition charges against protesters or arrest his political enemies like Jamie Raskin or Liz Cheney, what’s our response?\nActivist/intellectual Hardy Merriman released a studied response about political violence that had some news that surprised me. The first was that physical political violence hasn’t grown dramatically in this country — it still remains relatively rare. The threats of violence, however, trend upwards, such as this CNN report: “Politically motivated threats to public officials increased 178 percent during Trump’s presidency,” primarily from the right.\nHis conclusion wasn’t that political violence isn’t going to grow. Quite the opposite. But he noted that a key component to political violence is to intimidate and tell a story that they are the true victims. Making political violence rebound requires refusing to be intimidated and resisting those threats so they can backfire. (Training on this backfire technique is available from the HOPE-PV guide.)\nWe can shrink into a cacophony of “that’s not fair,” which fuels the fear of repression. Or we take a page from the great strategist Bayard Rustin.\nBlack civil rights leaders were targeted by the government of Montgomery, Alabama during the bus boycott in the 1950s. Leaders like the newly appointed Martin Luther King Jr. went into hiding after police threats of arrest based on antiquated anti-boycott laws. Movement organizer Rustin organized them to go down to the station and demand to be arrested since they were leaders — making a positive spectacle of the repression. Some leaders not on police lists publicly demanded they, too, get arrested. Folks charged were met with cheers from crowds, holding their arrest papers high in the air. Fear was turned into valor.\nI don’t feel certain, and I’m not predicting we win. But we’ve all now imagined storylines about how bad it might get. We would do ourselves a service to spend an equal measure of time envisioning how we might advance our cause in these conditions. As writer Walidah Imarisha says, “The goal of visionary fiction is to change the world.”\nIn my mind, we’ll have to eventually get Trump out of office. There are two paths available.\nThe first: Vote him out. Given the bias of the electoral college, this requires successfully defending nearly all local, state and national takeovers of elections such that they remain relatively fair and free.\nWinning via the path of electoral majority has a wide swath of experience and support from mainstream progressive organizations and Democratic institutions. It’s going to be a major thrust.\nIn my scenario writing I’ve explored what that strategy could look like, including preparing electoral workers to stand against last minute attempts by Trump to change election rules and even stymie the election with dubious emergency orders. They don’t obey — and go ahead with elections anyway.\nThe second strategy is if he illegally refuses to leave or allow fair elections: Kick him out. That means we are able to develop a national nonviolent resistance campaign capable of forcing him out of office.\nI’ve written several versions of this: One where large-scale strikes disable portions of the U.S. economy. If you recall from COVID, our systems are extremely vulnerable. Businesses running “just in time” inventory means small hiccups in the system can cause cascading effects.\nSustained strikes would face deep resistance, but they could swing communities currently on the fence, like the business community, which already is concerned about Trump’s temperamental nature. Trump’s own policies might make these conditions much easier. If he really does mass deportations, the economic injury might be fatal.\nIn another scenario I explore another strategy of taking advantage of a Trump overreach. Autocrats overplay their hands. And in this imagined scenario, Trump overreaches when he attempts to force autoworkers to stop building electric vehicles. UAW workers refuse and keep the factories running. Eventually he’s unable to stop them — but in the process he’s publicly humiliated.\nA very public loss like this can cause what Timur Kuran calls an “unanticipated revolution.” He noted many incidents where political leaders seem to have full support, then suddenly it evaporates. He gives as an example the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79. “None of the major intelligence organizations — not even the CIA or the KGB — expected Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s regime to collapse. Right up to the revolution, they expected him to weather the gathering storm.”\nKuran’s analysis reminds us to look at Trump’s political weakness. Political hacks like Lindsay Graham appear to be sycophants — but if given the chance to turn their knife in his back, they might. This means exposed political weaknesses could quickly turn the many inside Trump’s campaign against him.\nThat feels far away from now. But all these remain possibilities. Practicing this future thinking and seeing into these directions gives me some hope and some strategic sensibilities.\nOn the days when I can’t sense any of these political possibilities (more than not), I zoom out further to the lifespans of trees and rocks, heading into spiritual reminders that nothing lasts forever.\nAll of the future is uncertain. But using these things, we’re more likely to have a more hopeful future and experience during these turbulent times.\nUPDATE 11/6/24: This story was published prior to the election and updated on Nov. 6 to reflect the results.\nCORRECTIONS 11/6/24: Hardy Merriman’s name was incorrectly spelled. And the quote from Otpor was mistated as “It doesn’t hurt if you’re afraid.”\nThank you SO MUCH. Since it is 1:30am EST the day after the election and the prospect of having a sociopathic President looms large, I immediately began looking for resources that would provide “what’s next?” Will share this article with my network.\nThank you. I needed to read this so I could get some sleep tonight and prepare for how to fight tomorrow.\nI really needed this today, and it was so insightful and empowering. I’m currently an expat in Germany with the intention to come home, so I have a cool advantage out here. I’ll be searching for local groups and putting together action plans instead of sinking into doom and despair. Sharing with all my readers and friends!\nThank you for this much-needed article. I plan on sharing it with like-minded individuals in the morning.\nThank you for this – people need proactive suggestions for how to get involved and effect change\nThank you Daniel, This comprehensive hopeful view of how we need to think about making the world we want in the face of chaos and authoritarianism gives direction to all of us.\nWriting to thank you for this as, even here in Canada, i wept in the night when i saw what was unfolding. I felt so desperate as this awfulness is affecting the Canadian political landscape and i was scared and really needed to read something such as you have written here .I found it posted by an American friend…It’s so important. I feel less lost and afraid.\nThank you for this grounding and insightful call to action. I will try to take it to heart (and head).\nThank you. This is a lifesaver and I will be sharing with my friends and family.\nThank you, nearing my Century birth: have always been aware of “take over” power structures snd resisting them!\nThank you for updating the tools snd possibilities for me…again…even in my “old age”.\nThis is so helpful today! The scared parts of me needed to hear that somebody had suggestions for positive action.\nThis is incredibly helpful. Am reading this on the day after the elections and you have turned my dispair into determination. Thank you so much!\nVery interesting. Feels good just to find something that has thought through these scenarios. I’m wondering about the scenario where Trump’s health pretty quickly takes a nosedive, they remove him for it and we’re looking at a Vance administration. Same strategies?\nThere’s a lot to digest here. Thank you for all these strategies and possibilities. I spent 16 hours working the poll yesterday. When I got home, I poured myself a glass of wine, and sat in our hot tub. I gazed up to the night sky. The stars were countless. I thought to myself- the stars are not going to stop sparkling. They don’t care about this temporary reality. This too will pass. The world will continue to spin. I am exhausted and distraught today, but tomorrow, I will try to imagine where I fit in to this work. Thank you.\nThank you for this! I need it! And countless others do as well. I’m going to share this with many others.\nThank you for posting this. I was looking for ways to calm myself down in the morning after the election. I was feeling powerless, and this article gave me some hope and perspective.\nAt 67 to wake today knowing that in the 70s when i fought to just wear pants and not skirts to public school and ended up suspended, i would 55 years later be waking up to men tracking my reproductive organs to put me in jail\nRight now I’m sad, depressed and tired, but I appreciate your thoughtful analysis and suggestions. I’m 75 years old and angry at my generation. And I wonder if we are watching the demise of the American democratic dream. But I hope there is a path to a better future.

Any suggestions on a common communication network to join?\nTHANK YOU\nAs said by so many others, THANK YOU for these suggestions and links. I’m feeling quite hopeless, and scared for the earth, animals, plants, people who are not conservative white males. I’m so sad for Ukraine, what the people must feel. These are logical, well thought-out and practical steps to take. I’m hoping I will be able to stop crying and stressing to find people to join.\nAnd I would also ask, as someone else did, how can I find others that feel the same?\nThank you so much, this information, thoughtfulness and global examples helps me feel grounded going forward. I have already shared with all my circles and hope everyone who reads it does the same.\nThank you. This is the most helpful thing I have read so far this morning.\nI am in shock and in distress being 63 year old gay woman. I don’t know how I can do it anymore. I consider myself a patriot, but I feel defeated my family has been in Florida since the 1700s I’ve been in Florida all my life never had a passport, but now I will be getting a passport and eventually moving out of the United States if I survive that’s how I feel if I survive I have a 22-year-old gay grandson that I hope survives .\nSlfarris13@yahoo.com\nThis was forwarded to me by a friend and I found it most helpful with realistic expectations and plans.\nI expect to implement with mu Unitarian Universalist congregation.\nI’m not sure what you mean by saying we’ll have to either vote Trump out or kick him out. The Constitution bars Trump from running for another term after this one. We may have to kick him out if he goes full dictator, but I can’t see how we’ll ever get a chance to vote him out again. Do you mean that when his term expires, he’ll try to install a puppet president to act on his behalf?\nWe should also be prepared for a third possibility: he dies in office, and then it’s Vance we have to deal with. Is the playbook for dealing with him the same as for Trump?\nA church where my singing group meets had the “What if Trump Wins” book out on a table, and I have had to turn in over every time we sing in that room because his face has become so triggering to me. But I think I may end up getting the book. And maybe start attending that church.\nI am in such a distrusting mode I am afraid to give my name and email address. I have lived more than 80 years in a country I have always been proud of. My grief at where we are now is tremendous. I guess I am still in denial that this could happen in America.\nI hope what you are doing can make a difference.\nThank you. I needed this today. My first reaction to the election was to withdraw. Now I can see a way forward.\nI really needed this article today, thank you so much.\nPray for strength and peace that surpasses all human understanding\nThank you. Very helpful.\nGreat reading…gives me hope…lots of actionable ideas….thank you\nThankyou!!!!!\n“The military cannot stop Trump from giving these orders.” No, but they also cannot obey these orders. Members of the military take an oath to the Constitution, and the Nuremberg Trials made clear that following orders is not a defense. I wonder how many will refuse to follow unconstitutional orders. Not many, I’ll bet.\nThis is truly worth passing on. Thank you.\nReally appreciate this post.\nOne correction though: the LA Times didn’t refuse to endorse a candidate because of cowardice, but because of their stance on Palestine. The owners have come out in opposition to the democratic party’s support of apartheid in Palestine. Notably, the LA Times’ owners are South African, and have experienced apartheid first-hand, which they have stated they refuse to endorse in any country, under any circumstance. (Sources: The LA Times owners’ daughter’s twitter account (personal tweets); https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/05/los-angeles-times-endorsement-patrick-soon-shiong-gaza; https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/los-angeles-times-endorsement-soon-shiong.html; https://nypost.com/2024/10/26/us-news/la-times-owner-blocked-kamala-endorsement-to-protest-gaza-war/).\nRegardless, thank you for your guidance and advice. Will hold this dear.\nThis entire article is helpful. Just what I needed on this first post-election day. Thanks for your encouragement and practical examples. We move forward together!\nThank you for your support and advise regarding how I may possibly feel human again. Today was so depressing. How could do many voters want this man, Trump, as a leader ? I was asking myself-at 79 can I be of any help? Your words are making me feel that yes I can!! I will find a way!\nThis is a lot to take in. I will definitely go over it with true friends. It’s the beginnng of my question, “What can I do?”\nGoing forward with hope after today’s election is a major undertaking. Trump in office is beyond heartbreaking. I feel like we are looking down a long dark tunnel. But forward we must go, with confidence in the actions of peace and nonviolence. Gandhi faced the British Empire. Certainly we can face this terror.\nReally great information and well-written. I needed to read this today and I plan on challenging myself to take action in the coming weeks and months. Your guidance and writing inspires me act.\nAfter staying up the entirety of last night, watching the numbers/crunching my own numbers, and arriving at the conclusion that we are indeed back here again, I barely made it through the work day. Defeated, deflated, despondent- just a few words to capture my mindset. I vacillated between bawling uncontrollably and numbly staring out my window.\nAnd then one of the founders of a wonderful company for which I work sent me a link to this piece. And after a quick read, I sent the link on to trusted friends, family members, and colleagues. I have since read your piece carefully and thoughtfully. And I felt my blood pressure dropped significantly. I could breathe.\nThank you for your candor and wisdom, your suggestions and warnings (for lack of a better word, my brain is running on the fumes of caffeine). I do not have to be an island; I am not alone in this. I can feel my feelings without apology. And I can do something about my anxiety, my fear, my desire to crawl under the covers and hide. For example, I can further educate myself. I can grow in the thick of thorny thistles and murky waters. I can develop a better understanding of how to bring together the things I see and hear and the feelings and thoughts I experience internally. Develop a discourse, a language by which to connect and stay connected to others. Really accept that it is healthy to grieve, and to not grieve alone. Acknowledge the resources at the ready and the skills to speak truth to power.\nThank you for this gift, one of profound wisdom and a deep understanding of what is happening. And sending all of the peace and light I possess over the wire with gratitude.\nSharing! Very articulate capsule summary of the antidotes to despair: action. I’m very eager also to disrupt the pillars of support. I am a recovering “violent person,” an addict 40 years in recovery, who has seen and writes about the generalized, unexamined addiction to control, domination and violence coming from naive delusions about our mastery. If it were not Trump, it would be some other petty tyrant. We are our own worst enemies because we don’t ask good questions about ourselves. This crisis will fortunately encourage or force us to begin that soul-searching work. I am currently working with two other Davids to make us all honorary Davids or Davidas in planning to slay the Goliath of war. lovealwayswins.us\nPatricia,\nCan you please provide reliable and credible sources to support your statement that “99.9% of this article is pure lies and scare tactics”? Absent facts and logical reasoning, it is difficult to follow or appreciate your comment. From one reader to another.\nThank you!\nAndrea\nThank you. Reading this article helped me to remember that there is so much to be done, and to begin the work within myself.\nGood work, thank you.\nI’ve been pondering these same steps for two weeks and mentioned the second to my wife today, Step by Step, getting people to play together non-violently is something I have done for 19 years, inside and outside of prisons. The methods are proven and reliable, if you stay creative, focused and committed. What other options do people of conscience have, at this point? I’ll sign up for the newsletter.\nThe first rule in life is, Do not Stop.\nThank Godde for this article and this website. I came here from the FB Group for EQUAL and EQUAL and this site are a breath of fresh air. There’s just so much despair in Progressive FB Groups and not a lot of “We Got This!”. Sure, the “We Got This!” comes and goes but a lot of people are just bitter. I’m glad to find people who are hopeful.\n@Carrie Mook Bridgman\nYou have a point. We need allies in high places.\nI hope Europe picks up the slack with regards to Ukraine.\nThank you! THE Most grounded practical strategies I’ve come across. Sharing widely.\nTHANK YOU, THUS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. 💪🇺🇸🙏🙏\nThank you for this article.\nIn the spirit of Norwegians’ wearing paper clips to signify resistance, and as an expression of my mourning, I will be wearing a black armband. Perhaps others here would like to join me?\nHello!\nI am sharing this article but the headline has not yet been updated. I want readers to know the pice itself has been updated. Just letting you know.\nThank you for this. It’s my only hope right now.\nJessie\nEvery blockade is a potential ramp. Every kindness dispells cruelty. Every loving word brings light in darkness. Stand always strong in peacemaking.\nA friend gave me a link to this article, and I have been passing it around to friends and co-workers. Everyone I’ve shown this too has found it extremely helpful. I suppose this is one way to “build the circle of trust” described herein.\nI was interested by your discussion of building coalitions with retired military and Republicans. I find it very hope-inspiring to think of the resistance coalitions that will come together to resist Trump’s agenda. I’m very willing to set aside differences in policy for the time being as we work together for the good of the country.\nTwo points that stood out to me: “Your path may not be clear right now. That’s okay.” and “The initial weeks look chaotic no matter what. But over time some differentiated resistance pathways [will] begin to emerge.” I’m focusing on that right now, because I know we’re gonna take some nasty hits. There’s no way around that. But the way forward will eventually reveal itself; it always does. In short: cultivate resilience and look for an opening. That’ll be my mantra in the coming months.\nthank you so much, its nov 7 and though i was able to stay strong most of yesterday, i find myself nearing a cliff today (so far).\ni would love to be a part of a small group, as you speak of, of people that get together and support & brainstorm with eachother.\nso many wonderful ideas and information i will surely read and re-read. thank you so very much.\nThis is the time to organize the resistance. But just doing demonstrations or “one and done,” as George Lakey says, is not enough and will not be sufficient to out organize and take back our power from the Trumpian fascists controlling all three branches of our government. These 10 steps that Daniel Hunter suggests are spot on. We need the parallel tracks of organizing a mass movement and electoral political action of registering voters, running for offices up and down the ballot as well as establishing parallel institutions and alternatives to build community, sustain joy, celebration and healing. We need to take the “long view” Reverend Jesse Jackson & Rainbow PUSH has long said. There are so many more things we can do. “Beautiful Trouble”y Andrew Boyd and “How We Can Win” by George Lakey are starting points along with this Article. As Nancy Pelosi has said, “Don’t agonize, ORGANIZE!”\nThank you for this. I will do my homework from what you have provided and begin getting educated. I’ve just enrolled in a Fierce Compassion Leadership program with the intention of using my studio to begin support work for folks struggling with the aftermath of this election. My question is this: do you have/ recommend actual training programs and what kinds- if any- of a national team structure do you have in place? Are there local teams? If I want to start one, how does an uneducated newbie do so?\nThank you. We needed that.\nYeah baby! I’m so thrilled with this. Up for most if not all of what you suggest but I ask you: could you write a version of disrupt and disobey for Oldies?! Paperclips we can definitely handle. (I’m still only an Aspiring Oldie but have lots of friends who are wondering what “take to the streets” looks like for our generation.)\nI lived in a post-totalitarian society for two decades and saw both the erosion of agency that lingered in the new era, making it possible for the next misuses of political power, and worked with individuals on what needed psychic repair. The old collective traumas need tending to. You get at the fundamentals I recognize like fear, isolation, and obeying in advance…\nHuge thanks.\nThank you. I’m all in. It will take me sometime to absorb and understand all that you offer here. I will persist. I will act.\nWow! That is so helpful! It reverberates into other relationships and issues in my life. I choose to NOT react to every Clorox-swallowing comment.\nThank you. A great help in focusing my mind and soothing my heart.\nThis is a very helpful and inspirational article in these trying times. Things are very unsure and scary right now but as long as we’re still here there is still hope.\nSo very very grateful for all the work you and your team are doing!!! The tips and references are so very helpful\nIt is not just Trump, but what led to Trump – an ignorant and tired blighted populace, lame Democrats who ignored our econ crisis. Wondering now if it is in prep for a world war, a strong leader getting people to heel. Also, mimics right-wing rise in Europe.\nThis is so valuable! Exactly what I need as I move into vigilant acceptance. Thank you!\nThank you for this. It has helped calm my heart and mind from near constant panic. Now I want to build my collective of resistance and have shared this with like minded friends.\nWhile the Retrumplicans now hold all branches of government, they WILL institute Project 2025. After all of the voter suppression laws are then passed, they will use the 25th Amendment to remove tRump, installing Vance as KING for life. How do we “organize” against that? While DISINFORMATION is still the norm? While even “liberal”-leaning media still “sane-washes” tRump? Hoping for an answer; I have a daughter planning a wedding/family…and feel absolutely HOPELESS.\nSomewhere in the article or on findingsteadyground.com, you asked to let you know how your article is being used. Here is the email I sent out to our IndivisibleWorcester.org members.\nHello,\nMy daughter sent me a link to an article on Wagingnonviolence.org titled 10 Ways to be Prepared and Grounded Now that Trump has Won (link to it HERE). Being open to any inspiration, I read it. It is long, but it quickly filled me with hope. It has also inspired me to begin our recovery process. We are not the first nation to face fascism and repression. Some of the lessons in the article build on successes others have won around the world when oppressed. I founded Indivisible Worcester in 2019 as an outlet for political action. The concrete actions this article open us to has dissipated my feelings of powerlessness and despair. It may give you hope too.\nTo begin the strength building process, I decided to see if anyone is interested in meeting in person this Sunday at 9 am at NuCafe, 335 Chandler Street, Worcester. The 10 Ways article linked to FindingSteadyGround.com, which lists “7 behaviors we can use right away to strengthen ourselves, so we can keep taking more and more powerful and strategic actions.”\nThis list of actions will be the basis of our discussion on Sunday, once everyone has had 2-3 minutes to express their fears raised by the election results. You can download a pdf of the 7 behaviors here.\nPlease email me if you plan on coming Sunday. I will be there, sitting in the back right corner, by the rear exit. Hope to see you!\nIn Support and Solidarity,\nMary\nThank you\n“When your reference points are shaken, remain curious and open, trust your inner vision and maintain a healthy sense of humor.”\nWhere do I find the agenda you mentioned below? Thanks.\n“For the last several months I’ve been hosting a regular group at my house to “explore what is up with these times.” Our crew thinks differently but invests in trust. We emote, cry, sing, laugh, sit in stillness and think together.\nI’ve written an agenda for such gatherings right after a Trump win that you can use.”\nI believe in not telling my opponent what mistakes he’s making.\nAn excellent article, however, I take issue with the assertion that the Serenity Prayer was written by theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as he was watching the rise of Nazi Germany. There is a lot of debate as to the origin of the Serenity Prayer and who actually wrote it. To say that the motivation for the creation of the prayer was based on the rise of fascism in Germany is a fabrication. I can find no historical evidence to support this claim. Please, we need truth in the times in which we live.\nHi Jacqueline,\nYou should be able to access the link here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Y8GV9YqdyPOzwPVZXuTp2vvvgLbcrrUSaOsvIW8dqE/edit?tab=t.0\nThis is great information that restores my hope and gives me a path to think about how I can contribute to the resistance. Thank you.\nThank you. Please continue to send more information and tips. I’ll share with friends and Democratic contacts.\nThank you💙👍\nVery heartening and interesting! I will pass these thoughts on to others.\nWhy not try to be peaceful citizens and get a candidate who will win next time.\nThank you for this. It’s a great starting point. The question on my mind, though, is: How much of this still works when Vance forces Trump out and takes the Presidency? He and Johnson seem like the long-term threat, rather than Trump.\nWill the military go door to door to the people who are democrats and shoot or jail them if given the order from Trump?\nJust wonderful, Daniel. So helpful and hopeful. I’ll look forward to more thoughts as well as the development of small groups to support each other from one of the four orientations you mention. As I discern what I am now called to do as an elder it will be vital so I feel I am part of a community and not just doing things on my own.\nWith much gratitude,\nPhyllis Taylor\nJust what I needed !!\nThis is EXACTLY what I needed to read today (and tomorrow, and maybe every day for a good long while). I feel like I can finally exhale and start looking for ways forward. Thank you!\nIn your section on institutional change I would like to point out there is already a grass roots movement to change the way we vote. It’s call RCV ranked choice voting. It works in Alaska and Main. It is gaining traction in Colorado. Keep that in your back pocket for when we need to restructure.\nIt is so wonderful to see so many here wanting to do something positive and help to make changes that we need, yet what about us seniors, I am old, LOL…yet I feel half my age which is 80, my mind is sharp as is my tongue. I lived a long time and have been a volunteer in politics all my life yet this has torn me apart, never in a zillion years would I think to see the end of my America and that is what I fear. I was married to an idiot just like T and who even almost looked like him, evil beyond belief and I fear we are all in for a horrible ride to hell and back….T hates women, they belong in the bedroom only for him, 2 speaks out of both sides of his mouth and nothing coming out is honest or true, boy do I know that. I want to do something yet what at my age I wonder….Democrats are now targets for the GOP who want them dead than alive……Liz Cheney is on T’s hit list for sure, if I was her, I would need bodyguards and a bullet proof vest when out in public. Take care out there and keep calm and keep in contact very quietly.\nThis article is the grandest, most long-winded, and epic way of demonstrating mass delusion I have ever seen in my life. Wow! Autocrat? Put the crack pipe down please. Trump has the same amount of power that every previous president has had. He is no more an autocrat than Joe Biden is. Where is your hysteria and panic regarding Sleepy Joe’s power? Where is your outrage over Sleepy Joe having his political opposition arrested? Oh, it’s ok if it’s Trump who is arrested and charged with 100+ felonies in one of the most blatant and outrageous show trials ever in the history of the USA. Where was your outrage over the Democrats weaponizing the justice system against their political opposition? The double-standard is jaw-dropping. How can anyone engage in such hypocrisy? What’s good for the goose is good for the gander. And, it was LEFTISTS who pulled out all the stops in their decent into madness and a cult of anti-personality. The rhetoric from this article is so over-the-top it is scary that people actually believe in this hysteria over this alleged “autocrat”. I mean, check your own backyard before you go leveling accusations about what Trump is “going to do”. Your Dems already did it!! This whole sordid affair is just a demonstration of how susceptible -no… enthusiastic a whole segment of the population is to being brainwashed into this cult of anti-personality! I mean, you people have ignored your own lying eyes in order to believe in this whole sordid witch hunt and demonization of ONE MAN! It is scary how disconnected from reality people have become. You carry on like Trump had secret police and torture chambers in his first term and are returning for his second term! Get real! And stop believing all the hysterical a accusations of the corrupt main stream media. The MSM is the weapon of choice for the Bankers that own the world. They have been cramming globalist policies down our throats with decades of corrupt career politicians on their payroll. And, when Truml won his first term we finally had a populist president loyal to the American people instead of the bankers. And the bankers were pissed! They used their bought and paid for MSM to launch one of the most obvious smear campaigns ever seen. Trump almost secured peace with North Korea and the media refused to give Trump any fair coverage. Just smear after smear and spinning everything to demonize Trump. They even had a running list of “Trump’s lies”! Name me any previous president, senator, or congressman that the media ever even accused of telling a single lie! Please! Every previous president gave us “campaign promises” that they promptly ignored once elected. And the media never bothered to report on these i disputable lies! Trump DID what he promised he would do in his campaign. The first president in my lifetime who kept his word to the American people…. and the media accuses him of lying by spinning facts and nitpicking on his him getting details wrong. Has the blatant double standard of the MSM gone completely unnoticed by Democrats? Do you value the notion of fair play? Or is it all good as long as it’s the opposition that is getting smeared endlessly? Are your values and standards negotiable and ever changing according to WHO the subject is? What happened to the lofty claims of idealism that Liberals claim for themselves? One standard please and a sincere effort at objectivity will bring us all together. I know you can do it. We are all better together.\nIn that respect, I can fully admit Trump can be abrasive and unlikeable at times. Buy, at the end of the day it is about his policy. Not his personality. We are not marrying the guy. We don’t need to love him or even like him. We just want a president who acts in the interests of the Ameican people instead of the “elites” & globalists. At least that’s what the working class wants. I suspect many of you Trump haters aren’t being worked to death like the working class is and you have the luxury of hating on a president due to his personality. In that case, you probably also consider yourselves “elite” and your Trump Derangement Syndrome is a manifestation of your pride, elitism, and beliefs in your own superiority. You have no idea how revolting that is to the rest of us grinding out a living every day.\nPride is a mofo.\nGoodnight and I love you my fellow Americans.\nThis article is like oxygen for the resistance. Thank you for your courage!\nDaniel, I’m grateful for your work and writing here and have a suggestion that might make the first section more useful for readers. Where you listed the things that had you in grief – for example, Trump pulling us out of climate change agreements – if you can add to the item not only the concern but also the longing underneath it – we ache to be part of a society that contributes to reducing climate catastrophe; we long to see our country and the whole world work toward a safe environment for all. From here we can more easily feel our grief and bring compassion to it – “of course I long for an end to climate catastrophe! Of course I want society to take responsibility to stop this disaster!” Moving to what we long for can help us feel and bring compassion to the deep grief for what we don’t have.\nI wish to thank you for sharing this first thing that I’ve read that has eased some of my helplessness and despair. I’ve already begun sharing. I’m not sure I understand number ten though, given that the election is over? But yes, connecting with anything spiritual that helps one feel part of something larger than this, with nature, sounds vital.\nThank you for your words of wisdom. After lack of sleep and discouragement that I live in a country that refuses to support 2 brilliant qualified women to be president of our country & choose instead this unqualified man is horrible. I am a 76 years & dreamed that I would be able to see a woman elected President in my lifetime so now I advise my grandchildren that there is still a lot of work to do. Your article gives me hope\nYou left out getting involved in your community and running for local office. School board, village board, parks board…we need to build trust from the ground up. Run in your local munis and advocate for welcoming communities. Safely steward our local budgets. Most of this work is non-partisan. Voting is not enough!\nThank you so much for this map forward. There’s a place for all of us in the resistance. As I was reading, I began to imagine ways to gather with those around me in a different meaningful way, discussing possibilities, not just the doom we feel now. I will share this piece far and wide and begin to take action. I’m a “disrupt an disobey” person myself. I’ll meet you in the struggle.\nThe foundation of our losses in this election is our unabashed failure to communicate to and with MAGA folks. FOX and CNN served as useless echo chambers; educating no one and not reaching the other side of the aisle because they don’t watch them. National division was expanded and reinforced by this failure. Ultimately the Democrats failed miserably to listen, consider and debate MAGA’s chief concern (the cost of living.) ENdless, self-righteous esoteric discussions, by our left leaning and highly educated pundits, about democracy, tyranny, orange makeup and rude rallies entirely MISSED the point. MAGA didn’t pay any attention to our brilliant discourses on economics, geopolitics or fraud. They were and are laser focused on their (our) shattered purchasing power. We missed that, and missed innumerable opportunities to engage them on their level and their issue. We need to look in the mirror and realize that we are not right because we have a prideful grand image of ourselves.\nLoved the article. My one small contribution: Document hosted at Google in now on IPFS (Much harder to censor). We should all be mindful of digital footprints we leave (google now will *forever* know I was interested in this doc)… remember too the services we rely and to whom they will remain loyal if / when things get crazy.\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbxJK88FQRzZB1SFCJKWbEc4dLd8pg8VMJ4dnGsguQj9B\nthanks very much\n@pwnallthethings.bsky.social Quote:\nThe main thing you need to know is that the system of fascism is designed to make you give up and to disorient you. Resistance first and foremost is in helping yourself overcome those two.\nIt will be wildly unsettling. It will be somehow both incredibly fast, and also incredibly slow. It will be both wildly disruptive, and many things will look the same. Things you expect to break will be subverted instead, and things you think are unbreakable will not hold. It will be disorienting.\nThings will be destroyed in ways that make them look whole, but they will be hollowed out, and people around you will tell you nothing changed. It will be disorienting. Things that are supposed to be fair, will not be. It will make you want to give up. That is what it is *for*.\nLife will go on. Rent will be due. People will go to work. Classes will still be held. The world will not stop. It will be disorienting. It will make you want to give up. It is designed to disorient and demoralize you into being cynical and giving up, and to stop believing a better world is possible\nThank you.\nThanks for initiating an inspirational and meaningful platform to launch individual plans to move forward and hopefully beyond a second Trump regime. There is considerable conversation to be had about why Democrats failed to communicate a definitely clear message to those who voted for “MAGA” and Trump, however, that commentary only serves as distraction and diversion of reality.\nIt’s not that Democrats failed to have a clear message; quite the contrary; Trump and Republicans messaging soundly tapped into the pervasive emotions that are still prevalent and exist throughout much of the population of the United States. The emotional impacts of Division, Bigotry, Racism, Misogyny, Colorism as well as Welfare, DEI, Critical Race Theory and problems caused by *Others* serve as “Red Herrings,” that are useful tools Republicans realize can be easily exploited by simply connecting these emotions directly to the “Kitchen Table Issues and Lives” of a large massive majority of Americans. Trump followed the play books written by Jim Crow and Adolph Hitler.\nMaintain your composure, stay positive, surround yourself with positive individuals and remained engaged. GOD is still in control.\nLoved this piece! Will it be made available in Spanish or other languages?\nI am going to share this widely, subscribe, and do as many of the steps as I can. Thank you so so much. I am noticing the rapid responses over the last 6 months or so of poets and artists to build awareness; for some of us, being clear through political art is a potential aspect of any of these choices. Art has power, too.\nOMG! This “article” is so spot on! I want to be involved in “educating” the public and being prepared to counter any slips Trump makes. Democrats, I believe, need to get off the party bandwagon and start listening to “the people”. Someone needs to energize and organize the unaffiliated voters and those who don’t vote, but who and how? There are way too many small organizations that have a good message and mean well, but couldn’t there be a larger umbrella social media site that all of them could be listed/categorized according to their particular main agenda? This is what I want to be a part of but have no idea where to begin.\nOne more (important) thought! I would love to push this article all over social media. Unfortunately, the average person will see how long it is and give up. I would love to create a briefer outline-type version that will get more readers. Does something like this already exist and if so, can you share with me? Thank you!\nThe most debilitating feeling is that you no longer know who is an ignorant, short sighed, sexist, fascist… because it feels they are quietly everywhere.\nI’d love to see a place we could go to find out about resistance needs around the country. Maybe I travel to a different state to volunteer at an immigrant shelter or with a group helping women travel out of state for abortions. Maybe I send money to people who are fighting government supported attacks on trans people or libraries. It would be great to have a curated source of places that need our help.\nThank you so much. Very good detailed advice. I’m 78 and retired. I mailed out 50 postcards reminding people to vote. And feel like it was wasted energy now. 😢 I feel like we have been sent back to the 1940s. Things are really rotten (not in Denmark) but here in the USA. I will share this with friends.\nBrilliant analysis which should be widely disseminated. It’s practical, hopeful and visionary. Dictators come and GO, which we can’t afford to forget.\nThank you so much for this meaty resource Daniel! I appreciate you mentioning power and the need to understand it! I’d love to invite you to take a look at the Right Use of Power Institute and their brilliant approach and language to understanding power and power dynamics. You may be\ninterested in a free offering on the 14th of November, “RUPI Collective Trasmutation Circle” which you would find on their website.\nRightuseofpower.org\nThanks again and blessings and gratitude for your work Daniel!\nFenna\nGene Sharp quote: “….People provide these services to the ruler though a variety of organizations and institutions.”\n“though” looks like a typo, should be “through.”\nInspirational info, thanks for this resource.\nThese are all good ideas. Right now I feel angry. In 2020 Biden said he would be a Bridge Candidate. What happened to that? Instead we got a disastrous debate and an approval rating of 39.6 percent followed by an emergency candidate left with only 100 days to campaign. Donald Trump announced his candidacy in 2022 and had the time to lead a marketing and media-savvy campaign. Kamala did her best but basically she and we were thrown under the bus by the Democratic Party’s lack of planning and initiative.\nI like “taking advantage of t rump overreach”.\nI feel that his shenanigans will lead to his downfall\nI’ll take care of myself and family and watch him fail.\nWonderful article, spot on. I live in a small town in Northern California. I want to start by gathering together with like-minded people. And then develop a plan to go further. I’ve never done anything like this before but I’m a teacher (and a former lawyer) so I’m not afraid to talk to a group or take reasonable risks (or deal with openly hostile people). Your training modules are great. But I feel totally unprepared to use them. Where can I find live training to get started ? Many thanks.\nPAUL LOOMIS\nNevada City, CA\npauloomis@gmail.com\nHe has won the election now, and Elon Musk will soon have a hand in running the government- I am not too sure what this will do in regard to his electric car business but I am sure this is the last of his worries. My big fear is trumpie using the military to keep us in control…..\nTHANK YOU for such a profound study and details to help us strategize, resist, and hopefully, circumvent dictatorship!! HUGS ~ Jane\nThank you for this practical and reasoned essay, and for the four “pathways” you suggest.\nI may be an outlier in this conversation, but I think the anti-Trump people have a huge blind spot when they label everyone who voted for him with the same adjectives that they use for him as a person and a politician. While I despise DJT as a person and oppose a lot of his stated policies (and who knows what he’ll actually do, or which stated policies he’ll stick with), and I did not vote for him. I also did not vote for Ms. Harris.\nA significant portion of Trump voters come from the natural health space, seeing the medical mandates enforced by the Democratic administration and Democrats more broadly as a direct attack on our ability to use natural means to support our health and that of our loved ones. While some in this space seem to forget that Trump was in office at the start of those measures, and did nothing to oppose them or prevent them, and that he loudly took credit for the vaccines, others acknowledge that but say that he has better people around him this time. I don’t share that confidence.\nEspecially the idea that Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration are champions of free speech ignores the outright censorship they practiced, and asked online platforms to practice, against ANY skepticism about covid, the vaccines, the hospital protocols (e.g. ventilators, which were incentivised by the covid response bonus system, but were contraindicated for most covid patients. They had an 80% death rate) or about the validity of the “tests” and masking requirements.\nAs much as many well-meaning people accepted the restrictions and mandates as “better safe than sorry” precautions, it should be easy to see how any would-be dictator could look at the response of the majority of people, how they enthusiastically embraced those measures and were willing to shame and ostracize others who didn’t, and see an easy way to introduce such restrictions and worse: wrap them in a blanket of “public health measures,” endorsed and promoted by regime-vetted scientists. Because most people never read the actual science, to see how flimsy at best, fraudulent at worst the “science” behind these things is.\nMany people in the natural health movement were already protecting people, practicing “Disrupt and Disobey,” defending community institutions against shut-down orders, and building alternatives. Those defending the Biden-Harris administration would do well to listen to those who have been opposing it. We are NOT coming from a starting place of “Trumpism,” but from that classic attitude of “Question Authority.” That attitude has been severely repressed by the current administration–which has led many to consider Trump as an alternative, without endorsing his attitudes.\nThe other glaring blind spot for Harris supporters (and Trump supporters) is her (and his) steadfast support for the apartheid-like, and now genocidal state of Israel. Many of us feel like, if genocide isn’t a deal breaker, then what is? How can the US still be sending weapons, and now troops to teach the IDF how to use them, when their genocidal purpose is so exposed? How can anyone accept voting for any politician who supports that?\nSo, to all those who have taken “DJT2.0” as a major catastrophe, think back to what actually happened in “DJT1.0.” Resistance to objectionable policies is absolutely required. He has shown us that he’s quite willing to give the biggest polluters the green light to poison our atmosphere, water and soil; we need to oppose that. He has shown that he’s ready to spout off in incredibly divisive language; we need to make sure WE’RE not adding to that divisiveness by demonizing those who thought he was a better choice than Harris, aka more of what we already have.\nSending the people who are reading this article love. You do not need to fear, and this type of article is fear-mongering. You will be completely fine. Don’t psych yourself out. Over half the country felt fine voting for this man, and they will have your back. We are all on the same team. Relax and get back to your normal lives!\nExcellent article. Keep us grounded, aware, together, mobilized in what works!! Thank you!\nI enjoyed this very much, but I am confused about the part in the last section where you say one path to removing Trump from office is to “vote him out.” This will be his second term, so there is no legal way for him to run again. Agree?\nThis relates to your thoughts about grieving.\nIt’s now time to begin the process of conciously accepting that much of the good in America is now in effect gone. It’s a different and much darker world than it was even a week ago and will get darker yet, as least for a good long time. Darkness now has the upper hand. We can still trust that the darkness cannot finally overwhelm the light, even when it doesn’t feel that way along the way to more light.\nFrom my childhood, I understood that this would occur someday. I hoped I wouldn’t live to see it. I believe it stemed from the plot by the International Financiers to maintain their control over the world’s monetary systems. By putting Donald Trump in the Whitehouse, they’ll go a long way toward placing the world under a New World Order which will guarantee their control over world affairs and monetary systems and consequently enslave the world by eliminating the rights of mankind. Trump must be stopped before he can destroy our democracy and freedom of the USA and the world.\nYour views are very helpful. I’ve been a voice in my small group encouraging involvement of any sort. I’ve always been an active Democrat.\nMovement offers a sense of personal agency. Inactivity breeds despair.\nI’m 83 and need to continue to set an example , as I always have, for my family. Your experience is giving me new tools. Thanks.\nAll that is expressed here is worth believing in this ever changing world we now live in !!! Never stop believing in yourself!!! 👍❤️🔥👍🇺🇸\nPolitical education is crucial, starting in middle school. It should be neutral but talk about the history of unions, Vietnam War protests, social security, immigration.\nI substitute in an urban highschool. Rumors were that Trump was going to give out more stimulus checks and Harris would allow arrests of urban males.\nHow do we end or stabilize the anger of those who would usually be Democrats but are now far right? Group think is hard to destabilize. They see power they never had in being non educated.\nLet’s get social security recipients marching! Lefty friends, get out of the recliner and volunteer!\nThank you so much for your brilliant insight.\nThis was amazingly helpful for people that want to do something but don’t have a clue where to start. Im a believer in the “Disrupt and Disobey” strategy so I thank you for your insight on that.\nThis the hope I need. Thank you! 💖\nIn these uncertain times with a psychopath at the helm of the beautiful USA, it is important to stand up for what your beliefs are. There are so many things that Donald Trump has said and done – where many experts, Psychiatrists, Generals, etc. have warned how incredibly dangerous he is. My belief is that the people who voted for him could never find personal power within themselves to direct their own lives (plus their own demons) so they voted for Trump to represent that helplessness they feel (Trump appearing to have a strong and powerful personality – which in actuality is his weakness and fears.) Also, in turn, he acts out their repressed demons for them. Trump is terrified of black people because if the black people come into power – he and others might be treated like whites have treated black people. That is and was a subtle and bombastic message to his followers. Quite frankly, I am angry with these people who voted for him as they have taken this country down their own narcisstic ignorant path. Their votes for this whiney manipulative child called Trump, will destroy many lives – black, white, immigrants, etc. At this time, I have zero empathy for these people, as they have taken America down a slippery slope. Oh, and they do not realize they will be sliding down the slope with criminally insane Trump as well. Linda A.\nThe Serenity Prayer comes from St. Francis, not someone in Germany. You accidently misrepresented this fact.\nThanks very much for your article! My friends and I gather for simple social events where we find our optimism and comfort in one another to help us out of despair at least for an hour or so. I can see us developing some kind of resistance, too, over time.\nMuch thanks to Daniel Hunter. It is good to go in with a reasonal plan of action.\nI am guaranteed three things from my government: Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\nY’all be safe and love one aother.\nJane\nI’ve just realized why we need the electoral college, but first I would like to say that the electoral college was set up as a check on the possible overtaking of the electorate by a demigod, on a more grounded level, we need the electoral college to insure that the several States’ electorate choosing a president can be campaigned upon and got even though not in contiguous sections or States of our country.\nI understand more now. I wish you continue to give tiny steps we can do if we are new to resistance. I’m almost 60. As are all my friends. We show up for marches which feels good. I don’t associate with or talk to many MAGA in my daily life. I live in Austin TX, the blue dot in a red state. Help me and my people with real action. But I know some of my friends will be scared. And I will be. Help us contribute.\nThank you\nLet’s take a good hard look at the “Democratic Party” too.\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/mariannewilliamson/p/my-thoughts-exactly?r=27lbzy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email\nThe date the article was written is probably wrong considering no one knew he would win until late into Nov. 5 or when they woke up Nov. 6.\nThank you, just thank you.\nThe great thing about President Donald Trump is that he will even make America great for all of you idiots!!!\nIn topic number 2 in the “10 Ways” piece, it should be “whom,” not “who,” you trust.\nHow about prepare to respond to everything he does by publicizing the almost certain problems that will result from the action, i.e. tariffs in the end will cost the taxpayer/citizens more as the cost of the goods affected increases. With informed backup – there’s a great deal of this information in the papers right now. And work to inform those who voted for him, believing he knows what he is talking about. He usually does not.\nWow,\nThat was an insightful and hopeful read. I’m feeling that I have some action steps instead of being in inertia. Thank you!\nThis information is a lifesaver for me. Thank you so much! I was in such despair yesterday.. thank you 🙏\nThank you.\nAs an activist for democracy I see a lot of potentially valuable insights and tools in this piece by Daniel Hunter. By I also see a lot of unrealistic optimism. One lesson from this election is that Americans can be very lazy– did they even look into Project 2025? And they can be easily swayed by overly confident conmen. And just plain stupid and ignorant. What do we do about these handicaps? How do we generate sufficient action with this kind of populace?\nLots of great helpful suggestions. However you never addressed the racism and sexism that fuel the MAGA movement. Women need to come together and support each other and vote for our issues. We need to support nonprofits that protect minority rights.\nWe need to support organizations that protect the environment. We need to support organization that build affordable housing and press Congress to provide funding too.\nThank you Daniel. This is a survival manifesto after the last election. I am a 67yo white, middle class, female and devastated by the results. I refuse to let Trump take away my joy. I will focus my joy like a laser and act in the community through education and demonstration.\nI’m glad I found this article. The article is not very hopeful but it helps me that there are people thinking ahead and strategizing. I think we (anti-trumpers) can sway outcomes is by affecting food prices. I believe this was a primary reason for Trumps win. Voters don’t care about fascism (what is that anyway??) etc but they do care about high food / consumer food prices that stay high – it’s something that they see when they shop or eat out.\nThank you for the article. I really like the examples of how people under other autocratic regimes have made it through – it gives me hope.\nThank you for your advice. I am a seventy nine year old woman. I have vestibular vertigo, so for now, I am stuck. What can I do?\njacnccready653@gmail.com\nThis information/guidebook is a 2025 Manifesto of our own, of “The Movement.” It’s a lot to chew on, yet offers points of focus, places to start, and hope. Thank you.\nJust read and subscribed to this newsletter. I found #5’s suggestions, 3 0f them, as possible ideas for me. What I did not like, and what disappointed me, was to read of Mr. Hunter’s personal choice of disruption and disobeying, as to the one to follow.\nI voted for Jill Stein for president because in my opinion neither major party candidate was fit to be president. Democrats need to understand that if Trump was a moral person his victory would have been far, far greater! He won largely because people were suffering from very high inflation and fed up with Biden’s border policy. Another reason was Biden’s selfish attempt to hold on for another 4 years at his age until finally forced too close to the election to pass on the torch to a demonstrably unfit Harris. Harris never went through a democratic process to become VP. She only got her position because DEI was top on Biden’s list of “qualifications”. Many voters noted how unprepared and devious Harris was when questioned on a large number of issues. It was disgraceful.\nSo much for explanations… what do we now do about it?\nI believe a system more like that which exists in the UK might be an improvement. There, political parties clearly define their plans and the public chooses which party to support. The party then chooses from a pool of candidates. All this takes about 3 months… not 2 years as here in the US. In the US media untruths are also part of the election problem. And, in political debates it is extremely annoying when candidates do not answer questions and go on some tangent. Debate moderators should be empowered and expected to say things like “You did not answer the question!” One thing that must be change is for all political donations, private and business to be recorded and limited to a small amount. Otherwise money buys power and kills the very concept of a democracy.\nI would like to read this article so I can prepare myself and my three daughters.\nPJ\nThank you for this post election balm For the tired and fearful and strategically oriented. I and trusted others have endured several campaigns of resistance and trust is central to it all. All successful resistances have centered on a small group of people beginning a March of successfully saying no. Thanks for emphasizing patience in finding the cracks that can be successfully explored or resistance. We will certainly need both.\nThis is great writing! Thank you so much, Elizabeth. This is the first time I’ve felt grounded, hopeful and sane since the election. I appreciate everything. I was stuck in that “stunned” stage and now, I feel happy and hopeful. (Rejuvenated and grateful to you got making me feel this way.) I knew I’d be fighting for the rights of everyone in need, but this article REALLY helps. You are good, and very talented! I’m grateful for you.\nOops, I gave credit to an “Elizabeth,” (I saw her name under a picture.)\nI meant to thank, you, Daniel Hunter.\nThis is a FANTASTIC article and plan.\nThank you and many blessings! You’re excellent at what you do. I feel like I’ve done a 180° mental shift, and made a grounding which I desperately needed. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nGreat resource!\nWow! Wonderful! Thank you Daniel (in the Lion’s Den!)\nThis is an excellent article on the many pathways to undermine or block the coming lawlessness and inhumanity of the Trump administration. But a helpful follow up would be specific a simple set of concreteinstructions (an operating manual) by topic / approach on how to help communitues and even one activist to start pulling together to organize, create and carry out an action plan. Everyone I know is paralyzed on how to do anthing in the face of the enormity of tsunami heading our way. Finding safety and then banding together to save more people, help us through their trauma and then begin to rebuild back stronger to better handle the next tsunami. But we desperately need a clear manual with specific actions to take as we emerge from shock and grief. Right now people are simply spinning – overwhelmed with indecision on what to do next.\nThis article is a great ! start on beginning this process! With many resources. Thank you so much!\nThe progressive movement needs a new way to organize that matches what you have shared in regard to your journaling exercise and the comment made by a Jewish friend – we have to be able to strategically focus our individual attention as part of a larger system that organizes across progressive goals – the national organizations need to come together and lead – a cabinet of the leaders. And this organizing system needs to organize from the bottom up for example, local environmental nonprofits, to the national players like EDF, National Parks Foundation, and Redwood Society. I definitely feel like I spin my wheels -I could go to a different nonprofit’s meeting every night of the week and on Saturday’s there are often events happening at the same time -I am only one person! My inbox is flooded with nonprofit newsletters. I give a little bit to several orgs across different causes. How much more powerful could I be if I could be supported to focus on one (maybe two) causes? I could breathe a sigh of relief and carve back some personal time if I know that others are equally as focused on other causes I care about. We can call on each other when we need to make a big showing – a rally or a petition – work in a local election for a candidate that aligns with our various causes but otherwise we are uber focused. In this new way of organizing,\nthe national organizations have to listen to those of us on the ground – it has to be top down AND bottom up informed. Thank you for your work – I am sharing it far and wide.\nRose Bohman arguing for the right to spread a virulent respiratory disease that’s killed millions of our fellow Americans — claiming that suppressing anti-vax lies is “tyranny”, and then rubbing “health freedom” in our faces is….not helpful to the cause of preserving the nation.\nYou are the insane one who is promoting violence.\nCelebrate the new sharing of the film\n“The Boys Who Said ‘No’”\nwhich exemplifies effective non-violence !\nThis article is useful on many different levels and comprehensive as well .In it.common sense and intellectual strategies are not mutually exclusive especially when the focus is on both meeting personal needs and getting things done.I happened to start my morning with it and feel renewed resolve to carry on with hope.\nI would like to suggest a “silent protest” for January 20, 2025. Similar to the blue bead bracelet that women are now wearing. On January 20, 2025, I plan to wear all black clothing on that day to protest Donald Trump and all he stands for including his political objectives, his self-serving appointees and his disgusting moral core. I wish this idea could be circulated nationally. A silent protest via our clothing (especially women) and possibly some silent meetings/gatherings on that day around the country. Thank you!\nIdeas for now???\nI’m standing on intersections here in Taos with a sign that reads. “Trump and Company are criminals and Traitors”. I would encourage people to get out and stand with similar signs. It would encourage others to stand up and would let fascists know that fascism will be resisted and eventually destroyed.\nI’m a Navy veteran. I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, domestic and foreign. That oath is a lifelong commitment and I intend to stand by that oath.\nThis is a very well written and thought out article. Thank you\nThis is a beautiful article.\nI propose stop shopping and stop paying fees on credit cards. Profit from individual credit card debt monthly penalties is huge. I acknowledge people and families who do not have excess income but people paying the minimum balance on their credit card is easy profit money for banks and is money they can recover for themselves. Any forms of decreased consumption will hurt capitalism.\nThank you. It’s so depressing right now but I think issues, ideas and community involvement will help all of us.\nThank you! I will share this with my trusted support people. We appreciate your wisdom and sharing how to fight effectively in an authoritarian system.\nDoes the author expect Trump to run again? It seems so towards the end of the piece. This is obviously unconstitutional and Trump himself has indicated no intention to run a third time. Perhaps more explanation or clarification here would help this otherwise useful piece.\nThanks for this. We need community now to build strength. So well articulated. Thank you so much\nI’ve read this work and it will give me some kind of sanity going forward, though I’m not ready yet.

This is all in one week!!!!\nDorothy Drahzal, Cambridge MD\nDdrahzal2@comcast.net\nThank you for your article! I am 40 this year and am at a crucial bridge in life of youth to self-confident freedom. Trump’s presidency stands in the way of my life as a whole and he is none the wiser. This fact alone (among others as a whole) has pushed me past my limit. I am going to help however I can to not lose my country from USA to Disassociated States of America under this false prophet of a president.\nLet\ns deprive Trump of some of the attention he is getting. Let’s stop using Trump’s photograph or drawn image on our newsletters, alerts and news. We have seen enough of his face to last several lifetimes. It is – literally- psychologically traumatizing to continue to be forced to look at our abuser. This soon-to-be President of the US glories in attention. This is one way we can limit that.\n“Distrust fuels the flame of autocracy because it makes it much easier to divide.”\nHow much of this story is so one sided.\nThose on the Harris and other “Democratic” sides used their own versions of rhetoric — telling people to distrust others who follow Christianity, Republicans, who do not bend to their non-relevant “woke” policies, Independents, people from Rural Areas, Veteran’s, the press (legitimate or otherwise), History, truth, and the list goes on.\nThe divisiveness between BOTH Parties will not go away until voters/people learn to either vote None of the Above, Actually research what the real platforms are, educate themselves to what our U.S Constitution is about, and/or vote for a candidate that will uphold this Constitution, and/or vote as a non-partisan, vote for a different party all together.\nthis is everything\nFYI.. there’s a secular version of the Serenity Prayer, ” Don’t let what you CAN’T DO stop what you CAN DO.” And never forget, what you cannot do alone might be done with the strength of others.\nThank you for this. I don’t yet have clarity about how I can and will tap into this, I have discovered very clearly which role(s) I want to play.\nI do want to bring to your attention that there may be something else coming instead of deportation and that is criminalized undocumented people, putting them in prisons and then using the 13th amendment to use them as basically free labor. I don’t say this to disheartened, being prepared is all important and will allow us the advantage of not being shocked.\nThank you,\nTeresa Avalon\n(I was a person who was going to shift to stealth mode but now I understand that is doing what the fascists want)\nyour subscribe button isn’t working\nDuring the Vietnam war we could expand our resistance by doing the following:\n1. research and publish the companies that delivered directly or indirectly to that war or domestic repressive measures;\n2. boycott household products from these companies. This, amazingly, has a long term effect. Many years after we stopped that war and/or repression, I still don’t buy these products;\n3. prepare for small and large scale demonstrations, particularly blocking gates that expel ‘illegal’ immigrants, while providing legal protection;\n4. providing basic medical care and food to people in need in our own region;\n5. welcoming dissidents in your home;\n6. unite churchgoing people to assemble from all religions and protest together, like what happened many times along the Mexican border, performing rituals;\n7. teach USA history like it should be truthfully taught to all children and students.\nThank you for your insights.

We will get through this.\nI found this article through a community based organization ,and could not stop reading .Very well written and effectively stated ,I will pass this information on to other and I plan to get the book ,today !Mr Robert\nI am surprised at one strategy I hardly saw mentioned: boycott. A boycott was so influential in turning the tide after decades of other work toward civil rights. It is non-violent; it is diffused among a large population, making it difficult to target any one person for intimidation (harder to lynch someone for NOT doing something); if properly selected and promoted, it strikes directly at the inequities being protested; in the current context, it is about money, which is Trump’s validation language (he doesn’t have a love language).\nI was remembering being about 12 years old, and riding a bus watching someone running a 3-card monte scam. He was good at it. But it showed me that often the only way to beat a con, is to walk away. Don’t get sucked in. Don’t play.\nTrump is running a giant con. A boycott is one way to walk away. It’s saying, I’m not going to participate in this injustice. Obviously, it must be organized. It must be widespread. It must be clearly connected to a specific injustice. It’s a way for a disempowered population to feel more empowered. It must be large enough, and well enough connected to the injustice being addressed so that those who are perpetrating the injustice feel it the consequence of the loss of movement of money. I’m not sure what would be the first target of a boycott at this moment, but creative thinkers could easily find something.\nOne place I have already thought it could be used isn’t really about the Trump presidency, but that’s gun violence. Have an organization study all the content viewed on the various streaming services. Rank them in order of who has the highest number of times per hour where guns are used as a solution to a problem. Then boycott the one or two services at the top of the list. If they reduce their guns-as-solution content, they move down the list, and the boycott switches to the new top services. Streaming services are very sensitive to subscriber numbers.\nMaybe boycott companies who advertise on Fox News, or on certain shows on Fox. Or X. Or other sources of disinformation, most of which are funded by advertising. Since we live in a marketing economy, targeting advertisers has been effective. They are the movers of money in this economy. And the creators of scarcity.\nOther ideas are surely out there. We should start gathering them, and see which ones gain traction.\nThank you for your very thoughtful work. Non-violence must be the soul of resistance.\nAbsolutely fantastic ! article so ! beautifully written so many ideas thank you !! to a brilliant writer\nThank you\nThank you. I’ve never been involved in active resistance.

UNHCR reports that more than 550,000 Afghans have been displaced since January due to Taliban advances. Those most at risk include women leaders and activists, human rights workers, journalists, and tens of thousands of individuals who have assisted U.S. efforts in the country and are marked by their connection to the U.S. military. In the capital of Kabul, the Taliban is reportedly going door-to-door, targeting those with close ties to the U.S.\nInitially, it appeared that potentially hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees who had assisted the U.S. military effort would be eligible to come to the U.S. under either the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program or a broader Priority-2 (P2) refugee status that was announced on August 2. However, both processes take years to complete and — in the case of P2 status — they required individuals to escape on their own to a third country before applying. In addition, neither status was available to many of the Afghans who are most at most risk, including Afghan women and girls, human rights workers, and journalists.\nDue to the inadequacy of the SIV and P-2 programs in the context of an emergency evacuation, on August 23 the administration announced it would be using its humanitarian parole authority to process in evacuated Afghans who do not already have visas. This explainer will define humanitarian parole and describe how it is being used in the ongoing evacuation. It will discuss the eligibility and vetting protocols that have been put in place to secure the process and explain the benefits (or lack thereof) that parolees receive when they arrive in the United States.\nWhat is parole in the context of U.S. immigration law?\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, parole is a tool that allows certain individuals to enter and stay in the U.S. without a visa. Parole is granted either for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or because the entrance of an individual is determined to be a “significant public benefit” to the U.S. While visa processes can take years or decades, the parole process may take days or even just hours to complete. While it is often used when rapid admissions are necessary, each parole application must be considered individually and receive sign off from senior government officials. Parole programs all involve various vetting and processing requirements (discussed below).\nThere are several different categories of parole, and the authority has been used for a wide range of populations over the years. Parole has been used for international entrepreneurs under the IEPP and arriving Cubans under wet foot dry foot; it has been used for noncitizen veterans hoping to remain in the U.S. and for DACA recipients hoping to travel outside the country.\nParole has also been used — repeatedly and to great effect — to facilitate the evacuations of allies and others at risk following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from war-torn regions. In 1975 after the Vietnam war and then in 1996 after the first Iraq war, the U.S. used its parole authority to transport thousands of refugees and allies to Guam and Wake Island, where they went through vetting protocols and immigration processing before being resettled in the mainland United States.\nTable: Past Uses of Parole During Evacuations\nWhat is Humanitarian Parole?\nHumanitarian Parole refers to parole that is granted based on an urgent humanitarian need. “Humanitarian parole” is also sometimes used by the media as a blanket term for any parole process that allows admission to individuals on an emergency basis, but there are other forms of parole that have been used for refugees or those in harm’s way. For example, in 2007, the Department of Defense used Significant Public Benefit Parole (SPBP) to quickly evacuate Iraqi translators who had worked with U.S. troops. The U.S. has also created special Refugee-Related Parole Programs (RRPPs) for specific groups of vulnerable individuals, including certain Central American minors and Cubans arriving by boat.\nUSCIS notes that there is no statutory or regulatory definition of either the “Humanitarian” or “Significant Public Benefit” parole authorities, and that on some occasions requests for parole may be granted for both urgent humanitarian reasons and significant public benefit reasons.\nWhat are the eligibility requirements for parole?\nProspective applicants will only be granted parole “on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit.” Anyone can self-petition for parole at a U.S. embassy and sponsors inside the U.S. can also file on behalf of individuals who may be eligible.\nBeyond these standardized guidelines, there are not strictly defined eligibility requirements for parole processes. Parole is always decided on a case-by-case basis, and separate application and vetting procedures are created for and tailored to each new parole program. For instance, parole for Central American minors with family members in the U.S. requires different vetting procedures and processing requirements than parole for Iraqi interpreters in 2007 or Afghan allies today. In all cases, parole applications are accepted or denied at the discretion of the U.S. government.\nHow is parole currently being used to evacuate Afghans?\nUnder Operation Allies Refuge, the Biden administration reportedly intends to use parole to evacuate up to 50,000 Afghans who may otherwise be eligible for either refugee or SIV status but have not yet completed their visa processing. As of August 30, it is not yet clear how many of these have already been evacuated. The administration is planning to end the evacuation effort by August 31 and is currently evacuating almost exclusively U.S. citizens.\nUnder the current parole process, Afghans undergo rapid processing at Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul before being taken to military bases in third countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, Germany, Kuwait, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates. Afghans who are in the late stages of the SIV process and have already gone through multiple rounds of security screening are provided with quick medical screenings and then flown to the U.S., where they are paroled in.\nAfghans who are not in the final stages of the SIV process must wait — potentially for prolonged periods — in third countries to undergo robust security processing and vetting procedures. These vetting procedures are conducted by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel, some already present at the military bases and some who have been rapidly deployed. The procedures include multiple rounds of biometric and biographic screening, and matching results with a variety of law enforcement and intelligence agency watchlists. Current and former intelligence officials with knowledge of the vetting procedures being used have described the process as “robust,” “competent,” and “secure.”\nBeyond passing security and identity screens, the parameters of the current parole process are not yet fully clear. The U.S. has not yet specified the exact population of Afghans that is eligible for parole. On August 17, a bipartisan group of 46 Senators urged the administration to go beyond protections only for those who would be eligible for SIVs and P-2 status, which are both reserved only for those who directly supported U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. In their letter, the Senators called for the creation of “a humanitarian parole category specifically for women leaders, activists, human rights defenders, judges, parliamentarians, journalists, and members of the Female Tactical Platoon of the Afghan Special Security Forces.”\nWhat benefits do parolees receive in the U.S.?\nParole temporarily shields individuals from deportation and — in some cases — allows them to apply for work authorization. Parole is separate from the visa admissions process, and it does not automatically confer immigration status or public benefits. In general, parolees must apply for more permanent immigration status to remain in the U.S. for longer than a short period. In the case of the evacuation of Kurdish allies in 1996, for example, parolees were immediately placed in asylum proceedings in order to receive more permanent protection. (In other past parole programs, Congress has passed legislation allowing individuals to access permanent status after they were paroled in.) Parole protections typically only last for a year, although certain programs have provided more extended protections or the ability to apply for “re-parole.”\nBecause parolees are generally not eligible for government benefits such as resettlement assistance, they often are required to secure financial support through a nongovernmental sponsor prior to admission into the U.S. However, during some previous emergency evacuations, additional funding to support arriving parolees can be authorized by either Congress or by the administration.\nUnder the Operation Allies Refuge parole program, Afghans are granted protection from deportation for two years and are eligible to apply for work authorization. The parolees are first housed temporarily in military bases in the U.S. In these bases, those who are in the final stages of the SIV process can complete the process and obtain SIV status. Others who may have been eligible for refugee status cannot apply for that status from inside the U.S. and must instead enter asylum proceedings or other visa processes.\nParolees are soon transferred to the care of refugee resettlement agencies across the country. Both the SIV and asylum process are severely backlogged and can take years to complete, and parolees receive no public benefits or government support beyond initial processing. As of August 26, resettlement agencies are supporting the resettlement of these Afghans largely through private donations, volunteers, and stretching already thin resources.\nTable: Comparison of Federally Funded Benefits for Refugees, SIVs, and Parolees\nWhat about Afghans who are in danger but were not evacuated?\nAfghans who are unable to be evacuated at the airport in Kabul may also travel to neighboring third countries such as Uzbekistan or Pakistan and apply for humanitarian parole (or P-2 refugee status, if eligible) at a U.S. embassy.\nHowever, it has proven to be exceedingly difficult for Afghans to exit the country safely without U.S. support. Taliban checkpoints abound, and Pakistan — a traditional destination for Afghan refugees — has recently finished 1,640 miles of fencing along its border with Afghanistan, complete with 6 feet of concertina wire between two sets of 12-foot-tall chain link. Major crossing points along the border have been closed to refugees, including the Torkham gate near Kabul and Jalalabad.\nTo the west, the Taliban has seized control of certain crossing points with Iran (although some refugees have found safety there). Many Afghans attempting to flee through Iran to Turkey have been met with closed borders and increased enforcement. Refugees have faced a similarly cold response to the north, although in July a report suggested Tajik officials were preparing to host up to 100,000 Afghans.\nMap: Afghan Borderlands\nSource: I News\nWhat more can the U.S. do?\nThere are multiple steps the U.S. can take to better protect Afghan refugees:\n- Ensure parole eligibility is expanded to include vulnerable Afghan women and girls, human rights activists, journalists, and others most at risk.\n- Work with Congress to provide sufficient additional resources to resettlement agencies and communities working to resettle Afghan parolees.\n- Prolong evacuation efforts as long as possible and ensure safe passage to the Kabul airport to facilitate evacuations.\n- Leave no one behind. To the extent evacuations by air are no longer possible, work to assist vulnerable Afghans in escaping to third countries.\n- Apply diplomatic pressure to urge Pakistan and others to open their borders to refugees. Lead the international community in creating safe zones in neighboring countries to process claims for refugee status and humanitarian parole.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Fox News: 'Worst thing I've ever seen': 4 years later, GOP veterans say Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal still haunts them\nContact: Lexi Kranich (814) 380-4408\nWASHINGTON, D.C.—It has been four years since the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, ending a 20-year foreign entanglement and leaving the fates of hundreds of thousands of people in the hands of the Taliban.\nFor House Republican lawmakers who served in the Armed Forces, in the Middle East in particular, the frustration and angst is still raw.\n\"I thought the withdrawal was the worst thing I've ever seen from any president in my lifetime. It was the most bungled operation I've seen,\" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told Fox News Digital.\nBacon, a retired brigadier general with nearly 30 years’ experience in the Air Force, said the withdrawal left him and fellow veterans he spoke with feeling depressed.\n\"Why did our friends have to die there? Because all that [President Joe Biden] did, he pulled us out and it collapsed. We had 3,500 troops there when Biden came in. None of them were in combat. They were in support roles,\" he said. \"We could have sustained it at a low cost for a long time… And moms and dads wonder, why do we lose our son? I happen to know this to be true. I've talked to moms and dads. Why did I lose my son for something that Joe Biden just pulled the plug on and let it collapse?\"\nThe Nebraska Republican said he himself knew five people who died serving in Afghanistan.\nRep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C., a former Army Special Forces officer who served two tours in Afghanistan, said he cried when the chaos of the withdrawal dawned on him.\n\"I wept,\" Harrigan told Fox News Digital. \"I knew it was not about losing Afghanistan, right? It wasn't about the 20 years’ worth of work that we put into that country. It wasn't about the promises that we made that we didn't keep. It wasn't about even the 13 Americans that got killed. The reason I wept is because I believed that that display of strategic weakness on the world stage condemned the next generation of Americans to conflict.\"\nThis past Tuesday also marked four years since the deadly suicide attack on Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, which took the lives of dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members.\n\"I would say it was a very, very, you know, cutting morale situation for everyone,\" said Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Mich., who served in the military for over 20 years.\n\"I can't speak for everyone, but personally, I felt like it was complete and total failure of our leadership…We could watch this happen in slow motion. I mean, such terrible decisions that set up the vulnerability that ultimately resulted in that loss of life. And to know that we had troops there who were infants at the time of the attack of 9/11. They couldn't even, they weren't even old enough to remember when 9/11 happened.\"\nBacon pointed out that the ISIS-K terrorist who committed the attack was released from prison at Bagram Air Base following the Taliban’s lightening-fast takeover of Afghanistan.\n\"I cannot think of a more botched operation than that,\" he said.\nHarrigan said, \"We put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into that conflict, and to see it just effectively given away with no plan and absolutely no thought behind the withdrawal process, ultimately culminating in the deaths of 13 young Americans; none of that needed to happen. And I think that's the most frustrating part of it.\"\nAll three veterans said the chaotic withdrawal operation left damaging consequences in its wake.\n\"I think both the previous president and the current president could do better at helping the Afghan interpreters get out of Afghanistan and get into America,\" Bacon said.\n\"We have an obligation, in my view, to support these guys. I mean, they literally put their lives on the line to save Americans, and they've been hunted down in Afghanistan. They've been persecuted. And in some cases you hear stories of the current administration trying to return some of these folks. It’s just not right.\"\nHarrigan said the federal government handled Afghanistan \"terribly\" after the U.S. exit.\n\"I mean, President Joe Biden was sending $40 million a week to the Taliban, for God knows what reason. And now we have no relationship with them at all, which I also think is a problem,\" he said. \"I think that Afghanistan has, historically, and will always be a safe haven for terrorism…if we are not constantly keeping a pulse on what's going on there.\"\nBarrett pointed out that Afghanistan has since fallen under extremist control with Taliban rule and opened a \"vacuum\" for China and other adversaries to gain influence.\n\"I think we have to have a far more discerning, very realistic and clear-eyed mindset of the challenges that we're going to face, and what is the second and third order effects of the decisions we make?\" he posed. \"You go into a country to liberate them. Well, what's gonna happen the next day and the day after that, the day following?\"\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        As the Taliban takes control of the country, Afghanistan has again become an extremely dangerous place to be a woman.\nEven before the fall of Kabul on Sunday, the situation was rapidly deteriorating, exacerbated by the planned withdrawal of all foreign military personnel and declining international aid.\nIn the past few weeks alone, there have been many reports of casualties and violence. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes. The United Nations Refugee Agency says about 80% of those who have fled since the end of May are women and children.\nWhat does the return of the Taliban mean for women and girls?\nThe history of the Taliban\nThe Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996, enforcing harsh conditions and rules following their strict interpretation of Islamic law.\nUnder their rule, women had to cover themselves and only leave the house in the company of a male relative. The Taliban also banned girls from attending school, and women from working outside the home. They were also banned from voting.\nWomen were subject to cruel punishments for disobeying these rules, including being beaten and flogged, and stoned to death if found guilty of adultery. Afghanistan had the highest maternal mortality rate in the world.\nThe past 20 years\nWith the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the situation for women and girls vastly improved, although these gains were partial and fragile.\nWomen now hold positions as ambassadors, ministers, governors, and police and security force members. In 2003, the new government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which requires states to incorporate gender equality into their domestic law.\nRead more: Afghan government collapses, Taliban seize control: 5 essential reads\nThe 2004 Afghan Constitution holds that “citizens of Afghanistan, man and woman, have equal rights and duties before the law”. Meanwhile, a 2009 law was introduced to protect women from forced and under-age marriage, and violence.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the law saw a rise in the reporting, investigation and, to a lesser extent, conviction, of violent crimes against women and girls.\nWhile the country has gone from having almost no girls at school to tens of thousands at university, the progress has been slow and unstable. UNICEF reports of the 3.7 million Afghan children out of school some 60% are girls.\nA return to dark days\nOfficially, Taliban leaders have said they want to grant women’s rights “according to Islam”. But this has been met with great scepticism, including by women leaders in Afghanistan. Indeed, the Taliban has given every indication they will reimpose their repressive regime.\nIn July, the United Nations reported the number of women and girls killed and injured in the first six months of the year nearly doubled compared to the same period the year before.\nIn the areas again under Taliban control, girls have been banned from school and their freedom of movement restricted. There have also been reports of forced marriages.\nWomen are putting burqas back on and speak of destroying evidence of their education and life outside the home to protect themselves from the Taliban.\nAs one anonymous Afghan woman writes in The Guardian:\nI did not expect that we would be deprived of all our basic rights again and travel back to 20 years ago. That after 20 years of fighting for our rights and freedom, we should be hunting for burqas and hiding our identity.\nMany Afghans are angered by the return of the Taliban and what they see as their abandonment by the international community. There have been protests in the streets. Women have even taken up guns in a rare show of defiance.\nBut this alone will not be enough to protect women and girls.\nThe world looks the other way\nCurrently, the US and its allies are engaged in frantic rescue operations to get their citizens and staff out of Afghanistan. But what of Afghan citizens and their future?\nUS President Joe Biden remains largely unmoved by the Taliban’s advance and the worsening humanitarian crisis. In an August 14 statement, he said:\nan endless American presence in the middle of another country’s civil conflict was not acceptable to me.\nAnd yet, the US and its allies — including Australia — went to Afghanistan 20 years ago on the premise of removing the Taliban and protecting women’s rights. However, most Afghans do not believe they have experienced peace in their lifetimes.\nAs the Taliban reassert complete control over the country, the achievements of the past 20 years, especially those made to protect women’s rights and equality, are at risk if the international community once again abandons Afghanistan.\nWomen and girls are pleading for help as the Taliban advance. We hope the world will listen.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

In fact, Iran has more holders of American Ph.D.s in its presidential cabinet than France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, or Spain—combined.\nTake, for example, Rouhani’s chief of staff, Mohammad Nahavandian. He spent many years in the United States and has a Ph.D. in economics from George Washington University. Or Javad Zarif, the foreign affairs minister and chief negotiator in the recent nuclear deal between Iran and six global powers. He studied at the University of San Francisco and completed his doctorate at the University of Denver. For five years, he lived in New York and was Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations. Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, has a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from MIT. Mahmoud Vaezi, the communication minister, studied electrical engineering at Sacramento and San Jose State Universities and was enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Louisiana State University (he ultimately earned a doctorate in international relations at Warsaw University). Other cabinet members have advanced degrees from universities in Europe and Iran. Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi, the transportation minister, has a Ph.D. from the University of London, while President Rouhani got his from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland. The new government in Tehran, in other words, might well be one of the most technocratic in the world.\nDoes this matter? On the surface, perhaps not much. We all know how often the governments of the “best and the brightest” disappoint. And it’s important to keep in mind that many of these highly credentialed cabinet members were also active participants in former Iranian administrations and backed policies that earned Iran’s theocracy its bad name.\nAnd let’s not forget that it is Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, who really reigns supreme. He can initiate or stop any initiative. There’s also Major General Qassem Suleimani, who offers a sober counterpoint to the scholarly crowd in the cabinet. Suleimani is a product of a rural town in Iran’s interior and acquired a vast education in the battlefields and the dark alleys of terrorist plots, rather than in classrooms. He is enormously respected by his allies, admirers, and staunchest enemies both in and outside Iran. For the past 15 years, he has commanded the Quds Force, a division of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that answers directly to the supreme leader. The group’s official mission is to export the Islamic revolution and take care of “extra-territorial operations.” Among other achievements, Suleimani is recognized for successfully turning Hezbollah into a feared military force, for organizing the armed resistance that killed thousands of American soldiers in Iraq, and for his effective support of the forces loyal to the Syrian government as they sought to regain ground lost to the armed insurgency. Former CIA officer John Maguire told New Yorker journalist Dexter Filkins that “Suleimani is the single most powerful operative in the Middle East today.”\nLike that of all other countries, Iran’s foreign policy is the outcome of the complex interaction of multiple actors with differing backgrounds, ideologies, interests, and power. Who, then, is driving Tehran’s policy these days: the theocrats or the technocrats? The generals or the diplomats? These are the crucial questions that feed the intense speculation about Iran’s real intention in signing the Geneva accord on its nuclear program. Is this just one more trick by the Iranians to buy time for their continued race toward the bomb while also getting some relief from economic sanctions? Or is this really a momentous strategic change in the Iranian foreign policy of past decades? It is too soon to tell, and nobody can say for certain what will arise from this process. Nobody, except of course Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other neighboring countries in the Persian Gulf. Or members of the U.S. Congress who are keen to boost Iran sanctions while negotiations are ongoing. They’re all certain that the Geneva accord is a huge—indeed historic—mistake. Then there are the skeptics who, while wary and unsure of Iran’s intentions, know that the status quo is far more dangerous than seeking change, despite the risks involved.\nThe probability that the Geneva accord—called a “first step”—will derail because of the actions of extremists on both sides is high, and the deadline is only six months away. After that, there is the option of extending the talks for another six months in the hopes of attaining the big prize: permanent limits on and reliable verification of Iran’s nuclear program.\nFor critics, such a prize does not exist. They believe the hope that Rouhani and his team can fend off fundamentalists is naive, and that Iran is bent on getting nuclear weapons and continuing to use terror as a tool to mold the Middle East and eventually achieve its oft-stated aim of destroying the state of Israel. Tehran’s reformists have a similar worry: Will Barack Obama and his international allies be able to limit the bellicose positions of radicals in their midst?\nFor now, the answers are speculative. But the big strategic question is whether testing Iran’s intentions through negotiations is riskier than continuing to sanction and threaten to bomb it. As naive as assuming that everyone in the Iranian government is ready for a more peaceful integration of their country with the rest of the world is to assume that the status quo—the combination of stringent economic sanctions, sabotage, and the threat of military action—is sustainable and desirable. The latter strategy is as risky, if not more, as one of giving a controlled and cautious chance to Tehran’s doctors to change Iran’s dangerous and ruinous policies—and redefine the politics of the Middle East. They deserve that chance. Let’s hope they succeed.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Obviously, a young soldier's fate is at stake here. What we do know here at CNN is that there are new discussions with intermediaries in the region. Most likely the Qataris to get in touch with the Taliban and see what room there may be for discussions to get Bergdahl back.\nIn the past, the Taliban have wanted the release of five prisoners being held at Guantanamo bay. The U.S. has not agreed to that in the past. Whether there is some new formulation to make that happen remains to be seen. But what we do know is discussions are underway with intermediaries in the region trying to see if after all this time, there is a way to bring this young man home -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Barbara, last month, we reported the U.S. did receive what's called proof of life on Bergdahl that came nearly three years after -- three years of silence. Does that proof of life play into these negotiations? STARR: Well, what it does is reassure the United States, clearly, that Bergdahl is alive but not, perhaps, in the best of health. People who looked at that imagery said he did appear more frail than he has in the past.\nSo, the belief is that there is a couple of drivers here. His health and the fact that U.S. troops may not be in Afghanistan very much longer if they leave at the end of the year. This is a renewed push, if you will, to see what can be done to get this young man out. Whether it's directly tied or not, perhaps maybe yes, maybe no. But the timing is what is so interesting to U.S. officials that they were made to have this video in hand just as they're trying to see what they can do about it all.\nBLITZER: All right, we'll see what happens. Let's hope for the best, Barbara. Thanks very much.\nBowe Bergdahl's family, by the way, has just released this statement. Let me read it to you. We applaud the unity of purpose and resolve at the White House and other U.S. government agencies involved. We thank all involved for this renewed effort. We hope everyone takes this opportunity seriously. We are cautiously optimistic these discussions will lead to the safe return of our son after more than four and a half years in captivity.\nOther news. Now, a revelation of sorts from the director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He says the bulk collection of Americans' phone call data wouldn't have been a big deal if people were told about it immediately after 911.\nIn an exclusive interview with \"The Daily Beast\", he says, had we been transparent about this from the outset right after 911, we wouldn't have had the problem we had. He went on to say, I don't think it would be of any greater concern to most Americans than fingerprints. Well, people kind of accept that, because they know about it. Just like we have to go to airports two hours early, take our shoes off. All of the other things we do for the common good, this is one more thing.\nAll right, let's discuss what we just heard from Clapper. The New York Republican Congressman, Peter King, is joining us. He's a key member of the House Homeland Security Committee. He's a chairman of the subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence. I was surprised to hear Clapper make this statement. What about you, Congressman?\nREP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: Yes, I have great regard for General Clapper, but, politically, I don't agree with him. And I say politically in that I think that people still would have objected. He still would have certain people objecting to it.\nAnd also, you know, the whole idea of (INAUDIBLE) activity is that you don't announce to the world about your enemies what you're doing. So, I think in those days after 911, especially it would have been dangerous to let the enemy know what we were doing, know what we were collecting. And so, I just don't -- to me, it would have given too much away to the enemy, to the terrorists. And I don't think it would have calmed down the people over here.\nNow, average Americans, yes, but the organized anti-war people, or organized anti-Bush people at that time, for instance, back in 2004, I guess it was, 2005, when \"New York times\" had a big expose on the -- on the collecting of calls.\nSo, no, I -- listen, I think General Clapper meant well. I think he's done an outstanding job. But I think as far as reading the political tea leaves here, I think it would have been a mistake to do at the time because I still think the opposition would have been there and we would have been tipping off the enemy is what we were doing.\nBLITZER: Because it makes it sound -- and I am anxious to get your thoughts on this. It makes it sound that Snowden, Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who, last June, did release all this information, made it public about what the U.S. was doing, in terms of this metadata collection operation. It makes it sound at least, Clapper seemed to think, well, maybe Snowden did the right thing. I should have done it right after 911. The U.S. should have done it right after 911. We still wouldn't know about this if Snowden hadn't released this information.\nKING: Yes, I don't think General Clapper said anything we have to be ashamed of here. I think he's just saying it would have been less of a reaction if we had put it out after 911 rather than now. But I have been in many, many meetings with General Clapper. And I can tell you, he does not think Snowden did the right thing. He has nothing but contempt from Snowden, based on the meetings I've had with General Clapper.\nSo, I think what he is saying is that it may have been easier to get this done at the time, and it wouldn't have had the shock effect that it -- that it's had now. But I -- my concern would be looking at it, in -- both in hindsight and trying to think what would have happened that if we had announced it then, it would have started a debate at the time which would have been generated in such a way as to let the enemy know what we're doing and those who are opposed would still be opposed.\nBLITZER: But I guess the question is, given the statement that Clapper has now made to \"The Daily Beast\" to Eli Lake, and he's going to be joining us, Eli Lake, later in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\"\nKING: Right.\nBLITZER: Given the fact he's made this statement that what Snowden released effectively should have been released by the U.S. government immediately after 911, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal. If you're Snowden's lawyer, you use that statement to say, well, look, what Snowden did was only what Clapper himself said the U.S. should have done after 911. So, don't go after him.\nKING: I think he's -- first of all, I think General Clapper is only saying it should have been done to calm down public opinion. But, also, let's keep in mind that only about two percent of what Snowden has taken involves the NSA. There is other -- you know, much other data that he has obtained which the Defense Department, for instance, has shown would -- can do tremendous damage to Americans, including our IED detection devices. It's -- he's been very damaging to our national security.\nSo, the NSA part I think is only about two percent of the total amount of Snowden drew down. So even if that were true, again, NSA is a small part of the damage that Snowden has done. But I think what General Clapper was saying is (INAUDIBLE.) I just think that that's a -- it's really a -- intelligence (INAUDIBLE) is supposed to be kept secret. That's just part of the survival of the government. That's why we have representative democracy, why we have people in Congress who have been elected and on the Intelligence Committee and others. They are the ones who are aware of this, and they are representing the people.\nBLITZER: I suspect there is going to be a lot of discussion about this story coming up. Hey, --\nKING: Sure.\nBLITZER: -- Congressman, thanks, as usual, for joining us.\nKING: Thank you, Wolf. As always, thank you.\nBLITZER: Peter King is a member -- key member of the House Homeland Security Committee.\nJust ahead this hour, making big trucks that produce less pollution. President Obama focusing in on fuel efficiency as he tackles climate change. Gloria Borger is standing by live will discuss the politics of this.\nAlso ahead, the rocker, Ted Nugent, campaigning today for a Republican candidate running for governor of Texas. But Nugent's recent remarks about President Obama have a lot of people outraged right now, wondering why are the Republicans in Texas welcoming someone who calls the president of the United States a subhuman mongrel?\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nBLITZER: The political firebrand, Ted Nugent, (INAUDIBLE) at the far right, is campaigning, at this moment, with the Texas gubernatorial candidate, Greg Abbott. This despite Nugent's recent characterization of President Obama as a, quote, \"subhuman mongrel.\" Abbott, who is the state attorney general, invited Nugent to appear with him at two events today to motivate the Republican base to vote early. Nugent's presence hit a sour note with a lot of people. They say Texans deserve better than a candidate who would align himself with someone like Nugent who said -- who offered hate-filled assessments of the president. Listen to this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTED NUGENT, ENTERTAINER, MUSIC INDUSTRY: -- obviously failed to galvanize and prod and not shame enough Americans to be ever vigilant not to let a Chicago communist-raised, communist-educated, communist- nurtured, subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster, Barack Hussein Obama, to weasel his way into the top office of authority of the United States of America.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBLITZER: Shockingly, Abbott's campaign brushed aside the criticism, saying they value Nugent's commitment to the second amendment issuing a statement, Ted Nugent is a forceful advocate for individual liberty and constitutional rights, especially the second amendment rights cherished by Texans. While he may sometimes say things or use language that Greg Abbott would not endorse or agree with, we appreciate the support of everyone who supports protecting our constitution.\nNugent himself dismissed the controversy, reportedly saying that criticism comes from, quote, \"people who hate freedom.\"\nWayne Slater is the senior political writer for \"The Dallas Morning News.\" Wayne, thanks very much for joining us. You know, it's one thing for Ted Nugent to be saying what he's saying, calling the president, in effect, a communist, a subhuman mongrel. It's another thing for someone who wants to be governor of Texas to welcome him in out on the campaign trail with him. What's been the reaction there?\nWAYNE SLATER, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, \"The Dallas Morning News\": Yes, basically, that's the real problem for the Abbott campaign. On the one hand, Nugent is very, very popular with the Republican base in Texas. He lives here in Texas. His ranch is adjacent to George W. Bush's ranch near Waco. He's a fixture at the National Rifle Association. So, he's popular among the kind of base voters that Abbott is trying to appeal to.\nThe problem here is, when you call the president a subhuman mongrel, which has not only a disparaging reference but also an historic racial reference in some places, and then when you call feminine women politicians, fat pigs, then Abbott has to make a decision. And he had to say, do I keep Ted Nugent on the stage with me or not? He has chosen to do so. And that's what happened today.\nBLITZER: I mean do they know the history of that phrase, subhuman mongrel? That's what the Nazis called Jews leading up and during World War II -\nSLATER: Yes.\nBLITZER: To justify the genocide of the Jewish community. They called the Jews unter menschen, or subhuman mongrels, if you read some of the literature that the Nazis put out. There's a long history there of that specific phrase that he used involving the president of the United States.\nSLATER: You know, I don't know what the Abbott people knew precisely about the implications of some of the things Nugent said. But Nugent has been very outspoken, has said a whole lot for years that was easy enough to look into. And, frankly, when you talk about something like the word \"mongrel\" with its racial and ethnic and historic ramifications, there is no doubt, it seems to me, that whether or not Abbott's people recognized it instantly or not, it's offensive, deeply offensive, to some voters, and not just Democratic voters, but other voters.\nHaving said that, Wolf, and this is really the dark side of this, might that phrase be a kind of dog whistle and code to exactly some of the voters that Greg Abbott wants.\nBLITZER: Because I - as someone who has studied the Holocaust, studied World War II, I went back and we checked. In Der Sturmer in -- during World War II, Julius Streicher, the Nazi, this is what he would say about the Jews in justifying the genocide of the Jewish people.\nSLATER: That's right. Right.\nBLITZER: \"The Jew is a mongrel. He has hereditary tendencies from Aryans, Asiatics, Negroes and from the Mongolians. Evil always preponderates in the case of a mongrel.\" So that's the history of that phrase. And, A, I wonder if Ted Nugent himself knows that history, the use of that phrase. But, B, the Republicans in Texas who are welcoming him on the campaign trail and saying, yes, you know what, he's using some outspoken language. That's Ted Nugent. Do they know what this means to so many people out there?\nSLATER: You know, it's fascinating, Wolf, because you look at Ted Cruz, who has long said these outrageous things, calling the president a subhuman mongrel, calling Hillary Clinton the \"b\" word, calling women feminist fat pigs, saying a whole host of things, and you have to ask, doesn't he know that these are the kinds of words, these are the kinds of phrases that ought to offend people? But his support of the Second Amendment, at least for some Republican base voters, is so strong, it trumps all of that, including questions that the Davis -- Wendy Davis campaign, the likely Democratic opponent of Greg Abbott, has raised in which Nugent has acknowledged sexual relations with underage girls, something that had he ever been charged with a crime would have brought as much as 50 years to a life sentence in Texas.\nBLITZER: Let me play another clip of what he said in that interview that's now been posted on YouTube. Listen to this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTED NUGENT: I think America will be America again when Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, Dick Durbin, Michael Bloomberg and all of the liberal Democrats are in jail.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!\nNUGENT: Facing the just due punishment that their treasonous acts are clearly apparent.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBLITZER: And so, once again, I guess the question is someone like Abbott and the other Republicans who are out there campaigning with Ted Nugent, do they have a clue of what this guy has been saying? SLATER: I have to conclude that they do have some clue. They may not know everything and all the implications, but they clearly know something. Ted Nugent lives here much. He talks here. He's a fixture of some Republican local Republican events. So he knows. And the politics of this is crazy, it seems to me, if you analyze the race. Abbott is likely to win the Republican nomination. He's the front runner to win the election in November.\nAnd so you wonder, Wendy Davis needs to attract a great number of Democrat-based voters, plus a lot of women. Ann Richards in 1990 got 61 percent of the women vote. She won for governor. Wendy Davis has to do the same thing. This is the kind of language and approach, it seems to me, the Davis camp understands could absolutely cause a problem with the moderate, suburban women voters and others who won't find it funny or find it terribly offensive. And, frankly, I don't understand the politics of having him on stage with Greg Abbott.\nBLITZER: Yes, I suspect they're going to be running away from him fairly soon, but we'll see. We'll see what happens and you'll monitor it for us as you do all things political in the great state of Texas. Wayne, thanks very much for joining us.\nSLATER: All right.\nBLITZER: And later this hour, a defector from a Syrian rebel group is now vowing to take them down. Why he says the group is even worse than the Bashar al Assad regime.\nBut up next, President Obama takes direct aim at truck pollution. His latest action targeting big trucks as part of a broader focus on climate change.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nBLITZER: President Obama announces the latest move toward making trucks more fuel-efficient to cut down on pollution and reduce America's oil usage. The first phase just finalized back in 2011. It sets standards for medium and heavy-duty trucks and covers model years 2014 to 2018. Now the president is ordering officials with the EPA and the Transportation Department to take the next step.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Their charge, their goal, is to develop fuel economy standards for heavy duty trucks that will take us well into the next decade, just like our cars. They're going to partner with manufacturers and auto workers and states and other stakeholders, truckers, to come up with a proposal by March of next year, and they'll complete the rule a year after that. And businesses that buy these types of trucks have sent a clear message to the nearly 30,000 workers who build them. We want trucks that use less oil, save more money, cut pollution.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBLITZER: The new fuel standards for trucks are part of a larger push by the Obama administration to focus in on climate change. The president is calling for $1 billion to develop new technologies to prepare for and combat its effects. Our chief political analyst, Gloria Borger, is here watching all of this.\nSo what is the president politically trying to accomplish right now?\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: He's trying to make the base of the Democratic Party happy. They've had some problems with him as far as climate change is concerned. They don't believe he's gone far enough. They'd like to get a decision on the Keystone pipeline that says don't build the pipeline. He hasn't done any of that yet.\nSo what he's saying is, OK, I had these regulations in effect. I'm going to make sure that they continue for trucks. And this is one of those things he can do with a pen, as he pointed out in his State of the Union speech, without having to get congressional approval. So he can sort of check the box on that.\nBLITZER: He was in northern California last week talking about the severe drought there.\nBORGER: Right.\nBLITZER: And he said this. Listen to this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Unless and until we do more to combat carbon pollution that causes climate change, this trend's going to get worse. And the hard truth is, even if we do take action on climate change, carbon pollution has built up in our atmosphere for decades. The plant is slowly going to keep warming for a long time to come.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBLITZER: All right, so how much pushback is the president likely to get on this?\nBORGER: Well, he's going to get a lot of pushback. As you know, Wolf, Congress has been divided on this, largely along party lines. And they've repeatedly rejected any efforts on the president's side to reduce tax breaks for oil exploration. You remember that energy and solar energy became a big issue during the last campaign. So I think he knows he's going to get pushback, but he's continuing to talk about it. And the big --\nBLITZER: And it all is building up to the decision he's got to make on the Keystone pipeline.\nBORGER: Well -\nBLITZER: My own suspicion is, if he approves it, he's got to make a decision, I think, by June or July, something along those lines.\nBORGER: Right. BLITZER: All of these current actions might be designed to, you know --\nBORGER: Soften the blow?\nBLITZER: A little bit, yes.\nBORGER: Well, and it's actually John Kerry now, secretary of state, has to make a recommendation to the president on what to do with the pipeline, and the State Department report said, as you'll recall at the end of January, that the pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution. So Kerry then has to report to the president. Now, Kerry's a big environmentalist. He hasn't stated where he is on this. And then the president will have to give his own decision, although, as you point out, there isn't really a hard and fast time line on any of this.\nBLITZER: Right. Well, we'll see when he does.\nBORGER: Yes.\nBLITZER: Thank you. Lots at stake. Gloria Borger with us.\nSome of the hardest-hit areas are the Syrian refugee camps. The crisis in Syria is clearly growing and children are so impacted. Now a young activist is trying to make the situation just a little bit better in one refugee camp along the border with Syria. My conversation with the Pakistani teenager, Malala Yousafzai. That's still ahead.\nBut up next, a Syrian rebel group some are calling as dangerous as the Bashar al Assad regime itself.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Commentary: The Racist Rantings of Ted Nugent and Republican Silence\nThere is something so utterly repugnant about the recent statements of Ted Nugent, the 1970s rock star who is the darling of the conservative right wing. Nugent, of course, has become far better known for preposterous political commentary than anything he has done lately in the world of entertainment.\nIn a recent interview, Nugent said that by electing President Obama, American voters had allowed a \"Chicago communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured, subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America.\" If that weren’t enough, Nugent also referred to the president of United States as a chimpanzee.\nThe hateful language is despicable and tragic. But what is even more abominable is the way Nugent is being embraced by conservative politicians, particularly Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the likely Republican candidate for governor of Texas. Nugent is a strong supporter of Abbott’s gubernatorial campaign and the Texas attorney general has not shown the slightest inclination to distance himself from his controversial booster. In fact, at a recent campaign event, he introduced Abbott as his “friend” and referred to him as a “blood brother.”\n“I don’t know what he may have said or done in his background,” Abbott said about Nugent. “What I do know is that he stands for the Constitution. He stands against the federal government overreaching.”\nNugent’s kind of talk is deeply repulsive. And as CNN’s Wolf Blitzer pointed out recently, the language he used is steeped in the phraseology of Nazi officials in their description of Jewish citizens in Germany.\n\"That’s what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community,\" Blitzer said in a one-on-one discussion with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\"They called them untermenschen, subhuman mongrels. If you read some of the literature that the Nazis put out there, there is a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States.\"\nWhat is equally distressing is the unwillingness of Republican officials to condemn this kind of language. There can be no doubt of the racist and highly insulting nature of Nugent’s words. Yet Republican leaders have largely remained silent. Gingrich, for example, deflected the attention from Nugent and Abbott, suggesting that Democratic allies had tossed around equally inflammatory words.\nThis has become a pattern for Nugent. When President Obama won reelection in 2012, the singer made his opinion known via social media. On Twitter, he wrote, “Pimps whores & welfare brats & their soulless supporters have a president to destroy America.”\nNugent is the man who came to the defense of George Zimmerman, labeling Trayvon Martin as “a gangsta wannabe” who was bloodthirsty. He also offered his deep sympathy for Zimmerman, whom he feared might be the target of prosecution by attorney general Eric Holder. By the way, Nugent referred to Holder as “the most corrupt and racist attorney general in the history of the nation.”\nUntil Republican officials demonstrate the strength of character to offer the kind of condemnation these words deserve, they will never be viewed by progressive minded Americans as being fit for their support.\nBET National News - Keep up to date with breaking news stories from around the nation, including headlines from the hip hop and entertainment world.

MDT\nMR. LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver, in Denver, Colorado. I'm Jim Lehrer of the PBS News Hour, and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 Presidential Debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\nThis debate and the next three -- two presidential, one vice presidential -- are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the Commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments, with 2-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means. But I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the Commission or the candidates.\nThe segments, as I announced in advance, will be three on the economy, and one each on health care, the role of government, and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics, and choices. Both candidates will also have 2-minute closing statements.\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy, distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say.\nThere is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. (Applause.)\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let's start with the economy, segment one, and let's begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You have two minutes -- each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney, and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. (Laughter.) And so I just want to wish, sweetie, you happy anniversary, and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (Laughter.)\nFour years ago, we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we’ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we’ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise.\nBut we all know that we’ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we’ve been, but where we’re going.\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that we’ll be better off. I’ve got a different view. I think we’ve got to invest in education and training. I think it’s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America; that we change our tax code to make sure that we’re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States; that we take some of the money that we’re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America; and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\nNow, ultimately, it’s going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take. Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess? Or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I’m looking forward to having that debate.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It’s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the President. I’m pleased to be at the University of Denver. I appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I’m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here with me. (Laughter.) Congratulations.\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I’ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country -- I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, I’ve been out of work since May, can you help me? Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He’s lost his most recent job and we’ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it’s going to take a different path -- not the one we’ve been on, not the one the President describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That’s not what I’m going to do. My plan has five basic parts: One, get us energy independent -- North America energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America; crack down on China if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world -- we are far away from that now. Number four, get us to a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business.\nIt’s small business that creates the jobs in America. And over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business, because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. I know what it takes to get small business growing again, to hire people.\nNow, I’m concerned that the path that we’re on has just been unsuccessful. The President has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago, that a bigger government spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the Governor just said about trickle-down, his trickle-down approach, as he said yours is.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we've got to improve our education system. And we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.\nWe've got a program called Race To The Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now, I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas\n-- I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production. And oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit. And one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is how do we deal with our tax code and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investments.\nAnd this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\nMR. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things. And we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the President directly about something he just said?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, sure, I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of the scale that you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're President or I am.\nThe people who are having a hard time right now are middle-income Americans. Under the President's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing.\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the President, electric rates are up, food prices are up, health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again? And I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the cornerstones of my plan.\nBut the President mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note. First, education. I agree education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\nThe second area, taxation: We agree we ought to bring the tax rates down, and I do -- both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue and have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\nThe third area, energy: Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up -- but not due to his policies, in spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.\nIf I’m President, I’ll double them and also get the oil from offshore in Alaska, and I’ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And by the way, I like coal. I’m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it’s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\nAnd finally with regards to that tax cut, look, I’m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the revenues going to the government. My number-one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that -- no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let’s talk about taxes because I think it’s instructive. Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.\nAnd the reason is because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who is going off to college, which means they're spending more money; businesses have more customers; businesses make more profits and then hire more workers.\nNow, Governor Romney’s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he’s been asked over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn’t been able to identify them.\nBut I’m going to make an important point here, Jim. When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don’t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\nAnd that’s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney’s pledge of not reducing the deficit -- or not adding to the deficit, is by burdening middle-class families; the average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.\nNow, that’s not my analysis. That’s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And that kind of top-down economics where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making 3 million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that’s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, what is the difference? Let’s just stay on taxes for a --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But I get -- right, right.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s just stay on taxes for a moment here.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Yes. Well, but virtually --\nMR. LEHRER: What is the difference?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\nMR. LEHRER: All right.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I’d say, absolutely not. I’m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I’ve said is, I won’t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That’s part one. So there’s no economist who can say Mitt Romney’s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it’s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it’s just not the case. Look, I’ve got five boys. I’m used to people saying something that’s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I’ll believe it. (Laughter.) But that is not the case, all right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\nAnd number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you described and say it’s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you’re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there.\nBut let’s get to the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time, lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is, because small business pays that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of America’s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.\nFor me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, that’s where we started. Yes.\nDo you challenge what the Governor just said about his own plan?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, for 18 months, he’s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he’s saying that his big, bold idea is \"never mind.\" And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It’s math. It’s arithmetic.\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small business 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\nBut I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was President, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we can not only reduce the deficit, we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we’re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they’re the job creators, they’d be burdened. But under Governor Romney’s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business -- and I know Donald Trump doesn’t like to think of himself as small anything. But that’s how you define small businesses if you’re getting business income.\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research -- all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\nMR. LEHRER: All right.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that point, which is these --\nMR. LEHRER: Just for the record --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- small businesses we’re talking about --\nMR. LEHRER: Excuse me, just so everybody understands, we’re way over our first 15 minutes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: It’s fun, isn’t it?\nMR. LEHRER: It’s okay. It’s great.\nTHE PRESIDENT: That’s okay.\nMR. LEHRER: Great, no problem. As long as you all don’t have a problem, I don’t have a problem.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: That’s good.\nMR. LEHRER: Because we’re still on the economy. We’re going to come back to taxes, and we’re going to move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. But go ahead, sir.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: You bet. President, you’re -- Mr. President, you’re absolutely right, which is that with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they’re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half -- of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.\nNow, I talked to a guy who has a very small business. He’s in the electronics business in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes -- federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.\nI don’t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions -- the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way. Get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs, because there’s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That’s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Jim, you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people: If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for -- $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that’s more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney’s plan may work for you.\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that’s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we’ve tried this -- we’ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney is talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I’m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So in some ways we’ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans. And I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they’ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we’re not blowing up the deficit.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: The President began this segment, so I think I get the last word. So I’m going to take it.\nMR. LEHRER: You’re going to get the first part in the next segment.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word of that segment -- well, I hope -- let me just make this comment.\nMR. LEHRER: That's not how it works.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Let me repeat what I said. I’m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one. So you may keep referring to the $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.\nNumber two, let’s look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time, so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. They’re suffering in this country.\nAnd we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It’s absolutely extraordinary. We’ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It’s just -- we’ve got -- when the President took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year; and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, let’s talk -- we’re still on the economy. This is theoretically now a second segment, still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question -- you each have two minutes on this. And Governor Romney, you go first because the President went first on segment one.\nAnd the question is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Good, I’m glad you raised that, and it’s a critical issue. I think it’s not just an economic issue. I think it’s a moral issue. I think it’s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to passed on to the next generation, and they’re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt we’re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number three is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they’re paying taxes and you can get the job done that way.\nThe President would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth, and you can never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it’s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I’ll get rid of it. Obamacare is on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I like it.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Okay, good. So I’ll get rid of that. I’m sorry, Jim, I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I actually like you, too. But I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it. That's number one.\nNumber two, I’ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\nNumber three, I’ll make government more efficient and cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The President said he’d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it -- trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The President has put in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as all prior Presidents combined.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: When I walked into the Oval Office I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card, two tax cuts that were not paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for, and then a massive economic crisis.\nAnd despite that, what we’ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn’t slip into a Great Depression, but what we’ve also said it let’s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren’t working very well, 18 government programs for education that were well intentioned but weren’t helping kids learn.\nWe went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars -- $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That’s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\nNow, we all know that we’ve got to do more, and so I put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It’s on a website, you can look at all the numbers -- what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut we ask for $1 of additional revenue paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.\nGovernor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that’s how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward, suggested we have to do it -- in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let me just finish this point because you’re looking for contrast.\nWhen Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that -- Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively, this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities. And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\nMR. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Sorry.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Will you support Simpson-Bowles?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the President should have grabbed that.\nMR. LEHRER: I mean do you support Simpson-Bowles?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It’s not the same as Simpson-Bowles. But in my view, the President should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's what we’ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we’re putting it forward before Congress right now -- a $4 trillion plan --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But you’ve been -- but you’ve been President four years --\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- a balanced --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: You’ve been President four years. You said you’d cut the deficit in half. It’s now four years later; we still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we’ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you’re reelected we’ll get to a trillion-dollar debt. But you have said before you’d cut the deficit in half. And I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts -- you found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done.\nLet me come back and say, why is that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise taxes on people? And actually you said it. Back in 2010, you said, look, I’m going to extend the tax policies that we have. Now, I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we’re in recession, you shouldn’t raise taxes on anyone. Well, the economy is still going slow. As a matter of fact, it’s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.\nAnd the reality is, it’s not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump -- it’s not just Donald Trump you’re taxing. It’s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America, these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.\nI’ll make one more point.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s let him answer the taxes thing for a moment.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Okay.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we’ve had this discussion before --\nMR. LEHRER: No, about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\nTHE PRESIDENT: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He’s ruled out revenue.\nMR. LEHRER: Is that --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Absolutely. Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you’ll never get there. You never balance the budget by raising taxes. Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We’re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don't want to go down the path of Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.\nMR. LEHRER: But, Mr. President, you’re saying in order to get the job done, it’s got to be balanced.\nTHE PRESIDENT: If we’re serious, we’ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let’s talk about corporate taxes. Now, I’ve identified areas where we can right away make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that Exxon Mobil needs some extra money when they're making money every time you go to the pump?\nWhy wouldn’t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn’t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to in a revenue-neutral way close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn’t identified which ones they are -- but thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I’ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue.\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me she's got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks, she's got some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They're using textbooks that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That's not how America was built.\nAnd so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions. And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30-percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is numbers on a sheet of paper. But if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And governors are creative, there's no doubt about it. But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Jim, we've gone on a lot of topics there. And so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools --\nMR. LEHRER: Come back to Medicaid, yes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- to oil to tax breaks and companies going overseas. So let's go through them one by one.\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.\nTHE PRESIDENT: It's time to end it.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green-energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil, actually those $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\nBut you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive if you get that rate down to 25 percent. But don't forget, you put $90 billion -- like 50 years' worth of breaks -- into solar and wind -- to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers. So this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas -- look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant. But the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\nAnd finally, Medicaid to states -- I'm not quite sure where that came in except this, which is I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year plus inflation, plus 1 percent. And then, you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\nAnd I remember as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\nOne of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this. And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them.\nMR. LEHRER: Let's go.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\nMR. LEHRER: We're going on -- still on the economy, but another part of it. All right, this is segment three, the economy. Entitlements, first answer goes to you -- two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I suspect that on Social Security we’ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It’s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker Tip O’Neill. But the basic structure is sound.\nBut I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare because that’s the big driver of our deficits right now.\nMy grandmother, some of you know, helped to raise me -- my grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected President. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up -- only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.\nShe had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And that’s the perspective I bring when I think about what’s called entitlements. The name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term. And in Medicare, what we did was we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if we’re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that let’s look where some of the money is going -- $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies, by making sure that we weren’t overpaying providers, and using that money we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money throughout the system.\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don’t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\nMR. LEHRER: We’ll follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know any time we talk about entitlements people become concerned that something is going to happen that’s going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is, neither the President, nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near-retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you’re 60 or around 60 or older, you don’t need to listen any further.\nBut for younger people we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring -- oh, I just thought about one, and that is in fact I was wrong when I said the President isn’t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security he’s not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he’s cutting $716 billion from the program -- now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers, actually, just going to them and saying we’re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody is going to get a lower rate. That saying we're cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take any more Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.\nWe have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients in Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back, we're going to give a better prescription program. That's $1 for every $15 you've cut. They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.\nI want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\nWith regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called Premium Support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.\nMR. LEHRER: And you don't support that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't. And let me explain why.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Again, that's for future people --\nTHE PRESIDENT: I understand.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- not for current retirees.\nTHE PRESIDENT: So if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this will affect you.\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare, and every health care economist who looks at it says over time what will happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\nSo I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my -- only my opinion. AARP thinks that the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolstered the system, lengthened the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all.\nAnd ironically, if you repeal Obamacare -- and I have become fond of this term, Obamacare -- (laughter) -- if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying co-pays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren’t making seniors any healthier. And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\nMR. LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But do you support the voucher system, Governor?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the President supports taking $716 billion out of that program.\nMR. LEHRER: What about the voucher --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: So that's number one. Number two is, for people coming along that are young, what I'd do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan -- their choice. They get to -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000 -- that's not going to happen. They'll have at least two plans.\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare. Or they'll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan. I know I’d just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I’d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. Let people make their own choice.\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare, we have to have the benefits high for those that are low-income. But for higher-income people, we’re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.\nThat's the plan that I put forward. And by the way, the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or Senator Wyden, who is a co-author of the bill with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff. This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let’s see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\nMR. LEHRER: Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Jim, if I can just respond very quickly. First of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that, that's what they do. And so you’ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney is proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\nOne last point I want to make: We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare, but --\nMR. LEHRER: We'll talk about that in a minute.\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- but overall.\nMR. LEHRER: Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And so --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: That's a big topic. Can we stay on Medicare?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Is that a separate topic?\nMR. LEHRER: Yes, we’re going to -- yes, I want to get to it.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry.\nMR. LEHRER: But all I want to do is very quickly before we leave the economy --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Let’s get back to Medicare. Let’s get back to Medicare.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: The President said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\nMR. LEHRER: All right.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\nMR. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. Wait a minute.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But my experience -- my experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\nMR. LEHRER: Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between the two of you on Medicare?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Absolutely.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Absolutely.\nMR. LEHRER: All right. So, to finish quickly, briefly on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more? Beginning with you -- this is not a new two-minute segment. Just start, and we’ll go for a few minutes, and then we’re going to go to health care, okay?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have -- I needed to know the regulations. I needed them there. You could have people opening up banks in their garage and making loans. You have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\nMR. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: In some places, yes.\nMR. LEHRER: Like where? Let me know.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Other places no. It can become out of date. And what’s happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the President’s term, you’ve seen regulation become excessive and it’s hurt the -- it’s hurt the economy.\nLet me give you an example. Dodd-Frank was passed, and it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as \"too big to fail,\" and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that's been given to New York banks I’ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There have been -- 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd-Frank. So there’s one example.\nHere’s another. In Dodd-Frank, it says if --\nMR. LEHRER: You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal it and replace it. We’re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation, and there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency. You need to have leverage limits for institutional --\nMR. LEHRER: Well, there’s a specific --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But let’s -- but let’s mention --\nMR. LEHRER: Excuse me --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Let me mention the other one. Let’s talk the other big one.\nMR. LEHRER: No, let’s not.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Okay.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s let him respond -- let’s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the Governor just said.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn’t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn’t have been given because the folks didn't qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn’t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A-1, great investments when they weren’t. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn’t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you’ve got -- banks, you’ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can’t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We’re going to make sure that you’ve got to have a living will, so we can know how you’re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don’t have other taxpayer bailouts.\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back -- every single dime -- with interest.\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and I appreciate and it appears we’ve got some agreement that a marketplace, to work, has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Roll it back. And so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that’s not what I believe.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Sorry, Jim, but that’s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That’s why I’d have regulation. But I wouldn’t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That’s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn’t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it’s killing regional and small banks. They’re getting hurt.\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren’t qualified. That’s exactly right. It’s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that’s not qualified, there are big penalties -- except they didn’t ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was. It’s been two years. We don’t know what a qualified mortgage is yet.\nSo banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It’s hurt the housing market, because Dodd-Frank didn’t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It’s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn’t come out with a clear regulation.\nI will make sure we don’t hurt the functioning of our marketplace and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\nMR. LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now let’s move to health care, where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare. And it’s a two-minute new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part it comes, again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire; a woman came to me and she said, look, I can’t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we’re thinking of dropping our insurance -- we can’t afford it. And the number of small businesses I’ve gone to that are saying they’re dropping insurance because they can’t afford it -- the cost of health care is just prohibitive, and we’ve got to deal with cost.\nAnd unfortunately, when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it’s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the President ran for office, he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it’s gone up by that amount. So it’s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that’s one reason I don’t want it.\nSecond reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don’t like that idea.\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country. It said, what’s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said, it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don’t know how the President could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state -- craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state, and then let’s focus on getting the cost down for people rather than raising it with a $2,500 additional premium.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, four years ago when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn’t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn’t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn’t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care cost. But it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick -- millions of families all across the country.\nIf they had a preexisting condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so, as a consequence, they’re paying their premiums; somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don’t have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that they’ve hit the limit.\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you’ve got health insurance it doesn’t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can’t jerk you around. They can’t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on your insurance plan until you’re 26 years old. And it also says that you’re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\nNumber two, if you don’t have health insurance, we’re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you’re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\nNow, the last point I’d make before --\nMR. LEHRER: Two minutes is up, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me. (Laughter.) The irony is that we’ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state, to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as consequence, people are covered there. It hasn’t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\nMR. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.)\nAll right, Governor, tell the President directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement --\nTHE PRESIDENT: You did.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- I’ll go on.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Please elaborate.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: I’ll elaborate -- exactly right. (Laughter.)\nFirst of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator -- to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer, and drove it through.\nWhat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together. Two hundred legislators in my legislature -- only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.\nWhat were some differences? We didn’t raise taxes. You’ve raised them by a trillion dollars under Obamacare. We didn’t cut Medicare -- of course, we don't have Medicare -- but we didn’t cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn’t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they’re going to receive. We didn’t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put people in a position where they’re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\nRight now the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company, of American Businesses, said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\nSo for those reasons -- for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance -- this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare. It’s why Republicans said, do not do this. And the Republicans had a plan. They put a plan out. They put a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important, has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a President who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is we used the same advisors and they say it’s the same plan.\nWhen Governor Romney talks about this board, for example -- unelected board that we’ve created -- what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall. Because there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured, and let them fend for themselves; to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured -- and that's been the trend line. Or alternatively, we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective. And there are ways of doing it.\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care, cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They say if a patient is coming in, let’s get all the doctors together at once, do one test, instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let’s make sure that we’re providing preventive care, so we’re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let’s pay providers on the basis of performance, as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they’ve engaged in.\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says let’s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that when Obamacare is fully implemented, we’re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up, it’s true, but they’ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we’re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you’re already getting a rebate.\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says we should replace it -- I’m just going to repeal it, but we can replace it with something. But the problem is he hasn’t described what exactly we’d replace it with, other than saying we’re going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he’s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who has got a preexisting condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it’s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you’re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance at a time when it’s vitally important.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s let the Governor explain what you would do if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it? What do you have in mind?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, actually, it’s a lengthy description, but number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace. You don't have the government mandate that for that to occur.\nBut let’s come back to something the President and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it’s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government -- an unelected board, appointed board -- who are going to decide what kind of treatments you ought to have.\nTHE PRESIDENT: No --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government is not effective in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the government will ever be.\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.\nI used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job for keeping costs down. And that's happening -- Intermountain Health Care does it superbly well. Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well; Cleveland clinic, others.\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law.\nBut let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated -- that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well actually, Governor, that isn't what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if it's been under 90 days.\nBut that's already the law. And that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that, insurers, you've got to take everybody. Now, that also means that you've got more customers.\nBut when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be, in fact, replaced -- and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem -- it just reminds me of -- he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones. He won't tell us. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and assure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good? Is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is because when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of preexisting conditions -- these are tough problems and we've got to make choices -- and the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\nMR. LEHRER: We're going to move to --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: No, I have to respond to that -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You’ve said the same thing -- you’re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families, and I’m going to work together with Congress to say, okay, what are the various ways we can bring down deductions, for instance. One way, for instance, would be to have a single number -- make up a number -- $25,000, $50,000 -- anybody could have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That’s one way one could do it.\nOne could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model, and tax deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.\nAnd with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my preexisting condition plan. You obviously studied up on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with preexisting conditions; that’s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation, state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\nMR. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and it's the role of government. And let’s see, role of government, and it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President.\nAnd the question is this: Do you believe -- both of you, but you have the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there’s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I definitely think there are differences. The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That’s its most basic function. And as Commander-in-Chief, that is something that I have worked on and thought about every single day that I’ve been in the Oval Office.\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity -- the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom, and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions. But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.\nSo in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let’s help to finance the Trans-Continental Railroad. Let’s start the National Academy of Sciences. Let’s start land grant colleges -- because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans -- because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we’re all going to be better off. That doesn’t restrict people’s freedom; that enhances it.\nAnd so what I’ve tried to do as President is to apply those same principles. When it comes to education, what I’ve said is we’ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. It wasn’t a top-down approach, Governor. What we said is to states, we’ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence you have 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.\nBut what I’ve also said is let’s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact, we’ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.\nI do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It can't do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence, we’ll have a better-trained workforce, and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we’ve got a skilled workforce.\nMR. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools -- great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\nThe role of government: Look behind us -- the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty: We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America’s military.\nSecond, in that line that says, \"We are endowed by our Creator with our rights,\" I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our Creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another. We’re a nation that believes that we are all children of the same God, and we care for those that have difficulties. Those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled, we care for them. And we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we’re seeing right now is, in my view, a trickle-down government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams, and it’s not working.\nAnd the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty. The proof of that is we’ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work. We know that the path we’re taking is not working. It’s time for a new path.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, let’s go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government. Education -- does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, some ideas he’s put forward on Race to the Top -- not all of them, but some of them I agree with, and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and state schools to do a better job.\nMy own view, by the way, is I’ve added to that. I happen to believe -- I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or poor kids -- or lower-income kids, rather -- I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the state or to the school district, I’d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their student.\nMR. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government’s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, as I’ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we’ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they’re having an impact right now.\nMR. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney about education and the federal government?\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we’re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\nHis running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney has talked about. And it wasn’t very detailed -- this seems to be a trend -- but what it did do is to, if you extrapolated how much money we’re talking about, you’d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they’re setting up their training programs --\nMR. LEHRER: Do you agree, Governor?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me just finish the point.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Oh, sure. Oh, yes. It’s, by the way, going very well in my state, by the way. Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I suspect it will be a small agreement -- where they’re partnering so that they’re designing training programs and people who are going through them know that there’s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it’s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as President was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed so there was no risk for the banks or the lenders. But they were taking billions out of the system. And we said why not cut out the middleman? And as a consequence, what we’ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.\nAnd this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, that indicates the degree to which there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend the University of Denver just don’t have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that they’ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door -- that is vitally important -- not just to those kids; it’s how we’re going to grow this economy over the long term.\nMR. LEHRER: We’re running out of time, gentlemen, so I think you have a chance to respond to that. Yes, Mr. Governor.\nTHE PRESIDENT: He has a chance.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Mr. President, you’re entitled, as the President, to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts, all right? I’m not going to cut education funding. I don’t have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I’m planning on continuing to grow, so I’m not planning on making changes there.\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into green jobs. And, look, I’m all in favor of green energy. Ninety billion -- that would have hired two million teachers. Ninety billion dollars. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business. I think about half of them -- of the ones that have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happen to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\nLook, the right course for America’s government -- we’re talking about the role of government -- is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is to say, how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive?\nLet’s grade them. I propose we grade our schools, so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a school that’s being more successful. I don’t want to cut our commitment to education. I want to make it more effective and efficient.\nAnd by the way, I’ve had that experience. I don’t just talk about it. I’ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn’t have commitment to education. It’s because I care about education for all of our kids.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Jim, I --\nMR. LEHRER: Excuse me, one -- excuse me, sir. We’ve got -- we barely have three minutes left. I’m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I’ve done a poor job --\nTHE PRESIDENT: You’ve done a great job, Jim.\nMR. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing -- we’ve lost a pod, in other words. So we only have three minutes left in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask, finally here -- and remember, we’ve got three minutes total time here. And the question is this: Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case -- if reelected, in your case -- what would you do about that? Governor?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn’t seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out -- from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.\nMR. LEHRER: Well, what would you do as President?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: As President, I will sit down on day one\n-- actually, the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders, the Democrat leaders as well as Republican leaders, as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple of hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in our state, in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principles, but because there's common ground.\nAnd the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. We face -- this deficit could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East -- there are developments around the world that are of real concern. And Republicans and Democrats both love America, but we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done, and could not care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do it again.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney is going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.\nBut, look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from everybody -- Democrat or Republican -- as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.\nThat's how we repealed \"don't ask, don't tell.\" That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised. And that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after al Qaeda and bin Laden.\nSo we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do -- not just saying I'll sit down, you have to have a plan. Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no to folks both in your own party and in the other party.\nAnd, yes, we had some fights between me and the Republicans when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street -- absolutely -- because that was a fight that needed to be had. When we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no -- yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\nAnd so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\nMR. LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last. So you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Jim, I want to thank you. And I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think this was a terrific debate and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\nFour years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And, yet, my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people. Because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter, and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten. Because of a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn’t lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride that they’re helping to build America.\nAnd so the question now is, how do we build on those strengths? And everything that I’ve tried to do, and everything that I’m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy, or making sure that we’re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allow us to invest in our future -- all those things are designed to make sure that the American people -- their genius, their grit, their determination is channeled and they have an opportunity to succeed, and everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair share -- everybody is doing a fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules.\nFour years ago, I said that I’m not a perfect man and I wouldn’t be a perfect President. And that’s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I’ve kept. But I also promised that I’d fight every single day on behalf of the American people and the middle class, and all those who are striving to get into the middle class. I’ve kept that promise. And if you’ll vote for me, then I promise I’ll fight just as hard in a second term.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\nThis is an important election, and I’m concerned about America. I’m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It’s bigger than our respective parties. It’s an election about the course of America -- what kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening. And over the course of this month we’re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice-presidential debate -- we’ll talk about those paths. But they lead in very different directions. And it’s not just looking to our words that you have to take into evidence of where they go; you can look at the record.\nThere’s no question in my mind that if the President were to be reelected you’ll continue to a see a middle-class squeeze, with incomes going down and prices going up. I’ll get incomes up again. You’ll see chronic unemployment. We’ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If I’m President, I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\nIf the President is reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view, that’s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You’re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If I’m elected, we won’t have Obamacare. We’ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in my place in my own state, and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured, and we’ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\nIf the President were to be reelected, you’re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You’ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare advantage. You’ll have hospitals and providers that will no longer accept Medicare patients. I’ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.\nAnd finally, military. If the President is reelected, you’ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The Secretary of Defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America’s middle class working again.\nThank you, Jim.\nMR. LEHRER: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe next debate will be the vice-presidential event on Thursday, October 11th, at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I’m Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night. (Applause.)\nEND\n8:33 P.M.

Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. JEFFREY BROWN: And now: another story about dollars, this one about dollars and deficits, as the leaders of a bipartisan commission appointed by the president offer a far-reaching and controversial plan.The proposal by the debt commission's chairmen, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, sent out shockwaves that reached all the way to President Obama at the G20 meeting in South Korea. Without addressing the particulars, he said he's ready to make — quote — \"tough decisions.\" And he urged those who campaigned on deficit-cutting to get specific. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Unfortunately, a lot of the talk didn't match up with reality. If we are concerned about debt and deficits, then we're going to have to take actions that are difficult, and we're going to have to tell the truth to the American people. JEFFREY BROWN: That truth, as Democrat Bowles and Republican Simpson see it, involves $4 trillion in deficit reductions over a decade, starting in 2012.Among their dramatic proposals: cutting hundreds of billions a year from the Pentagon and domestic spending programs, while reducing the federal work force by 10 percent; raising the federal gasoline tax by 15 cents; and ending popular tax breaks, including the deduction for home mortgage interest. In addition, the plan calls for major reform of the individual and corporate tax system aimed at closing loopholes, while lowering rates.The chairmen would also cut Medicare spending and raise, over time, the retirement age for full Social Security to 69, while reducing benefits for affluent seniors.For some, it was too much too fast. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly denounced the overall plan as — quote — \"simply unacceptable.\" And some on the commission, like Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, rejected it as well. REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D-Illi.): Now, I agree that we have to something to — that the debt and the deficit are unsustainable, but this is not the way to do it. JEFFREY BROWN: But another commission Democrat, North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad, counseled caution this morning on ABC.SEN. KENT CONRAD (D-N.D.), North Dakota: Instead of shooting this down, propose an alternative, but one that does as good a job as this one does in getting us back on a sound fiscal course. JEFFREY BROWN: Republican leaders largely withheld comment, but some conservative groups blasted the tax-increase provisions. The proposal is not the full commission's report. That is due by December 1.So, the debate is on. And we have our own now, with Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget at the New America Foundation. Damon Silvers is director of policy and special counsel at the AFL-CIO. And Grover Norquist is the president of the advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform. Welcome to all of you.Maya MacGuineas, I will let you go first. We are going to hear that you're surrounded on two sides with different critiques. Why do you think this is a good idea overall?MAYA MACGUINEAS, president, Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget President: Well, I mean, I think if there's one thing that we should be able to agree on, it's that the deficit and the debt present a real threat to this economy in the medium and long term.And this is the first time in — in years, really, that there's been a realistic plan that's been put out there of the kinds of policies that are going to be required to address this threat. And my hope is that having this realistic blueprint out there changes the terms of the debate.No longer are we going to focus on things like we can cut out earmarks, and that will change the problem, or we can grow our way out of it. And, instead, we understand the parameters are large, we understand all parts of the budget are going to be involved, and we change the terms of the debate to a more realistic one. And I think that's very helpful. JEFFREY BROWN: All right. Damon Silvers, the president — Richard Trumka, the president of your organization, immediately said, \"The chairmen of the deficit commission just told working Americans to drop dead.\" Pretty harsh.Where is the damage that you see? DAMON SILVERS, AFL-CIO: Well, the damage starts with the fact that this is not a realistic plan. It's not a starting point.The — as Maya said — what Maya didn't say was that, immediately, we have a short-term jobs problem. This — this proposal would make it worse. And it would start by making it worse in what would be perhaps the most unfair possible way, which is by cutting Social Security benefits starting in 2012, not to affluent people, as your reporter said, but to people making more than $37,000 a year.Secondly, it's not courageous. It ducks all the hard questions, and it starts by ducking the hardest, by ducking the most important of all, you would think, for anyone interested in deficit reduction, which is ending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that will cost a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Grover Norquist, and you focused immediately on the taxes-vs.-spending equation.GROVER NORQUIST, president, Americans For Tax Reform: Well, they add a trillion dollars in higher taxes over the next decade, and — which is not a good idea. The economy's already overburdened with spending and taxes.But this whole commission was set up by Obama so that, for a full year, when people said to him, why are you spending so much, why are you bankrupting the country, he could turn and say, well, we have got a commission that's going to do something about that, conveniently, after the election. So, stop asking me about all the spending. JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're thinking — you don't accept it as a serious effort, that… GROVER NORQUIST: It was never intended to be a serious effort. It was always to allow Democrat congressmen and senators, when they were asked, how come you voted to put an extra trillion dollars in taxes and spending on energy policy, another two trillion dollars on health care spending and taxes, they could turn around and say, oh, I'm against deficit spending. I'm for this imaginary commission that's going to report after the election. JEFFREY BROWN: OK, but here we are. I mean, is it a serious problem? Here we are now. So they have put something out there. When you look at it, are there compromises that one can make on the spending and the tax side? GROVER NORQUIST: Well, we're overspending. The problem is not the deficit, which is the difference between overspending and the overtaxing, but, rather, the overspending is the problem.All we have to do is not continue the $100-billion-a-year increase that Obama and the Democrats put into domestic discretionary spending. Just the domestic discretionary, they jumped up a trillion dollars over the next decade.Stop that, you have just taken a trillion dollars dead weight loss off the American economy. And this commission doesn't even do that. JEFFREY BROWN: All right, but you're saying that's not enough, just to deal on the spending side? MAYA MACGUINEAS: Well, no, I'm saying, actually, the commission does much more than that. I mean, they have a lot of savings in both mandatory and discretionary spending.They go after fundamental tax reform, which would raise revenues, but also make the tax code much better, which would be good for the economy. And they basically spread the cost of this plan across the entire budget.The problem has grown so large because we waited so long. We delayed, when we should have gotten ahead of this problem, that, really, all parts of the budget are going to have to be affected. But they can be done so gradually. And it's important to do that. And the commission also recognizes that. As the economy is still recovering, you phase these things in gradually.They wouldn't even start immediately, as they shouldn't. The Social Security changes are phased to — by 2050 and 2075. This is not an aggressive change. So, there are times for people to adjust. And these are changes that have to be done to get the debt to a sustainable level. JEFFREY BROWN: Well, you started, Damon Silvers, talking about the entitlement programs, Social Security in particular.What about on the spending side? Are there cuts here that you can abide by, abide with? DAMON SILVERS: The fundamental concept of this proposal is mistaken and will aggravate, make worse, our jobs crisis, and it will make it impossible… JEFFREY BROWN: You mean because of the timing? DAMON SILVERS: Because of the timing and because — A, because of the timing, and, B, because it places caps, long-term caps, on federal spending in areas that are going to cripple our competitive capacity in the future, particularly around infrastructure.We have a $2 trillion 20th century infrastructure deficit. We are rapidly falling behind our major global competitors in 21st century infrastructure. The way this — the way this proposal would approach federal spending in the future, it would make it impossible, right, to fund that infrastructure gap.There is nothing in this document that tells us how we're going to build our future as a country. And that — that, combined with the attack on the economic security of middle-class Americans through — through the attack on Medicare, the attack on Social Security, those two things combined make this an extraordinarily dangerous and short-sighted approach that has nothing to do with the problems our country faces in the future. JEFFREY BROWN: All right, let me let you have a quick response on that side. MAYA MACGUINEAS: I mean, I just have to say that the scare tactics on all these sides, this is not an attack on Social Security and not an attack on Medicare. It's trying to bring — to manage the growth, so that they don't… DAMON SILVERS: You're going to cut people's income in 15 months. DAMON SILVERS: In 15 months, you're going to cut people's income. Do you deny that that's so? JEFFREY BROWN: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, please. MAYA MACGUINEAS: Sorry. Let me just — so that they don't squeeze out other parts of the budget. And, also, there's a very strong focus throughout the commission's plan on saying, you want to make changes that are conducive to economic growth on both the tax and spending side. That means shifting away from a lot of the less effective parts of the budget, into the parts that are investment-focused.And those are the kinds of things that will grow the economy over time. JEFFREY BROWN: All right, I want to come back.You focused on the spending time. Now come back to taxes. Are there any areas — they have taken a lot of — taken a big look here. Are there any areas where you could see tax increases or changes in loopholes, et cetera, that might help that you could accept towards closing the deficit and the debt? GROVER NORQUIST: Well, they're talking about raising a trillion dollars in taxes. That's not going to happen — 235 members of the House of Representatives incoming have signed a pledge never to raise taxes. JEFFREY BROWN: Right, but is there any part of that — I'm asking you, is there any part of that? GROVER NORQUIST: Sure. They talk about taking the top corporate rate, which is 35 percent, down towards 25 percent. The European average is 25 percent. We have priced ourselves out of the world market. We're surprised we can't compete, because our corporate rate is at 35 percent, and the average in Europe — not the lowest, the average in Europe — is 25 percent.Our top personal rates are getting at 35 percent. The rest of the world has lower rates, particularly the Eastern European countries that have flat-rate income taxes. We need to have lower rates. We don't need the tax increases they're talking about, but lower marginal tax rates would be very helpful. JEFFREY BROWN: Well, but — but you — but they're — they're offering that. I don't — offering may not be the right word, but they're putting that up, those lower rates, against some increases, a 15 cent gas tax we mentioned, or getting rid of some tax loopholes or — or tax breaks, rather. GROVER NORQUIST: If the U.S. economy is going to grow at 2 percent a year for the next decade, and, instead, you had pro-growth policies of lower tax rates that gave you a 3 percent growth rate, just growing at 1 percent more a year, brings the federal government $5 trillion in — I'm sorry — it's $2.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion — $2.5 trillion in, additional, by having 1 percent more growth. I would rather get the money from growth than from higher taxes. JEFFREY BROWN: Is the next point just all or nothing, or is there a kind of debate and compromise here, from your perspective? DAMON SILVERS: Well, first, let me say this. I'm in an extraordinary position of saying that I completely agree with what Grover just said. JEFFREY BROWN: OK. Well, we have made history here. DAMON SILVERS: Right, that growth is critical to solving our medium-term deficit problem. Grover and I certainly… GROVER NORQUIST: And long term. DAMON SILVERS: And long-term. We certainly disagree about how to get there, but I completely agree with you, what he just said about growth. If there's one message that I have today on this matter is that this is not a starting point. This document represents a fundamental wrong direction.And, so, in response to your question, Jeff, where do we go from here, we start someplace that begins with focusing on two things. One is ensuring that we reverse the long-term trend of our tax structure toward favoring the wealthiest Americans, which this document doesn't do. In fact, it exacerbates it.And, secondly, all right, that we focus on an approach to short- and medium-term policy that sets the foundation for growth through rebuilding our nation's infrastructure and our nation's competitiveness. This document doesn't do that. It is not a starting point. We need to start someplace else. JEFFREY BROWN: All right, and I'm going to give you the last word. MAYA MACGUINEAS: So, if I listen to what both of the other guests are saying, they're sort of — you know, you're saying here's a way to spend more money, and here's a way to cut more taxes.And the bottom line is, it's a lot more fun to add to the deficit than it is to actually close it. But we have been doing that for years. And one of the things that's going to stand in the way of growth is stranglehold from government debt.And so what we have to do is get on top of that by a sensible, balanced plan that keeps growth issues in mind on both the tax and spending side. But we can't keep running these budget deficits indefinitely, or that is going to strangle off the growth. And so I think we have to talk about compromise. That's where I hope the discussion turns. JEFFREY BROWN: All right. We will see what the commission comes out. It's December 1.Maya MacGuineas, Damon Silvers, and Grover Norquist, thank you all very much. MAYA MACGUINEAS: Thank you.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It was opened as a second location to build 787 Dreamliner jets after a series of union strikes in Washington state plants. Margaret Warner discusses the matter with The New York Times' Steven Greenhouse. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. JIM LEHRER: Next, back in this country, a fight among government, labor and business over the location of a manufacturing plant.Margaret Warner has our story. MARGARET WARNER: The fight is over a case brought by the government's National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, an independent agency where Democrats currently hold the majority — at issue, a just-opened $750 million Boeing factory in South Carolina, where the company plans to build some of its 787 Dreamliner passenger jets.The new lightweight planes are already being built at Boeing's main factory complex in the Seattle area. But after a series of union strikes in Washington State, the company decided to open its second 787 assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina, a right-to-work state.In April, the NLRB charged Boeing with illegally retaliating against unionized workers. Hearings in the case began before an administrative law judge in Seattle this week. Separately, a Republican-led House committee held a hearing on all this in North Charleston today.And, for more, we turn to Steven Greenhouse with The New York Times.Steven, thank you for joining us.Flesh out this complaint for us. What is the agency charging is illegal about Boeing putting this plant in South Carolina? STEVEN GREENHOUSE, The New York Times: Nice to be here, Margaret.So, the National Labor Relations Board is asserting that Boeing, in deciding to open this plant in South Carolina, is illegally retaliating against workers in Seattle because they had exercised what the Labor Board says was their legal, their federally protected right to strike.And the union up in Seattle has gone on strike five times since 1977, including a 58-day strike in 2008, which Boeing says cost the company $1.8 billion in losses. So, when Boeing announced two years ago that it wanted to open up a new factory in South Carolina, some Boeing executives said, we're tired of all these disruptions. That's a major reason we're leaving.And the Labor Board said you can't punish the workers in that way. That's illegal. You're retaliating against them for exercising their right to strike.Boeing says that's not quite right. Boeing insists that the main reason it's moving is for the lower labor costs in South Carolina. So there's a real difference about the reason why Boeing is moving the plant. MARGARET WARNER: Now, companies, U.S. companies, have been moving plants south to right-to-work states for decades. Has a case like this ever been filed before? STEVEN GREENHOUSE: Not quite like this, Margaret.There have been other cases where, in the middle of a union contract, the company will say, we're going to close shop and move, and the NLRB will bring a lawsuit and say, you can't do that. That's retaliation. You're violating the contract.So, the NLRB has moved against companies moving — that have moved plants to the South. I think the problem here is Boeing — according to the NLRB, that Boeing was caught red-handed saying, we're doing this to punish you for striking and to prevent you from striking again.And they say that's illegal kind of suppression of workers' rights. And folks in South Carolina are outraged by that. They say — and Boeing is outraged. They say Boeing should have the right, like any company, to decide where it wants to locate a plant, and federal bureaucrats shouldn't get in the way. MARGARET WARNER: Now, what is the union's role in all this? I noticed at the hearing this week in Seattle the judge was urging Boeing and the union to settle. STEVEN GREENHOUSE: Right.So the machinists brought the case to the National Labor Relations Board, saying that all workers are being illegally retaliated against. They filed a complaint with the federal agency. And then that agency, the Labor Board, decided to move forward with a case saying that Boeing had acted illegally.So, now the judge in — the administrative law judge in Seattle, who worries that this case is going to go on for weeks, even years, says look, guys, you have got to really try to settle. And it — and he's trying to forge a deal between the machinists union on one hand and Boeing on the other, and maybe Boeing would commit to build additional planes, maybe decide to locate a whole new line of aircraft manufacturing in Washington State, which would create and guarantee many, many jobs for unionized workers in Washington State. MARGARET WARNER: Finally, briefly, what's the political dimension here? Big one. STEVEN GREENHOUSE: This is — Margaret, this has blown up into a political firestorm.There's the little thing, the presidential — the Republican presidential primary coming up, and — that will be in South Carolina. And the Republican candidates are climbing over each other to condemn the Obama administration and the National Labor Relations Board for improperly discriminating against right-to-work states and Southern states.And also, I think, in South Carolina, there's a feeling that the federal bureaucrats, the socialists, the regulators, the pro-union forces are unfairly discriminating against, taking advantage of, trying to take jobs away from South Carolina. And South Carolina says we just want to find jobs for our workers. Our unemployment rate is above the national average. This is a great thing — having Boeing come is a great thing for South Carolina. It's the biggest single investment in the history of the South Carolina.And they're just very, very upset. MARGARET WARNER: So, more to come.Steven Greenhouse with The New York Times, thank you. STEVEN GREENHOUSE: Thanks very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The government's labor dispute with Boeing Co. is turning into a political headache for President Barack Obama, giving his Republican rivals a fresh opening to bash the administration's economic policies.\nFrom congressional hearings to presidential debates, outraged Republicans are keeping up a steady drumbeat of criticism over the National Labor Relations Board's lawsuit against the aerospace giant.\nObama defended his administration's business policies at a White House news conference Wednesday, saying he wouldn't interfere in the case brought by the NRLB, an independent federal agency. But he said it would defy common sense for Boeing to have to close a new U.S. aircraft plant or lay off workers as a result of the legal action.\n\"What I think defies common sense would be a notion that we would be shutting down a plant or laying off workers because labor and management can't come to a sensible agreement,\" Obama said.\nThe NLRB alleges that Boeing retaliated against its unionized work force in Washington state by opening a new production line for its 787 airplane in South Carolina, a right-to-work state. The agency wants a judge to order Boeing to return all 787 assembly work to Washington, even though the company has already built a new $750 million South Carolina plant and hired 1,000 new workers there.\nThe case — which could drag on for years — has become an unwanted distraction for Obama as he tries to mend relations with the business community and contend with polls that show growing public disapproval over his handling of the economy.\nIt makes an easy target for Republicans, who call it a case of government overreaching at a time when the private sector is struggling to create new jobs. And it's a major story in South Carolina — a bellwether early primary state in the GOP presidential race. Candidates are lining up to impress voters and the state's Republican governor, tea party favorite Nikki Haley.\n\"Obama's NLRB has united the Republican Party and turned this government agency into a political piñata,\" said GOP consultant Scott Reed. \"Boeing spent a billion dollars building a plant to create thousands of jobs and it looks like the NLRB stuck their nose in and tried to pull the rug out.\"\nBusiness groups and their GOP allies say the government is interfering with the right of company managers to choose where and how to expand business operations. Boeing claims it opened the plant for a variety of economic reasons, but NLRB officials say Boeing executives made public comments showing the move was meant to punish union workers for a series of costly strikes.\nFor Haley, the case has been a litmus test for every GOP presidential candidate visiting the state. And they have not disappointed her.\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, visiting New Hampshire on Monday, said Obama had appointed \"union stooges into the NLRB and then they come up with decisions that are really quite extraordinary,\" like the Boeing lawsuit that he and others have said will drive companies to seek workers overseas.\nGOP presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich called for defunding the agency during a recent New Hampshire debate, saying the case could threaten the viability of the nation's 22 right-to-work states, where labor unions can't force employees to be members.\nAnd during a tour of South Carolina last week, GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman called on Obama to step in and end the lawsuit to prevent it from scaring other businesses away from the state.\nHaley says the only way to make things right \"is for the president to tell the NLRB to back off. And until that happens, it is my job to be loud and annoying and in his face until he realizes that what they have done is wrong.\"\nEven South Carolina's Democrats have piled on, focusing on the complaint's effect on business less than the politics of the board.\n\"Clearly it's an independent agency and is taking an action that I know was not directed by the president,\" said Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., a Democrat. \"But in this case, I think it was a very, very bad decision and a huge mistake that is not good policy for the country.\"\nObama, ordinarily a reliable supporter of organized labor, has carefully avoided taking a position on the case. At his Wednesday news conference, he said companies need to have the freedom to relocate work in other states, though they must follow the law when doing so.\n\"My hope is that even as this thing is working its way through, everybody steps back for a second and says, 'Look, if jobs are being created here in the United States, let's make sure that we're encouraging that,' \" Obama said.\nObama said he wants to make sure the nation keeps its global advantage in airplane manufacturing.\nBut the issue became more awkward for Obama when John Bryson, his pick to head the Commerce Department and a former Boeing board member, openly criticized the lawsuit during a Senate confirmation hearing last week.\n\"I think it's not the right judgment,\" Bryson said. He said Boeing officials thought they were \"doing the right thing for the country\" by keeping jobs in the U.S. and not moving them overseas.\nSome Democrats and union officials have stepped up their defense of the NLRB, saying Republicans are misrepresenting the case against Boeing. Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, accused Republicans of peddling \"misinformation,\" distorting the public perception of the case and unfairly attacking the agency.\nLabor experts say if the allegations in the complaint are true, it would constitute a standard violation of federal labor laws, which prohibit a company from moving work to punish union workers for past strikes. The complaint lays out several public statements by Boeing executives saying they wanted to relocate new lines for the Dreamliner because of strike activity, including a 58-day work stoppage in 2008.\nBut such violations can be difficult to prove, especially if the company can show it had other valid motives for opening the new lines in South Carolina. The government has to show the company relocated work for the purpose of stopping workers from exercising their legal rights to strike, said Catherine Fisk, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine who specializes in labor issues.\nPerhaps the best scenario for Obama would be for the case to be settled, an outcome that many labor experts expect.\n\"The unions don't want an adverse decision, management doesn't want an adverse decision and the best way to avoid that is to reach a settlement on their own,\" said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The National Labor Relations Board announced on Friday, December 9, 2011 that it was dropping its politically charged case against Boeing. The NLRB had accused Boeing of violating federal labor law by opening a new aircraft production plant in South Carolina instead of Washington State. See our blog article dated May 5, 2011.\nThe NLRB filed a complaint against Boeing in April 2011, seeking to force Boeing to move the 787 Dreamliner passenger plane production from a non-union plant in South Carolina to the union assembly line in Washington State. The NLRB contended that Boeing had retaliated against its workers for exercising their federally protected right to strike because Boeing management had announced that it was moving the plant to South Carolina to “punish” the Boeing workers for having power the strike in the future (Lafe Soloman General Counsel for NLRB April 22, 2011, see our blog article dated May 5, 2011).\nRepublican lawmakers and presidential candidates announced that the lawsuit was a prime example of regulatory overreaching by the Obama Administration, and argued that the federal officials should not be telling companies where they can or cannot build factories. Congress held hearings and demanded thousands of pages of documents. Boeing invested over a billion dollars in the South Carolina plant before the lawsuit was filed. On Wednesday, December 7, the International Association of Machinists approved a new contract with Boeing in which Boeing agreed to build its 737 Max Jet in the state of Washington with union labor. Within a few days, the NLRB dropped its lawsuit against Boeing.\nThe question now becomes whether the NLRB’s motivation to bring the lawsuit in the first place was simply born out of some political loyalty to side with the union over management in the collective bargaining situation? Boeing was very clear that the new contract to build the 737 Max Jet in Washington was not tied directly to a settlement of the NLRB complaint, and that it had always intended to build the 737 Max Jet in Renton because of the workforce and that the experience gained from manufacturing the present 737 offers certain efficiencies. It is nevertheless difficult to resist the conclusion that Boeing felt obliged to make the agreement to save its more than one billion dollar investment in South Carolina where it is presently building the 787s. As for the NLRB, its decision to drop the case as quickly as it did after the machinists made their deal exposes how politically motivated the Boeing suit may have been. The NLRB is supposed to be an even-handed and fair-minded referee in labor disputes, making sure that neither side breaks the federal law. In this instance, the NLRB seems to have come down squarely on the side of the union and against the employer’s move to assemble the 787 in a right to work state. The message appears to be that if an employer seeks to move its plant and operations to escape onerous collective bargaining agreements, that its investment will be at risk.\nAlthough maintaining manufacturing in the state of Washington is vitally important to this state’s economy, this case raises questions as to the NLRB’s independence, and raises concerns that companies may be motivated to send even more jobs overseas where there is no NLRB to be concerned about.\nReferences: New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

Orrin Hatch (R-UT). \"The difference between regulating and requiring is liberty.\"\nBut Hatch's opposition is ironic, or some would say, politically motivated. The last time Congress debated a health overhaul, when Bill Clinton was president, Hatch and several other senators who now oppose the so-called individual mandate actually supported a bill that would have required it.\nIn fact, says Len Nichols of the New America Foundation, the individual mandate was originally a Republican idea. \"It was invented by Mark Pauly to give to George Bush Sr. back in the day, as a competition to the employer mandate focus of the Democrats at the time.\"\nThe 'Free-Rider Effect'\nPauly, a conservative health economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, says it wasn't just his idea. Back in the late 1980s — when Democrats were pushing not just a requirement for employers to provide insurance, but also the possibility of a government-sponsored single-payer system — \"a group of economists and health policy people, market-oriented, sat down and said, 'Let's see if we can come up with a health reform proposal that would preserve a role for markets but would also achieve universal coverage.' \"\nThe idea of the individual mandate was about the only logical way to get there, Pauly says. That's because even with the most generous subsidies or enticements, \"there would always be some Evel Knievels of health insurance, who would decline coverage even if the subsidies were very generous, and even if they could afford it, quote unquote, so if you really wanted to close the gap, that's the step you'd have to take.\"\nOne reason the individual mandate appealed to conservatives is because it called for individual responsibility to address what economists call the \"free-rider effect.\" That's the fact that if a person is in an accident or comes down with a dread disease, that person is going to get medical care, and someone is going to pay for it.\n\"We called this responsible national health insurance,\" says Pauly. \"There was a kind of an ethical and moral support for the notion that people shouldn't be allowed to free-ride on the charity of fellow citizens.\"\nRepublican, Democratic Bills Strikingly Similar\nSo while President Clinton was pushing for employers to cover their workers in his 1993 bill, John Chafee of Rhode Island, along with 20 other GOP senators and Rep. Bill Thomas of California, introduced legislation that instead featured an individual mandate. Four of those Republican co-sponsors — Hatch, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Robert Bennett of Utah and Christopher Bond of Missouri — remain in the Senate today.\nThe GOP's 1993 measure included some features Republicans still want Democrats to consider, including damage award caps for medical malpractice lawsuits.\nBut the summary of the Republican bill from the Clinton era and the Democratic bills that passed the House and Senate over the past few months are startlingly alike.\nBeyond the requirement that everyone have insurance, both call for purchasing pools and standardized insurance plans. Both call for a ban on insurers denying coverage or raising premiums because a person has been sick in the past. Both even call for increased federal research into the effectiveness of medical treatments — something else that used to have strong bipartisan support, but that Republicans have been backing away from recently.\n'A Sad Testament'\nNichols, of the New America Foundation, says he's depressed that so many issues that used to be part of the Republican health agenda are now being rejected by Republican leaders and most of the rank and file. \"I think it's a sad testament to the state of relations among the parties that they've gotten to this point,\" he said.\nAnd how does economist Pauly feel about the GOP's retreat from the individual mandate they used to promote? \"That's not something that makes me particularly happy,\" he says.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In November, 1993, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced what was considered to be one of the main Republican health overhaul proposals: “A bill to provide comprehensive reform of the health care system of the United States.”\nTitled the “Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act of 1993,” it had 21 co-sponsors, including two Democrats (Sens. Boren and Kerrey). The bill, which was not debated or voted upon, was an alternative to President Bill Clinton’s plan. It bears similarity to the Democratic bill passed by the Senate Dec. 24, 2009, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nRelated Content\nHere is a summary of the 1993 bill:\nTitle I: Basic Reforms to Expand Access to Health Insurance Coverage and to Ensure Universal Coverage – Subtitle A: Universal Access – Provides access to health insurance coverage under a qualified health plan for every citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States.\n(Sec. 1003) Establishes a program under which persons with low incomes (and who are not eligible for Medicaid) will receive vouchers to buy insurance through purchasing groups.\n(Sec. 1004) Requires each employer to make available, either directly, through a purchasing group, or otherwise, enrollment in a qualified health plan to each eligible employee.\nSubtitle B: Qualified General Access Plan in the Small Employer and Individual Marketplace- Requires the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop specific standards to implement requirements concerning: (1) guaranteed eligibility, availability, and renewability of health insurance coverage; (2) nondiscrimination based on health status; (3) benefits offered; (4) insurer financial solvency; (5) enrollment process; (6) premium rating limitations; (7) risk adjustment; and (8) consumer protection.\n(Sec. 1119) Requires each qualified general access plan to: (1) establish and maintain a quality assurance program and a mediation procedures program; and (2) contain assurances of service to designated underserved areas.\n(Sec. 1141) Provides for the formation of purchasing groups by individuals and small employers.\n(Sec. 1161) Requires brokers or insurers to provide specified information to prospective enrollees.\n(Sec. 1162) Prohibits insurers from creating improper financial incentives and from selling duplicate coverage.\nSubtitle C: Qualified Health Plans in the Large Employer Marketplace – Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to establish standards for large employer plans similar to requirements applicable to small employer plans.\n(Sec. 1203) Requires large employers to offer to employees at least a standard package and a catastrophic package.\n(Sec. 1205) Allows two or more large employers to form purchasing groups, but not through an individual or small employer purchasing group.\n(Sec. 1206) Requires a semi-annual review of each large employer plan to determine whether requirements are being met and what corrective actions need to be taken.\n(Sec. 1221) Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to revise provisions to conform to this Act.\nSubtitle D: Benefits; Benefits Commission – Requires each qualified health plan to provide a standard package and a catastrophic package.

It was hard to find a law professor in the country who took them seriously. “The argument about constitutionality is, if not frivolous, close to it,” Sanford Levinson, a University of Texas law-school professor, told the McClatchy newspapers. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California at Irvine, told the Times, “There is no case law, post 1937, that would support an individual’s right not to buy health care if the government wants to mandate it.” Orin Kerr, a George Washington University professor who had clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, said, “There is a less than one-per-cent chance that the courts will invalidate the individual mandate.” Today, as the Supreme Court prepares to hand down its decision on the law, Kerr puts the chance that it will overturn the mandate—almost certainly on a party-line vote—at closer to “fifty-fifty.” The Republicans have made the individual mandate the element most likely to undo the President’s health-care law. The irony is that the Democrats adopted it in the first place because they thought that it would help them secure conservative support. It had, after all, been at the heart of Republican health-care reforms for two decades.\nThe mandate made its political début in a 1989 Heritage Foundation brief titled “Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans,” as a counterpoint to the single-payer system and the employer mandate, which were favored in Democratic circles. In the brief, Stuart Butler, the foundation’s health-care expert, argued, “Many states now require passengers in automobiles to wear seat-belts for their own protection. Many others require anybody driving a car to have liability insurance. But neither the federal government nor any state requires all households to protect themselves from the potentially catastrophic costs of a serious accident or illness. Under the Heritage plan, there would be such a requirement.” The mandate made its first legislative appearance in 1993, in the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act—the Republicans’ alternative to President Clinton’s health-reform bill—which was sponsored by John Chafee, of Rhode Island, and co-sponsored by eighteen Republicans, including Bob Dole, who was then the Senate Minority Leader.\nAfter the Clinton bill, which called for an employer mandate, failed, Democrats came to recognize the opportunity that the Chafee bill had presented. In “The System,” David Broder and Haynes Johnson’s history of the health-care wars of the nineties, Bill Clinton concedes that it was the best chance he had of reaching a bipartisan compromise. “It should have been right then, or the day after they presented their bill, where I should have tried to have a direct understanding with Dole,” he said.\nTen years later, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, began picking his way back through the history—he read “The System” four times—and he, too, came to focus on the Chafee bill. He began building a proposal around the individual mandate, and tested it out on both Democrats and Republicans. “Between 2004 and 2008, I saw over eighty members of the Senate, and there were very few who objected,” Wyden says. In December, 2006, he unveiled the Healthy Americans Act. In May, 2007, Bob Bennett, a Utah Republican, who had been a sponsor of the Chafee bill, joined him. Wyden-Bennett was eventually co-sponsored by eleven Republicans and nine Democrats, receiving more bipartisan support than any universal health-care proposal in the history of the Senate. It even caught the eye of the Republican Presidential aspirants. In a June, 2009, interview on “Meet the Press,” Mitt Romney, who, as governor of Massachusetts, had signed a universal health-care bill with an individual mandate, said that Wyden-Bennett was a plan “that a number of Republicans think is a very good health-care plan—one that we support.”\nWyden’s bill was part of a broader trend of Democrats endorsing the individual mandate in their own proposals. John Edwards and Hillary Clinton both built a mandate into their campaign health-care proposals. In 2008, Senator Ted Kennedy brought John McDonough, a liberal advocate of the Massachusetts plan, to Washington to help with health-care reform. That same year, Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, included an individual mandate in the first draft of his health-care bill. The main Democratic holdout was Senator Barack Obama. But by July, 2009, President Obama had changed his mind. “I was opposed to this idea because my general attitude was the reason people don’t have health insurance is not because they don’t want it. It’s because they can’t afford it,” he told CBS News. “I am now in favor of some sort of individual mandate.”\nThis process led, eventually, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—better known as Obamacare—which also included an individual mandate. But, as that bill came closer to passing, Republicans began coalescing around the mandate, which polling showed to be one of the legislation’s least popular elements. In December, 2009, in a vote on the bill, every Senate Republican voted to call the individual mandate “unconstitutional.”\nThis shift—Democrats lining up behind the Republican-crafted mandate, and Republicans declaring it not just inappropriate policy but contrary to the wishes of the Founders—shocked Wyden. “I would characterize the Washington, D.C., relationship with the individual mandate as truly schizophrenic,” he said.\nIt was not an isolated case. In 2007, both Newt Gingrich and John McCain wanted a cap-and-trade program in order to reduce carbon emissions. Today, neither they nor any other leading Republicans support cap-and-trade. In 2008, the Bush Administration proposed, pushed, and signed the Economic Stimulus Act, a deficit-financed tax cut designed to boost the flagging economy. Today, few Republicans admit that a deficit-financed stimulus can work. Indeed, with the exception of raising taxes on the rich, virtually every major policy currently associated with the Obama Administration was, within the past decade, a Republican idea in good standing.\nJonathan Haidt, a professor of psychology at New York University’s business school, argues in a new book, “The Righteous Mind,” that to understand human beings, and their politics, you need to understand that we are descended from ancestors who would not have survived if they hadn’t been very good at belonging to groups. He writes that “our minds contain a variety of mental mechanisms that make us adept at promoting our group’s interests, in competition with other groups. We are not saints, but we are sometimes good team players.”\nOne of those mechanisms is figuring out how to believe what the group believes. Haidt sees the role that reason plays as akin to the job of the White House press secretary. He writes, “No matter how bad the policy, the secretary will find some way to praise or defend it. Sometimes you’ll hear an awkward pause as the secretary searches for the right words, but what you’ll never hear is: ‘Hey, that’s a great point! Maybe we should rethink this policy.’ Press secretaries can’t say that because they have no power to make or revise policy. They’re told what the policy is, and their job is to find evidence and arguments that will justify the policy to the public.” For that reason, Haidt told me, “once group loyalties are engaged, you can’t change people’s minds by utterly refuting their arguments. Thinking is mostly just rationalization, mostly just a search for supporting evidence.”\nPsychologists have a term for this: “motivated reasoning,” which Dan Kahan, a professor of law and psychology at Yale, defines as “when a person is conforming their assessments of information to some interest or goal that is independent of accuracy”—an interest or goal such as remaining a well-regarded member of his political party, or winning the next election, or even just winning an argument. Geoffrey Cohen, a professor of psychology at Stanford, has shown how motivated reasoning can drive even the opinions of engaged partisans. In 2003, when he was an assistant professor at Yale, Cohen asked a group of undergraduates, who had previously described their political views as either very liberal or very conservative, to participate in a test to study, they were told, their “memory of everyday current events.”\nThe students were shown two articles: one was a generic news story; the other described a proposed welfare policy. The first article was a decoy; it was the students’ reactions to the second that interested Cohen. He was actually testing whether party identifications influence voters when they evaluate new policies. To find out, he produced multiple versions of the welfare article. Some students read about a program that was extremely generous—more generous, in fact, than any welfare policy that has ever existed in the United States—while others were presented with a very stingy proposal. But there was a twist: some versions of the article about the generous proposal portrayed it as being endorsed by Republican Party leaders; and some versions of the article about the meagre program described it as having Democratic support. The results showed that, “for both liberal and conservative participants, the effect of reference group information overrode that of policy content. If their party endorsed it, liberals supported even a harsh welfare program, and conservatives supported even a lavish one.”\nIn a subsequent study involving just self-described liberal students, Cohen gave half the group news stories that had accompanying Democratic endorsements and the other half news stories that did not. The students who didn’t get the endorsements preferred a more generous program. When they did get the endorsements, they went with their party, even if this meant embracing a meaner option.\nThis kind of thinking is, according to psychologists, unsurprising. Each of us can have firsthand knowledge of just a small number of topics—our jobs, our studies, our personal experiences. But as citizens—and as elected officials—we are routinely asked to make judgments on issues as diverse and as complex as the Iranian nuclear program, the environmental impact of an international oil pipeline, and the likely outcomes of branding China a “currency manipulator.”\nAccording to the political-science literature, one of the key roles that political parties play is helping us navigate these decisions. In theory, we join parties because they share our values and our goals—values and goals that may have been passed on to us by the most important groups in our lives, such as our families and our communities—and so we trust that their policy judgments will match the ones we would come up with if we had unlimited time to study the issues. But parties, though based on a set of principles, aren’t disinterested teachers in search of truth. They’re organized groups looking to increase their power. Or, as the psychologists would put it, their reasoning may be motivated by something other than accuracy. And you can see the results among voters who pay the closest attention to the issues.\nIn a 2006 paper, “It Feels Like We’re Thinking,” the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels looked at a National Election Study, a poll supported by the National Science Foundation, from 1996. One of the questions asked whether “the size of the yearly budget deficit increased, decreased, or stayed about the same during Clinton’s time as President.” The correct answer is that it decreased, dramatically. Achen and Bartels categorize the respondents according to how politically informed they were. Among the least-informed respondents, Democrats and Republicans picked the wrong answer in roughly equal numbers. But among better-informed voters the story was different. Republicans who were in the fiftieth percentile gave the right answer more often than those in the ninety-fifth percentile. Bartels found a similar effect in a previous survey, in which well-informed Democrats were asked whether inflation had gone down during Ronald Reagan’s Presidency. It had, but many of those Democrats said that it hadn’t. The more information people had, it seemed, the better they were at arranging it to fit what they wanted to believe. As Bartels told me, “If I’m a Republican and an enthusiastic supporter of lower tax rates, it is uncomfortable to recognize that President Obama has reduced most Americans’ taxes—and I can find plenty of conservative information sources that deny or ignore the fact that he has.”\nRecently, Bartels noticed a similar polarization in attitudes toward the health-care law and the Supreme Court. Using YouGov polling data, he found that less-informed voters who supported the law and less-informed voters who opposed it were equally likely to say that “the Supreme Court should be able to throw out any law it finds unconstitutional.” But, among better-informed voters, those who opposed the law were thirty per cent more likely than those who supported it to cede that power to the Court. In other words, well-informed opponents realized that they needed an activist Supreme Court that was willing to aggressively overturn laws if they were to have any hope of invalidating the Affordable Care Act.\nOrin Kerr says that, in the two years since he gave the individual mandate only a one-per-cent chance of being overturned, three key things have happened. First, congressional Republicans made the argument against the mandate a Republican position. Then it became a standard conservative-media position. “That legitimized the argument in a way we haven’t really seen before,” Kerr said. “We haven’t seen the media pick up a legal argument and make the argument mainstream by virtue of media coverage.” Finally, he says, “there were two conservative district judges who agreed with the argument, largely echoing the Republican position and the media coverage. And, once you had all that, it really became a ballgame.”\nJack Balkin, a Yale law professor, agrees. “Once Republican politicians say this is unconstitutional, it gets repeated endlessly in the partisan media that’s friendly to the Republican Party”—Fox News, conservative talk radio, and the like—“and, because this is now the Republican Party’s position, the mainstream media needs to repeatedly explain the claims to their readers. That further moves the arguments from off the wall to on the wall, because, if you’re reading articles in the Times describing the case against the mandate, you assume this is a live controversy.” Of course, Balkin says, “if the courts didn’t buy this, it wouldn’t get anywhere.”\nBut the courts are not as distant from the political process as some like to think. The first judge to rule against the individual mandate was Judge Henry Hudson, of Virginia’s Eastern District Court. Hudson was heavily invested in a Republican consulting firm called Campaign Solutions, Inc. The company had worked with the Presidential campaigns of John McCain and George W. Bush, the Republican National Committee, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and Ken Cuccinelli—the Virginia state attorney general who is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act.\nThe fact that a judge—even a partisan judge in a district court—had ruled that a central piece of a Democratic President’s signature legislative accomplishment was unconstitutional led the news across the country. Hudson’s ruling was followed by a similar, and even more sweeping, ruling, by Judge Roger Vinson, of the Northern District of Florida. Vinson declared the entire bill unconstitutional, setting off a new round of stories. The twin rulings gave conservatives who wanted to believe that the mandate was unconstitutional more reason to hold that belief. Voters who hadn’t thought much about it now heard that judges were ruling against the Administration. Vinson and Hudson were outnumbered by other district judges who either upheld the law or threw out lawsuits against it, but those rulings were mostly ignored.\nAt the Washington Monthly, Steve Benen kept track of the placement that the Times and the Washington Post (where I work) gave to stories about court rulings on the health-care law. When judges ruled against the law, they got long front-page stories. When they ruled for it, they got shorter stories, inside the paper. Indeed, none of the cases upholding the law got front-page coverage, but every rejection of it did, and usually in both papers. From an editorial perspective, that made sense: the Vinson and Hudson rulings called into question the law’s future; the other rulings signalled no change. But the effect was repeated news stories in which the Affordable Care Act was declared unconstitutional, and few news stories representing the legal profession’s consensus that it was not. The result can be seen in a March poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that fifty-one per cent of Americans think that the mandate is unconstitutional.\nWhat is notable about the conservative response to the individual mandate is not only the speed with which a legal argument that was considered fringe in 2010 had become mainstream by 2012; it’s the implication that the Republicans spent two decades pushing legislation that was in clear violation of the nation’s founding document. Political parties do go through occasional, painful cleansings, in which they emerge with different leaders who hold different positions. This was true of Democrats in the nineteen-nineties, when Bill Clinton passed free trade, deficit reduction, and welfare reform, despite the furious objections of liberals. But in this case the mandate’s supporters simply became its opponents.\nIn February, 2012, Stuart Butler, the author of the Heritage Foundation brief that first proposed the mandate, wrote an op-ed for USA Today in which he recanted that support. “I’ve altered my views on many things,” he wrote. “The individual mandate in health care is one of them.” Senator Orrin Hatch, who had been a co-sponsor of the Chafee bill, emerged as one of the mandate’s most implacable opponents in 2010, writing in The Hill that to come to “any other conclusion” than that the mandate is unconstitutional “requires treating the Constitution as the servant, rather than the master, of Congress.” Mitt Romney, who had both passed an individual mandate as governor and supported Wyden-Bennett, now calls Obama’s law an “unconstitutional power grab from the states,” and has promised, if elected, to begin repealing the law “on Day One.”\nEven Bob Bennett, who was among the most eloquent advocates of the mandate, voted, in 2009, to call it unconstitutional. “I’d group us”—Senate Republicans—“into three categories,” he says. “There were people like me, who bought onto the mandate because it made sense and would work, and we were reluctant to let go of it. Then, there were people who bought onto it slowly, for political advantage, and were immediately willing to abandon it as soon as the political advantage went the other way. And then there’s a third group that thought it made sense and then thought it through and changed their minds.” Explaining his decision to vote against the law, Bennett, who was facing a Tea Party challenger in a primary, says, “I didn’t focus on the particulars of the amendment as closely as I should have, and probably would have voted the other way if I had understood that the individual mandate was at its core. I just wanted to express my opposition to the Obama proposal at every opportunity.” He was defeated in the primary, anyway.\nBut, whatever the motives of individual politicians, the end result was the same: a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition—opposition that was echoed, refined, and popularized by other institutions affiliated with the Party. This is what Jason Grumet, the president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a group that tried to encourage Republicans and Democrats to unite around policy solutions, calls the “think-tank industrial complex”—the network of ideologically oriented research centers that drive much of the policy debate in Washington. As Senator Olympia Snowe, of Maine, who has announced that she is leaving the Senate because of the noxious political climate, says, “You can find a think tank to buttress any view or position, and then you can give it the aura of legitimacy and credibility by referring to their report.” And, as we’re increasingly able to choose our information sources based on their tendency to back up whatever we already believe, we don’t even have to hear the arguments from the other side, much less give them serious consideration. Partisans who may not have strong opinions on the underlying issues thus get a clear signal on what their party wants them to think, along with reams of information on why they should think it.\nAll this suggests that the old model of compromise is going to have a very difficult time in today’s polarized political climate. Because it’s typically not in the minority party’s interest to compromise with the majority party on big bills—elections are a zero-sum game, where the majority wins if the public thinks it has been doing a good job—Washington’s motivated-reasoning machine is likely to kick into gear on most major issues. “Reasoning can take you wherever you want to go,” Haidt warns. “Can you see your way to an individual mandate, if it’s a way to fight single payer? Sure. And so, when it was strategically valuable Republicans could believe it was constitutional and good. Then Obama proposes the idea. And then the question becomes not ‘Can you believe in this?’ but ‘Must you believe it?’ ”\nAnd that means that you can’t assume that policy-based compromises that made sense at the beginning will survive to the end, because by that time whichever group has an interest in not compromising will likely have convinced itself that the compromise position is an awful idea—even if, just a few years ago, that group thought it was a great one. “The basic way you wanted to put together a big deal five years ago is that the thoughtful minds in one party would basically go off and write a bill that had seventy per cent of their orthodoxy and thirty per cent of the other side’s orthodoxy and try to use that to peel off five or six senators from the other side,” Grumet says. “That process just doesn’t work anymore.” The remarkable and confusing trajectory of the individual-mandate debate, in other words, could simply be the new norm.\nI asked Ron Wyden how, if politicians can so easily be argued out of their policy preferences, compromise was possible. “I don’t find it easy to answer that question, because I’m an elected official and not a psychiatrist,” he said. “If somebody says they sincerely changed their minds, then so be it.” But Wyden is, as always, optimistic about the next bipartisan deal, and, again, he thinks he knows just where to start. “To bring about bipartisanship, it’s going to be necessary to win on something people can see and understand. That’s why I think tax reform is a huge opportunity for the economy and the cause of building coalitions.” Perhaps he’s right. Or perhaps that’s just what he wants to believe. ♦\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of student-athletes choosing to reclassify has skyrocketed.\nMore and more students are deciding to reclass to continue developing academically and athletically before enrolling in college, but it’s important to pay attention to a few key things to ensure you are maintaining your NCAA eligibility. Don’t be one of the many reclassified students, who find out too late that they are short the required credits and can’t play NCAA DI sports.\nReclassification refers to the process of a student graduating on a date that differs from the typical four-year high school timeline. While some students might reclass to graduate earlier than their classmates, student-athletes most often choose to repeat a year in high school in order to gain an athletic or academic advantage.\nBefore deciding to reclassify, students and parents should have a clear plan and be aware of what is necessary to ensure full-qualifier status upon graduation.\nWhy? Because NCAA Division 1 (DI) follows a strict timeline for courses and credits. The academic eligibility clock for DI schools starts your first year of high school and counts 4 years from there. This means the NCAA DI is only going to evaluate your high school courses taken during your first four years of high school. Here are a couple of scenarios to keep in mind:\nNo matter the scenario, all student-athletes looking to play in college must meet the NCAA’s 16 Core Course requirements. An NCAA DI college may choose to apply for a waiver with the NCAA if they can argue extenuating circumstances. However, you should never assume you will get a college to file a waiver for you. Waivers are used very rarely.\nStudent-athletes may choose to reclassify for many reasons, but paying attention to a few key things is vital to maintaining their NCAA eligibility.\nIf you repeat a grade, and you have earned grades of D or higher, don’t repeat those same courses (unless you are ahead in your credit count). Take different courses so you can continue earning NCAA credits toward your requirements. NCAA will not grant credit for the same course taken twice. By junior or, more commonly, senior year, when the NCAA reviews your profile, it’s often too late to make up the credits. Don’t be one of the many reclassified students, who find out too late that they are short the required credits and can’t play NCAA DI sports.\nThe NCAA requires students to enroll in college within one year of graduating from high school, with some sports having even shorter timelines. If students wait longer than a year, they must sit out their first year of college. Additionally, the NCAA counts one season of competition for every year of participation, meaning early high school graduation doesn’t grant extra time before college enrollment.\nUnderstanding these rules is crucial, yet unfortunately, many students and families aren’t aware until it’s too late. Each year a student competes after their gap year, they lose a year of eligibility. NCAA full qualifier status includes playing eligibility, so even if academically eligible, failure to enroll in college within the appropriate timeframe may limit playing opportunities to three years.\nFor some students, taking an NCAA course after graduation can boost their NCAA Core GPA. Additionally, retaking the SAT/ACT is an option. While standardized test scores aren’t required for NCAA eligibility, achieving high scores on tests like the SAT or ACT can bolster a student-athlete’s college application.\nThe important thing to know is that you must have officially graduated from high school on time if you’re going to need additional course work to gain NCAA eligibility. If you meet your NCAA eligibility requirements after your first four years of high school, but don’t graduate on time, it is imperative that you make sure you meet your NCAA core course requirements during the first 4 years while also taking into account delayed enrollment rules at your high school, and/or state athletic association.\nFor those student-athletes who did not graduate high school in 4 years after entering 9th grade and are not on track for NCAA DI eligibility, not all hope is lost! You can still explore options at NCAA DII, NCAA DIII, Junior College, or NAIA schools and then transfer to an NCAA DI school after meeting the transfer requirements.\nWhether you choose to reclassify or attend a postgraduate or prep school, having a plan is key. Know the NCAA rules and the timeline for DI, maintain constant communication with the institution you plan on attending, and make sure you are on the right path. Honest Game can help!\nBy Joyce Anderson, Honest Game Co-founder and COO\nHaving served on the NCAA Eligibility Center High School Advisory Board and as the College Bound Student-Athlete Advisor at Evanston Township High School (Evanston, IL), Joyce has advised more than 2,000 high school student-athletes and families on academic eligibility and recruiting.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        With sports betting legal in more than 39 states and more than half of college-age students reporting having bet on sports at least once in the previous year, it's clear that sports betting has become a part of how fans consume sports. However, it also creates a serious threat to the well-being of our student-athletes and to the integrity of NCAA competition.\nAt the NCAA, we want to help educate student-athletes, coaches and administrators on what the Association’s rules are, help them understand the dangers associated with engaging in sports betting and provide resources to protect student-athletes and their sports. With assistance from industry experts, we are educating student-athletes and staff, tracking online threats and monitoring the integrity of competitions to protect student-athletes against the risk of sports betting.\nWhat’s the NCAA rule about sports betting?\nNCAA rules ban participation in sports betting activities and prohibit providing information to individuals involved in or associated with any type of sports betting activities concerning intercollegiate, amateur or professional athletics competition.\nIn other words, if you are a student-athlete, coach or athletics staff member, regardless of sport or division, you are not allowed to bet or provide any useful information that can influence a bet in any sport the NCAA sponsors at any level.\nWhat’s the issue surrounding sports betting?\nPrevalence of sports betting among college students and the impacts on student-athletes.\n- An April 2023 NCAA survey of more than 3,500 18- to 22-year-olds shows sports betting is pervasive among young adults across the country, with 58% saying they have engaged in at least one sports betting activity.\n- In the April survey, 6% said they have lost more than $500 on sports betting in a single day.\n- In a September 2023 NCAA survey of campus compliance directors and their experience with sports betting issues, 27% of autonomy schools had dealt with a sports betting problem among their athletes or staff within the past year, a substantial increase from a survey in 2019.\nWith such significant growth in the prevalence of sports betting in the United States, particularly on college campuses, it threatens the health and well-being of student-athletes and the integrity of NCAA competition.\nWhy is the NCAA concerned about sport betting?\nThe rise in sports betting creates unique challenges in college athletics.\n- Certain bets such as player-specific prop bets create circumstances where student-athletes and other athletics personnel received targeted harassment by bettors. The September 2023 NCAA survey of campus administrators found 10% of Division I respondents said they were aware of student-athletes being harassed online or in person by someone with gambling interests.\n- Billion-dollar ad campaigns can entice student-athletes or those around them to engage in sports betting irresponsibly. College-age students are more likely to develop problem gambling habits.\nWhat is the NCAA doing about sports betting?\nAnti-social media harassment\n- The NCAA worked with Signify Group to pilot an anti-social media harassment initiative for the 2023-24 championship season on select championships with a heightened risk for harassment and abuse directed at our championship participants, particularly student-athletes.\n- Data trends from the March Madness collection revealed:\n- One in 3 high-profile athletes receive abusive messages from someone with a betting interest.\n- More than 540 abusive betting-related messages were directed at men's and women's basketball student-athletes, including death threats.\n- Women's basketball student-athletes received approximately three times more threats than men's basketball student-athletes.\n- Insights from the full set of championships covered by the service revealed:\n- 12% of all abuse was related to sports betting, with more than 740 instances.\n- As betting markets increased, so did the prevalence of harassment, with 19% rates in men's basketball and football.\n- While 12% of the abuse detected was directly tied to sports betting based on the exact language within the posts, deeper analysis suggests that much of the abuse in other categories (e.g., sexism, racism, etc.) was influenced by sports-betting behaviors, creating overlapping abuse targeting student-athletes and officials.\n- Nearly 4,000 verified abusive messages\n-\nThe NCAA has teamed up with Venmo to curb harassment of student-athletes.\n-\nThis collaboration includes increased protections for student-athletes on Venmo, including a dedicated abuse reporting hotline, best practices guide, account support and user education.\nIn-person and online education\n- To date, over 100,000 student-athletes, coaches and administrators have been reached as part of the NCAA’s educational efforts with EPIC Global Solutions, the largest program of its kind globally.\n- The EPIC program has been made available to all NCAA campuses and conferences with a blend of delivery options, including in-person education workshops and seminars, prerecorded sessions, and on-demand virtual resources.\n- To schedule an EPIC session, please email ncaa@epicglobalsolutions.com.\n- The NCAA launched its first sports betting e-learning module, designed to educate more than 500,000 current and prospective student-athletes on problem gambling harms and the risks sports betting poses to the integrity of the game.\n- Since its rollout two years ago, the program has achieved remarkable global reach by empowering young athletes across six continents and 98 countries, as well as 50 U.S. states, to better understand and reduce the potential negative impacts of sports betting. More than 50,000 student-athletes have completed the training to date.\n- Increasing education and growing awareness of the complexities of sports betting fueled the NCAA's Draw the Line campaign, launched at the start of March Madness in 2024.\n- The campaign prioritizes student-athlete education while also addressing responsible gambling for all who consume and participate in college sports.\n- The campaign includes a membership toolkit with resources for member schools and conferences.\nIntegrity monitoring\n- Over 22,000 contests are monitored annually through the world’s largest global integrity monitoring program with an additional partner.\n- Over 20,000 officials are screened per year.\n- A network of contacts to prevent and detect integrity concerns includes federal and state law enforcement, gaming operators, campus administrators and specialized vendors.\nWorking with state and federal lawmakers\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        From my first day as a sociology professor at a university with a Division I football and men’s basketball team, education and athletics struck me as being inherently at odds.\nStudent-athletes filled my courses to take advantage of the fact that the classes met early in the morning.\nThe football and men’s basketball players – most of whom were black – quickly fell behind due to scheduling constraints. Only so much time was set aside for academics and, often, it wasn’t enough. Academic rigor and athletic success were simply incompatible goals.\nNow – as a researcher who is studying college athletes through the lens of race and class – I have compiled evidence to show just how much more time college athletes devote to sports over academics.\nLopsided but ‘normal’\nEarly data from my ongoing research on the academic experiences of black Division I football and men’s basketball players shows that they spend three times as many hours per week on athletics as they do on academics. On average, the players spend more than 25 hours on sports-related activities other than games, such as practice, workouts, general team meetings, film sessions and travel. On the other hand, the player spend less than eight hours on academics outside of class, such as writing papers, studying, getting tutored or working on group projects. This imbalance is institutionally constructed and perpetuated. Perhaps most disturbingly, the student-athletes I surveyed perceive this lopsided situation as “normal.”\nSome may argue that the players should be satisfied with the fact that their scholarships enable them to reap the benefits of a college education. The problem with that argument is that college athletes aren’t able to fully actualize their identities as students to the same degree as their classmates. College sports is just too demanding, and universities do not make any special concessions for athletes’ additional time commitments.\nMoney at stake\nIt is important to distinguish the lives of college athletes who don’t generate money for their institutions, such as soccer and tennis players, versus those who are deeply intertwined with the generation of revenue for colleges, universities and the NCAA, which cleared US$1 billion in revenue in 2017. That kind of money cannot be made without serious time commitments among the players.\nEvery time I watch a college football or men’s basketball game on TV, I can’t help but wonder what the players on my screen missed in class that day.\nThey are students such as Jalen (a pseudonym), a football player who requested a meeting with me mid-semester. He wanted to discuss how my office hours conflicted with the team practices and film sessions. For an hour we discussed what he understood as unfixable. Jalen wanted and needed to utilize the main academic support systems provided by the college, but literally didn’t have the time.\nJalen was by no means alone. Rather, his plight was emblematic of untold numbers of college athletes who struggle to balance sports and academics.\nWorkers or students?\nSo, are college athletes workers who attend school part-time? Or are they students who play sports part-time? Players at schools across the country are speaking up about the fact that they generate revenue for the colleges they play for but not for themselves. They have attempted to unionize and filed lawsuits to get what they see as their fair share.\nMeanwhile, the NCAA claims that student-athlete balance is not only possible, but that most Division I players achieve it.\nDisparities persist\nThe reality is most football and men’s basketball players underperform academically and routinely graduate at lower rates than “other student-athletes, black non-athletes and undergraduates in general.”\nRecent academic scandals – from fraudulent classes to inappropriate tutor support and administrative cover-ups – reveal that a sports-first mentality permeates college campuses.\nThe NCAA continues to describe Division I football and basketball players as “regular students who happen to play sports.” However, the NCAA rarely details how this student-athlete balance is supposed to work. There are tournament time commercials that remind viewers how most college athletes “will go pro in something other than sports.” However, less mentioned, if at all, are what kind of practical routes exist to this theoretically “balanced” identity. Even the NCAA’s own surveys of college athletes show that athletics takes precedence over academics.\nCoaches and college staffers are getting rich in the name of higher education while their mostly black players are – in their own words – “broke.” And this despite the fact that student-athlete responsibilities have grown as the business of college sports grows. For instance, some of the games last longer, and the average hours that players spend per week on athletes continues to creep upward.\nConflicts continue\nRecently, 2017 Heisman runner-up, Bryce Love, drew criticism for “setting a bad precedent” for choosing to attend summer classes instead of Stanford’s media day.\nAlmost 60 percent of participants in my current national research study find it difficult or very difficult to balance sports and academics – from the moment they set foot on campus until graduation, if they graduate at all. Considering the fact that less than 2 percent of college football players get into the National Football League, and only 1.2 percent of college basketball players get drafted into the National Basketball Association, the reality is that many college athletes will never see a payoff in professional sports. But the real tragedy is that – having devoted so much time to sports instead of their studies – they won’t really get to see their college education pay off, either.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

A member of the Democratic Party, Doggett was a member of the Texas Senate from 1973 to 1985 and a justice of the Texas Supreme Court from 1989 to 1994.\nDoggett represents the same district President Lyndon B. Johnson once represented from 1937 until 1949. He is also the dean of Texas's congressional delegation; he previously shared the deanship with Sheila Jackson Lee until her death in 2024. Doggett was the first sitting Democratic congressperson after the CNN presidential debate to call on Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.[1] On August 21, 2025, he announced that he would not run for re-election in 2026 if Texas's then-planned new congressional map was in effect for the 2026 elections.[2]\nEarly life and education\n[edit]Doggett was born in Austin, the son of Alyce Paulin (Freydenfeldt) and Lloyd Alton Doggett. His maternal grandparents were Swedish.[3] Doggett graduated Omicron Delta Kappa and received both a bachelor's degree in business administration and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the University of Texas at Austin, he also joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.\nEarly career\n[edit]Doggett served as a member of the Texas Senate from 1973 to 1985. He gained attention in 1979 as a member of the \"Killer Bees\", a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state's presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former Texas Governor John Connally a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a closed primary. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a quorum. The bill was withdrawn five days later.[4]\nHe was the Democratic nominee for the 1984 United States Senate election in Texas, losing to the Republican candidate, then-U.S. Representative Phil Gramm, by a wide margin. Doggett authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing cop killer bullets and a sunset law requiring periodic review of government agencies.\nIn 1989, Doggett became both an Associate Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law.\nU.S. House of Representatives\n[edit]Elections\n[edit]- Before 2012\nDoggett was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 in what was then the 10th district after 32-year incumbent Jake Pickle retired. He was one of the few Democrats to win an open seat in that year's massive Republican landslide. Running for reelection in 1996, Doggett defeated Republican nominee Teresa Doggett, to whom he is no relation. It marked the second election in a row in which he defeated a black female Republican. In the years following his first reelection, Doggett consistently won around 85% of the vote, facing only Libertarian opponents. The 10th, which had once been represented by Lyndon Johnson, had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.\nRedistricting by the Texas Legislature in 2003 split Austin, which had been entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, into three districts. Through Republican gerrymandering, Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the Houston suburbs. Most of his former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to McAllen on the Mexican border. It was called \"the fajita strip\" or \"the bacon strip\" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primary—the real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and the general election.[citation needed]\nOn June 28, 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the nearby 23rd district's lines violated the rights of Latino voters. As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino Laredo had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino district—in other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place. While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.[5]\nDue to the 23rd's size, the ruling forced the redrawing of five districts between El Paso and San Antonio, including the 25th. For the 2006 election, Doggett regained most of his old base in Austin (though not the area around the University of Texas at Austin, which stayed in the 21st), and also picked up several suburbs southeast of the city. After skating to reelection in 2006 and 2008, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote in 2010—his closest race since 1996.\n- 2012\nIt was reported that the new Congressional maps in Texas turned Doggett's district from a strongly Democratic district into a strongly Republican one.[6] The new map split Doggett's old territory among five districts. His home was placed in a new, heavily Republican 25th district stretching from east Austin all the way to the fringes of Fort Worth. Much of his old base was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin.[7] Doggett's home was approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had gerrymandered the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.[8]\nDoggett accused the Republicans of wanting to make it difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to be elected to Congress from Texas, saying, \"The Republican Party is determined to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities—that is what this is about, as well.\" He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by \"deny[ing] the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city.\" He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.[9]\nDoggett was set to face State Representative Joaquin Castro in the 35th district primary election. The race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett's survival yet, with Castro seen as a \"rising star\" in the Democratic party. Doggett accused Castro of working alongside Republicans throughout the redistricting process. The Republican House Redistricting Committee later said that any discussions with Castro took place after the area for the district was decided.[10] Castro opted to run in the neighboring 20th district after its incumbent, Charlie Gonzalez, announced his retirement.\nDoggett eventually decided to run in the 35th district, facing Bexar County assessor Sylvia Romo. Before the primary, he said that he would move into the district if he won. Political commentators suggested that Romo had the district numbers in her favor, but was attempting the difficult leap from local office to Congress, while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wanted to \"stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care\", and also touted his strong support for higher education programs and public education. By contrast, Romo's campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.[8]\nDoggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote.[11] He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented. The district is so heavily Democratic that he was heavily favored to win the general election in November.[12] He easily defeated Republican nominee, former San Marcos Mayor Susan Narvaiz, in the general election to become the first Anglo Democrat to represent a significant portion of San Antonio since Chick Kazen left office in 1985.\n- 2016\nDoggett won his 12th House term in 2016. With 124,612 votes (63.1%), he again defeated Narvaiz, who polled 62,384 (31.6%). Two other contenders held the remaining 5.4% of the vote.[13]\n2022\nTexas's population growth resulted in its gaining two congressional seats after the 2020 census. In October 2021, Doggett announced he would run for reelection in the state's new 37th district rather than the 35th.[14] Austin had been split between five districts on the previous congressional map, and Republican members of Congress who represented the area began facing closer reelection margins later in the decade due to the city's continued population growth and overwhelmingly Democratic voting patterns. Republican state legislators drew one of the new districts, the 37th, almost entirely within Travis County. They hoped to bolster Republican margins in surrounding districts by packing as many of Austin's Democrats into the 35th and 37th districts as possible. It closely resembles the area Doggett represented for his first five terms. Doggett's decision to run in the 37th district created a vacancy in the 35th, which runs along Interstate 35 from Austin to San Antonio. Both seats are overwhelmingly Democratic, and the winner of the Democratic primary in the 35th district, Greg Casar, was easily elected in the general election. Doggett won the 37th.\nTenure\n[edit]Described as an \"endangered species\", Doggett was one of only three white male Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the others being Gene Green and Beto O'Rourke) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party.[15] Since Green's and O'Rourke's retirements after the 2018 election, Doggett is the only white male Democrat representing Texas in Congress. He is one of the most liberal white Democrats from a Southern district, and one of the most liberal people ever to represent Texas in Congress. David Hawkings of Roll Call described his tax and environmental policies as \"muscular progressivism\".[16]\nDoggett was a frequent critic of former Speaker Newt Gingrich while allying with David Bonior, the Democratic whip, when Bonior was leading[according to whom?] \"an effort to diminish Gingrich's power by raising continual questions about his ethics.\"[17] He has been a close ally of Nancy Pelosi. In 2002, he supported her successful bid for Democratic leader over fellow Texan Martin Frost, a more moderate candidate.[18]\nOn the local level, Doggett helped ensure the development of the Austin Outpatient Clinic, which opened in 2011 as the largest veterans' clinic of its kind in the country.[19] In 2014, he secured passage of legislation to expand the Missions National Park and supported it being named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[20]\nDoggett has long supported more open government, and is also a leading advocate for campaign finance reform. On the Ways and Means Committee, he has sought to close many overseas tax shelters. Doggett has authored legislation to create tax incentives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and to create a nationwide Silver Alert system. From 2011 to 2016, he served as ranking member of the Human Resources Subcommittee and in 2017 became ranking member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. His priorities there included education, health care, preventing child abuse, reducing prescription drug prices, fighting poverty, and eliminating multinational tax shelters and loopholes.\nOn July 2, 2024, Doggett became the first sitting Democrat in Congress to openly call for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election after the first presidential debate, in which many perceived Biden performed poorly in, causing many Democrats to start being concerned about Biden's age and cognitive ability. Before Doggett took this political risk he spoke with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. He also huddled with Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland and spoke with Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a close ally of Biden's, and \"with every other (House) member I could find.\" Doggett's message was clear: \"We must have another candidate.\"[21] Democrats had become doubtful of Biden's ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in the general election.[22]\nAfter Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, regarding not calling on Biden to call it quits sooner, Doggett said, “I only regret I didn't do it earlier. I think it's unfortunate that he took three weeks to decide. I believe that the only person in our caucus who doesn't share some responsibility for the outcome is Dean Phillips, who came out early. I accept responsibility as well that there's more that we could have done.” [23]\nIn spite of calling for President Biden to step down due to age concerns, Representative Doggett himself declared his candidacy for his own re-election bid just months later. He will be 80 years old when the 2026 midterm elections take place.[24] Ongoing efforts by the Texas State Legislature to gerrymander the state's congressional districts has raised speculation that he and fellow Democrat Greg Casar could be placed in the same district. In July 2025, Doggett reaffirmed his intent to seek re-election even if he were to challenge the 35-year old Casar, stating that \"We do need young leaders, but we don't need everyone on our team to play the same position.\"[25] However, on August 21, 2025, Doggett announced he would not seek reelection in Texas’ 37th congressional district if Republican-backed redistricting maps are upheld, avoiding a potential primary against Representative Greg Casar.[26][27]\nPolitical positions\n[edit]Abortion\n[edit]Doggett supports legalization of abortion. In 2003, he voted against a bill that would have banned all late-term procedures called partial-birth abortions. He was given a 100% by the NARAL.[28] He voted in favor of a bill to provide federal funding for embryonic stem cell research in 2007.\nEnvironment\n[edit]Doggett supports environmental preservation. He is one of the leading opponents in the House of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska. The League of Conservation Voters gave Doggett a 100% rating,[29] an indication that he supports the group's interpretation of environmental preservation. In the 110th Congress (2007–08), he wrote climate change legislation that would have gone further to reduce greenhouse gases than bills his party's leaders supported.[30]\nIn June 2009, Doggett voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a bill that would have established an emissions trading system for American producers of carbon dioxide. He said, \"It has been a difficult and significant decision\". \"I just decided that I will have a better chance to make changes later in the process if I acted in good faith now. But don't think this means I'm signing off on the conference report\", he added.[31]\nIn 2018, Doggett was rated 100% by the group Clean Water Action.[32]\nGay rights\n[edit]Doggett voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in the 109th Congress. He voted against HR 4380 and HR 2587, bills that would have banned adoption by same-sex couples.[33] In 1996, Doggett voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), but in 2011 he co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal DOMA.[34][35]\nTaxes\n[edit]Doggett introduced legislation that would restrict American companies from using overseas strategies to reduce their corporate tax rates. When Obama unveiled his plan in May 2009 to significantly change how U.S.-based multinationals are taxed, it included aspects of Doggett's proposals to crack down on tax dodgers.[36] He voted against the 2010 tax compromise, criticizing the renewal of the Bush tax cuts, saying \"This bill is largely a mishmash of rejected Republican ideas that cost too much to accomplish too little.\"[37] He led a group of Democrats who \"criticized the inclusion of a Social Security payroll tax reduction, saying it would endanger the soundness of the program.\"[18]\nIn 2010, Doggett was responsible for an amendment to an education jobs bill that would mandate that Texas keep the same amount of education funding for three years in order to receive $832 million in federal money. Rick Perry called it \"an unconstitutional anti-Texas amendment\" and later filed a lawsuit after the Department of Education declined the application for funds.[18][38]\nIn 2015, Doggett introduced legislation to close a loophole that allows tax writeoffs for senior executive bonuses, calling it \"a perverse incentive for companies: the more you pay your executives, the less you'll pay in taxes.\"[39][40]\nEnergy\n[edit]Doggett has backed bills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and supports cap-and-trade as well as clean technologies. He supported the 2009 climate-change bill, \"despite claiming it didn't do enough to protect the environment.\" He said it stripped the EPA of too much power and was too beneficial to coal plants and \"other polluters.\" Doggett supports auctioning carbon allowances, and has worked to make legislation usually associated with the House Ways and Means Committee to be associated with the Energy and Commerce Committee.[18][41]\nIn June 2015, Doggett voted against fast-track Trade Promotion Authority, calling it a \"charter for corporate America rather than a high-level trade agreement.\" He criticized the U.S. Trade Representative for failing to enforce labor and environmental standards. \"Usually, the reason that USTR fails is that it doesn't really try,\" he said. 'Asleep at the Wheel' is a great Texas swing band, but it is a horrible philosophy for trade law enforcement.\"[42]\nIn 2015, Doggett's continued interest in international affairs was reflected in his support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal. Together with Representatives David Price and Jan Schakowsky, Doggett organized a successful whip effort to ensure Congress did not obstruct nuclear negotiations with Iran.[43][44]\nHealth care\n[edit]In March 2010, Doggett voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Before his vote, he cited concerns that the bill did not include enough affordability, insurance competition provisions, and consumer protection provisions. Originally an advocate of a public option, he conceded the option in the final vote.[18]\nIn 2015, Congress passed Doggett's NOTICE Act, which ensures that hospitalized seniors are notified whether they are in outpatient observation or inpatient care, saving them the sticker shock from realizing Medicare may not cover their skilled nursing facility care as expected. Doggett sponsored the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act, which was enacted in 2015 and protects seniors from identity theft by removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards. Another of Doggett's sponsored bills, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, was enacted that same year. It allows patients with rare diseases to receive some compensation for clinical trial participation, without that compensation counting toward income eligibility limits for Social Security income or Medicaid.[45]\nDoggett has said Republicans in Congress and \"ideological groups that have never accepted the idea of social insurance\" pose a greater threat to Social Security than the country's aging population.[46]\nDoggett founded the House Prescription Drug Task Force to tackle the cost of prescription drugs.[47]\nDoggett co-sponsored the Medicare for All Act of 2019.[48]\nCriticism of healthcare opponents\n[edit]In August 2009, a \"rally\" against Obamacare broke out after Doggett said that he would support it even if his constituents opposed it. The protesters, who chanted \"just say no\", were later criticized by Doggett, who called them a \"mob\" and \"extremists\", and said the group was part of the \"party of no.\"[49] Of the situation, he said: \"Their fanatical insistence on repealing Social Security and Medicare is not just about halting health care reform but rolling back 75 years of progress.\" Doggett said he was committed to individual choices.\nDoggett reportedly tried to answer questions, but felt the demonstrators opposed all government programs, including Social Security and Medicare, in addition to the health care plan. He said that \"[i]n Texas, not only with the weather but with the politics, it is pretty hardball around here ... I have a pretty thick skin about all of this. But this really goes over the line.'\"[50]\nImmigration\n[edit]Doggett supports a guest worker program for undocumented immigrants. In 2004, he voted against a bill that would have required hospitals to report undocumented immigrants who received hospital treatment to the Department of Justice. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-immigration organization classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group,[51] gave Doggett a score of 0% – indicating the percentage of times he voted in favor of FAIR's positions – in 2003.[52]\nDoggett also supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age, known as \"Dreamers\", access to work permits and deportation relief.[53]\nIraq\n[edit]Doggett was one of the leading opponents of the authorization of the Iraq War in 2003 and called for a timetable for U.S. troops pulling out of Iraq. On May 24, 2007, he was one of 140 Democrats and two Republicans to vote against HR 2206, a bill that would provide emergency supplemental appropriations for funding the war, and in 2009 he was one of only 30 representatives to vote against HR 2346, which provided funding to continue war.[54][better source needed]\nEducation\n[edit]In 2009, as part of the Obama administration's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Doggett authored the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a refundable credit for some tuition and related expenses.[55]\nOther social service issues\n[edit]In January 2013, Doggett passed a bill into law setting up a national commission to examine ways to reduce the number of children who die of abuse and neglect.[56] More children die in Texas of abuse and neglect than in any other state.[57] The tax and spending deal approved that month to avoid a so-called \"fiscal cliff\" included an extension of a higher-education tax credit he had proposed. He also worked with Representative Sam Johnson to pass a bill through the House in December 2012 to authorize the phased removal of Social Security numbers from Medicare cards to crack down on identity theft.[58]\nTrump administration\n[edit]Doggett was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, skipping his inauguration to speak at the Women's March at the State Capitol in Austin, which observers described as the largest protest in Texas history.[59][60] He has played a leading role in seeking disclosure of Trump's tax returns and in opposing the repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act.[61] Doggett also sponsored a resolution to formally censure Trump for his failure regarding violence at Charlottesville, Virginia.[62]\nSyria\n[edit]In 2023, Doggett was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[63][64]\nIsrael\n[edit]Doggett voted to provide Israel with financial support in the Gaza war.

Lloyd Doggett was quick to announce he would run in the sole Austin-based district.\nDoggett, a formidable incumbent with three decades in Congress, was planting a flag with the hope that his Austin counterpart Rep. Greg Casar would stay in his current district despite its new boundaries favoring Republicans. But Doggett’s move unexpectedly set off a powerful coalition that worked publicly and privately to support the younger congressman.\nThree weeks after Doggett dug in on the promise to run again, he changed his mind, opting to retire at the end of his term and support Casar’s candidacy — a move that spared Democrats an expensive primary.\nDoggett, 78, still believes he would have beaten Casar in a head to head, and he stands by his position that his colleague should have run in the newly-drawn Congressional District 35, a majority-Hispanic district in San Antonio and outlying counties that bears the same number as Casar’s current district but has little overlap with his constituents. But he realized in August that a race between the two of them would have been damaging.\n“It would be a very demanding race for everybody involved,” Doggett said in an interview with The Texas Tribune about his decision, adding that even if he did win “it would still leave a community scarred and split. And that is a community I really care about. And so, I’m satisfied.”\nDoggett’s decision to forgo the primary caused many Democrats across Texas to breathe a collective sigh of relief, while signaling Casar’s growing strength in Austin politics and in Congress.\nCasar, a second-term congressman, publicly stayed above the fray as Doggett suggested he run in the new San Antonio seat. But behind the scenes, he was making moves to consolidate support.\nBefore Doggett announced his decision to step aside, Casar had lined up endorsements from a handful of members of Austin’s City Council, according to a source familiar with his campaign not authorized to speak publicly. In Washington, where Casar chairs and Doggett vice chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he was planning to announce support from Democratic members from an ideological cross-section of the party, the source said.\nA series of Democratic groups, including BOLD PAC, End Citizens United and Way to Win, were planning to raise money on Casar’s behalf. Jane Fonda had committed to host a fundraiser for Casar. And his campaign had brought on national Democratic pollsters and recruited Morris Katz, New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s lead media strategist, to produce Casar’s launch video.\nTory Gavito, the president of the progressive donor network Way to Win, said she lamented having to choose but that her organization was ready to support Casar through independent expenditure efforts had a primary materialized.\n“Folks were definitely lining up [for Casar], and it was really pulling on different types of the Democratic coalition, from those that are ready to back the next gen[eration], to those who are more working class-aligned, people of color constituency groups, Latinos,” Gavito said, adding that some Democrats thought Doggett’s suggestion that Casar run in the new San Antonio seat, which would have voted for President Donald Trump by a 10-point margin, was a misstep.\n“In fact, there were a few of us who were a little offended by this idea that Austin isn’t a place for Latino kids too. We have to go to San Antonio,” she said.\nThe court of public opinion also took its toll. On the morning Doggett withdrew, a group of influential Austin Democrats — including former state Sen. and gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis and former Texas state Rep. Glen Maxey — published an op-ed in the Austin Chronicle that pointed out that Doggett would be 80 at the time of his next reelection and encouraged him to either run in a different district or retire.\nThe op-ed noted that Doggett had been the first elected Democrat to call on then-President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race in the aftermath of his disastrous debate performance.\nDoggett said he disagreed with the op-ed — and that local efforts to scare him out of running were “weak at best” — but took to heart the way it was already pitting Democrats against each other.\n“I thought the opinion piece made no sense at all,” Doggett said of its suggestion he should run in Casar’s current district which had been redrawn. “But it did stir a lot of debate online and otherwise and again, that made it apparent what kind of battle would lie ahead to win this.”\nDoggett’s decision to step aside also prevented others from publicly siding against him. Liberal New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg had been working on an opinion piece calling on Doggett to retire before he ultimately announced he would do so, according to two Democrats with knowledge of the column. Goldberg had previously called on then-President Joe Biden to forgo running for reelection as early as July 2022.\nNew York Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said the paper does not comment on journalism that may or may not be underway.\nDoggett, for his part, said he fears ageism factored into the feedback he got.\n“Just as we need to encourage new generation leaders, we need leaders of all generations and should evaluate each on performance, not claims that one is too young or too old,” he said. “Ageism, not unlike sexism and racism, denies us the full range of talent available to overcome Trump’s march to tyranny and build a country with respect and greater opportunity for all.”\nWhile the loggerheads between the two were ultimately resolved, some Texas Democrats were upset that Doggett had begun discussing a primary before the maps were passed.\nIn the days before the map was unveiled, the Texas Democratic delegation in Congress had publicly and privately called for unity. Doggett himself said at a July press conference that he would not be asking Texas legislators to protect his seat, “nor should any member of this delegation.”\nBut when he began giving interviews stating his intent to run in Congressional District 37, it rubbed some Democrats the wrong way.\nThe situation between Doggett and Casar played out in direct contrast to a similar map-drawing casualty in North Texas. Republicans redrew Dallas-area seats to leave just two Democratic seats where there used to be three. Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s downtown Dallas seat was shifted around the margins, while Fort Worth Rep. Marc Veasey and Farmers Branch Rep. Julie Johnson saw their districts completely dismantled and amalgamated, with pieces of Crockett’s, into one deep blue seat in Dallas County.\nBut neither Johnson nor Veasey has publicly committed to running for one seat or another, and Johnson has made clear she will not primary Veasey.\nVeasey said the nature of their conduct is intentional.\n“I’ve been trying to get the entire delegation to be like that [while] this plays out,” he said. “You don’t want to feed into their game by responding to what they do. I understand also that no one wants to be the last person to plant a flag. I think it’s a delicate balance.”\nIn an interview, Johnson said she was glad to see Casar and Doggett avoid a primary, and that she and Veasey are committed to the same.\n“I have every expectation that we’re going to get it all sorted out,” Johnson said. “Marc and I have great respect for each other. We’re good friends, and I think we’re pretty much there.”\nStepping aside means Doggett will largely have avoided a serious primary over the course of his 30 year congressional career.\nThroughout numerous redistricting efforts, Doggett had always managed to survive, despite the shape of his district changing to incorporate McAllen and San Antonio at various points, forcing him to hit the road and practice his formidable style of retail politics in places he had no connection to.\nIn 2011, after a round of redistricting, Doggett found himself in an unofficial showdown with then-state Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, in a district redrawn to span from San Antonio neighborhoods to the southern part of Travis County. Like now, Doggett, who is white, faced the prospect of running against a younger Latino Democrat in a heavily Hispanic district where the turf was likely tilted toward Castro.\nDoggett was committed to fighting for his seat and was flush with cash, with nearly $3 million in his campaign account in the summer of 2011. But both men were bailed out by the retirement of U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, in the neighboring 20th District, where Castro chose to run instead.\nBut this time around, with no other Central Texas Democrats close to retirement and a challenge coming from an Austinite rather than a San Antonian, it was Doggett, despite again having a financial advantage of $6.2 million to Casar’s approximately $450,000, who ended up bowing out to clear the way for a younger politician.\n“I’ve always said that I didn’t plan to stay here forever,” Doggett said, adding that he only planned to serve one or two more terms. “So it just didn’t seem to me like a good use of my resources, and that I could spend my time, and those who would be on the other side could do the same, trying to elect a Democratic House and fight Trump.”\nThe dean of the Texas delegation, Doggett has spent decades as one of the Texas delegation’s most progressive members, with a focus on cracking down on tax evasion and defending Social Security and the Affordable Care Act.\nCastro, for his part, appeared at Casar’s launch event to praise his colleague. But he lamented that Doggett had to make a decision at all.\n“Lloyd Doggett has given 50 years of his life to incredible public service, to the people of Austin and many people in Texas,” Castro said in an interview. “And so I respected his decision to not run again. It cleared the way for Greg. But really, [he] never should have been put in that position.”\nShape the future of Texas at the 15th annual Texas Tribune Festival, happening Nov. 13–15 in downtown Austin!

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening.

Recently, FBI Director James Comey said she wouldn’t be indicted for using a private server to send and receive classified emails, which put government secrets at risk of being hacked by U.S. enemies. He did say her actions were “extremely careless.”\nRepublicans say the fact she wasn’t charged is further proof Clinton is a corrupt, Washington insider who doesn’t deserve the Oval Office.\nAssociated Press photo\nIt was the quote heard throughout the Republican party and repeated many times: “What difference does it make?”\nThe GOP affixes that paraphrased quote to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s response to the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that on Sept. 11, 2012, killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\nDuring a vigorous U.S. House investigation on the issue, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, pressed Clinton on why State Department officials in Washington, D.C., didn’t call their counterparts in Libya to determine the cause of the attack.\nWas it a protest over a video mocking Islam or a planned terrorist attack? Clinton has been accused of lying about both.\nShe initially told Johnson her priority was figuring out how to rescue them, not finding out if it was the video or a planned attack. Clinton also told him it wasn’t appropriate to ask those questions before FBI interviews.\nAs Johnson continued to push for the information, Clinton said:\n\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\"\nClinton has repeatedly been accused by Republicans of not doing enough to save lives.\nAssociated Press photo\nEmails\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton set up a private server that she used to send and receive classified emails. During numerous campaign stops early on, she said her use of a private server was “allowed.”\nShe also said she turned over all of her emails.\nA federal investigation determined she was not “allowed” to transmit government secrets on a private server that was vulnerable to hackers, and recent reports show she deleted tens of thousands of emails pertinent to the investigation.\nNew Jersey Chris Christie, a former prosecutor, delivered a blistering line about the scandal in his Republican convention speech: “Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she cared about protecting America’s secrets.”\nRecently, FBI Director James Comey said she wouldn’t be indicted for using a private server to send and receive classified emails, which put government secrets at risk of being hacked by U.S. enemies. He did say her actions were “extremely careless.”\nAssociated Press photo\nVince Foster\nQuestions and conspiracy theories swirled for years about Vince Foster, deputy White House counsel during Bill Clinton’s administration.\nA few months after Foster filed delinquent tax returns in the Whitewater scandal, he committed suicide.\nBut some Republicans have implied foul play, despite his death being ruled a suicide by five investigations.\nGOP nominee Donald Trump gave new life to those rumors on the campaign trail:\nFoster, who was a close friend of the Clintons, “had intimate knowledge of what was going on,” Trump told The Washington Post in May. “He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide. I don’t know enough to really discuss it (but) I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder.”\nAssociated Press\nWhitewater\nRepublicans have not forgotten the Whitewater scandal.\nIt’s a controversy that began with then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in 1978.\nThey, along with developer James McDougal, borrowed about $200,000 to form Whitewater Development Corp, a real estate firm formed to buy and flip riverfront property into vacation homes.\nAs interest rates increased, the homes didn’t sell and the project was stagnant, but McDougal and the Clintons continued the business.\nThe business partners grew more entangled as McDougal became a political fundraiser for Clinton in his run for governor.\nAlso, in 1985, McDougal hired Rose Law Firm, where then-Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton was a partner. Rose Law Firm represented McDougal’s savings and loans business, Madison Guaranty.\nHillary Clinton signed off on the billing records for Madison Guaranty, but those records couldn’t be found when the Whitewater investigation began. They were found two years later in the Clintons’ private residence in the White House.\nInvestigator Kenneth Starr said he had no explanation for the disappearance or the reappearance of the billing records. \"After a thorough investigation, we have found no explanation how the billing records got where they were or why they were not discovered and produced earlier. It remains a mystery to this day,” he said according to a 1998 New York Times Article.\nThis is how Politifact explains some of the scandal:\n“Madison Guaranty failed in 1989, costing taxpayers an estimated $60 million.\nMcDougal was ultimately indicted for fraud and making bad loans, with about. About $134,000 was funneled through Whitewater. The Clintons, who had retained interest in Whitewater throughout, sold their share to McDougal for $1,000 in 1992.\nDuring the first year of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the Resolution Trust Corp., a temporary federal agency tasked with investigating failed savings and loans, named the Clintons as \"potential beneficiaries\" of Madison Guaranty's and McDougal’s illegal activities. That summer, Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster committed suicide, a few months after he filed delinquent tax returns for Whitewater.”\nAfter a lengthy federal investigation, no civil or criminal charges were brought against the Clintons.\nHowever, 15 other people were convicted of more than 40 crimes in the Whitewater scandal. Then-President Bill Clinton pardoned four of them before leaving office: Susan McDougal, wife of James McDougal who was charged with fraud; Robert Palmer, a Madison Guaranty appraiser charged with conspiracy; Stephen Smith, a former Clinton aide in Arkansas who was charged with conspiracy to misapply funds; and Chris Wade, a Whitewater real estate broker who was charged with multiple loan fraud.\nAssociated Press photo\nBullied her husband's mistresses\nRepublicans say Hillary Clinton bullied the women who said they were sexually involved with or harassed by her husband. They also say she played a victim role publicly while vindictively working behind the scenes.\nSome of the often-cited examples come from “A Woman in Charge,” the biography written by Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Bernstein.\nAs the Gennifer Flowers scandal emerged while Bill Clinton was running for president, Hillary Clinton wanted sworn statements from women he was rumored to have been with, including interviewing one of them herself, according to the biography.\nShe also worked to undermine Flowers, who she labeled as “trailer trash,” according to Bernstein.\nWhile trying to discredit Flowers, she also tried to get “horrified” campaign aides to start rumors that former President George H.W. Bush has cheated on First Lady Barbara Bush.\nAssociated Press photo\nBosnia\nDuring a George Washington University commencement address in 2008, Hillary Clinton said she remembered \"landing under sniper fire” in Bosnia.\n“There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base,” she said.\nBut that didn’t actually happen.\nA CBS News video shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac without any sniper fire and being greeted by a child handing her a poem.\nBy the end of March 2008, Clinton said she \"misspoke” about Bosnia.\nClinton \"is a world-class liar,\" GOP nominee Donald Trump said on June 22 during a speech in New York. \"Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers.\"\nRead more from PennLive: Does Hillary Clinton have a Brian Williams problem? Fact-checking her claim of 'landing under sniper fire'\nAssociated Press\nDonations to the Clinton Foundation\nThe Clinton Foundation has been the subject of much speculation from Republicans and journalists.\nRepublicans say the nonprofit is an example of Hillary Clinton’s questionable ties to global politicians – some which have competing interests with the U.S.\nJournalists say, because the foundation is a nonprofit, it’s hard to get a public accounting of who is donating.\nFor example, Politifact had trouble verifying a recent claim from Donald Trump.\nAfter the Orlando shootings, Clinton called on Persian Gulf states to stop their wealthy citizens from funding Muslim extremists.\nDonald Trump on June 13 posted the following response on Facebook:\n\"Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!\"\nPolitifact quickly investigated the claim.\n“We soon found that independently confirming information about the Clinton foundation is challenging at best,” Politifact reported.\n\"The only thing we found from the campaign was a list that included broad-range figures of the Saudi donations to the foundation, along with donations from an unnamed group of \"Friends of Saudi Arabia.\"\nTrump can’t prove that he’s right. But by the same token, it’s just about as difficult to prove conclusively that he’s wrong,” Politifact reported.\nAssociated Press photo\nSyrian refugees\nNumerous Republicans have talked about Hillary Clinton’s plan to admit “500 percent more” Syrian refugees into the U.S.\nIt’s actually 550 percent.\nHere’s the issue:\nDonald Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants after the Orlando shooting in June, claiming refugees are potential terrorists.\n“Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security,” he said on June 13. “Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions, without a screening plan, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me. Tell me, how stupid is that?\"\nDuring a Sept. 20 appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Clinton was asked if President Barack Obama's plan to increase the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the U.S. to 10,000 was enough.\n\"Look, we’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,\" Clinton said.\nAn increase from 10,000 to 65,000 would be a 550 percent increase.\nAssociated Press photo\nTrade deals\nRepublicans say Hillary Clinton has killed American jobs with her support of free trade deals.\nDuring the Republican National Convention, GOP nominee Donald Trump said, “She supported (the North American Free Trade Agreement), and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization — another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"\nWhile she supported NAFTA and TPP in the past, Clinton said she no longer supports those deals.\nIn an April CNN forum, Clinton reaffirmed her support for China entering the World Trade Organization, despite sharing concerns of labor unions.\n“Right now, we are trading with China,” she said. “We have a huge trade deficit with China. The agreement that has been negotiated between our two countries would open their markets to us in a way that they are not yet open, and in fact, for many large manufactured products, like automobiles, we would have the first chance to really get in and compete in that marketplace.”\nAs for the trade deal with South Korea, Clinton opposed it while running for president in 2008, claiming it was “inherently unfair” and did not create “a level playing field for American carmakers.”\nHowever, as secretary of state, she supported the South Korea deal championed by the Obama administration.\nAssociated Press photo\nControlled by the big banks\nRepublicans repeatedly accuse Hillary Clinton of having a cozy relationship with the big banks.\nDuring a radio show appearance in May, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley, said \"It's entirely possible that the democratic nominee earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s.\"\n\"In fact, it’s quite likely,” he said.\nClinton’s 2014 tax return shows 14 of the 41 speeches she gave in 2013 were to Wall Street banks, according to Politifact.\nShe was paid $225,000 for most of them. However, she was paid $260,000 for one speech to Deutsche Bank.\nAssociated Press\nFlip-flops on the big issues\nRepublicans say the way Hillary Clinton flip-flops on big issues proves she’s untrustworthy and panders to the polls.\nFor example, she changed position on the Cuba embargo and trade deals.\nLast year, she said at a campaign stop in Florida, “The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all.”\nDuring her 2008 presidential run, she favored keeping the embargo. Her position started to change in 2014 when she said the embargo wasn’t serving the country’s goals across Latin America.\nClinton also previously supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Trans-Pacific Partnership, but no longer supports them.\nAssociated Press\nVisit on the tarmac\nThe private meeting late last month between former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch fed Republican theories that Hillary Clinton is a Washington insider “above the law.”\nDemocrats took Lynch and Bill Clinton at their word that the impromptu meeting June 27 on a Phoenix tarmac did not involve the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use as secretary of state.\nMeanwhile, Republicans called for action.\nThey said an independent prosecutor should investigate the email scandal, claiming the Justice Department under a Democratic president should not be investigating a Democratic presidential candidate, the Associated Press reported.\n\"This incident does nothing to instill confidence in the American people that her department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation, and that's why a special counsel is needed now more than ever,\" Texas Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement, according to the AP.\nLynch, who was traveling with her husband, told the AP that the meeting was unplanned.\nThe former president was waiting to depart and walked over to her plane after she landed. They talked about his grandchildren and their travels, Lynch said.\n\"There was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body. There was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of the State Department emails, by way of example,\" she said in Phoenix, according to the AP.\nMany reporters asked her if the meeting was appropriate given that the FBI is investigating the potential mishandling of classified information on Hillary Clinton's private server.\nLynch deflected those questions, according to the AP, and said the investigation is being conducted by career investigators and agents \"who always follow facts and the law.\"\nAssociated Press photo\nPicking 'Corrupt Kaine'\nRead more\nRead more:\nBefore Benghazi: 20 fatal U.S. embassy attacks during the Bush administration you may not know about\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        %PDF-1.5 %���� 1 0 obj <>>> endobj 2 0 obj <> endobj 3 0 obj <>/ExtGState<>/XObject<>/ProcSet[/PDF/Text/ImageB/ImageC/ImageI] >>/MediaBox[ 0 0 595.32 841.92] /Contents 4 0 R/Group<>/Tabs/S/StructParents 0>> endobj 4 0 obj <> stream x��X�oGG��ǻH,�5�!E�bp\"��q1N�\n��y�y�Ά���ጇ�sV �Ȕ��6Y���Xu;g�n��A�c\\�d��fD@&�D����=�}���x���9�LzMO/I�\"���n�&��+L>u;���n�5Ȃ�W0[n���V�k<��9��9�1��\n�����(��F��E�a��B�Fd�: 5(�8}�2K��0�����[-��\\0�d�\n�lp\"/(.a2�I�ŚG�Oh�����.����b п}1\n��Q��Tz���\n��h�T���N�p�rn� ������a�b�|����Z�F�IBY����H�ӞT�� ���)YS�^c\n�|Z�ʠ�p�Z�GU\\��jr\n8tK5D�䈌�TJJD-���qtW�M� ��\\A�����S-�E�I���)~�w�*��X5}���A�����#�۳�)�E�&�J��=�d�����b2\n�Y���jM�y\\\n�Z/S��ă�]�^��;��c��8�a���pt�GN ���*��+:��R1�5���J]��F\"���O;kD��v?�\\>�3��8f��`o_������y�qô}]�Q�W�e%��c��)S�iB��^����nO(���\nu7�H/��^�*,ݺ�~o�Gu-�w�QGG�*u��#լ��h����˨����{e/ך\\��������$�Z9����=�\\Q�P��d@�1�G������_�b�'�o�sHG�9���\\n�=�=����b��\n�tG�P����G�����d��6��јU�(!�s�A�� Q�x�@FR۶��I����)��x}������gf%#�T\\��Y@_8���==�����������3j~�iMn��Hq�Lü$T���jI��]_��M�D��B�8^R�q�2����`����s5+)�M��f�~a�H�����v9=�+����<� |YO�1���p�����9����Ԡ��X#�s\n��>��iU�Uwx��L%�Tk�k��ձ������c���[U-'�Pϱ���I*Tr��h���\n���r>����c�ѩ�ρ�_���-���M^2�[%�?}��\nendstream\nendobj\n5 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n6 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n7 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n8 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n9 0 obj\n<>\nstream\nx���1jQ@QɊlY��M�)R�ąp�:�[��J��%��Md�Y@\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Donald Trump knows how important his words about unauthorized immigrants are.\n“Migrant criminals.” “Illegal monster.” “Killers.” “Gang members.” “Poisoning our country.” “Taking your jobs.” “The largest invasion in the history of our country.”\nRepetition has been core to Trump’s speech throughout his political career. The Marshall Project used text analysis to identify 13 major claims about immigration in over 350,000 of Trump’s public statements from Factba.se, some of which Trump has made 500 times or more. All of them are untrue or deeply misleading.\nResearch has shown that as someone hears a statement more times, it feels more true.\nMillions of Americans and people worldwide have heard these claims. Here they are, fact-checked by the staff of The Marshall Project.\nTrump claims that:\n▪ Unauthorized immigrants are criminals [said 575+ times], snakes that bite [35+ times], eating pets, coming from jails and mental institutions [560+ times], causing crime in sanctuary cities [185+ times], and a group of isolated, tragic cases prove they are killing Americans en masse [235+ times].\n▪ They are stealing Americans’ public benefits [270+ times] and jobs [155+ times].\n▪ He has to build a wall [675+], and mass deportations are acceptable because Eisenhower did it [50+ times].\nSkip to the end for more context about these repeated falsehoods.\nclaimed by trump more than 550 times\nFor Donald Trump, immigrants bring crime. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said during his 2015 campaign announcement. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.”\nBut immigration in the U.S. is strongly associated with lower crime. Looking at data from 200 metropolitan areas, a 2017 study found immigrants are “less likely to offend than native born Americans” and “for property crimes, immigration has a consistently negative effect” on a region’s crime rate. That trend, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) research found, has been consistent all the way back to 1870.\nThose findings hold true for undocumented immigrants. Using estimates of undocumented populations, researchers in 2018 found that “undocumented immigration does not increase violence.” Similarly, a study published one year earlier asserted undocumented immigrants have lower rates of drug arrests, overdoses and drunk driving offenses than native-born Americans.\nWhy do immigrants commit fewer crimes? One theory is that the type of person willing to pack up their entire life to seek prosperity in America is also the type of person unwilling to put all of that at risk through criminal behavior, according to a 2007 NBER paper.\nWhile first-generation immigrants generally display lower levels of criminality, their descendants tend to behave more and more like the greater U.S. population as their families assimilate. “By the second generation, immigrants have simply caught up to their native-born counterparts,” reads a 2014 study.\nTrump’s oft-repeated assertion that immigrants make crime worse is shared by around half of Americans, according to a 2023 survey — a number relatively consistent with when Pew started asking the question nearly a quarter-century ago. Only 5% of respondents thought immigrants reduce crime.\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed that millions of immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border were intentionally released from overseas jails, prisons and asylums, especially in countries like Venezuela.\nThese claims have been routinely debunked by journalists, researchers and fact-checkers. Pressed multiple times, Trump’s campaign has not been able to corroborate the claims, making it difficult to fact-check something that may not exist.\nA kernel of truth driving Trump’s claim is that federal officials say they’ve encountered Venezuelan gang members crossing the southern border, though in nowhere near the numbers the former president is pushing. And there’s no evidence they were incarcerated or systematically released, intentionally or otherwise, to infiltrate the U.S.\nCriminology and immigration experts, both inside and outside of Venezuela, told El País, the largest daily Spanish-language newspaper in the world, that there’s been no emptying of prisons and mental institutions. Meanwhile, Trump has exaggerated and misattributed the country’s decline in violent crime. A 2023 annual report on violence from an alliance of Venezuelan universities links a more modest 25% decline in violence to peace agreements between organized gangs and fewer opportunities for crime amid a suffering economy. The report does say outward migration of youth gangs temporarily drove up violence in neighboring countries.\nRepublicans echo Trump’s accusations. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott proclaimed the border a disaster less than five months into the Biden administration. Last month, Abbott amended that proclamation to label Tren de Aragua — the Venezuelan gang at the heart of Trump’s unfounded claim — a terrorist organization.\nDonald Trump has claimed that Mexico is flooding the border with drug dealers, criminals and rapists by repeating emotionally powerful anecdotes. Two weeks after his 2015 presidential campaign announcement, Trump latched onto a poster child: Jose Garcia-Zarate, a five-times deported Mexican national who was charged with murder for fatally shooting 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a pier in San Francisco. She died in her father’s arms.\nTrump repeatedly invoked Steinle’s killing as part of an immigrant crime wave and said that he is “the only one who can fix it.”\nTrump’s focus on Garcia-Zarate is part of a pattern of highlighting undocumented people of color killing or raping White women: Lakin Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Marilyn Pharis.\nWhile each of these violent crimes is tragic, multiple studies have shown there is no crime wave: Documented and undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Individual cases of violence can always be found within a population of some 11 million undocumented immigrants, said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a professor at the Moritz School of Law.\nThese individual stories “serve as useful rallying points around which his supporters and members of the right-wing media ecosystem are willing to devote immense amounts of time,” García Hernández said.\nAnd some of Trump’s cases aren’t what he claims they are. A jury acquitted Garcia-Zarate of murder, finding the gun went off by accident and ricocheted off the pier before killing Steinle. Trump called it “a disgraceful verdict” and tweeted, “BUILD THE WALL!”\nSteinle’s family did not appreciate the attention. “For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed — beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,” Liz Sullivan, Steinle’s mother, told the San Francisco Chronicle. “We were the perfect storm for that man.”\nFederal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections and the available evidence shows attempts to get around the law are vanishingly rare.\nState-level reviews of voter rolls have routinely found negligible numbers of noncitizens attempting or successfully registering to vote. For example, earlier this year in Ohio, about 600 noncitizens were found to have registered to vote. Of those, about 138 are believed to have cast a ballot, representing about 0.002% of the state’s registered voters. Similarly, in August, a yearslong review in Texas found about 2,000 “potential” noncitizens with voting histories on Texas voter rolls — or 0.01% of the electorate — but to date, none have been accused of voting illegally.\nRepublicans have still tried to tighten voter registration laws, specifically the 2024 SAVE Act legislation, which would force states to verify citizenship before adding someone to the voter rolls, an effort that Democrats have stymied to this point.\nAnother version of Trump’s argument is that pro-immigrant efforts by Democrats pad the census counts of Democrat-majority districts and give the party an advantage in House representation and the Electoral College. Trump ally Elon Musk has repeatedly echoed this claim, falsely claiming that Democrats have gained as many as 20 seats in the House due to illegal immigration.\nMultiple analyses have found that illegal immigration is responsible for between 0 and 1 additional Democratic representatives in the House based on the 2020 census. Additionally, at the statewide level, noncitizen arrivals have been concentrated in Republican-leaning states since 2019, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute.\nAlthough there is no single definition for a “sanctuary city,” Donald Trump is broadly referring to states or municipalities that choose not to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to arrest or detain people suspected of violating the country’s immigration laws. It’s a movement that traces its origins back to the 1980s, when churches banded together to shelter refugees fleeing violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. These religious communities offered migrants protection in open defiance of the federal government.\nTrump’s claims that these policies lead to increased crime by undocumented immigrants are central to the larger debate over whether the sanctuary movement threatens the safety of the local communities embracing it.\nResearch shows that there is no link between sanctuary policies and rising crime rates. There are numerous studies that reach the same conclusion using various types of statistical research methods. Instead, researchers find that migrants are less likely to commit crimes than their native-born counterparts.\nA 2017 study found that, across 107 U.S. cities, homicide and robbery rates tended to drop as the number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico increased, but only in sanctuary cities. One theory explaining why is that sanctuary policies allow undocumented immigrants to interact with law enforcement without fear of deportation, producing “a spiral of trust that supports police and raises informal social control over crime.”\nAt rally after rally, Donald Trump asks the crowd if they want to hear the poem “The Snake” and the audience roars. A Marshall Project analysis estimates he has read or referenced the poem at least three dozen times.\nThe poem is actually the lyrics of a song based on one of Aesop’s fables, in which a tender-hearted woman picks up a frozen snake and warms it. When it’s revived, the snake repays her kindness with a poisonous bite. She asks him why he would kill her and the snake replies, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” In a speech in South Carolina, Trump told the crowd the lyrics were pertinent in light of “people coming into our country who are going to cause tremendous problems.”\nMisinformation can come in the form of outright lies, but also in the less tangible, and more difficult to fact-check, medium of a metaphor. A 2018 academic paper analyzed Trump’s use of metaphor and found he frequently evoked the image of immigrants as animals. “He uses this metaphor to present himself as a hero, as someone who will protect you from these animals,” a study author told Frontline.\nIronically, the song was written by civil rights activist and musician Oscar Brown Jr. Brown, who wrote essays against racism, ran as a progressive candidate in Illinois and for a brief time joined the Communist Party.\nIn an interview, Brown’s daughter Africa Brown said her father was “never against immigrants” and said, “Trump is the living embodiment of the snake that my father wrote about in that song.”\nDonald Trump’s assertions that members of Hamas, ISIS and other extremist groups are entering the country as refugees to conduct acts of terrorism largely don’t hold up to reality. Historically, most perpetrators of terror attacks have been U.S.-born citizens or permanent legal residents from countries not part of the Trump administration’s “Muslim ban,” which restricted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nA 2023 Cato Institute analysis found that the annual odds of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack by a refugee is one in 3.3 billion. The likelihood of being killed in a terrorist attack by any foreigner is one in 4.3 million, and the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by an undocumented immigrant is “zero.”\nAccording to a 2015 Migration Policy Institute article examining nearly 800,000 resettled refugees since Sept. 11, 2001, only three — two Iraqi and one Uzbek — have been arrested for planning terror attacks: Two were to take place abroad, and one was “barely credible.” However, the following year, a Somali refugee in Ohio stabbed 13 people (none of whom died).\nAfter Israel’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack that killed almost 1,200 Israelis and took over 250 hostages last year, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the “same people” behind the attack in Israel were entering the U.S. through “our totally open southern border.”\nPalestinians in Gaza largely cannot escape the war outside the strip’s borders because of Israel’s land, sea and air blockade. The main U.N. agency settling Palestinian refugees does not refer them to the U.S. The number of Palestinian refugees going through other countries, and referred to the U.S. by nongovernmental organizations, is quite small and subject to rigorous vetting to identify anyone posing “security risks.” According to the State Department, fewer than 600 Palestinians have come to the U.S. as refugees in the last decade. In the 2023 fiscal year, out of more than 60,000 total refugees accepted by the U.S., only 56 were Palestinian.\nDonald Trump often repeats that undocumented immigrants put a financial burden on American taxpayers by taking advantage of public welfare benefits. “Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in 2018.\nUndocumented immigrants are able to use some public services. Undocumented children can receive public education. And the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), provides items like baby formula to low-income parents, including undocumented ones. However, fear often keeps undocumented immigrants from taking advantage of their benefits. After Trump took office, many undocumented families withdrew from WIC for fear of being detected and deported.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for many other public benefits. Undocumented people can pay into Social Security and unemployment insurance, but are unable to access them themselves.\nThis is in contrast to veterans, who have benefits like the Veterans Health Administration, the GI bill to pay for education and specialized loan assistance programs.\nA report from the Cato Institute argued that undocumented immigrants could be a net benefit to public coffers because they tend to pay more in taxes than they consume in government services.\nUndocumented people contribute to the American economy by working, earning income and paying sales, income and payroll taxes, including through automatic paycheck withholdings or by using taxpayer identification numbers instead of Social Security numbers. Again, fear and lack of information about the tax preparation process often keeps undocumented people from receiving tax credits they may otherwise qualify for.\nAccording to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in 2022 in federal, state and local taxes.\nOn the night Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, Donald Trump claimed, if given the chance, she would “allow more than 100 million illegal aliens into our country.”\nAlthough Trump says Democratic politicians like Harris support “open borders,” both Harris’ presidential platform and the Biden administration’s current policies advocate for strong border enforcement.\nSince becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has called for stricter asylum rules and vowed to prosecute drug-smuggling gangs. “The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them,” Harris said during a recent visit to the border town of Douglas, Arizona.\nIn some ways, the Biden administration carried over Trump’s immigration policies. Both administrations enforced Title 42, a pandemic-related policy allowing Border Patrol agents to turn away migrants on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.\nAfter Title 42 was lifted last May, the State Department clarified this change “does not mean the border is open.” Instead, immigration rules reverted to Title 8, which imposes harsher penalties for illegal border crossings, such as deportation and a five-year ban on reentry — consequences not enforced under Title 42.\nHowever, border crossings continued to rise and, earlier this year, President Joe Biden issued an executive order stopping the government from processing asylum requests when Border Patrol’s daily number of encounters with “removable noncitizens” averages more than 2,500 over the course of a week. Harris has pledged to reduce that limit to 1,500 per week.\nBiden’s order mandates deportation for anyone denied asylum, which exposes them to criminal charges and a long-term ban on reentering the U.S. A month after the order, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported the lowest arrest levels since September 2020, with a 32% decrease in illegal crossings.\nDonald Trump often points to the 1950s-era immigration policies of then-President Dwight Eisenhower when discussing his plans for mass deportations of migrants.\n“He moved out 1.5 million people and brought them back to where they came from,” Trump said during a 2015 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\nOperation Wetback, Eisenhower’s military-style deportation operation targeting undocumented immigrants, whose name comes from an anti-Latino slur, has been an inspiration for the former president and current presidential candidate. “We’re rounding them up in a very humane way, a very nice way,” Trump told “60 Minutes” in 2015. When asked to elaborate, he referred to deportations under the Eisenhower administration.\nBut despite Trump’s sympathetic characterization of Operation Wetback, historians widely describe it as inhumane. It’s not just that the deportations also ensnared U.S. citizens. Historian Mae Ngai wrote that, in one roundup, 88 migrants died of sunstroke. Ngai also pointed to a congressional investigation comparing conditions on a boat used for deportations to an “eighteenth century slave ship.” Many who survived the voyage were displaced to unfamiliar locations within Mexico.\nHistorians also contest the number of people deported. After the 1954 initiative, officials reported over a million migrant apprehensions and expulsions. But researcher Kelly Lytle Hernández’s review of records shows apprehensions and expulsions fell closer to 250,000. Hernández argues that the initiative’s results, much touted by officials, were “less than they were portrayed to be.”\nStill, she wrote, that “does not render the summer of 1954 meaningless” because it directed greater public attention to the United States’ ongoing push to exert increasing control over its southern border.\nDuring Donald Trump’s presidential run in 2015, he told rallygoers, “They’re taking our jobs.” At the time, the amorphous “they” were people from Mexico. And the jobs were manufacturing jobs.\nThis election cycle, Trump still says “they” are taking our jobs. This time, the meaning of “they” has evolved to encompass anyone who enters the U.S. illegally, and the jobs are what Trump has repeatedly called “Black jobs” and union jobs, reflecting two groups of potential voters the former president is courting.\nWhen Trump’s original claims surfaced, the Urban Institute noted that while immigrants were increasingly filling low-skilled, low-wage jobs here, the types of jobs were different from jobs native-born Americans did. Immigrant workers, especially those with less education, worked as maids, house cleaners, cooks and in agricultural jobs. Similar native-born workers were cashiers, sales clerks and janitors. Zooming out, a 2007 National Bureau of Economic Research study found that the last large wave of immigration led to a dip in employment for Black people at lower skill levels and, perhaps, higher incarceration rates.\nIn a September speech, Trump said that “Kamala Harris’ border invasion is also crushing the jobs and wages of African American workers and Hispanic American workers, and also union members.” It’s true that Black workers have largely had lower wages and higher unemployment rates than White workers for decades, due to discrimination and other barriers. In recent years, Black workers and all low-wage workers have seen their paychecks grow, driven by state-level boosts to minimum wage, and wage growth for Black workers from 2019 to 2023 outpaced White workers.\nWhen it comes to union jobs, until the early 2000s, modern labor and manufacturing unions were staunchly anti-immigration but flipped that stance and supported amnesty policies. A widely circulated paper from the Cato Institute found a link between increases in immigration in general — whether legal or not — and a drop in unionization.\nBuilding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has been a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s immigration policy. He argues it’s effective at curbing illegal border crossings and that Mexico can cover the construction costs.\nBut the reality of building a wall at the border is more complex and its efficacy is dubious.\nAccording to a Government Accountability Office report, from 2017 through January 2021, the Trump administration added about 450 miles of barriers along the over-1,900-mile expanse. But 81% of the new structures replaced old ones. Government officials and others “noted that the barriers led to various impacts, including to cultural resources, water sources, and endangered species, and from erosion,” the report said. Also, because of the wall, people are more likely to try to cross at more dangerous points, contributing to more injuries and deaths.\nHistorically, many undocumented immigrants have come into the country legally and overstayed their visas, something a wall wouldn’t prevent. Additionally, people have found ways of circumventing the wall with tunnels and even a hidden rail system.\nA review by The Washington Post of Customs and Border Protection records found smuggling gangs had sawed through the wall 3,272 times from 2019 to 2021, usually cutting it “with inexpensive power tools widely available at retail hardware stores.”\nThus far, despite Trump’s promises, Mexico has not covered the nearly $20-million-per-mile expense of building a border wall.\nTrump\nThe people that came in, they’re eating the cats... They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.\nFact-check\nThere is no evidence to support claims that Haitian migrants are abducting, killing or eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio.\nDuring a recent presidential debate against Kamala Harris, Donald Trump made some shocking claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio.\n“They’re eating the dogs. The people that came in,” he said. “They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame.”\nTrump’s assertions about migrants eating pets drew further attention to other claims he and his vice presidential running mate, Sen. JD Vance, made: that migrants were in the U.S. illegally and that their presence had led to an increase in both crime and communicable diseases.\nIn a statement, Springfield spokesperson Karen Graves asserted “that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.”\nIn a post on Springfield’s website, city leaders refuted claims about the city’s Haitian population committing high levels of crime or being undocumented. An August report from health officials in Clark County, where Springfield is the largest city, showed that, excluding COVID, infectious disease case counts in the county remained relatively similar to a decade ago, well before Springfield’s influx of Haitian migrants began.\nPolice body camera video purportedly showing a Haitian woman eating a cat in Springfield was ultimately determined to be an incident involving a U.S.-born American woman from Canton, Ohio, a nearly three-hour drive from Springfield. The woman was arrested on animal cruelty charges and her attorney requested she undergo a mental health evaluation. A similar story falsely claiming a Haitian migrant had captured a pair of endangered geese has also been debunked.\nSimilar tales of Haitian migrants eating cats and dogs date back to the 1980s, when it became a popular insult against Haitian American youth in places like South Florida. Haitians are not alone in being targeted with these types of rumors. Other migrant populations, including people from Asia, have been accused of using pets for food.\nKamala Harris: A more positive tone, backs tough policies\nReporters also searched for and reviewed Vice President Kamala Harris’ public statements about immigration. Since the Factba.se database is focused on presidential candidates, data for Harris was limited to the time since she became the Democratic nominee in July, resulting in far fewer statements than what was available for Trump. What statements there were, though, indicated a more positive tone toward immigration and those seeking asylum in the U.S.\n“Innocent people.” “Children who had fled incredible violence.” “Displaced.” “Dreamers.” “Families.” “Muslim brothers and sisters.” “We’re all immigrants.”\nWhile Harris frequently references her record of prosecuting transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers, she also supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants: “Let’s bring all of these folks out of the shadows into the sunlight, and be true to the value that we have as a country.”\nStill, as vice president, she has expressed what experts call the party’s toughest approach to immigration in a generation. Though these measures fall far short of Trump’s extreme proposals like mass deportations, they include increased border enforcement, raising the bar for asylum, and expanding immigrant detention centers.\nHarris also often cites a tough border security bill she supported. The bill would have increased funding for border personnel, shut loopholes related to the asylum system, reduced the ability of migrants to temporarily enter the country, and given more discretion to the president to close down the border. Trump derailed the bill, in part because its passage would “make things much better for the opposing side.”\n“Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down,” said Harris.\nThe harm of repeating the false link between immigration and crime\nEven recognizing that a statement is false becomes more difficult when someone repeatedly hears false information.\nIn what cognitive scientists call the “illusory truth effect,” the more someone hears a statement, the more likely they are to believe it. A leading explanation for the phenomenon is that repetition makes information easier to process, making it seem more truthful. A 2021 study found that even as the greatest increase in perceived truth happened when subjects heard a piece of information a second time, subjects reported perceptions of truth increased with repetition up to nine times, and didn’t decrease with further repetition.\nFalsely linking immigration and crime has resulted in real policies. These include Secure Communities, a Department of Homeland Security Program that flags immigrants in local law enforcement custody for deportation, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which delegates some immigration enforcement tasks to local law enforcement.\n“None of them delivered the increased public safety that was promised,” said Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine. “Why? Because immigrant criminality was not a problem to begin with.”\nAccording to Kubrin, this focus shifts attention and resources from other public safety concerns such as mass shootings, violence against women and crimes with broad economic impact like fraud, corporate negligence and failure in regulation.\nDiscrediting election results\nClaims about immigration and crime can also strengthen attempts to discredit the results of the 2020 general election, and potentially, the 2024 general election.\nGov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia accepted the 2020 election results while raising concerns about noncitizen voting. While campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Youngkin highlighted his state’s purging of 6,303 names recorded as noncitizens from voter rolls. Election administrators say these registrations are often the result of errors when filling out paperwork and there are no records of noncitizens casting votes, and few instances of illegal voting in general. Youngkin’s registration removals now face a federal lawsuit.\nIn Texas, the right-wing group True the Vote has led a campaign to challenge voter registrations in the state, leaving election officials to process thousands of challenges while ensuring that voters aren’t improperly removed. While most of the Texas challenges are over the residence of the voter, the group behind the challenges has stoked claims of noncitizen voting.\nTrue the Vote, and other groups have also challenged registrations in states like Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The challenges are often based on name-matching software that has known issues with data quality and usability. This comes after activists pushed Republican-led states to leave the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a partnership of state election administrators that many regarded as the most rigorous system for helping states maintain up-to-date voter rolls.\nNormalizing hardline policies\nScholars have noted the cumulative effect of scapegoating immigration. Trump’s rhetoric helped shift the window of acceptable language, and policy, toward immigrants, making controversial practices like family separation or mass deportation more palatable, Laura Finley and Luigi Esposito, sociology and criminology professors at Barry University, wrote in a 2020 article.\nIn 2018, researchers reviewed available studies on policies that limited local cooperation with immigration enforcement, often referred to as “sanctuary” policies, and found there was little evidence that linked such policies, or immigration overall, to more crime. The researchers concluded that linking immigration and crime allows xenophobia and racism to be expressed under a “color-blind” concept of “rule-of-law.”\nPolls show more Americans favor fewer immigrants and more restrictions on immigration. A July Gallup poll found that 55% of respondents wanted a decrease in immigration. The poll, which has asked about immigration levels since 1965, has not found such a high level of those who wanted decreased immigration in nearly two decades. Other 2024 polls also show support for tougher border measures and that many Americans find immigration to be a key problem facing the country.\nThe same poll shows broad support for tougher immigration measures. A majority of those polled support temporarily halting migrants from seeking asylum at the Southwest border, hiring more border patrol agents and expanding walls at that border. Nearly half support deporting all immigrants in the country illegally. Despite this, large majorities also supported some path to citizenship for those in the country without authorization. Support for the restrictive measures rose from five years ago while support for pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants fell.\nPolling also shows support for tougher state immigration policy. An August poll found 63% of polled Arizona voters supported Proposition 314, a ballot measure before voters in the November 2024 election. The measure would make crossing the border with Mexico outside ports of entry a state crime, allowing state and local police to arrest migrants for the new crime.\nThe effects of repeating a lie\nBeyond Trump, there is a growing partisan divide around the way politicians talk about immigrants. In a 2022 article published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers describe how they analyzed over 200,000 U.S. congressional speeches and 5,000 presidential communications on immigration since the late 1800s. While there has been a general trend toward more positive language on immigration, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to use words like “crime,” “legality” and “threat” and to use dehumanizing language, the researchers found.\nPoliticians across parties and nations continue to reap rewards by blaming immigrants for social problems. “Politicians, from far-right populists to centrist liberals, use anti-immigrant narratives to deflect attention from deeper systematic issues such as affordable housing shortages, economic inequalities and failing public services,” Yvonne Su, director of the Centre for Refugee Studies at York University, wrote last month.\nFor Alex Piquero, a University of Miami criminology professor and former director of the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the body of research is “absolutely clear” that immigrants are not responsible for increases in crime.\nBut beliefs to the contrary are persistent. “What we have here is a mismatch between what the data show and what the political rhetoric says,“ Piquero said.\nTrump seems confident in the power of repetition. “I could get elected twice over the wall,” he said in a speech at CPAC in 2020. That didn’t happen that year. Will it happen in November?\nThis story was updated to omit the minimum number that some claims are repeated.\nCredits\nREPORTING AND WRITING\nAnna Flagg, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Geoff Hing\nFACT CHECKS\nAala Abdullahi, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Rachel Dissell, Daphne Duret, Shannon Heffernan, Ghazala Irshad, Jamiles Lartey, Doug Livingston, Ilica Mahajan, Ana Graciela Méndez, Joseph Neff, Aaron Sankin, Chris Vazquez\nDATA ANALYSIS\nRobert Flagg, Anna Flagg\nAUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT\nAshley Dye, Chris Vazquez, Kristin Bausch\nCOPY EDITING\nKelsey Adams, Lauren Hardie, Ghazala Irshad\nTRANSLATION\nAna Graciela Méndez, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón\nVIDEO EDITING\nAlex Gilwit, Celina Fang, Anna Flagg\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nAndrew Rodriguez Calderón\nPRODUCTION COORDINATION\nMara Corbett, Ruth Baldwin\nPARTNERSHIPS\nTerri Troncale, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón\nEDITING\nDavid Eads, Aaron Sankin, Susan Chira\nDISTRIBUTION PARTNERS\nDocumentedNY\nSpecial thanks to Moiz Syed for contributing design.\nLearn about how The Marshall Project is covering the 2024 election’s criminal justice and immigration issues across the U.S. and in our local news teams’ cities.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Mitt Romney expressed support ... for an immigration program that places large numbers of illegal residents on the path toward citizenship ... Romney said illegal immigrants should have a chance to obtain citizenship.” (Evan Lehmann, “Romney Supports Immigration Program, But Not Granting ‘Amnesty’,” The Lowell Sun, 3/30/06)\nFLOP: “[I] think I’m best off to describe my own positions. And my positions, I think I’ve just described for you – secure the border, employment verification and no special pathway to citizenship. I feel that’s the course we ought to take.” (CNN’s “The Situation Room,” 5/22/07)\n2) On George W. Bush's Tax-Cuts\nFLIP: “[R]omney spoke at the 10th annual legislative conference organized by U.S. Rep. Martin T. Meehan (D-Lowell) and met with the Massachusetts delegation. ... Congressional sources said that a point of contention arose when Romney refused to take a position on Bush’s massive, 10-year tax cut plan.” (Noelle Straub, “Romney Talks Policy With Bush Staffers, Mass.

Mitt probably agreed with you at one time or another.\nFLIP: \"I think the global warming debate is now pretty much over and people recognize the need associated with providing sources which do not generate the heat that is currently provided by fossil fuels ...” (Jack Coleman, “Massachusetts Governor Urges Use Of Alternative Energy,” Cape Cod Times, 3/14/03)\n“I concur that climate change is beginning to [have an] effect on our natural resources and that now is the time to take action ...” (“Romney OK With Plan On Emissions,” Boston Herald, 7/24/03)\nFLOP: “I have to tell you with regards to global warming that that’s something, which, you’re right, the scientists haven’t entirely resolved, but no question about one thing, it’s getting warmer, and a lot of good reasons for us to use less energy, to use it more efficiently and to develop sources here in this country that could allow us to be more independent of foreign sources.” (CNBC’s “Kudlow & Company,” 2/7/07)\n“Unfortunately, some in the Republican Party are embracing the radical environmental ideas of the liberal left. As governor, I found that thoughtful environmentalism need not be anti-growth and anti-jobs. But Kyoto-style sweeping mandates, imposed unilaterally in the United States, would kill jobs, depress growth and shift manufacturing to the dirtiest developing nations. Republicans should never abandon pro-growth conservative principles in an effort to embrace the ideas of Al Gore.” (Romney For President, Press Release, 2/23/07)\n7) Don't Ask Don't Tell? Don't Ask Mitt Romney\nFLIP: In 1994 “[Romney] called President Bill Clinton’s ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ military policy ‘the first of a number of steps that will ultimately lead to gays and lesbians being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation’s military.’” (Dan Balz and Shailagh Murray, “Mass. Governor’s Rightward Shift Raises Questions,” The Washington Post, 12/21/06)\nFLOP: “[Romney] defended his policy switch on gays in the military. He said when he first heard the phrase ‘don’t ask, don’t tell,’ he thought it was ‘kind of a silly phrase that didn’t make a lot of sense.’ But the last 10 years have convinced him that the policy is working and there is no reason to change it, he said.” (Alexa Aguilar, “Romney Campaigns In Chicago,” Chicago Tribune, 4/12/07)\n8) Has your position on same-sex marriage changed? So has Mitt Romney's.\nFLIP: When a 2002 Constitutional Amendment was proposed to ban same-sex marriage, Romney opposed it. “Romney’s family members signed the petition to put it on the ballot ‘without reading the fine print,’ [Romney aide Eric] Fehrnstrom said, but he has no reason to believe they do not support it. ‘Mitt did not know they signed it, and Mitt does not support it,’ he said. ‘As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it’s unnecessary.’” (Rick Klein, “Romney Kin Signed Petition To Ban Same-Sex Marriage,” The Boston Globe, 3/22/02)\nFLOP: “Just two weeks before lawmakers resume a Constitutional Convention to vote on a proposed ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage, Gov. Mitt Romney will stand with the supporters of the measure to call on the Legislature to back it. Romney will join petition backers in a State House press event today to urge the Legislature to pass the Protection of Marriage Amendment when the Constitutional Convention reconvenes July 12, authorizing a 2008 ballot question asking voters to define marriage as between one man and one woman.” (Kimberly Atkins and Kate Gibson, “Mitt Joining Supporters Of Anti-Gay Wed Initiative,” Boston Herald, 6/28/06)\n9) On embryonic stem cell research, Romney's still developing a fully-formed position.\nFLIP: “Speaking at a bioethics forum, GOP gubernatorial hopeful Mitt Romney yesterday endorsed embryonic stem cell research ... [Romney] endorsed embryonic stem cell research, saying the controversial science might one day help treat his wife’s multiple sclerosis in addition to numerous other degenerative diseases. ... Romney spoke extensively about his position on stem cell research, which also involves embryo destruction.” (Raja Mishra, “Romney Endorses Stem Cell Research, Is Silent On Cloning,” The Boston Globe, 6/14/02)\nFLOP: ...On Feb. 10, 2005 ... Romney came out strongly against the cloning technique ... He vowed to press for legislation to criminalize the work. Romney’s opposition stunned scientists, lawmakers, and observers because of his past statements endorsing, at least in general terms, embryonic stem cell research.” (Scott Helman, “Romney’s Journey To The Right,” The Boston Globe, 12/17/06)\n10) Favorite Book? Well, that depends.\nFLIP: FOX NEWS’ MARTHA MCCALLUM: And an interesting response to his favorite novel. ROMNEY: “Actually the one by L. Ron Hubbard, I hate to think ... I’m not in favor of his religion by any means, but he wrote a book called ‘Battlefield Earth’ that was a very fun science fiction book.” (Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” 4/30/07)\nFLOP (Maybe just a hedge): \"Asked about his comments during a Fox News interview Monday that L. Ron Hubbard’s 'Battlefield Earth' is his favorite novel, Romney said Huckleberry Finn is his favorite fiction and that the book by Hubbard, who founded Scientology, is his favorite science fiction reading.” (Mary Anne Ostrom, “Education Should Determine Immigrants’ Legal Status, Mitt Romney Says,” The [San Jose, CA] Mercury News, 5/1/07)\n11) His Own Health-Care Initiative. He's Not Sure About That Either.\nFLIP: \"In a Colonial-era hall, with a fife-and-drum corps marching in with him, Gov. Mitt Romney (R) signed a bill Wednesday requiring all Massachusetts residents to purchase health insurance -- portraying the measure as a historic solution to health-care costs, even as questions emerge about whether the state can afford it. The signing [was] staged with a near-presidential attention to theatrics and slogan-bearing banners...” (David A. Fahrenthold, “Mass. Marks Health-Care Milestone,” The Washington Post, 4/13/06)\nFLOP: \"As governor of Massachusetts he signed a bipartisan law intended to ensure that every resident has coverage. Romney touted it as an innovative free-market solution. Yet these days, Romney ... is much more likely to present his state’s universal coverage law as not a model to copy but an example for other states to learn from. He’s now a critic of his own biggest achievement.” (Sean Higgins, “Ex-Gov. Romney Keeps Distance From His Own Mass. Health Plan,” Investor’s Business Daily, 3/7/07)\n12) Tax Pledges are beneath Romney, until the presidency was in front of him.\nFLIP: “Four years ago, Mitt Romney broke with GOP tradition and refused to sign the [Americans for Tax Reform] pledge [to ‘oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes’].” (Lisa Wangsness, “Healey Will Sign Antitax Pledge,” The Boston Globe, 9/4/06)\n“Romney’s Gubernatorial Campaign Spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, Dismissed Such Pledges At The Time As ‘Government By Gimmickry.’” (Scott Helman, “Romney Finds ‘No New Taxes’ Promise Suits Him After All,” The Boston Globe, 1/5/07)\nFLOP: “Almost five years after he refused to sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge during his campaign for governor, Mitt Romney announced ... that he had done just that, as his campaign for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination began in earnest.” (Scott Helman, “Romney Finds ‘No New Taxes’ Promise Suits Him After All,” The Boston Globe, 1/5/07)\n13) Money in politics? Sometimes its good, sometimes it is bad.\nFLIP: “Romney also said he advocates spending limits on congressional elections, even suggesting that the current race against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy should have a $6 million spending cap.” (Frank Phillips, “Romney, Vowing To Live It, Touts Congress Reform Plan,” The Boston Globe, 7/27/94)\n\"[Mitt Romney] once touted dramatic restructuring measures such as taxing political contributions and placing spending limits on federal campaigns.” (Alexander Bolton, “Romney’s About-Face On Campaign Funding,” The Hill, 2/8/07)\nFLOP: “Romney noted his foe from Arizona wrote the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law that restricts certain types of contributions. ‘That’s a terrible piece of legislation,’ Romney said. ‘It hasn’t taken the money out of politics. ... (But) it has hurt my party.’” (Lee Bandy, “Romney Targeting McCain,” The State, 2/4/07)\n14) NOW THE BIG ONE: During his 1994 Senate Run, Mitt Romney argued that he was more pro-choice than Ted Kennedy\nFLIP: “When Kennedy called him ‘multiple choice,’ Romney demanded an extra rebuttal. He revealed that a close relative died of an illegal abortion years ago and said, ‘Since that time, my mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter, and you will not see me wavering on that.’” (Joan Vennochi, “Romney’s Revolving World,” The Boston Globe, 3/2/06)\n14) (continued) When he went to conservative Utah, that tune changed.\nFLOP: “When I am asked if I am pro-choice or pro-life, I say I refuse to accept either label.” (Glen Warchol, “This Is The Place, But Politics May Lead Romneys Elsewhere,” The Salt Lake Tribune, 2/14/99)\n14 (continued) But I'm running for office in Massachusetts again, so I'm pro-choice again\nFLIP: “I will preserve and protect a woman’s right to choose, and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard. I will not change any provisions of Massachusetts’ pro-choice laws.” (2002 Romney-O’Brien Gubernatorial Debate, Suffolk University, Boston, MA, 10/29/02)\nIn 2002, Romney Offered His Completed NARAL Questionnaire, Filled Out With “Mostly Abortion-Rights Positions,” To The Media Even Before Returning It To NARAL. “Yesterday, Romney also aimed to head off confusion about his stance on abortion rights by answering a Mass National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League questionnaire with mostly abortion-rights positions. He offered the questionnaire to the press even before he returned it to MassNARAL...”\n14 (continued) FLOP: Then he started thinking of national office as a Republican. ANd he happened to have a revelation\nFLOP: \"Romney said he had a change of heart on the issue after speaking with a stem-cell researcher, Dr. Douglas Melton. Romney claims Melton said ‘Look, you don’t have to think about this stem cell research as a moral issue, because we kill the embryos after 14 days.’\n‘It hit me very hard that we had so cheapened the value of human life in a Roe v. Wade environment that it was important to stand for the dignity of human life,’ Romney says.” (Karen Tumulty, “What Romney Believes,” Time, 5/21/07)\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Mitt Romney’s Biggest Flip Flops\nIs GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney “a strong believer in stating your position and not wavering,” as he once bragged?

Bain bled companies dry.\nRomney devised methods of pulling cash out of companies that Bain either bought or invested in, usually to the detriment of the workforce. He slashed costs, fired workers, shipped jobs overseas and halted investment and modernization. It didn’t matter to him if a company failed because Romney won either way.\nAs a politician, Romney has been inconsistent on every issue but one: cheap labor. And that’s a big reason he attracts the backing of David Koch and 33 billionaires from the Forbes billionaire list. His policies would expand the reservoir of cheap labor available to billionaires.\nAmerica needs a vibrant middle class for our economy to work. America does not need a cheap-labor conservative in the White House—one who doesn’t understand that prosperity depends on many people making things and many people buying them.\nIf Mitt Romney wins, American workers lose.\nPrivate Equity\nRomney’s career as a vampire capitalist left a trail of empty factories and bankrupt enterprises. One in five of Bain’s investments under Romney went bankrupt or liquidated within nine years.\nBetween 1987 and 1995, Bain made $587 million from five businesses and all five eventually went bankrupt.\nIn 1992, Bain bought a hanging file folder company in Indiana called SCM. On July 5, 1994, security guards surrounded the building and told all 258 union workers they were fired. They were told they could reapply for their jobs at lower wages. Some did. Eventually the workers went on strike, and Bain closed the plant. It’s against the law, but Bain got away with it.\nIn 1993, Bain purchased a Kansas City steel mill, GS Industries, and drove it into bankruptcy. Bain partners did just fine, making $50 million. But more than 700 workers lost their jobs, their health insurance, their severance pay and some of their pension benefits. Then taxpayers picked up the tab for the company’s underfunded pension plan.\nIn 1994, Bain led a group of investors to buy Dade International, a medical technology firm in Miami. They fired close to 2,000 workers and loaded the company with debt—while taking hefty management fees, of course. Dade went bankrupt within eight years.\nRomney: Outsourcing Pioneer\nWhile at Bain, Romney was as happy to plunder the taxpayer as he was to loot the companies he bought. He relentlessly sniffed out tax breaks, subsidies and bailouts even as he stashed his money in a Swiss bank account. Meanwhile, Bain set up 138 offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands.\nRomney’s indifference to the American worker was also evident in his willingness to buy companies that sent jobs overseas.\nThe Washington Post reported that in 1993 Bain bought a portion of Corporate Software Inc., which outsourced customer support services for high-tech companies like Microsoft. A few years later, the company began setting up call centers overseas. It merged with another company and continued to offshore call centers. By 1998, the company spun off Modus Media, with Bain as its biggest shareholder.\nRomney’s campaign tried to suppress the Washington Post story that described Modus Media as specializing in helping companies send manufacturing jobs overseas. According to the Post, it produced software and training products in Australia for Microsoft. It also did packaging and assembly overseas for companies such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Computer Corp.\nCompanies like Modus Media are the reason manufacturing employment in the U.S. computer industry was actually lower in 2010 than it was in 1975.\nEtch A Sketch\nRomney the presidential candidate sounds much different than Romney the vampire capitalist. At a metalworking factory in Cincinnati in June, he told the crowd, “For me it’s all about good jobs for the American people and a bright and prosperous future.”\nThat was not Mitt Romney’s first flip-flop and it was far from the last. Romney changes positions the way a traffic light changes color. His lack of principles, along with his passion for cheap labor, may be the only things that stayed constant about him.\nRomney launched his political career in 1994. Though it was unclear that he was a resident of Massachusetts, he challenged U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy for re-election. He lost, but not before taking positions at odds with his current self-identification as a conservative.\nTo win votes in deep-blue Massachusetts, he portrayed himself as a social moderate on issues such as health care, reproductive rights and immigration. Back then, he said, “I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years we should sustain and support it.”\nHe’s changed his tune since then. “Roe v. Wade has gone too far,” he said during his campaign for president in 2007.\nRomney told the Log Cabin Republicans that he'd be better than Ted Kennedy on gay rights. In 2002, he passed out a flyer in Boston’s gay community saying “Mitt and Kerry wish you a great Pride Weekend! All citizens deserve equal rights, regardless of their sexual preference.” (Kerry is Kerry Healey, his lieutenant governor.)\nSix years later, Romney donated $10,000 to the anti-gay National Organization for Marriage.\nCandidate Romney said in 1994, “I don’t line up with the NRA.” Today, he’s a lifetime member of the NRA. In 2007 he said he supported the assault weapons ban. Months later, he said he didn’t support any gun control legislation. He even told a gun story that changed within a week. On January 10, 2007, he claimed to own a gun. Four days later, he said he didn’t.\nRomney’s memory is equally tricky when it comes to his military service—or lack thereof. In 1994, he told the Boston Herald, “It was not my desire to go off and serve in Vietnam.” Fourteen years later, during a presidential debate, he remembered differently. “I longed in many respects to actually be in Vietnam and be representing our country there,” he said.\nThe list goes on and on. In 1996, Romney called the flat tax a “tax cut for fat cats.” In 2011, Romney said “I love a flat tax.” During a debate in 2008, he said, “I like mandates. The mandates work.” Two years later he told the Manchester Union Leader, “I think it’s unconstitutional on the 10th Amendment front.” He’s done a complete 180 on a capital gains tax cut. “I believe the tax on capital gains should be zero” became “It’s a tax cut for fat cats.”\nRomney’s spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, recently shrugged off his boss’s chameleon-like personality. “Everything changes,” Fehrnstrom told CNN. “It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.”\nGovernor of Massachusetts\nOne thing Romney can’t shake up is his record as governor of Massachusetts. As the state’s chief executive from 2002-06, he systematically tried to lower working families’ standard of living. The results in Massachusetts were the same as they were for the companies that Bain exploited: less prosperity for broad groups of workers.\nMassachusetts ranked 47th among the 50 states in job creation during Romney’s tenure in office. Though the national rate of job growth was over 5 percent, Massachusetts lagged far behind at 0.9 percent. A Northeastern University economist found that Massachusetts was behind on every economic indicator while Romney was in office.\nHe raised taxes, vetoed an increase in the minimum wage and presided over anemic job creation. He tried to weaken workers’ rights. He vetoed a card check bill as well as a measure that would have prevented state vendors from sending work overseas. He tried to prevent union members from becoming managers in state government and to exempt public construction projects from the prevailing wage law.\nHis first budget as governor included $240 million in fee increases. He raised the cost of ice skating, registering a boat, taking the bar exam, hauling hazardous waste and many other activities.\nBillionaire Buddies\nRomney panders to super-rich donors who want to impoverish and exploit America’s middle class.\nHe embraces the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates of corporate cash into the political system. In one of his most repeated comments, he told a voter, “Corporations are people, my friend.”\nBillionaire David Koch hosted one of Mitt Romney's first fundraisers for his 2012 campaign and recently held another at $50,000 a head. One protester’s sign read, “I don’t mind you being rich, I mind you buying the government.”\nDozens of billionaires are backing Romney’s bid for the presidency. They pledged to contribute $1 billion to put him in the White House. They may come up with even more, due to the largesse of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Karl Rove’s American Crossroads and the Koch brothers. The Kochs, in fact, pledged to spend $400 million on this election cycle, more than John McCain spent in his entire presidential campaign.\nThe billionaires expect a big payback on their investment. If Romney does as promised he’ll gut environmental regulations, repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and slash corporate tax rates. He would divert untold billions from the U.S. Treasury into the wallets of the 1 percent. The Wal-Mart heirs alone would save $32.7 billion if a President Romney eliminates the estate tax, as he has promised.\nWorkers would not receive the kind of loving treatment that Romney plans to lavish on his rich buddies. He supports right-to-work-for-less and opposes the Employee Free Choice Act. He wants to weaken unions by making automatic paycheck deductions of dues illegal. And he strongly supports privatization of government functions.\nAs a businessman and as a politician, Mitt Romney has ruthlessly exploited working Americans for his own enrichment. His legacy is one of prosperity for himself and hardship for workers. As president, no one should expect any different.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

He emphasized that his top priority, during his final year, is delivering economic security and opportunity to all New Jerseyans and building a stronger and fairer state for all.\nLeaders from across the state offered praise for the Governor’s vision for his final year in office:\nLegislative Leadership:\nSenate President Nick Scutari:\n“I look forward to working with the Governor to build upon the progress we have made in making the lives of New Jersey’s residents more affordable and improving the quality of life in communities throughout the state.\n“We need to maintain our commitment to job creation, public safety, affordable housing, educational excellence, strategic investments that promote economic growth, and services that care for the most vulnerable. We also have to continue to be a national leader in protecting a woman’s right to choose.\n“I will keep an open mind on the Governor’s proposals and work with my legislative colleagues to address the needs and priorities of the people of New Jersey.”\nAssembly Speaker Craig Coughlin:\n“I am proud of the progress we’ve made to keep New Jersey an affordable place to live while meeting our obligations and making prudent investments for the future. From our continued efforts to provide property tax relief and fund programs to help New Jersey families, we have made real strides in improving the quality of life for everyone in New Jersey.\n“As the Governor acknowledged, we face challenges ahead, but thanks to sound fiscal management we have been able to improve our credit rating, pay down our debt, and fully fund our schools and the state pension system – achievements that reflect our commitment to responsible governance. We’ve also managed to cut taxes and avoid taking on new debt. I applaud the Governor for these actions, and support his efforts to address tax fairness.\n“While belt-tightening may be necessary, we cannot abandon our commitment to making New Jersey more affordable for the 9.3 million people that call it home. That is why property tax relief remains our highest priority. We will continue to fund the ANCHOR program and are moving forward with the launch of StayNJ – ensuring property tax relief for seniors while building on the affordability initiatives we have already championed.\n“We also made New Jersey a safer place to live. I stand with the Governor in extending gratitude to the law enforcement agencies and social justice organizations who, through coordinated efforts, led New Jersey to a record low number of shootings and car thefts this past year. Our shared vision for a safer, more affordable New Jersey is becoming a reality and together through our partnership with the Senate and the Governor, we will continue to build on the momentum we have created.”\nOn Expanding Paid Family Leave for State Workers:\nFormer Senate President Steve Sweeney:\n“As a dad to a daughter with special needs, I know the challenges that come with balancing raising children and working full-time.\n“As Senate President, I was proud to partner with @GovMurphy on the expansion of paid family leave so working families of New Jersey can thrive.”\nCenter for WorkLife Law Co-Director Liz Morris:\n“The adoption of paid family leave for state workers would help address the maternal health crisis, protect the health and wellbeing of babies, and have positive ripple effects across the state. In addition to the health benefits, when employees have access to paid family leave they are more likely to return to work and to be more productive when they do.”\nCenter for WorkLife Law Co-Director Jessica Lee:\n“When working class parents don’t get 100% of their salary covered under a paid family leave program, they can’t afford to take the leave they need. Governor Murphy’s common-sense proposal would close the leave affordability gap for state workers and serve as an example for employers across the state and the country.”\nNew Jersey Citizen Actions Workplace Justice Program Director Yarrow Willman-Cole:\n\"We’re pleased Governor Murphy is focusing his attention on paid leave. The action taken by the state acknowledges the connection between paid leave and how equitable access can improve the health of birthing people and contribute to lower maternal mortality rates.\n“Paid leave helps prevent workers and their families from experiencing financial instability, and full pay is crucial, especially for lower-income workers. Many employers, including New Jersey Citizen Action, have implemented this practice of making workers' salaries whole while they are on leave, and we hope this move by the state leads the way for more employers to adopt a similar policy to create a fairer and healthier workforce.\n“As New Jersey moves forward with this modest expansion of benefits for state workers, we urge the Governor and Legislature to work together to strengthen job protections when taking leave for all New Jerseyans, so that no family has to risk job loss when they need to care for a new child or ill loved one. Since all workers pay into the state’s paid family leave program, it is essential that these benefits are equitable and accessible for everyone.”\nNew Jersey Policy Perspective President Nicole Rodriguez:\n“Parental leave is important for child development, mother’s recovery, and so much more. Very encouraging to hear @GovMurphy support in providing full wages while state workers are on leave. #njsots”\nNational Partnership for Women & Families:\n“Today, @GovMurphy announced New Jersey will begin providing 12 weeks fully paid parental leave to state employees! #PaidLeave not only improves maternal health outcomes, it also boosts economic outcomes for bother individuals and employers. Congratulations New Jerseyans!”\nCWA District 1 Vice-President Dennis Trainor\n“CWA appreciates Governor Murphy and the First Lady’s support of family friendly policies like full pay for parental leave and hybrid work schedules for State Workers. These types of initiatives are lower-cost, common sense ways that allow parents to spend important quality-time bonding with newborns without having to make the difficult choice of losing pay or going back to work.”\nState Troopers Fraternal Association President Wayne Blanchard:\n“The STFA applauds the initiative and leadership of @GovMurphy and @FirstLadyNJ for their continued vigilant and unwavering support of New Jersey’s state employee working families through the proposed implementation of a fully paid Parental Leave program. This program will empower workers seeking to start or grow their families by relieving the massive hardship of temporary lost wages during an exciting but extremely stressful time. No longer will any state workers be forced to choose between their paychecks and family planning. As this program comes to fruition, we hope to see it embraced across New Jersey to encompass all workers in every sector.”\nOn Expanding Free, Universal Pre-K and Requiring Free, Full-Day Kindergarten Statewide:\nSenate Majority Leader M. Teresa Ruiz:\n“I want to commend Governor Murphy for his commitment to helping New Jersey’s children and families thrive. His dedication to laying a strong foundation for their future success is evident in the strides we’ve made together in expanding access to preschool and childcare, one of the most impactful investments we can make in our communities. Continuing to invest in and expand early childhood programs in the next year will be vital to the long-term success of our state,”\nSenator Vin Gopal:\n“Kindergarten is a fundamental part of a child's educational foundation, and it is unacceptable that eight school districts in New Jersey still fail to offer this critical program. As Senate Education Chairman, I stand with @govmurphy in calling for changes to state funding.”\nAssemblyman Sterley Stanley:\n“One of our most significant accomplishments, which I am proud to have been a part of, has been the incredible strides we have made expanding free pre-k for New Jersey’s families. Which is why I am incredibly proud to join with my colleague Asw.Katz in putting forth this bill that will ensure that every child is provided with early childhood education so we can minimize any barrier that may stand between children and their ability to flourish into incredible individuals. I look forward to seeing this bill passed and signed into law so that we can bear witness to the extraordinary individuals the children of our State will become with this law protecting their right to education at such a critical time for their development.“\nAssemblywoman Andrea Katz:\n“This is the issue that brought me into the political arena. I wanted to ensure that every kid in New Jersey had access to a great public education.I’m proud to work towards permanent pre-k funding because it just makes sense for New Jersey families and taxpayers.”\nNJEA President Sean Spiller:\n“As he enters the final year of his governorship, Gov. Phil Murphy has made it clear that he plans to sprint to the finish line. We are encouraged by his determination to build on past successes in strengthening our schools, protecting our environment, upholding our democracy and making our state more affordable for the families that call New Jersey home.\n“His call to bring full-day kindergarten to every district in New Jersey and to continue making pre-K opportunities available to more students in more communities will pay dividends for decades to come. Dollars invested today in education – especially early education – are repaid many times over in a stronger future economy. New Jersey must continue to be a national leader in all aspects of public education, from preschool through college, and getting a strong early foundation will help us achieve that.\n“We also applaud Gov. Murphy for highlighting the concerns that so many educators and parents have about the detrimental effects of cellphones in classrooms. As New Jersey moves to limit the distraction that they pose during the school day, we call on the New Jersey Department of Education to issue guidelines directing districts to work with parents and educators in each community and at each school level to determine what specific policy will best serve students’ academic, safety and mental health needs. Shared input and community buy-in will help ensure the success of those policies better than any one-size-fits-all ban imposed from above.\n“We also commend Gov. Murphy for his ongoing commitment to funding our pensions. As the first governor in this century to achieve full funding, he has put New Jersey on the road to fiscal responsibility. We look forward to building on that progress by once again making New Jersey’s pension system a tool to attract and retain the dedicated professionals who will keep our schools the best in the nation.\n“During the coming year, we look forward to working alongside Gov. Murphy and the Legislature to achieve the goals he spoke about today. We also look forward to electing our endorsed candidate, Sean Spiller as New Jersey’s next governor, so he can build on that progress and help New Jersey achieve even greater heights.”\nOn Banning Cell Phone Use in K-12 Classrooms and Supporting Phone-Free Schools:\nSenator Paul Moriarty:\n“I am grateful to Governor Murphy for recognizing the importance of Bill S-3695 in addressing the growing concerns surrounding student use of cell phones and social media platforms during school hours. This bill empowers school districts to develop comprehensive policies to ensure students remain focused on their education while safeguarding their well-being.\n“Unrestricted cellphone use in our schools has become a crisis that disrupts learning and negatively affects the mental health of students. Technology plays an integral role in our daily lives, but when misused, it can distract from learning and pose serious risks to students' mental and emotional health. “We are taking a proactive step toward fostering a safer and more productive learning environment by providing schools with the tools they need to create balanced policies.\n“This bill reflects our commitment to maintaining the integrity of the educational experience while adapting to the challenges of the digital age. I look forward to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to address these priorities.”\nSenator Vin Gopal:\n“I strongly support the cell phone restriction policy emphasized by @GovMurphy in today’s State of the State Address. It’s time to end the harmful impacts of cell phones on students’ mental health, focus, and social skills.”\nAssemblyman Cody Miller:\n“I’m honored to work alongside Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie, Assemblywoman Carmen Morales, and my colleague and friend, Senator Paul Moriarty, who represents the 4th Legislative District with Assemblyman Dan Hutchison and me, on this common-sense initiative. This legislation is designed to create a more focused learning environment, reduce distractions, and combat issues like cyberbullying in schools. Ensuring our students have the best opportunity to succeed in the classroom is always a top priority.”\nAssemblywoman Rosy Bagolie:\n“As a superintendent and as a principal, I know that cell phone and social media usage is rampant in our schools, to the detriment of students’ academic experiences. Hopefully thanks to Bill A4882/S3695, which Governor Murphy referenced during his State of the State address, students in New Jersey will be able to put down their phones, focus more on the material in the class, and become better learners.”\nNYU-Stern Professor Author Jonathan Haidt:\nBravo @GovMurphy in leading NJ toward phone-free schools! Getting phones out of class time, and then out of the school day, will help New Jersey's students learn and its teachers teach.\nOn Supporting Pubic Contracting Reforms that Will Create New Economic Opportunities for Family-Owned and Minority-Owned Businesses:\nSenator Nilsa Cruz-Perez:\n\"Minority-and women-owned businesses deserve a level playing field, but have too long been unfairly overlooked by government when awarding public contracts. Over months of consultation with our state's business community, we have developed a comprehensive and multi-faceted legislative package to truly tackle the inequities that have been exposed in public contracting, and bring equal opportunity to all of our state's businesses.\"\nAssemblywoman Shavonda E. Sumter:\n\"The findings of the New Jersey Disparity Study revealed undeniable inequities, but history will judge us not by the challenges we identified, but by the decisive actions we take to address them. Last year’s release of the Disparity Study was a pivotal moment, exposing the structural barriers that have marginalized communities for far too long. These findings are not just data points; they reflect the lives of real people who deserve equitable opportunities and meaningful change.\"\nAssemblyman Benjie E. Wimberly:\n“The disparity study was more than a report – it was a call to action for all of us to reimagine what fairness and opportunity should look like in New Jersey. While the report’s findings paint a clear picture of the challenges we face, we must not - and will not - sit idly and dwell on how we got here. Instead, we must focus on solutions, taking decisive steps to address these inequities and pave the way for a fairer, more inclusive future.”\nAssemblyman Sterley Stanley:\n“The disparity study revealed that minority- and women-owned businesses have faced significant hurdles in obtaining public contracts, and that’s unacceptable. We have taken important steps to right that wrong, working with stakeholders, our fellow legislators, and government representatives, to create pathways for all businesses to succeed in today’s marketplace and to ensure that New Jersey’s public contracting opportunities reflect the diversity of our communities.”\nOn Raising the Minimum Wage\nCongressman Donald Norcross:\n“New Jersey is leading the way on increasing the minimum wage and ensuring workers are fairly compensated. Laws that support working families help ensure people receive a fair day's pay for a hard day's work.”\n32BJ SEIU New Jersey State Director Ana Maria Hill:\n“Thank you @GovMurphy for putting working families first and doubling the minimum wage since you took office. We are in a better place because of your leadership!”\nOn Expanding Access to Affordable Housing and Lowering Housing Costs\nSenator Troy Singleton:\n“Undoubtedly, housing affordability is the most important issue facing New Jersey’s families, and I am heartened by Governor Murphy’s emphasis on housing related initiatives in this year’s State of the State address. Last spring, I was proud to champion the landmark affordable housing law that will enable thousands of new, affordable homes to be built across the state. When combined with the specific, tangible reforms the Governor outlined today – expansion of accessory dwelling units, conversion of vacant and commercial property into housing, and creation of more transit-oriented development – we will continue to meet our housing goals, while also reigniting our local economies and revitalizing our communities.\n“Together, these proposals will give municipalities even more tools to meet their affordable housing obligations while cutting needless and outdated bureaucratic rules that have for too long locked families out of communities and out of homeownership. I applaud the Governor’s recognition of this issue and his commitment to tackling it head-on.\n“Making housing more affordable must be the foundation of our public policy, because without a safe, secure, and affordable home, none of our other policies can be as effective. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Legislature as well as Governor Murphy over the coming months on these proposals.”\nNew Jersey Builders Association Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kolakowski:\n“On behalf of the residential homebuilding industry, I commend the Governor on encouraging the Legislature to take additional steps to support New Jersey’s housing ecosystem following the historic passage of A4 (the affordable housing law).\n“New Jersey has the fastest growing population in the Northeast but suffers from a significant housing shortage that prevents even middle-income New Jerseyans from being able to afford housing. By modernizing our zoning and permitting we can ensure we are using our limited land in a responsible manner that will enable our State to meet demand and lower costs for New Jerseyans. We look forward to working with the Administration and Legislature to modernize our inefficient and inequitable land use laws.”\nFair Share Housing Center Executive Director Adam Gordon:\n“We applaud Governor Murphy for his focus on advancing affordable housing in New Jersey, on the heels of landmark legislation enacted last year to streamline and strengthen enforcement of the Mount Laurel Doctrine. The shortage of affordable housing in New Jersey hurts everyone, especially low-income families and people of color. While the state’s new affordable housing law is a crucial step forward, much more needs to be done.\n“The proposals Gov. Murphy announced today — such as reforming the state’s zoning and permitting laws to create thousands of new affordable homes — are important steps forward.”\n“We applaud the Murphy Administration for their efforts to invest in affordable homes throughout our communities. Since last year’s State of the State Address, Governor Murphy signed landmark legislation into law that empowers the NJ Department of Community Affairs with the authority to facilitate the development of more affordable homes across NJ. Governor Murphy also signed the Community Wealth Preservation Program into law, a tool communities can use to ensure that foreclosed homes stay in the hands of community members, not private equity. We also saw the enactment of legislation to combat racial bias in home appraisals, another step toward closing the racial wealth gap.\nThe Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey President and Chief Executive Officer Staci Berger:\n“Today’s message about zoning reform goals is a positive one and we look forward to working with the Administration, Senator Troy Singleton and legislative leaders on these reforms. As housing costs continue to spiral, NJ must continue its important work to rectify the racial wealth gap and the housing crisis with the policies and programs needed to foster homeownership among Black and Brown families.\n“This effort includes not only implementing policies like the new affordable housing law or the initiative to address racial bias in property appraisals, but also protecting and expanding the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Program, a significant funding source for community developers seeking to build affordable homes in their neighborhoods. The Network and its membership of over 275 nonprofit organizations look forward to continuing our work with the Murphy Administration, Senate President Scutari, Assembly Speaker Coughlin, and all our state legislators in expanding these efforts to HouseNJ so that all individuals in our state live in decent, affordable homes in safe, healthy neighborhoods.”\nAARP New Jersey State Director Chris Widelo:\n“I applaud Governor Murphy for announcing action on several of AARP New Jersey’s priorities in his 2025 State of the State Address, including significant property tax relief, reforming our state’s zoning and permitting laws to allow for more affordable housing options, launching RetireReady NJ, and addressing pedestrian safety. These important actions will empower older New Jerseyans to choose how they live as they age.\n“Seventy-seven percent of people 50 and older want to age in their own homes; however, New Jersey’s high cost of living, including the highest property taxes in the nation, has made it unaffordable for far too many. We applaud the Governor for supporting and highlighting the ANCHOR tax credit. We look forward to working with the Governor and the Legislature to fully fund STAY NJ in the FY ’26 state budget and bring this critical property tax relief to our older residents.\n“In addition to property tax relief, AARP New Jersey applauds the Governor’s proposal to reform our state’s zoning and permitting laws to allow for new housing, particularly accessory dwelling units which provide affordable, accessible housing for people of all ages. According to AARP’s 2021 Home and Community Preferences Survey, most respondents would consider building an ADU to provide a home for a loved one in need of care.\n“We applaud the Governor for making a full payment into the state’s pension system for the fourth year in a row. This payment will significantly strengthen the financial health of New Jersey’s pension system, which is critical to the retirement security of hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans and their families.\n“AARP New Jersey is pleased that the launch of RetireReady NJ, which is a public-private partnership that allows private-sector workers an affordable, voluntary and portable retirement savings program at work, was highlighted. Financial security in retirement is crucial to helping people remain in their homes and communities and is a core component of our mission to enhance the quality of life for all as we age, including for generations to come.\n“AARP New Jersey commends the Governor’s proposal to overhaul New Jersey’s ten most dangerous intersections in order to keep families safe and prevent avoidable tragedies. This along with updating driver education programs to focus on cyclist and pedestrian safety will help create safer streets for older New Jerseyans to use.\n“While we were pleased to hear the Governor announce expanded parental leave, AARP New Jersey encourages expanding the program to include caring for a loved one of any age. We look forward to working with him and the legislature to ensure all public workers and their families benefit from this needed expansion.\n“AARP New Jersey thanks the Governor for supporting real change to help our more than one million Garden State members and all older New Jerseyans age in place. We look forward to working with the Governor and the entire New Jersey Legislature in the coming year.”\nOn Road Safety and Pedestrian Safety Reforms:\nAssemblyman David Bailey:\n“I want to thank Governor Murphy for recognizing the importance of this legislation. In rural districts like ours people are often forced to walk, run, and bike along narrow roads with no bike lanes, a reality I know all too well as an avid cyclist. There have been several tragic accidents in Salem County this past year that could have been avoided had drivers followed their obligation to share the road. Better education on these laws will save lives.”\nAssemblywoman Lisa Swain:\n\"As a longtime triathlete, I’ve faced my share of dangerous close calls with vehicles on the road and have been fortunate to emerge with only minor injuries. New Jersey must prioritize reducing dangerous accidents and creating safer roads for everyone—drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike. My bill, A4765, advances essential reforms to strengthen driver education and enhance protections for all who share our streets. Alongside Governor Murphy and my colleagues in the legislature, we are reducing accidents and building a safer, more inclusive transportation network across our state.\"\nAssemblywoman Heather Simmons:\n“I am grateful to Governor Murphy for recognizing A4765 in his State of the State address. This bill is vital for the Third District, where rural roads can pose unique safety challenges for pedestrians and cyclists. The tragic loss of brothers Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau in Salem County last fall underscores the urgent need to improve driver education and roadway safety, making this legislation a top priority for our community.”\nMetuchen Mayor Jonathan Busch:\n“I applaud this decisive action to establish the New Jersey Target Zero Commission. The goal of eliminating all traffic-related fatalities by 2040 is ambitious yet essential. In Metuchen, we are steadfast in our efforts to enhance pedestrian safety, and we deeply value the alignment between our local initiatives and the leadership shown by the Governor and our State legislative delegation. Their work will help us advance our shared commitment to protecting lives and fostering safe, walkable communities.”\nClinton Mayor Janice Kovach:\n“As leaders, we have a responsibility to prioritize the safety of our communities. Governor Murphy’s legislation creating the Target Zero Commission is a crucial step toward eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries in New Jersey. By bringing together experts and stakeholders, we can create safer streets and ensure that every resident can travel without fear. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to building a safer, more sustainable future for all.”\nPaulsboro Mayor John Giovannitti:\n\"I wholeheartedly support the Governor's unwavering commitment to road and pedestrian safety. The establishment of the Target Zero Commission marks a pivotal moment in our collective efforts to eliminate fatal and serious injuries on our roads. By prioritizing the safety of all drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists, we are paving the way for a safer and more secure future for everyone in New Jersey.”\nCollingswood Borough Mayor Jim Maley:\n“We desperately need a focus on pedestrians. It seems since the pandemic drivers are paying less attention to the usual signage and warnings. We need to change our infrastructure to protect pedestrians.”\nHamilton Mayor Jeff Martin:\n\"I want to express my gratitude to Governor Murphy for leading this critical pedestrian safety initiative and to the Legislature for establishing the 'Net Zero Commission. In 2024, Hamilton, like so many communities across the country, faced a tragic record of pedestrian fatalities. Each of these incidents represents a preventable loss, leaving a profound impact on families and loved ones. This initiative is a vital step toward preventing such tragedies and ensuring safer streets for everyone in the future.\"\nMorristown Mayor Tim Dougherty:\n“The establishment of the 'New Jersey Target Zero Commission' is a critical step in our state’s ongoing commitment to making our roads safer for everyone. This initiative reflects our collective responsibility to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries, while also ensuring that more road users can travel without incident. I applaud the passage of this bill, which paves the way for a safer transportation future for all New Jersey residents.”\nPrinceton Mayor Mark Freda:\n“Princeton supports this effort to increase the focus on, and to develop actions, that will help achieve the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Locally we are working on better protecting pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as making vehicle travel safer on our roads and sidewalks.”\nAtlantic Highlands Mayor Lori Hohenleitner:\n“I applaud Governor Murphy’s Pedestrian Safety Initiative introduced in today’s State of the State. As mayor of a municipality that offers public transportation stops placed along a busy state highway, safe pedestrian access is of the utmost importance. We have a strong relationship with the Department of Transportation and the Governor’s office and look forward to partnering with them on this vital project.”\nEast Brunswick Mayor Brad Cohen:\nI want to thank the Governor for signing legislation aimed at improving pedestrian and road safety. As our densely populated state continues to see families choose New Jersey to raise their families, we have an obligation to keep folks safe on our roads. Whether it is distracted driving or inattentive pedestrians, this bill will help establish goals and provide initiatives to eliminate traffic related fatalities.\nHighland Park Borough Mayor Elsie Foster:\n“Traffic safety is a critical issue that affects every community. By prioritizing the study and implementation of effective safety measures, the Target Zero Commission will make it easier for towns to design and build safer streets for all users. In Highland Park, we remain steadfast in our efforts to enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety and ensure that all residents and visitors can navigate our roads without fear.\n“I am proud to support this initiative and look forward to collaborating with state and local partners to achieve the ambitious but necessary goal of zero traffic-related fatalities.”\nSomerville Mayor Brian Gallagher:\n“Like many communities across New Jersey, Somerville is faced with increasing pedestrian safety challenges. Being the seat of Somerset County government and home to a major health care facility, Somerville’s population doubles in size every day. Somerville is a pedestrian oriented community with a walking school district with numerous public and private schools, park trails that cross many roads, and a destination downtown that has a state highway as its main road. The goal of enhancing that safety is a win, and Somerville looks forward to increased safety for our residents and visitors.”\nNew Jersey Future:\n“Landmark affordable housing legislation was the start. We need tools for towns to develop housing in communities that are walk & bike-friendly. We’re happy @govmurphy intends to advance statewide zoning reforms for more housing to be built in the right places & ways.”\nOn Introducing Mobile Driver’s Licenses:\nSenator Patrick Diegan:\n“Under current state law, motorists are permitted to carry and display an electronic version of their registration and insurance cards. Making that same option available to residents for their driver’s licenses by taking advantage of emerging technologies is a logical next step. Any law we can implement to make life more convenient for citizens looking to securely update their licenses and conduct other business makes good sense.”\nOn Making New Jersey’s Tax System Stronger and Fairer by Reforming the Farmland Assessment Act:\nSenator Joseph Pennacchio:\n\"New Jersey citizens deserve to know that our State's Farmland Assessment Program is operating in a fair and transparent manner. Working with the Governor's Office we hope to accomplish that.\"\nOn Defending Reproductive Rights and Expanding Access to Fundamental Health Care:\nAttorney General Matt Platkin:\n“As @GovMurphy said today, “when it comes to protecting fundamental rights, we will not give an inch.\" #NewJersey has and will continue to lead the way in safeguarding reproductive rights, no matter what is occurring on the national stage.”\nSenate Majority Leader M. Teresa Ruiz:\n“Amid an ever-changing and often uncertain national landscape, we have remained unwavering in our defense of women’s rights. This is at the heart of who we are, and New Jersey will continue to lead the way in protecting and advancing reproductive healthcare and bodily autonomy. We are committed to ensuring that every individual — regardless of where they live or their personal circumstances — has access to the care they deserve, and that their rights are safeguarded,”\nAssemblywoman Lisa Swain:\n\"Here in New Jersey, women have a fundamental right to their own privacy, their own bodies, their own lifestyles, and their own futures. A4654 supports those rights by making critical expansions in access to family planning, reproductive health, and early infancy care by removing financial barriers to care. While states across the country take steps to reduce or eliminate access to life-saving reproductive healthcare services, in New Jersey we are prioritizing, upholding and bolstering the fundamental liberties that we have worked so hard to protect and preserve.\"\nAssemblywoman Shanique Speight:\n“Every New Jersey resident deserves to have access to safe, affordable, and equitable reproductive care – it’s fundamental. The progress we've been able to make – to enshrine these rights in law – reflect the power of our collaboration and shared commitment. Together we will continue to protect these rights for all who call New Jersey home.”\nNew Jersey Family Planning League President & CEO Rachel Baum:\n“We applaud the Governor’s unwavering commitment to continuing to protect and advance reproductive rights in New Jersey. In a time when access to reproductive healthcare is under attack in many parts of the country, New Jersey continues to lead the way by prioritizing accessibility, equity, and autonomy. By stockpiling essential medications and supplies necessary for reproductive health and abortion care, the state is taking proactive measures to ensure these critical resources remain available regardless of external pressures or political challenges. We look forward to working in partnership with the Murphy Administration to ensure all New Jerseyans have access to safe and effective reproductive health care services and supplies.\n“In addition, the decision to eliminate cost-sharing for reproductive health services further underscores the state’s dedication to breaking down barriers and ensuring that every individual—regardless of income, background, or circumstances—has access to the care they need. This initiative is not just about preserving critical rights - it is about creating a system where those rights can be exercised fully and equitably. We appreciate the commitment of the Murphy Administration and the Legislature to set a powerful example for the nation, reaffirming that reproductive health is essential healthcare and access to it is a fundamental aspect of individual freedom in this State.”\nCherry Hill Women’s Center Director of Public Affairs Roxanne Sutocky:\n\"As abortion providers serving southern New Jersey for nearly 50 years, Cherry Hill Women's Center extends our gratitude to Governor Phil Murphy for his unwavering commitment to sexual and reproductive healthcare and maternal health, as highlighted in today’s State of the State address. At a time when access to essential health services is under threat across the country—threats deeply tied to the ongoing maternal mortality and morbidity crisis—we are proud to do this critical work in a state that strives to be a safe haven for pregnant and parenting individuals. We understand abortion access as an issue of racial and economic justice. Policies like removing out-of-pocket costs for abortion and stockpiling abortion care medications are vital to ensuring care remains affordable and accessible to all. We are also encouraged by the administration’s efforts to strengthen New Jersey's economy and support families’ economic security, including the extension of paid parental leave—especially as the majority of those we care for are parents. We are grateful for leaders like Governor Murphy, Senate Majority Leader Ruiz, Assemblywoman Speight, and Assemblywoman Swain, who are proactive in safeguarding the rights, health, and access of all individuals. We look forward to continuing our work to ensure equitable, compassionate care for every community.\"\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund Vice President of Public Affairs New Jersey Kaitlyn Wojtowicz:\n“Following Gov. Phil Murphy’s second-to-last State of the State address, we express our deep gratitude for his steadfast commitment to reproductive health and rights, including his efforts to ensure access to abortion and birth control in the state.\n“As our country prepares to reckon with an anti-reproductive freedom federal administration, we warn legislators not to rest on their laurels and urge the New Jersey Legislature to act swiftly to ensure the state’s commitment to reproductive health remains unwavering.\n“The Reproductive Freedom and Health Equity Bill Package includes key provisions aimed at expanding access to reproductive health services, ensuring comprehensive care for all New Jerseyans, and providing protections against potential federal rollbacks of reproductive rights.\n“The legislation is an essential step in securing the future of reproductive freedom in New Jersey, particularly as challenges to reproductive health rights continue to grow nationwide.”\nACLU of New Jersey Executive Director Amol Sinha:\n“New Jersey must be a safe haven for reproductive freedom. Grateful that @GovMurphy is supporting abortion access for all and that he will be stockpiling mifepristone for those who need it. When the federal government won’t protect our rights, New Jersey must lead. #njsots”\nACLU of New Jersey Policy Director Sarah Fajardo:\n“In his State of the State address today, Gov. Murphy showed that New Jersey has expanded civil rights and liberties under his leadership, and there is more to be done in his final year as governor. By modernizing the state’s parole system, New Jersey will advance justice, promote public safety, and recognize positive conduct. For too long, people have been unnecessarily disrupted in their efforts to rebuild their lives due to technical violations. With these changes, and his commitment to granting categorical clemency for even more people, Gov. Murphy will continue to add to our state’s long and transformational history of decarceration. We hope he continues to further reduce New Jersey's prison population throughout the rest of his term.\n“As states across the country rollback access to abortion, New Jersey will instead begin stockpiling mifepristone and advancing policies to remove out-of-pocket costs for abortion care – both necessary steps to protecting and expanding reproductive freedom. At the same time, government leaders must also prioritize legislation that will strengthen immigrants’ rights, especially as President-elect Trump has promised mass deportations as a top priority of his administration. New Jersey must embrace its chance to be a national leader on every front, and that means adopting a comprehensive approach to advance and defend civil rights – not prioritizing one goal at the expense of another or waiting until it’s politically expedient.\n“New Jersey has a powerful history of crafting ambitious public policy to build a better future. As the country braces for Trump’s next term, our state can and must do more to protect all New Jerseyans. We will continue to work with Gov. Murphy and lawmakers at every opportunity to do exactly that.”\nGarden State Equality Executive Director Christian Fuscarino:\n“As we brace for the challenges ahead, I'm so grateful for Governor Murphy centering New Jersey values during his State of the State address. New Jersey has stood steadfast in protecting human rights and freedoms, becoming a beacon of hope and equality across the country.\n“As @GovMurphy said, we all have a shared responsibility to safeguard the dignity of every person, no matter who they love, where they come from, or how they worship—these are our values because we're from Jersey, baby!”\nOn Codifying New Jersey’s Clean Energy Standard:\nAssemblyman Robert Karabinchak:\n“The transition to clean energy is not only essential for the health of our planet, but it also creates new opportunities for sustainable economic growth. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) are a critical tool in accelerating this transition, ensuring a future where energy is both affordable and environmentally responsible. I commend Governor Murphy for making clean energy a top priority in New Jersey. His leadership in pushing for a cleaner, more sustainable energy future is inspiring. As we approach the final year of his term, I look forward to continuing our work together to expand clean energy solutions, support innovation, and make lasting environmental progress for the state. “\nNew Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club Director Anjuli Ramos-Busot:\n“We thank Governor Murphy for ensuring 100 percent clean electricity is a part of his and New Jersey’s environmental and energy legacy. This standard is one of the most ambitious energy targets in the nation, and secures our state’s position as an environmental leader. Transitioning to clean energy is not only beneficial to the environment, but it will also provide good, high paying union jobs to New Jerseyans, secure our state’s energy independence, and clean our air. The NJ Sierra Club is eager to see the legislature swiftly codify this necessary goal.”\nNew Jersey LCV Executive Director Ed Potosnak:\n“We know that clean energy costs less than dirty oil and gas, and Governor Murphy’s plan to enshrine these goals in law will allow children with asthma and seniors with heart disease to breathe easier – even as we create thousands of jobs here in New Jersey.”\nNew Jersey Clean Coalition:\n“In his State of the State Address, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy doubled down on the Administration’s commitment to clean energy. We commend Gov. Murphy for his continued leadership in advancing bold and transformative clean energy goals in the final months of his term, cementing both his legacy and New Jersey’s as a clean energy leader in the U.S.”\n“Under Gov. Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey is prioritizing jobs and affordability by advancing clean energy production. By Executive Order, New Jersey has one of the most ambitious standards in the country, aiming for 100% clean energy generation by 2035. Codifying this goal is the next step to ensuring New Jersey’s energy security,” the statement continued. “Today, Gov. Murphy called on the Legislature to advance legislation to establish a clean energy standard by law. We commend Gov. Murphy for his leadership on this issue and are committed to working with the Administration and the Legislature to advance legislation to protect New Jersey’s clean energy future.”\nReThink Energy NJ:\n“Grateful to @GovMurphy for prioritizing #cleanenergy in his final year. Codifying NJ’s 100% clean energy goal by 2035 is critical for combating #climatechange and ensuring a livable future for all. #NJSOTS”\nNew Jersey Sustainable Business Council:\n“@GovMurphy’s #StateoftheState underscores his commitment to pushing NJ forward in #sustainability! With bold goals like 100% #cleanenergy by 2035, we must work together to codify this vision and secure a healthy, bright future for all.#NJSOTS”\nTri-State Transportation Campaign:\n“Today, @GovMurphycalled for bold legislation to establish NJ’s 100% clean energy goal by law. As we approach the Gov’s final year in office, we must double down to secure NJ’s energy future. Together, we can ensure NJ remains a national leader in clean, affordable energy!”\nOn Expanding Voting Rights by Allowing 16 and 17-Year-Olds to Vote in Local School Board Elections:\nSenator Raj Mukherji:\n“Governor Murphy's State of the State address underscores the bold leadership and forward-thinking vision that New Jersey needs as we continue to build a more inclusive, resilient, and prosperous future for all Garden State residents. The Governor's commitment to take bold steps that strengthen our democracy — making same-day voter registration a reality and enfranchising 16- and 17-year-olds in school board elections as numerous other jurisdictions have done successfully — is what our state needs to empower our young people and ensure we hear every voice. We are building a more inclusive and engaged future for all. I look forward to working alongside Governor Murphy and my fellow legislators to turn these goals into lasting progress for our communities.”\nOn Reforming Penalties for Technical Parole Violations:\nReturning Citizens Support Group Executive Director Edwin Ortiz:\n“The Returning Citizens Support Group support Governor Murphy’s initiative to reform the handling of technical parole violations. We believe that no individual on parole should be sent back to prison for a technical violation unless a new crime has been committed. Technical violations—such as leaving the state without prior permission, testing positive for substance use, failing to report a change of address, or being unable to pay court-imposed fines or penalties—should not result in incarceration. These actions do not pose a direct threat to public safety but instead highlight systemic issues such as economic hardship, substance use disorders, or a lack of access to resources.”\nNew Jersey Institute for Social Justice:\n“First, we agree that ensuring the economic security of New Jersey families must be a priority, and we hope to see deep investments in closing the racial wealth gap and ensuring that our most economically vulnerable families have the resources they need to thrive.\n“Governor Murphy is correct—public officials “all bear a responsibility to correct the failures and injustices of the past.” That is why we launched the New Jersey Reparations Council. The Council's mission is to finally confront and repair New Jersey’s deep and often overlooked involvement in slavery and its lasting impact on the contemporary life of Black people in our state.\n“We also appreciate Governor Murphy’s focus on affordable housing and expanding housing supply to reduce housing costs in the state, but policy and program design must be well-targeted. Despite his focus on property tax relief, we know that the greatest benefits of StayNJ will go to the wealthiest families in our state.\n“Finally, we believe Governor Murphy is right in calling for much-needed parole violation reform. Thousands of New Jerseyans are faced with seemingly insurmountable barriers to successful reentry, and the arbitrary rules surrounding parole make the journey to reintegration that much harder.”\nNew Jersey Policy Perspective Senior Policy Analyst Marleina Ubel:\n“This announcement marks a critical step toward building a more equitable and effective justice system in New Jersey. By reducing the number of individuals re-incarcerated for technical violations, this policy would address a key driver of unnecessary incarceration, promote stability for individuals reentering their communities, and improve government efficiency by significantly reducing the number of people entering the New Jersey Department of Corrections.\n“We look forward to hearing how this policy would extend relief to the over 1,000 people currently incarcerated for such violations. We commend the governor’s leadership in advancing this reform, which reflects a commitment to justice, fairness, and second chances.”\n4 C’s Coalition/Friendship Baptist Church Pastor John Taylor:\n“It was a privilege to attend the State of the State Address, where Governor Murphy outlined several important initiatives aimed at advancing justice and equity. Among the key topics discussed were clemency, addressing technical parole violations, and the release of the disparity study highlighting the allocation of investments to Black, Women, and minority-owned businesses. The Governor urged the legislature to pass his bill package to address these inequities and promote greater economic inclusion. These initiatives reflect a thoughtful approach to reform, and I appreciate the Governor’s continued commitment to promoting fairness and opportunity for all New Jersey residents. Thank you, Governor Murphy, for your leadership on these critical issues.”\nCommunities in Cooperation Pastor Pamela Jones:\n“Thank you, Governor Phil Murphy, for your insightful State of the State Address. The proposed bill to reduce penalties for certain parole violations is a significant step toward providing rehabilitative support rather than punitive measures.\n“As Martin Luther King Jr. stated, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.’ This legislation embodies that principle by fostering a more equitable and compassionate justice system.”\nPrinceton Policy Founding Director Udi Ofer:\n“Sending a person to prison for a technical violation of parole, which is not a crime, is often a grave injustice that doesn't make society safer. Thank you, Governor Murphy, for supporting these smart reforms to the parole system.”\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        February 5, 2019 • By Steve Wamhoff\nA recent headline tells us that bold tax plans proposed by lawmakers today reflect a “profound shift in public mood.” But, in fact, the public’s mood has not changed at all. Americans have long wanted progressive taxes but few, if any, lawmakers publicly backed this view. What’s happening now isn’t a shift in public opinion, rather it’s Washington finally catching up with the American people.\nProgressive tax proposals are finally being discussed with the urgency and seriousness they deserve. Following Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s call for a much higher marginal tax rate for multi-millionaires and Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to introduce a wealth tax for those at the very top, Sen. Bernie Sanders has introduced a revised version of his proposal to reform the federal estate tax.\nJanuary 8, 2019 • By Steve Wamhoff\nThe uproar deliberately steers clear of any real policy discussion about what a significantly higher marginal tax rate would mean. Her critics are mostly the same lawmakers who enacted a massive tax cut for the rich last year that was not debated seriously or supported by serious research. Meanwhile, multiple scholarly studies conclude a 70 percent top tax rate would be an optimal way to tax the very rich. Ocasio-Cortez has brought more attention to the very real need to raise revenue and do it in a progressive way.\nDecember 17, 2018 • By Richard Phillips\nWhile it has only been a year since passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), it’s clear the law largely is both a debacle and a boondoggle. Below are the five takeaways about the legacy and continuing effect of the TCJA. 1. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will substantially increase income, wealth, and racial inequality. 2. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will continue to substantially increase the deficit. 3. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not significantly boosting growth or jobs. 4. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act continues to be very unpopular. 5. Despite…\nDecember 12, 2018 • By ITEP Staff\nOutgoing Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) today introduced legislation that includes $80 billion in tax cuts that are unpaid for and largely benefit the wealthy. The bill would, among its numerous provisions, expand retirement and education savings programs that offer very little value to low-income families, delay the Health Insurance Tax for an additional two years, and delay the Medical Device Tax for an additional five years.\nNovember 8, 2018 • By Richard Phillips\nWith most of the results of the 2018 midterm elections in, the broad landscape for federal tax policy over the next couple years is coming into view. Democratic control of the House and Republican control of the Senate means a significant tax overhaul is unlikely, but minor tax changes may happen. And the run-up to the 2020 presidential election will force more robust debate over the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and what aspects of the legislation should be repealed, reformed, or built upon.\nOctober 24, 2018 • By Aidan Davis\nA new federal proposal, the Livable Incomes for Families Today (LIFT) the Middle Class Act, would create a new refundable tax credit for low- and middle-income working families who were little more than an afterthought in last year’s federal tax overhaul. This proposal would take the place of TCJA, providing tax cuts similar in cost to the recent federal tax law but targeted toward working people rather than the wealthy. ITEP analyzed the bill, proposed by California Senator Kamala Harris, and compared its potential impact to TCJA.\nOctober 23, 2018 • By Steve Wamhoff\nConversations about economics often take place on different planets, it seems. Economists and analysts note rising inequality in America. And it’s not just lefty analysts. The credit ratings firm Moody’s chimed in earlier this month, warning that inequality “is a key social consideration that will impact the U.S.’ credit profile through multiple rating factors, including economic, institutional and fiscal strength.”\nSeptember 12, 2018 • By ITEP Staff\nThroughout President’s Trump’s presidential campaign and from his first day in office until now, his administration has favored and promoted policies that benefit the wealthy and corporations even as it claims to be the working people’s champion. If more recent economic data are a reflection of what we’ll see in the long-term due to the Trump Administration’s recent tax cuts, wealth will continue to accrue at the top while income remains stagnant or barely budges for low- and moderate-income families. Policy can make a difference: ITEP Staff shows how the Grow American Incomes Now (GAIN) Act would help millions of…\nAugust 10, 2018 • By ITEP Staff\nThe idea behind the new tax break is to provide an incentive for wealthy individuals to invest in the economies of struggling communities. Despite alleged intentions, it appears opportunity zones are turning into yet another windfall for wealthy investors and may encourage displacement of people in low-income areas, working against the provision’s intended goal.\nAugust 1, 2018 • By Richard Phillips\nFor true believers in supply-side economics, however, one major flaw of the TCJA is that it did not further cut taxes for the wealthy by reducing capital gains tax rates. But now the Trump Administration is considering using executive action to remedy this by indexing capital gains to inflation for tax purposes.\nJuly 11, 2018 • By Richard Phillips\nNow, new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco finds that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may not be so much of a stimulus after all. In other words, lawmakers have left themselves with few options should the country face an economic recession, and the country may not receive a substantive economic benefit in the short term.\nJune 6, 2018 • By Richard Phillips\nOne simple rule should drive the nation’s international tax policies: tax the offshore profits of American companies the same way their domestic profits are taxed. The latest legislation to approach that ideal is the Per-Country Minimum Act (H.R. 6015), from Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR). The DeFazio bill closes the loophole that allows corporations to use foreign tax credits to shelter profits in tax havens from U.S. taxes. No other bill addresses this.\nNew Jersey’s new governor, Phil Murphy campaigned on a promise to raise state income taxes on millionaires, a proposal that is supported by 70 percent of the state and was, until recently, backed by New Jersey’s Senate President, Steve Sweeney. In recent months, Sweeney changed his position on the proposed millionaires tax and called for an increase in New Jersey’s corporate tax instead. The idea of hiking taxes on corporations is not a bad one, particularly since corporations received a windfall from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But Sweeney’s new opposition to an income tax hike for the state’s…\nMay 15, 2018 • By Steve Wamhoff\nThe House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) Wednesday. Proponents of the law likely will use the occasion to tout its alleged economic benefits and argue that its temporary provisions should be made permanent. The title of the hearing is “Growing Our Economy and Creating Jobs,” but there is little evidence that the law does either of these things.\nMay 10, 2018 • By Steve Wamhoff\nThe Trump Administration is pushing to add or strengthen work requirements for programs that benefit low- and middle-income people but holds a different view when it comes to the wealthy. Most tax cuts enjoyed by the richest 1 percent of households under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Job Act (TCJA) are tax cuts for unearned income.\nMay 2, 2018 • By Steve Wamhoff\nThe United Kingdom’s parliament has enacted a new law requiring its overseas territories — which include notorious tax havens like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands — to start disclosing by 2020 the owners of corporations they register. This could shut down a huge amount of offshore tax evasion and other financial crimes because individuals from anywhere in the world, including the United States. have long been able to set up secret corporations in these tax havens to stash their money.\nApril 27, 2018 • By ITEP Staff, Jenice Robinson, Misha Hill\nIn 2017, the Trump Administration released a budget proposal filled with loaded language about “welfare reform” and moving able-bodied people from welfare to work. This narrative is designed to perpetuate the pernicious idea that poor people have personal shortcomings and are taking something that rightly belongs to others.\nApril 19, 2018 • By Steve Wamhoff\nPresident Trump and his allies in Congress have made many wild claims about economic growth that would result from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And the Congressional Budget Office just released a report revealing the TCJA will, in fact, create economic growth — for foreign investors.\nApril 10, 2018 • By Steve Wamhoff\nA new ITEP report estimates the impacts in every state of the much-discussed idea of extending the temporary provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will expire after 2025 without further action from Congress. The report concludes that extending or making permanent these provisions would be just as skewed to the wealthy as the original law.\nApril 5, 2018 • By Ronald Mak\nHouse leaders are preparing a vote on a balanced budget amendment next week that could force massive spending cuts and restrict the ability of lawmakers to raise revenue. Although a balanced budget amendment will likely be pitched as a way to address our nation’s long-term fiscal challenges, such proposals are economically harmful, ineffective, and one-sided.\nMarch 23, 2018 • By Dacey Anechiarico\nDue to its rushed passage in a matter of weeks, without public hearings or enough time even for basic proofreading, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) contains numerous unintended consequences that Congress is now scrambling to fix. The authors of the new law have openly admitted that the law includes major mistakes. One of the most prominent drafting errors is what is now known as the “grain glitch,” which temporarily created a huge incentive for farmers to sell their products to cooperatives over businesses taking other forms.\nThe Heritage Foundation, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) routinely disagree on a wide range of policy issues, but a recent Ways and Means Tax Policy Subcommittee hearing revealed they all agree that the continual and unpaid-for extension of temporary tax breaks needs to end.\nFebruary 23, 2018 • By Ronald Mak\nWhen Republican leaders rushed through an overhaul to the federal tax code over a seven-week legislative period, they failed to acknowledge that many provisions in their bill would have negative consequences for states. One such provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that undermines state laws is the expansion of federal tax breaks that now allows taxpayers to use 529 savings plans to pay for private K-12 education.\nFebruary 15, 2018 • By Matthew Gardner\nWhen President Trump released the initial outline of his tax reform plan in April, carried interest repeal was nowhere to be found. And when Congress hammered out a tax plan in late December, lawmakers agreed to reduce the cost of the carried interest tax provision by about 5 percent. (Full repeal would have raised $20 billion over a decade; the enacted provision raises about $1 billion.)\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Medal of Freedom\n\"The Presidential Medal of Freedom is not just our nation's highest civilian honor—it's a tribute to the idea that all of us, no matter where we come from, have the opportunity to change this country for the better.

A member of the Democratic Party, Coons served as the county executive of New Castle County from 2005 to 2010.\nRaised in Hockessin, Delaware, Coons graduated from Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He received graduate degrees from Yale Divinity School and Yale Law School. He went to work as a volunteer relief worker in Kenya, where he had taken classes at the University of Nairobi, later returning to the U.S. to work for the Coalition for the Homeless in New York. He spent some time as a legal clerk in New York before returning to Delaware in 1996, where he spent eight years as in-house counsel for a materials manufacturing company. In the interim he worked for several nonprofit organizations.\nCoons served as president of the New Castle County Council from 2001 to 2005 and county executive of New Castle County from 2005 to 2010. He balanced the county budget with a surplus in fiscal year 2010 by cutting spending and raising taxes, and the county maintained a AAA bond rating. Coons contested the 2010 Senate special election for Delaware. He defeated the Republican nominee, Christine O'Donnell, to succeed Ted Kaufman, who had been appointed to the seat when Joe Biden resigned to become Vice President of the United States. He was elected to a full term in 2014. Coons is the vice chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, having chaired the committee from 2021 to 2025. His other committee assignments include Appropriations, Foreign Relations, Judiciary, and Small Business and Entrepreneurship. He previously served as ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts.[1]\nCoons co-chaired the 2017 and 2019 National Prayer Breakfasts and co-chairs the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast.[2] The New York Times called him an \"effective\" emissary of Joe Biden to former and current Republican lawmakers in Biden's 2020 campaign for president.[3]\nCoons became Delaware's senior senator and the dean of Delaware's congressional delegation when Tom Carper retired from the Senate in January 2025.[4]\nEarly life and education\n[edit]Coons was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the son of Sarah Louise \"Sally\" (née Ives) and Kenelm Winslow \"Ken\" Coons. His ancestry includes English and Irish.[5] Coons grew up in Hockessin, Delaware, where he attended the public Yorklyn Elementary School and later H.B. DuPont Middle School. His parents struggled financially and divorced in the mid-1970s. He and his two brothers lived with their mother for a few years until 1977, when his mother married Robert W. Gore, the President of W. L. Gore and Associates.[6]\nHe graduated from the private Tower Hill School and then Amherst College in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry and political science. While in college, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Sigma chapter) and a U.S. Senate intern. In 1983, Coons was awarded a Truman Scholarship. During his junior year of college, he studied abroad at the University of Nairobi in Kenya through St. Lawrence University's Kenya Semester Program.[7] In 1992, he earned a master's degree in ethics from Yale Divinity School and a J.D. degree from Yale Law School.[8] In 2018, Delaware State University named Coons as an Honorary Doctor in Humane Letters.\nProfessional career\n[edit]After college, Coons worked in Washington, D.C., for the Investor Responsibility Research Center, where he wrote a book on South Africa and the U.S. divestment movement. He then worked as a volunteer for the South African Council of Churches and as a relief worker in Kenya, before returning to the U.S. to work for the National Coalition for the Homeless in New York. In 1992, he earned a J.D. degree from Yale Law School, and a master's degree in ethics from Yale Divinity School.[9]\nCoons clerked for Judge Jane Richards Roth on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and then worked for the National \"I Have a Dream\" Foundation in New York.[10] After returning to Delaware in 1996, Coons began his eight-year career as in-house counsel for W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Newark, Delaware-based makers of Gore-Tex fabrics and other high-tech materials. There he was responsible for the ethics training program, federal government relations, e-commerce legal work, and for general commercial contracting.[11]\nHe has also worked for several nonprofits, including the Coalition for the Homeless, the education-oriented \"I Have a Dream\" Foundation, and the South African Council of Churches. Coons has served on several boards including First State Innovation, the Bear/Glasgow Boys & Girls Club, and the Delaware College of Art & Design.\nCoons is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[12]\nEarly political career\n[edit]Coons first became involved in politics working on behalf of Republican politicians. As a 17-year-old, in 1980, he independently campaigned for Ronald Reagan's presidential run. He also worked on Bill Roth's U.S. Senate campaign in 1982.[13] During college, he switched from being a Republican to a Democrat and in 1988, Coons became the issues director for the U.S. Senate campaign of Democratic Delaware Lt. Gov. Shien Biau Woo.[10][13] He was a delegate from Wilmington to the 1996 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He also interned in the Senate office of Joe Biden, whose seat he would later hold in the Senate.[14][15]\nCoons was first elected to office in 2000, as president of the New Castle County Council. He served four years before being elected county executive in 2004. He was the New Castle County Democratic Party's endorsed candidate in 2008 and re-nominated by the party on September 9, 2008. Coons was reelected on November 4, 2008, unopposed in the general election. In his six years in office as county executive, Coons balanced the budget with a surplus in fiscal year 2010 by cutting spending and raising taxes.[16] As New Castle county executive, Coons raised taxes despite having campaigned on a promise not to increase them.[17] New Castle County maintained a AAA bond rating throughout his tenure.[18]\nU.S. Senate\n[edit]Elections\n[edit]2010\n[edit]Coons ran in the 2010 special election for the U.S. Senate seat then held by Democrat Ted Kaufman, who was appointed after Joe Biden resigned to take office as vice president. Kaufman had been appointed as a placeholder, and did not run in the special election.[19] Coons was unopposed in the Democratic primary, and expected to face Republican Congressman and former Governor Mike Castle in the general election. Coons was considered a decided underdog due to Castle's moderate profile and longstanding popularity in the state, but the dynamics of the race significantly altered when Christine O'Donnell, a Tea Party Republican who had lost to Biden in 2008 and who was strongly opposed by the GOP establishment, upset Castle in the Republican primary.[20][21]\nIn the first post-primary polls, Rasmussen Reports showed Coons with a double-digit lead over O'Donnell, describing this as a \"remarkable turnaround\" given that the race had leaned Republican before O'Donnell's primary victory.[22] In the first week of October, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll showed Coons with a 17-point lead, 53%–36%, over O'Donnell, and that 85% of self-identified Democratic voters had united behind Coons, while only 68% of Republican voters endorsed O'Donnell.[23] Days before the election, a second Fairleigh Dickinson poll showed Coons leading 57% to 36% among likely voters, and 72% to 20% among voters who described themselves as moderates.[24] As polls closed at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, multiple news sources announced that Coons had defeated O'Donnell based on exit poll data. Final results gave Coons close to a 17-point margin over O'Donnell, with 56.6% of the vote to her 40%.[25]\nDuring the campaign, Coons became embroiled in controversy over an article he wrote in 1985 for his college newspaper: \"Chris Coons: The Making of a Bearded Marxist\".[26] In it, he described how, on a college trip to Kenya, hearing wealthy Africans disparaging their country's poor while studying under a \"bright and eloquent Marxist professor\" at the University of Nairobi helped transform him from a Republican to what Fox News called a \"Democrat suspicious of America's power and ideals\".[27][28] Coons campaign spokesman Dave Hoffman said the article's title was a humorous takeoff on a joke Coons's college friends had made about how his time outside the country had affected his outlook. \"After witnessing crushing poverty and the consequences of the Reagan Administration's 'constructive engagement' with the South African apartheid regime, he rethought his political views, returned to the America he loved and proudly registered as a Democrat\", Hoffman said in a statement to Politico.[29]\nAccording to Fox News, Coons was \"targeted by Republicans\" over the 25-year-old piece, and then-Senate-Majority-Leader Harry Reid's attempt to defend Coons by calling him \"my pet\" might have done more harm than good. Coons downplayed the article, as well as controversial past statements by O'Donnell, saying that voters were interested in current issues such as job creation and the national debt and not \"statements that either of us made 20 or 30 years ago\".[27] Writing in Slate, David Weigel called Coons \"boring\" and noted that his campaign ads failed to identify him as a Democrat, but opined, \"If the Tea Party Express slings the 'bearded Marxist' nonsense, I doubt it will work.\"[30]\nO'Donnell also attracted significant controversy; she embellished her academic record on several occasions,[31] and after comedian Bill Maher aired a video clip of her admitting that she had \"dabbled in witchcraft\" while in high school, her campaign aired a widely mocked television ad that began with her saying \"I am not a witch.\"[32][33][34]\n2014\n[edit]Coons was elected to his first full term by defeating Republican challenger Kevin Wade and Green Party candidate Andrew Groff on November 4, 2014.[35] Wade, an engineer and businessman, also ran against U.S. Senator Tom Carper in 2012.[36] Coons won 55.8% of the popular vote (130,655 to Wade's 98,823 and to Groff's 4,560).[37]\n2020\n[edit]In the 2020 Democratic primary election, Coons easily defeated technology executive Jessica Scarane, a progressive challenger endorsed by groups like Brand New Congress.[38] In the general election, Coons faced Republican nominee Lauren Witzke, a controversial conservative activist and conspiracy theorist calling for a ten-year immigration moratorium.[39] Coons and Witzke took part in a digital debate hosted by the Jewish Federation of Delaware, in which they debated the merits of late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as Witzke's comments about the QAnon conspiracy theory.[40] In the November general election, Coons defeated Witzke, 59% to 38%.[41]\nTenure\n[edit]2010s\n[edit]On November 15, 2010, Coons was sworn in as Delaware's newest senator by Vice President Joe Biden, the former occupant of Coons's Senate seat. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was sworn in on the same day, though he took an advantage in seniority over Coons, as the former governor of West Virginia.\nThe Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare) had already been passed when Coons took office, but he has voted against repealing it, emphasizing that seniors in Delaware would have to pay higher prescription drug prices if it was repealed.[42] In September 2017, Coons said the Graham-Cassidy bill, meant to replace the Affordable Care Act, would be playing \"Russian roulette with the American health care system.\"[43]\nOn abortion, Coons has received a 100% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.[44][45]\nIn June 2013, after the death of Democratic senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Coons was appointed to his seat on the influential Appropriations Committee, becoming the first senator from Delaware to serve on the committee in 40 years. As a result, he gave up his seat on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[46][47][48]\nIn October 2013, Coons announced the formation of the inaugural Senate Chicken Caucus in the United States Senate. He stated, \"I hope that the Senate Chicken Caucus will give America's chicken producers a platform to better inform legislators about the industry's vital contributions to our economy, and promote policy solutions that help their businesses grow and thrive.\"[49]\nOn December 11, 2013, Coons introduced the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2013 (S. 1799; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 and would authorize funding through 2018 to help child abuse victims.[50] Coons said that \"we have a responsibility to protect our children from violence and abuse.\"[50]\nIn March 2014, Coons voted against President Obama's nomination of civil rights lawyer Debo Adegbile for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, even though he believed that Adegbile would have been \"an asset to the Justice Department.\" He stated that voting for a nominee \"who would face such visceral opposition from law enforcement on his first day on the job\" was troubling and the vote was \"one of the most difficult I have taken since joining the Senate\".[51] Obama described the Senate's vote against Adegbile as \"a travesty based on wildly unfair character attacks against a good and qualified public servant.\"[52] An open letter to Coons from students, faculty and alumni of the Yale Law and Divinity Schools, of which Coons is an alumnus, criticized his vote as \"alarm[ing]\" and \"signal[ing] a lack of respect for the fundamental American legal principle that all parties have a right to zealous representation.\"[53]\nCoons was mentioned as a possible replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016.[54]\nIn April 2017, after President Trump tweeted that North Korea had \"disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President\" with a recent missile launch, Coons said Trump understood China was his sole \"constructive path forward on North Korea\" but that diplomacy would not work through tweeting.[55]\nIn July 2017, Coons voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that placed sanctions on Iran together with Russia and North Korea.[56]\nIn April 2018, following the FBI raid on the hotel room and offices of Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, Coons, Cory Booker, Lindsey Graham, and Thom Tillis introduced new legislation to \"limit President Trump's ability to fire special counsel Robert Mueller\". Termed the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, the legislation would allow any special counsel, in this case Mueller, to receive an \"expedited judicial review\" in the 10 days following being dismissed to determine whether the dismissal was appropriate. If not, the special counsel would be reinstated. At the same time, according to The Hill, the bill would \"codify regulations\" that a special counsel could be fired only by a senior Justice Department official, while having to provide reasons in writing.[57]\n2020s\n[edit]In November 2020, Coons was named a candidate for Secretary of State in the Biden administration.[58] Biden ultimately chose Antony Blinken to lead the State Department, telling Coons, \"I need you in the Senate.\"[59] Coons was seen as among Biden's closest allies in the Senate,[60] and co-chaired Biden's 2024 reelection campaign.[61]\nDuring the 2021 attack on the United States Capitol, Coons was evacuated from the Senate chambers, along with other senators and staff. He said there were \"some scary and chaotic moments\" during the attack. When the Senate reconvened to certify the Electoral College vote count, Coons called for Trump's removal, saying he \"poses a real and present threat to the future of our democracy\". He called for the invocation of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution the day after the event on Good Morning America.[62] That same day, January 7, he called for Republicans Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, who both challenged the election results, to resign from the Senate.[63]\nArctic Frost investigation\n[edit]In November 2025, following disclosures that the FBI's Arctic Frost investigation had obtained phone records of Republican senators without notification, Coons expressed concern about the surveillance of legislators. He stated, \"On the surface of it, it would strike me as a significant invasion of the right of Senators to conduct their jobs, so this is something that needs urgent follow-up.\"[64] Coons also co-sponsored the Anti-Cash Grab Act, legislation introduced by Senators Martin Heinrich and Mark Kelly to repeal a provision in the government funding bill that allowed senators to sue for $500,000 in damages over seized phone records.[65]\nCommittee assignments\n[edit]Source:[66]\n- Select Committee on Ethics (Ranking Member)\n- Committee on Appropriations\n- Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n- Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n- Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government\n- Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n- Subcommittee on the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (chair)\n- Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n- Committee on Foreign Relations\n- Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy\n- Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy\n- Subcommittee on United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Multilateral International Development, Multilateral Institutions, and International Economic, Energy and Environmental Policy\n- Subcommittee on State Department and USAID Management, International Operations, and Bilateral International Development\n- Committee on the Judiciary\n- Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n- Previous (2010–2015)[67]\nCaucus memberships\n[edit]- Senate Law Enforcement Caucus (co-chair)\n- Senate Climate Solutions Caucus (co-chair)\n- Senate Competitiveness Caucus (co-chair)\n- Senate Chicken Caucus (co-chair)\n- Senate Human Rights Caucus (co-chair)\n- Congressional Trademark Caucus (co-chair)\n- Senate Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Caucus (co-chair)\n- Senate Caucus on Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (co-chair)\n- Senate Oceans Caucus\n- Senate Manufacturing Caucus\n- Rare Disease Caucus[68]\n- Senate Renewables and Energy Efficiency Caucus\n- Congressional International Creativity and Theft-Prevention Caucus\n- Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus\n- Senate National Guard Caucus\n- Senate Small Brewers Caucus\n- Congressional Bicameral High-Speed & Intercity Passenger Rail Caucus\n- Senate Diabetes Caucus\n- Senate Global Internet Freedom Caucus\n- Senate India Caucus\n- Congressional French Caucus\n- Cloud Task Force, Congressional High Tech Caucus\n- Bicameral Congressional AIDS Caucus\n- Senate Veterans Jobs Caucus\n- Senate Air Force Caucus\n- Senate Recycling Caucus\n- National Service Congressional Caucus\n- Congressional Inventions Caucus\n- Afterschool Caucuses[69]\n- Congressional Coalition on Adoption[70]\nPolitical positions\n[edit]The American Conservative Union gave him a 3% lifetime conservative rating in 2020[72] Coons has been described as a pro-Israel centrist.[73]\nAbortion\n[edit]Coons supported Roe v. Wade and believes abortion should remain legal throughout the country. In 2015, he signed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt that urged the Court to step in to prevent states from enacting laws that restrict access to abortion.[74] Coons described the June 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade as taking away \"the fundamental freedom for women to make their own choices about their body and their future.\"[75]\nAgriculture\n[edit]In June 2019, Coons and 18 other Democratic senators sent USDA Inspector General Phyllis K. Fong a letter requesting that she investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserting that not to conduct an investigation would mean these \"actions could be perceived as a part of this administration's broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists.\"[76]\nEnvironment\n[edit]In April 2019, Coons was one of 12 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development advocating that the Energy Department be granted maximum funding for carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS), arguing that investment in viable options to capture carbon emissions could stimulate American job growth and expressing disagreement with Trump's 2020 budget request to combine the two federal programs that include carbon capture research.[77] Coons was revealed in a sting operation by Greenpeace to be a target for ExxonMobil in efforts to weaken the climate regulations in President Biden's INVEST in America Act.[78] In June 2023, Coons was the primary sponsor of the PROVE IT Act, which would direct the Department of Energy to collect data on the greenhouse gas intensity of certain goods made in the United States and other countries, data that could enable climate-focused trade policy addressing international disparities in environmental standards. He was joined by lead Republican sponsor Kevin Cramer.[79][80]\nGun law\n[edit]As of 2010, Coons had a \"F\" grade from the National Rifle Association (NRA) due to his stance on gun control.[81] In 2015, he and 23 other Democratic senators signed a letter to Obama asking him to take executive action on gun control in the wake of the Umpqua Community College shooting. Coons supported the Feinstein Amendment, which sought to ban known and suspected terrorists from buying firearms.[82] The next year, he participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster.[83]\nForeign policy\n[edit]In December 2010, Coons voted for the ratification of New START,[84] a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.[85]\nCoons is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and is a staunch supporter of Israel. He has also been a guest speaker at AIPAC events. Coons is also a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334 because it undermines direct talks between the parties.[86]\nCoons condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[87]\nIn October 2018, Coons was one of seven senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing that they found it \"difficult to reconcile known facts with at least two\" of the Trump administration's certifications that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were attempting to protect Yemeni civilians and were in compliance with US laws on arms sales, citing their lack of understanding for \"a certification that the Saudi and Emirati governments are complying with applicable agreements and laws regulating defense articles when the [memo] explicitly states that, in certain instances, they have not done so.\"[88]\nIn November 2018, Coons joined Senator Marco Rubio and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in sending the Trump administration a letter raising concerns about China's undue influence over media outlets and academic institutions in the United States. They wrote, \"In American news outlets, Beijing has used financial ties to suppress negative information about the CCP. In the past four years, multiple media outlets with direct or indirect financial ties to China allegedly decided not to publish stories on wealth and corruption in the CCP...Beijing has also sought to use relationships with American academic institutions and student groups to shape public discourse.\"[89]\nIn April 2019, Coons was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., arguing that the funding improved conditions in those countries.[90]\nOn June 6, 2021, Coons and Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dan Sullivan visited Taipei in an U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport to meet President Tsai Ing-wen and Minister Joseph Wu during the pandemic outbreak of Taiwan to announce President Joe Biden's donation plan of 750,000 COVID-19 vaccines included in the global COVAX program.[91][92][93]\nIn January 2024, Coons opposed a resolution proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders that would have applied the human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act to U.S. military aid to Israel. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11.[94] In March 2024, Coons urged the Biden administration to recognize a \"nonmilitarized\" Palestinian state after the end of the Gaza war.[95]\nFiscal position\n[edit]Coons supports free-trade agreements.[96] He opposed the Obama-era government bailouts.[97] He is against right-to-work laws, and supports internet sales tax.[98]\nHousing\n[edit]In April 2019, Coons was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the Housing and Urban Development Department's Section 4 Capacity Building program for authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[99]\nLabor\n[edit]In May 2018, Coons was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) Chairman Colleen Kiko urging the FLRA to end efforts to close its Boston regional office until Congress debated the matter, adding that closing the FLRA's seven regional offices would cause staff to be placed farther away from the federal employees whose rights they protect.[100]\nOn March 5, 2021, Coons voted against Bernie Sanders's amendment to include a $15/hour minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[101]\nIn March 2023, Coons co-sponsored the introduction of the PRO Act in the 118th Congress.[102]\nLGBT rights\n[edit]In September 2014, Coons was one of 69 members of the House and Senate to sign a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell requesting that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shall revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.[103][104]\nIn October 2018, Coons was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rollback of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQIA+ diplomats who had unions that are not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQIA+ individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that refusing to let LGBTQIA+ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent to upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"[105] Coons supports transgender rights.[106]\nPatents\n[edit]Coons proposed the Stronger Patents Act, which would make it more expensive to challenge patents and thus easier to enforce them.[107]\nPublications\n[edit]Articles\n[edit]- \"A Bipartisan Foreign Policy Is Still Possible\", Foreign Affairs, October 7, 2020[108]\nElectoral history\n[edit]| Year | Office | Election | Candidate | Party | Votes | % | Opponent(s) | Party | Votes | % | ||\n| 2000 | County Council | Primary | Chris Coons | Democratic | 7,520 | 48% | Vincent D'Anna Martha Denison Dwight L.

Coons is Presbyterian, his wife is Catholic, and they attend St. Ann Catholic Church in the city. Coons describes himself as \"someone who is, privately, fairly religious,\" though he has never thought \"that needs to be a big part of [campaigning].\"[110]\nIn 1999, he was awarded the Governor's Outstanding Volunteer Award for his work with the \"I Have a Dream\" Foundation, the Governor's Mentoring Council, and the United Way of Delaware.[11]\nAs of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Coons's net worth was more than $10 million.[111]\nCoons bears a striking resemblance to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which the two referenced when posing for a selfie together in February 2024 with the caption \"Wer ist wer\" (German for \"who is who\").[112]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Chris Coons Biography\". coons.senate.gov.

Mike Castle, started right off trading insults. He said she supports failed economic policies and extreme education positions, and prefers \"partisan bickering\" over compromise and solutions. She said voters should choose him if they think their government is too small, their taxes are too low and they want a rubber stamp for President Obama's failing economic policies.\nThe moderators – CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Delaware public television anchor Nancy Karibjanian – did their part to make sure no sore subject went unmentioned. In the case of O'Donnell, that meant her personal finances and past TV appearances in which she has talked about subjects like masturbation (equivalent to adultery) and witchcraft (she dabbled in it long ago).\nKaribjanian noted an IRS tax lien against O'Donnell for about $12,000 in taxes and penalties from 2005, a 2008 mortgage default judgment on her home, and the bachelor's degree the 41-year-old candidate received this year \"because it took a decade to pay off the tuition. The question, then, is how can voters rely upon your thoughts on how to manage the deficit if you're having such personal financial issues of your own?\"\nO'Donnell said the lien was an IRS mistake. As for the rest, \"I don't have a trust fund. I didn't come from a privileged, sheltered background as my opponent says he did ... When I fell upon difficult times, I made the sacrifices needed to set things right. I sold my house. And I sold a lot of my possessions in order to pay off my personal debt and to become in a stronger position.\"\nKaribjanian quoted a local writer who said O'Donnell's many comments on videotape, including some from appearances on Bill Maher's show in the late 1990s, \"seemed to be making Delawareans cringe.\" O'Donnell said the election should not be about her long-ago comments on a comedy show. \"You know, as, Wolf, you can attest, I have not welcomed this media attention. You've been asking for an interview for quite a long time,\" she added.\nCoons said he wanted to talk about national issues – not O'Donnell's personal issues, which he said have been all over the national media. \"You're just jealous you weren't on 'Saturday Night Live,' she teased him, referring to a skit about her \"I am not a witch\" TV ad. \"I'm dying to see who's going to play me, Christine,\" he replied with a smile.\nIt was a rare light moment in a testy session. O'Donnell, trailing Coons by double digits in nine polls since the Sept. 14 primary, tried to bait him as much as possible, including mentioning that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had described Coons as \"my pet.\" \"I don't know why Harry Reid said that. I'm nobody's pet. I'm going to be a bulldog for Delaware,\" Coons said, seeming annoyed.\nThe other pesky issue for Coons, 47, was an article he wrote in 1985 for his college newspaper, headlined \"Chris Coons: The Making of a Bearded Marxist.\" He wrote that he had been a \"proud founding member of the Amherst College Republicans,\" but became a Democrat after a visit to Kenya. \"My friends now joke that something about Kenya, maybe the strange diet, or the tropical sun, changed my personality; Africa to them seems a catalytic converter that takes in clean-shaven, clear-thinking Americans and sends back bearded Marxists,\" he wrote in the piece.\nCoons, who throughout the debate stressed his work with business groups such as the local chamber of commerce, said the article was clearly a joke. \"I am not now, nor have I ever been, anything but a clean-shaven capitalist,\" he declared.\nO'Donnell had turned the talk to Marxism after dodging a question about whether she believes, as she told Maher in 1998, that evolution is a myth. She said her beliefs are irrelevant because it should be up to local schools to decide how to teach evolution and creationism. \"I would argue that there are more people who support my Catholic faith than his Marxist beliefs,\" she added.\nCoons believes in \"tenets of Marxism\" such as raising taxes, O'Donnell said, and wrote in the 1985 article that he learned his beliefs \"from an articulate intelligent Marxist professor.\" She said \"that should send chills up the spine of every Delaware voter.\"\n\"If it were accurate, if it were true, I'd agree. But it's not accurate. It's not true,\" Coons said.\nCoons did get a chance to talk a little about his record as New Castle County executive, where he said he inherited a deficit, turned it into a surplus and kept the county's triple-A bond rating – one he said only 30 of 3,000 counties have. O'Donnell scoffed that he had balanced the budget by raising taxes and cutting police salaries, and that he had inherited that bond rating. \"Ms. O'Donnell is not familiar with how bond ratings work,\" Coons said, explaining they have to be re-earned on a continual basis.\nIt was one of several cutting remarks he directed at her. \"Ms. O'Donnell, we're going to try to have a conversation here this evening, rather than just a diatribe if we possibly could,\" he said, then went on to accuse her of telling \"flat-out lies\" about him on her Web site.\nThe pair presented clear contrasts on abortion (Coons said he supports legal abortion, O'Donnell opposes it even in cases of rape or incest); the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy on gay soldiers (Coons called it \"discrimination, plain and simple,\" while O'Donnell said the policy falls within the military's right to regulate personal behavior such as adultery); and on Afghanistan.\nO'Donnell said Obama's plan to start drawing down troops in June 2011 will embolden terrorists. Coons said he would support a negotiated settlement to end the war. \"I don't know how long is too long, but 10 years strikes me as awfully long,\" he said, and \"we are not succeeding in building a nation.\"\nO'Donnell also attacked Democratic economic policies, saying food stamps and welfare spending are higher than ever despite promises of recovery and 8 percent unemployment. \"This is not a move towards real economic recovery. This is a move towards creating a culture of dependency,\" she said. To which Coons replied that \"to simply denounce people as being dependent because they're applying for and receiving food stamps in the worst recession in modern times is frankly slandering people who are in incredibly difficult times.\" She called that unfair.\nHe then went on to fudge whose taxes should remain at lower Bush-era levels (\"I don't think we should draw an arbitrary line at $250,000\") and she fudged what she would cut to reduce the deficit (Blitzer: \"Don't just say waste, fraud and abuse.\" O'Donnell: Spending freezes and \"waste, fraud and abuse.\")\nO'Donnell also was asked about her 2006 assertion that she was \"privy\" to information that China had a plan to take over America. \"Well, they misquoted me at the time, I believe,\" she said.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Meet Chris\nPriorities\nLegislation\nCaucuses\nCommittee Assignments\nVoting Record\nServices\nCoronavirus Resources\nAfghanistan inquiries: Resources for U.S. citizens and Afghans at risk\nHelp with the Federal Government\nFlag Requests\nVisiting Washington\nFederal Grant Funding\nRequest a Meeting\nLetters from the Senator\nAcademy Nominations\nInternships\nPassport Assistance\nStudent Leadership Opportunities\nU.S. Senate Page Program\nAppropriations Requests\nNews\nPress Releases\nOp-eds\nPhotos\nVideos\nContact\nShare Your Opinion\nHelp for Delawareans\nStaff Directory\nRequest a Meeting\nNewsletter Sign-Up\nWebsite Feedback\nSearch\nSenator Coons Facebook\nSenator Coons Instagram\nSenator Coons Twitter\nSenator Coons Youtube\nContact\nShare Your Opinion\nShare Your Opinion\nnav-mobile-modal\nMeet Chris\nPriorities\nLegislation\nCaucuses\nCommittee Assignments\nVoting Record\nServices\nCoronavirus Resources\nAfghanistan inquiries: Resources for U.S. citizens and Afghans at risk\nHelp with the Federal Government\nFlag Requests\nVisiting Washington\nFederal Grant Funding\nRequest a Meeting\nLetters from the Senator\nAcademy Nominations\nInternships\nPassport Assistance\nStudent Leadership Opportunities\nU.S. Senate Page Program\nAppropriations Requests\nNews\nPress Releases\nOp-eds\nPhotos\nVideos\nContact\nShare Your Opinion\nHelp for Delawareans\nStaff Directory\nRequest a Meeting\nNewsletter Sign-Up\nWebsite Feedback\nsearch-mobile-modal\nSite Search\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

An approval rating is a percentage determined by polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a politician based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure. A question might ask: \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way that the current president is handling their job as president?\"[1]\nLike most surveys that measure opinions, individual poll results may be inaccurate. Many unscientific approval rating systems exist that show inaccurate statistics. Examples that self select, such as online questions, are of this type; however, the aggregate approval rating is generally accepted by statisticians as a statistically valid indicator of the comparative changes in the popular U.S. mood regarding a president. George W. Bush registered a 90% job approval rating (the highest in Gallup's tracking) shortly after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.[2] Harry S. Truman registered a 22% job approval rating (the lowest in Gallup's tracking) in a survey conducted February 9–14, 1952.[3]\nHistorical comparison\n[edit]| # | President | Years in office | Approval[4] | Disapproval | Margin | Final poll | Polls per year | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Avg | Highest | Lowest | Diff | Highest | Lowest | Highest | Lowest | |||||\n| 47[7] | Donald Trump | 2025– | TBD | 47 (2025-01-27) |\n37 (2025-07-21) |\n10 | 58 (2025-07-21) |\n48 (2025-01-27) |\n−1 (2025-01-27) |\n−21 (2025-07-21) |\nTBD | |\n| 46[8] | Joe Biden | 2021–2025 | 42 | 57 (2021-02-02, 2021-04-21) [9] |\n36 (2024-07-21) |\n21 | 59 (2022-07-26, 2023-04-25, 2023-10-23, 2023-11-21, 2023-12-20, 2024-02-20) |\n37 (2021-02-02) |\n20 (2021-02-02) |\n−22 (2023-04-25, 2023-10-23, 2023-11-21, 2024-07-21) |\n40 (2025-01-15) |\n12 |\n| 45[10] | Donald Trump | 2017–2021 | 41 | 49 (2020-01-29, 2020-02-16, 2020-03-22, 2020-04-28, 2020-05-13) |\n34 (2021-01-15) |\n15 | 62 (2021-01-15) |\n45 (2017-01-22, 2020-03-22) [11] |\n4 (2020-03-22) |\n−28 (2021-01-15) |\n34 (2021-01-15) |\n40 |\n| 44[12] | Barack Obama | 2009–2017 | 48 | 69 (2009-01-24) |\n38 (2014-09-05) |\n31 | 57 (2014-10-10) |\n12 (2009-01-23) |\n56 (2009-01-23, 2009-01-24) |\n−18 (2014-10-10) |\n59 (2017-01-19) |\n48.4 |\n| 43[13] | George W.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context.

This N-word:\n“If you go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany. Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they’ll dominate the continent of Europe, but that’s not our problem. Let’s appease them. Why? Because (strength against the Nazis) can’t be done. We can’t possibly stand against them.\n“I suspect those same pundits who say (that opposing Obamacare) can’t be done, if it had been the 1940s, we would have been listening to them. Then they would have made television. They would have gotten beyond carrier pigeons and beyond letters and they would have been saying, ‘You cannot defeat the Germans.’”\nI will endeavor to translate: (a) Obamacare is like stuff the Nazis did, and (b) Those who refuse to stop Obamacare are no better than Nazi appeasers.\nAh yes, the Nazi metaphor. The last refuge of the demagogue.\nCruz, whose lordly self-regard is trumped by the bipartisan loathing he so richly inspires, appears to knows less about governance than a newbie political science student. Most of Obamacare is already funded, and would not be halted by a filibuster. As conservative political analyst David Freddoso has pointed out, “During a shutdown, Marines don’t get paid, but Obamacare gets funded.”\nBut Cruz’s marathon rant wasn’t about governance anyway. It was classic showhorse behavior. Not a single Senate colleague rose to join him. Obamacare lives on. All he did was gum up the governing machinery for a day.\nAs a duly elected member of the chamber (thanks, tea-partying Texans), he has every right to make a spectacle of himself. But Nazi analogies are beyond the pale. It insults our intelligence to insinuate that a law offering health coverage to tens of millions of people is akin to a criminal regime that systematically murdered tens of millions of people. And it’s a tar-brush smear of his fellow Republicans to suggest that their coolness to his crusade is akin to Nazi appeasement.\nI wrote here last February that freshman Cruz, just one month into his tenure, was already on track to emulate ‘50s smear artist Joseph McCarthy. The Nazi nonsense is Exhibit A.\nMost elected Republicans prefer to voice their disdain for Cruz off the record. But John McCain, to his credit, went on the record yesterday, denouncing Cruz on the Senate floor: “I resoundingly reject that (Nazi) allegation. That allegation, in my view, does a great disservice” to the Americans who fought in the war, including his own father and grandfather.\nFurthermore, “To allege that there are people today who are like those who, prior to World War II, didn’t stand up and oppose the atrocities that were taking place in Europe…is an inappropriate (topic) for debate on the floor of the United States Senate.”\nAnd put your hands together for Republican congressman Peter King, whose on-the-record assessment of Cruz is refreshingly succinct: “He’s a fraud.”\nElsewhere, some Republicans are weighing in. Shortly after Cruz invoked the N-word, strategist Steve Schmidt unloaded on TV: “We need Republicans, whether they’re running for president, whether they’re in the leadership of Congress, to stand up against a lot of this asininity. You finally saw it with Ted Cruz. Maybe he’s the one who’s got a bridge too far. Maybe we’ll start seeing our elected leaders stop being intimidated by this nonsense, have the nerve, have the guts, to stand up and fight to take conservatism’s good name back from the freak show.”\nOr, as U.S. Army lawyer Joseph Welch famously said to Joe McCarthy, when the senator’s smears became too much to bear, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”\n—\nFollow me on Twitter, @dickpolman1\nWHYY is your source for fact-based, in-depth journalism and information.

The man had a pretty good career in British politics, even rising to the post of prime minister in 1937. Yet, he was not destined to be remembered for any of his successes. History has associated one word with Chamberlain, and that word is “appeasement”.\nThe word “appease” does not necessarily have to be negative. The Latin root word is pacem, which literally means “peace”. An “appeaser” is one who brings peace. But when most people refer to Chamberlain as an appeaser, they do not mean it in a positive way. In fact, what they are really implying is that he sought to appease but failed.\nJust last week, in the middle of his 21-hour non-filibuster filibuster, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) briefly paused from reading from Dr. Seuss’ Green Eggs and Ham to take a shot at Chamberlain. “Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they’ll dominate the continent of Europe but that’s not our problem. Let’s appease them. Why? Because it can’t be done. We can’t possibly stand against them.’” (I think it’s safe to say that those exact words never exited Chamberlain’s mouth.)\nPrime Minister Neville Chamberlain had the misfortune of coming to power at a time when the world was about to erupt into the most destructive, deadly conflict in history. When he announced that his policy in Europe would be one of appeasement, he meant that he was hoping to avoid such a war.\nIn September 1938, Chamberlain met with Adolf Hitler, then Chancellor of Germany, and the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini in Munich. The Germans expressed their demand to unite (or in some cases reunite) ethnic German populations in some of their neighboring countries with Germany itself. Hitler’s first move was to pressure Austria, his own boyhood home, into merging with Germany. He then sought to bring a significant portion of western Czechoslovakia (known as “Sudetenland”), much of which was home to ethnic Germans, into the fold.\nChamberlain and the British government ultimately decided to sign a pact with Hitler which granted approval to Germany’s takeover of this section of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the assurance that this would be the last of any such moves by Berlin. The British and German leaders signed an agreement pledging that they would never go to war with each other – a piece of paper that Chamberlain proudly waved in the air upon his return to England, proclaiming to the overjoyed British people that it insured they would have “peace for our time”.\nOf course, the Munich agreement did not bring an end to the Nazi regime’s expansion efforts. Less than a year later, Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded Poland from opposite directions, thus triggering a conflict that would envelope not only Europe, but also the entire world. (To be fair, some count Japan’s invasion of Manchuria in 1931 as the true start of WWII, while others believe that WWI and WWII were both one massive war with an intermission in between.)\nWithin a few years of this debacle, Chamberlain’s decision to sign the Munich Pact with Hitler was seen as an ultimate act of cowardice, betrayal, and naivety by many in Britain and beyond. Chamberlain suffered particularly when compared to his successor as prime minister, Winston Churchill, who many regarded as the lone “voice in the wilderness” who had understood Hitler’s true belligerence and insisted on standing up to him.\nIn more recent decades, some historians have attempted to defend Chamberlain’s decision making. I would submit that while his appeasement policy does seem both wrongheaded and dangerous in hindsight, it is much more understandable when one considers some lesser known information about Chamberlain and the world in which he lived at the time. It may not be possible to completely exonerate him, but at least it will bring some nuance to the situation.\n1. He didn’t want a repeat of World War I.\nIt is difficult for Americans to grasp just how damaging the First World War, referred to in the 1930s simply as The Great War, was to the collective European psyche. An entire generation of European men was nearly wiped out in this conflict, which proved to be a rather pointless bloodletting. The United Kingdom alone suffered an estimated 886,939 military fatalities during this war, accounting for 2.19% of its total population.¹ By comparison, the total number of combat deaths for both sides in the U.S. Civil War (the deadliest war in American history) was less than 700,000.²\nGiven this very recent history and the fact that military technology had become even more deadly by 1938, it seems perfectly reasonable that Chamberlain would have gone to great lengths to avoid another such war. A generation of fathers broken by their combat experiences did not want to see the same thing happen to their sons. Pursuing the path of diplomacy as far as possible seemed like the only responsible option.\n2. Britain was in no position to defeat Germany in a military conflict.\nThe British armed forces were simply not well prepared to face a reinvigorated Germany. While the Nazi regime in Germany had put in place a program of rearmament, industrial expansion, and scientific research as a method of stimulating the moribund national economy (as well as preparing for a possible conflict in Europe), the British were far behind. Chamberlain undoubtedly knew that it would take a few years before his country could match the total output of the German industrial machine. If a conflict had to happen, later would be better than sooner.\nConsider this passage from Robert Self’s book British Foreign & Defence Policy since 1945:\nIn these circumstances, British policymakers were obliged to accept that skillful diplomacy in support of a policy of “appeasement” designed to redress the legitimate grievances of Germany and the revisionist powers was essential. As Chamberlain argued repeatedly, this was not “a peace at any price” policy, but “in the absence of any powerful ally, and until our armaments are completed, we must adjust our foreign policy to our circumstances, and even bear with patience and good humour actions which we should like to treat in a very different fashion.” If diplomacy was successful, the threat of war would be averted; if it failed it would have still bought the time needed to complete the necessary programme of rearmament.\nIf you need further proof that the British were not ready to pose a serious threat to Nazi expansionism, just look what happened when the Germans invaded Western Europe. The German blitzkrieg swept through the Netherlands and Belgium fairly easily and ended up crushing the French resistance, occupying much of France in just a matter of days. The British were also stationed in France as part of an international defensive force. However, they were no match for the Germans and ended up retreating until they hit the Atlantic coast, where a hurriedly assembled band of military and civilian vessels rushed to ferry them across the English Channel.\nThe Dunkirk evacuation ended up providing a great morale boost for the British, but in reality it was simply a chaotic retreat that worked better than expected. Even when defending their own island in the Battle of Britain, the British relied heavily on semi-covert American support. Had Hitler never opened up a second front in Russia and the U.S. never joined the war effort entirely, it is impossible to say how long Britain would have been able to hold out against the German bombing campaign.\n3. British war debt threatened to bankrupt the empire.\nThis aspect of Chamberlain’s thinking seems particularly appropriate given the current political climate in the United States. The prime minister would have been aware of the heavy debt burden taken on by Britain in order to win the First World War. Just take a look at the table below, which details the state of the British government’s financial situation around the time of World War I (1914-1918).\nBritish Budget Situation by Fiscal Year (1913-1920)\nThe war effort forced the government to spend more than 10 times the annual rate from before the war. Robert Self writes, “By the end of the war, Britain’s overseas debt stood at ₤1241 million, of which ₤840 million was owed to the US government.” He also notes that annual interest payment on the country’s national debt “absorbed some 40 per cent of total central government expenditure until 1931 after which it slowly declined, although even in 1939 it still accounted for over a quarter of gross public expenditure.” I would guess that if Sen. Ted Cruz had been a member of the British parliament in 1938, he would have been giving a long-winded speech about how the British government could not endure another massive increase in debt brought on by war.\nIf Chamberlain was at all worried about debt bringing an end to the British Empire, he would have been right. “Britain had emerged victorious from the Second World War only by accepting the financial, industrial and commercial devastation of its economy,” Robert Self wrote. Indeed, just four years after the end of WWII, the British Empire effectively came to an end with the creation of the British Commonwealth, a collection of 54 “free and equal” states.\n4. The United States did not stand up to Hitler.\nIf Chamberlain was a wimp for not taking a stronger stand against Hitler pre-1939, then the United States was at least equally wimpy. The U.S. had adopted a firm policy of neutrality and isolationism with regard to European affairs. In the days surrounding Hitler and Chamberlain’s Munich negotiations, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt exchanged letters with the German leader urging him to embrace diplomacy and peace with regard to Czechoslovakia. After receiving assurances from Hitler, Roosevelt replied with another letter on September 27, 1939, which is summarized on the History Channel’s website.\nIn his letter of September 27, Roosevelt expressed relief at Hitler’s assurances but re-emphasized his desire that “negotiations [between Germany and Czechoslovakia] be continued until a peaceful settlement is found.” FDR also suggested that a conference of all nations concerned with the current conflict be convened as soon as possible.\nHe appealed to Hitler’s ego, saying “should you agree to a solution in this peaceful manner I am convinced that hundreds of millions throughout the world would recognize your action as an outstanding historic service to all humanity.” FDR then assured Hitler that the U.S. would remain neutral regarding European politics, but that America recognized a responsibility to be involved “as part of a world of neighbors.”\nIt appears that Roosevelt’s treatment of Hitler and his policy of expansion was much the same as Chamberlain’s. The American president was eager to maintain peace, and he seemed to think that Hitler was a reasonable person capable of performing “an outstanding historic service to all humanity”. The U.S. did not have a delegation participating in the Munich negotiations, but if there had been one, I’m willing to bet that they would have acted in exactly the same way as the British. Even after Hitler had invaded much of Europe, the U.S. did not declare war on Germany until the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan, more than two years after the war in Europe had begun.\n5. Churchill did not have a great war track record.\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill is beloved by many in both the UK and the US for his strength in the midst of adversity, his quick wit, and his apparently prophetic ability to discern developing threats. However, the toughness and lack of hesitation with regard to war that we often admire in Churchill could also have negative effects.\nWhile he was First Lord of the Admiralty during World War I, Churchill suggested an Allied operation against the Ottoman Empire (which was allied with Britain’s enemies) in the area known as the Dardenelles. The resulting Gallipolli Campaign, named for the Turkish peninsula on which much of the fighting took place, ended in defeat for the British and French, with 252,000 casualties.\nLargely as a result of this defeat, the majority Liberal government in the British Parliament (of which Churchill was then a member) was forced to form a coalition with the Conservatives. As part of the coalition agreement, Churchill was demoted from his position, eventually ending up as Minister of Munitions. He did perform some good work during the war, helping to push the introduction of the tank (a new technology at the time), but it’s safe to say that in the 1930s, Churchill’s war record was not exactly impressive. There would have been good reason to doubt the judgment of a man whose main claim to fame was a military disaster.\n6. Chamberlain declared war on Germany.\nSo much has been made of Neville Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement that it is easy to forget that he actually did declare war on Hitler. On September 3, 1939, following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland, Chamberlain addressed the British people via radio to inform them that the country was at war. What he said that day provides another level of insight into his thinking.\nYou can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful.\nUp to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland, but Hitler would not have it. He had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland, whatever happened, and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.\nThe proposals were never shown to the Poles, nor to us, and though they were announced in a German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.\nHis action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force.\nNeville Chamberlain was a man caught in an impossible situation. It is quite likely that nothing he could have done would have changed the ultimate course of events. While his claim that the Munich Pact would provide “peace for our time” turned out to be incorrect, no one could blame him for doing what he could to prevent war from breaking out. Churchill is usually remembered as a great critic of Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement, and that is certainly true. However, he also had a good deal of respect for the man. This is what Churchill said upon the death of Neville Chamberlain in 1940.\nIt fell to Neville Chamberlain in one of the supreme crises of the world to be contradicted by events, to be disappointed in his hopes, and to be deceived and cheated by a wicked man. But what were these hopes in which he was disappointed? What were these wishes in which he was frustrated? What was that faith that was abused? They were surely among the most noble and benevolent instincts of the human heart-the love of peace, the toil for peace, the strife for peace, the pursuit of peace, even at great peril, and certainly to the utter disdain of popularity or clamour.\nWhatever else history may or may not say about these terrible, tremendous years, we can be sure that Neville Chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority, which were powerful, to save the world from the awful, devastating struggle in which we are now engaged. This alone will stand him in good stead as far as what is called the verdict of history is concerned.\nIf that explanation was good enough for Winston Churchill, then it is good enough for me.\n¹ Source: Commonwealth War Graves Commission Annual Report 2009-2010\n² Source: The Oxford Companion to American Military History\nAnother excellent review with insightful, thought-provoking writing. Mr. Chamberlain was no-doubt a humble and sincere man who could not have realized how evil Mr. Hitler was and would go on to become. He could not realize how badly Mr. Hitler would treat his own citizens and what was planned for them in the near future. And certainly Mr. Chamberlain was concerned about any future war that would cost not only many lives, but many pounds.\nAmy, you are simply amazing! Another stunning article. Very timely, as well. Although you do not draw the parallel, directly, with our current president, it is hinted, in the words of Senator Cruz..\nI can still “hear” my dad scoffing at Neville Chamberlain in 1938, and at FDR, too.\nAre you allowed to correct typos in quotes? If so there are two. Under the picture of the British dead lying in the mud: ‘scene’ should be ‘seen’.\nIn Robert Self’s book quote, ‘ins’ should be ‘in’.\nYou are welcome.\nGrama “Eagle Eye” Mercer\nPS. Happy to see your dad chiming in.\nThis post has now been corrected in the two cases you mentioned.\nI have just come across your article on Neville Chamberlain and would like to thank you for seeking to put right some of the grievous wrongs done to the memory of a man who, whilst having honourable intentions, was no match for the criminal duplicity of Adolf Hitler. As you pointed out, the anti-war sentiments of the 1930s were as strong in Europe as they were in the US, but if Chamberlain was a dupe, he was an honest one and FDR must have also believed that Hitler could be persuaded to follow a more peaceful path by writing to him as he did.\nI do have one criticism however with the article and that is that you have repeated the myth that after Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941, America declared war on Nazi Germany; which she did not.\nThe USA only became involved in the European war because Hitler, having already been stupid enough to invade the USSR, in a moment of extreme hubris chose on 11th December 1941 to declare war on the USA; without consulting anyone else in the Nazi hierarchy or even his generals!\nHad Hitler not done this, I am certain that public and Military opinion in the USA would have ensured that your country fought only against Japan, whilst (as in 1914-1917) maintaining it’s highly profitable ‘benevolent neutrality’ in the European war and thus defraying most of the costs of the war against Japan.\nWhilst the peace-makers may be blessed, the arms-makers are always enriched.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        McCain Rips Cruz for Nazi Comment in Obamacare Speech\nShortly after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, completed his 21-hour marathon speech today, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took to the Senate floor to rebut portions of the Texas senator's talk, which McCain said failed to recognize that \"elections have consequences.\"\nMcCain took issue with Cruz's comparing those who think Obamacare will not be defunded to Nazis.\n\"If you go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany,\" Cruz said Tuesday. \"Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, 'Accept the Nazis. Yes, they'll dominate the continent of Europe but that's not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We can't possibly stand against them.'\"\nMcCain didn't mince words in his response.\n\"I resoundingly reject that allegation,\" he said on the Senate floor. \"That allegation in my view does a great disservice, a great disservice for those brave Americans and those who stood up and said what's happening in Europe cannot stand.\"\nWithout naming names, McCain noted that many of those who are leading the fight to defund Obamacare were not serving in the Senate when Republicans tried to stop Democrats from passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\"Many of those who are in opposition right now were not here at the time and did not take part in that debate,\" McCain said. \"The record is very clear of one of the most hard fought, fair, in my view, debates that has taken place on the floor of the Senate.\"\nMcCain, who campaigned for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney last year, noted that Obamacare was a major issue in the 2012 campaign, but the American people made their position on the issue known by reelecting President Obama.\n\"That doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to try to replace and repair Obamacare, but it does mean that elections have consequences,\" McCain said. \"Those elections were clear in a significant majority that a majority of the American people supported the president of the United States and renewed his stewardship of this country.\"\nMcCain was among a group of Republican senators who said Obamacare would not be defunded in the Senate, an issue with which Cruz continues to take issue.\n\"The single biggest surprise on arriving to the Senate is the defeatist attitude here,\" Cruz said in a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh today. \"We don't even talk about how to win a fight. If you had to sit through one Senate lunch, you'd be in therapy.\n\"They've been here a long time and they're beaten down and they can't believe they can win. They don't believe it can happen,\" he added.\nBut while Cruz argued that his overnight speech helped make Americans' voices heard, one top Democrat argued that the Texas senator's speech actually helped Democrats.\n\"Senator Cruz has actually advanced our cause,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters today. \"He has alienated some of his colleagues, he has united Democrats and he has shown the American people that he is willing to hold them and their well-being hostage unless he gets his way.\"\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Funded by the Georgia Lottery, it has provided college scholarships and grants to almost 2 million public, private and technical college students in Georgia during the more than 25 years since its inception in 1993.\nOver time, lawmakers have modified eligibility requirements, award amounts and rules that affect who can access the scholarships and grants that make college more accessible and affordable for students across the state. Among its successes, HOPE has enticed many Georgians to stay in-state for college and promoted college preparation in high school, but it has also reflected patterns of inequality by race, ethnicity, income and geography.\nLawmakers must balance questions of effectiveness, equity and sustainability as they adapt HOPE to serve Georgia’s evolving needs.\n1991 – Georgia General Assembly passes an amendment to the State Constitution designating lottery revenue to be used entirely for educational purposes.[1]\n1992 – Voters ratify the amendment, allowing for the creation of the Georgia Lottery through the Lottery for Education Act.[2]\n1993 – The first lottery ticket is sold in June, and the first HOPE scholarships are awarded in September. At its inception, the scholarship awarded two years of full tuition to students who graduated high school with a B average and had a family income of less than $66,000 per year.[3]\n1994 –\n- Legislators raise the HOPE income cap to $100,000.[4]\n- Scholarship expands to cover four rather than two years of tuition, a $100 per quarter book allowance and payment for mandatory fees.[5]\n1995 –\n- The income cap is eliminated entirely.[6]\n- Zell Miller adds a second chance for students who lose their HOPE scholarship after their first year of college, so that students who complete their second year of college with B average will receive HOPE their third year.[7]\n1996 –\n- Mandate is added that high school students must maintain a B in their core classes (English, math, science, social studies and foreign language). The mandate does not become effective until the high school graduating class of 2000.[8]\n- Scholarships for students attending private school increases from $1,500 to $3,000, and private school students must now earn and maintain a B average.[9]\n1997 – Nontraditional and home school students can now qualify retroactively for HOPE awards after their first year of college.[10]\n1998 –\n- The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs ranks Georgia No. 1 of 50 states for academic-based student financial aid due to HOPE.[11]\n- Voters pass an amendment to the Constitution limiting the use of lottery funds to specific educational programs and purposes, so that “scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and shortfall reserves shall receive priority over teacher technology, training and capital.”[12]\n2000 –\n- Students receiving federal Pell grants can now also receive HOPE scholarships.[13]\n- State reaches milestone of 500,000 HOPE awards, totaling $1 billion in scholarships.[14]\n2003 – The Georgia General Assembly creates the Improvement of the HOPE Scholarship Joint Study Commission, which is tasked with identifying and suggesting actions to ensure that sufficient funding for the HOPE Scholarship continues for years to come.[15]\n2004 – The most significant changes to HOPE eligibility requirements since its inception are made, including a new high school GPA calculation by the Georgia Student Finance Commission, a cap on attempted credit hours covered by HOPE, a freeze on mandatory fees payment and future payment reductions in the case of budget shortfalls.[16]\n2007 –\n- HOPE’s new high school GPA calculation goes into effect.\n- HOPE reaches milestone of 1,000,000 awards.[17]\n2008 –\n- HOPE’s Georgia residency requirement is increased to 24 months, and an addendum specifies that noncitizen students are not classified as in-state unless the student is legally in the state (with some considerations given to refugees and lawful permanent residents).[18]\nGED recipients, home study students and graduates of ineligible high schools can now gain HOPE eligibility if they score in the 85th percentile or higher of a standardized college admissions test.[19]\nHOPE award is increased from $3,000 to $3,500 for students attending private colleges.[20]\n2011 –\n- Changes are made to HOPE’s funding structure, eliminating awards for books and mandatory fees and creating the Zell Miller Scholarship, which covers full tuition for students who graduate high school with at least a 3.7 HOPE GPA and a score of at least 1200 on the SAT or 26 on the ACT. Students must maintain a 3.3 GPA to continue receiving Zell Miller in college.[21]\n- HOPE Scholarship amounts are now determined based on lottery revenue and a percentage set by legislators each year. A maximum semester credit hour cap is added for HOPE and Zell Miller, along with a seven-year graduation limit.[22]\n- New high school academic rigor requirements are added for HOPE and Zell Miller, to take effect between 2015 and 2017. The GPA requirement is changed from 2.0 to 3.0 for the HOPE Grant.[23]\n- Students cannot regain HOPE after losing eligibility at two checkpoints.[24]\n2013 – The HOPE Grant GPA requirement is reversed back to 2.0.[25] Nearly 9,000 technical students had lost the HOPE grant due to 2011’s GPA eligibility increase, and this reversal allows approximately 5,000 technical students to regain funding.[26]\n2014 –\n- The Zell Miller Grant Program is created. This program provides full-tuition scholarships for technical school students who have met the eligibility requirements to receive HOPE and have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 at the end of any quarter or semester.[27]\n- Home school and ineligible high school standardized test eligibility requirement for HOPE scholarships and grants is lowered from the 85th to the 80th.[28]\n2016 –\n- HOPE standardized test eligibility requirement for home school and ineligible high\nschool graduates is lowered from the 80th to the 75th Zell Miller eligibility for home school and ineligible high school students is expanded for those who score in the 93rd percentile.[29] - A cumulative HOPE GPA calculation weight of 0.5 is added for B, C and D grades received in college courses taken in specific Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics subject areas.[30]\n- Advanced computer science is added to the list of approved high school academic\nrigor courses.[31]\n2017 – Students who graduated high school with a technical diploma or two approved technical certificates can now receive the HOPE Grant for the first 30 semester hours of an associate level degree at a Technical College System of Georgia institution.[32]\n2018 – Members of the Georgia National Guard now meet residency requirement for HOPE and Zell Miller scholarships and grants.[33]\n2019 – The state extends the deadline for completing degrees while receiving HOPE or Zell Miller. For students who receive their first payment in the Summer 2019 term or later, their expiration limit is set at ten years after high school graduation. Active military service does not count towards the ten-year limit.[34]\n2020 –\n- Emergency regulation due to COVID-19 allows unaccredited home study completers and graduates of non-eligible high schools who were unable to sit for the ACT or SAT due to cancellations to test through December 30, 2020. Upon earning a sufficient test score, students may qualify to retroactively receive HOPE.[35]\n- Dual enrollment students who have reached the funding cap can receive HOPE and Zell Miller Grants, given they meet eligibility criteria.[36]\n2021 –\n- Students with a disability that prevents them from full-time academic study can now apply for an extension on HOPE’s expiration limit.[37]\n- Due to the pandemic, students in the high school graduating class of 2021 are allowed to sit for ACT or SAT tests through June 30, 2022.[38]\nFor over 25 years, the HOPE scholarship has dominated the state’s financial aid system, making college more affordable for nearly 2 million students across Georgia. However, while numerous modifications have been made to the program to preserve funding and increase academic eligibility requirements, none of these changes have addressed structural inequities that students face based on race, ethnicity, income and geography.\nAlthough the scholarship has been successful in keeping many high-performing students in the state and increasing college preparation rates, significant disparities remain. The state’s emphasis on increasingly selective merit-based aid means funding needs continue to grow while a large portion of Georgia’s students still lack adequate resources needed to attend and graduate college without significant debt.\nAs Georgia looks towards the future, the state must build a financial aid program that is sustainable and supports the education goals of all Georgians.\nEndnotes\n[1] Barlament, James.

Funded by lottery-ticket revenues, HOPE provides tuition assistance at Georgia public universities, colleges, or technical institutions for students who graduate from a high school in the state with a 3.0, or “B,” average. Students must maintain this average at the college level to retain the scholarship. (The scholarship pays up to $3,000 for students attending private schools.) As of 2018, more than $10 billion in HOPE funds have been awarded to 1.8 million Georgia students.\nIn 1991 the Georgia General Assembly passed an amendment to the state constitution designating lottery proceeds for educational purposes only, and voters ratified the amendment the following year. Concerned with the state of education in Georgia high schools and colleges, Governor Miller allocated much of this revenue to create the HOPE scholarship, with a three-fold purpose. Foremost of these was to improve the quality of education in Georgia by providing an incentive for students to perform better in high school and maintain that performance in college. Miller also hoped that the scholarship program would encourage top-performing high school students to attend college in-state. Finally, HOPE addressed the disparities between college enrollment of whites and African Americans, and between socioeconomic classes.\nHOPE was not entirely merit based upon its inception in 1993. At the time, it paid for two years’ full tuition for students who graduated with a “B” average and had a family income of less than $66,000 per year. The success of the Georgia lottery allowed legislators to expand the income cap in 1994 to $100,000, and in 1995 the General Assembly abolished the income cap. As a completely merit-based scholarship, HOPE has enjoyed enormous growth. In 2016 more than 95,000 college students from Georgia received HOPE funds, including more than 27,000 first-year students.\nThe HOPE scholarship set off a national debate on the effectiveness of merit-based versus need-based programs. Critics point out that HOPE has actually widened the gap between high- and low-income students, as well as widened the disparities in college-going rates for those other than whites and Asians. Scholars argue that the rise in attendance by high-income students at Georgia’s research institutions has raised requirements and tuition, thereby relegating low-income students to lower-tier state schools.\nAllegations of grade inflation at the high school level have resulted in tougher standards for HOPE. In 1996, because nearly 70 percent of HOPE recipients were not maintaining the necessary grade point average at the college level, Governor Miller mandated that high school students hold a “B” average in their core classes (English, math, science, social studies, and foreign language). The change became effective with the high school class of 2000. In 2004 the General Assembly lowered the cap on the number of hours (127 semester or 190 quarter) that HOPE pays for in order to preserve funding.\nFollowing a budget shortfall in 2011, Governor Nathan Deal made further changes to the program, eliminating mandatory fee and book awards and reducing the HOPE scholarship to cover a percentage of tuition set annually by legislators. At the same time, he created the Zell Miller scholarship, which provides full tuition for Georgia high school students who have a minimum 3.7 GPA and a combined score of 1200 on the SAT or 26 on the ACT.\nHOPE has generally been successful in the areas that Governor Miller sought to address and has gained national recognition. A study published in 2006 by the Journal of Labor Economics found that statewide SAT scores had increased by around forty points since the implementation of HOPE and that freshman enrollment at state schools increased by 15 percent between 1988 and 1997. Enrollment by Georgia students at out-of-state historically Black colleges and universities decreased by 34 percent between 1992 and 1994, and in 2006 enrollment by African Americans at all Georgia colleges and universities had increased nearly 70 percent since HOPE’s inception.\nHOPE is also credited with helping to retain many of the state’s best students, which has benefited colleges and universities across Georgia. The national rankings of the University of Georgia, for example, have increased dramatically since the advent of HOPE.\nIn addition to scholarships, the program also offers student aid in the form of grants, including the HOPE grant, Zell Miller grant, HOPE GED grant, and HOPE Career grant.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Minnesota came in at 45th.\nAt first glance, Wisconsin and Minnesota are similar geographically, ethnically and historically. So, why the huge spread?\nThe answer lies in our states’ differing policy playbooks.\nWhile Minnesota is home to many corporate headquarters, including UnitedHealth Group, Target and Best Buy, the state’s economy is lagging.\nA recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows Minnesota ranking below Wisconsin — and dead last in the Midwest — for private sector job creation. Minnesota’s GDP growth lags 2.5 percent below what it should be, had the North Star State kept up with the national average.\nAnd improving Minnesota’s per capita GDP would be tough because it has the third-highest corporate tax rate in the country, with a discouraging top marginal rate of 9.8 percent. It also has one of the highest personal income tax rates in the country at 9.85 percent.\nOne consequence of the lagging economy has been that Minnesotans are leaving – so many that the state faces the possibility of losing one of its congressional seats after the 2020 census.\nBut rather than address these economic issues with pro-growth, market-oriented reforms, Minnesota has continued to pursue policies that rely on tax hikes and increased government spending.\nThe situation is quite different next door.\nBadger State policymakers have changed the game by implementing a series of sweeping reforms that have transformed the state’s economic landscape and turned Wisconsin into an economic powerhouse.\nWisconsin’s latest state budget reduces the personal property tax by $75 million, and eliminated an onerous small business alternative minimum tax and a state-levied property tax.\nCommon-sense policies like the REINS Act eliminate job-killing regulations, while worker freedom laws such as collective bargaining reform and right-to-work have helped Wisconsin live up to its “open for business” motto.\nThanks to these growth-friendly policy reforms, the Badger State has steadily climbed the rankings for best states in the nation to do business. In 2010, Chief Executive Magazine ranked Wisconsin 41st out of 50 for its business climate. This year, Wisconsin ranked 10th.\nNew employment data released this month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks Wisconsin first in the Midwest and second nationally for 12-month manufacturing job gains, further evidence that Wisconsin’s economic policies are working.\nBy following Wisconsin’s lead in enacting common-sense policy reforms, Minnesota could at least put itself on track for an economic comeback — and perhaps avoid an economic blowout of sorts.\nJason Flohrs is state director of Americans for Prosperity-Minnesota.

Scott Walker's Worst Nightmare\nDemocrat Mary Burke is statistically tied in the latest polling with Wisconsin's Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is often discussed as a possible contender for his party's nomination for president in 2016.\nBurke, a Democrat whose family owns a successful bicycle business, is hoping to play spoiler in one of the most closely watched head-to-head races in the country this November. Recent polling from Marquette University Law School shows her with a one-point edge among likely voters, and within one point of Walker among registered voters.\nThe Wisconsin governor's race is part of ABC's \"14 for 14? project, which is tracking key contests across the country between now and November.\nABC News conducted a rapid-fire question/answer session with Burke, delving into the candidate's thoughts on a range of topics, from her ties to Hartland, Wis. to forgiveness for future Packers Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre.\n1. What's something voters don't know about you?\nWell, I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin called Hartland and went to Swallow School and the big memory I have of Swallow is when one of the cows from the Vilter Farm got loose and ran out on to our playground. I'm a fourth-generation Wisconsinite. My great-grandparents were farmers and that's something that - those values drive me every single day.\n2. What's something voters may not know about Gov. Scott Walker?\nSome people are not aware that under Governor Walker our economy in Wisconsin is dead-last in the Midwest. Out of 10 Midwestern states, we're tenth in job creation under Scott Walker.\n3. What do you think Gov. Walker believes about marriage equality?\nHe hasn't been straight with the voters in Wisconsin. He's been waffling on this issue and I think he owes it to the voters in Wisconsin to be clear about where he stands on the issue.\n4. How much of your own money are you willing to put into your campaign?\nWell, I've been pretty clear from the start. I will put into the race what I can of my own resources, but it's a fraction of what will be needed. Over 90 percent of my donations come of $100 or less, and we have had great success. So, I'm focused on raising the money to get my message out.\n5. Should the Packers retire Brett Favre's jersey and induct him into the Hall of Fame? Yay or nay?\nDefinitely a 'yay.' Brett and his family have contributed a lot to Wisconsin, a lot to the winning tradition of the Packers, and I don't think we should be holding a grudge. I think we should be looking at all the contributions he made.\n6. Spotted Cow or Summer Shandy?\nSpotted Cow. New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and [it's] one of my favorites.\nGet real-time election results and news about all the races you care about delivered right to your phone from now until November.

Scott Walker spoke with reporters just as news was breaking out of Federal Appeals Court -- that an injunction halting the John Doe case has been lifted. But Walker cautioned that little had changed -- because the John Doe investigation is still stopped on a state level.\n\"The bottom line is they should know. Late last year, a well-respected court of appeals judge, someone who has no political connections to me or anyone that I'm aware of or to my party, made it clear that he didn't think it was a sufficient case to go forward. And that's where it sits,\" said Gov. Walker\nThe news from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals comes less than six weeks until the election -- and on a day when both Gov. Walker and his Democratic challenger Mary Burke campaign about a mile apart in Milwaukee.\nGov. Walker talks about his record of helping military veterans -- while Burke detailed her jobs plan to a group of women in business.\nMuch of the recent fighting has been over that jobs plan -- and revelations that Burke plagiarized sections word-for-word from other documents.\n\"I've put hundreds of hours into this plan, so it's definitely my plan, but it certainly draws on good ideas from across the country,\" said Burke.\n\"If you spent hundreds of hours on it, then you should probably have an idea of where it came from,\" said Gov. Walker.\nThe jobs plan is about jobs creation -- and Burke is making the case that job creation lagged during Walker's tenure at the Capitol.\n\"We're dead last in the Midwest in terms of job growth under Gov. Walker and the latest jobs report shows we lost 4,300 jobs in August. We need more good ideas,\" said Burke.\n\"Unemployment is 5.6 percent. It's the lowest it's been in nearly six years,\" said Walker.\nKnowing that the economy is the issue voters care about most, Burke asserted that Wisconsin is under-performing.\n\"If our state economy in Wisconsin had grown at just the national average over the last three years while Gov. Walker is in office, our state's economy would be $4 billion a year bigger. 4 billion,\" said Burke.\n\"And if the state's economy had grown under the rate that Mary Burke saw it grow when she was Secretary of Commerce, we'd have about half as many jobs as we do today. So the bottom line is, you've got someone talking potshots, kind of like throwing a rock at a glass house,\" said Walker.\nCLICK HERE to read more stories about the campaign for governor in Wisconsin.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It was then that I learned there’s a difference between civility and politeness and why it’s more important than ever to recognize the distinction.\nPoliteness is a technique: It reflects decorum, mores, manners, and etiquette. It is neither good nor bad itself, but it can be used for good or for ill depending on a person’s motivation.\nAt its best, politeness can help mitigate the awkwardness, discomfort, and annoyance inherent in our social lives—but it will only ever apply surface-level fixes and will never be enough to help us navigate or resolve our most profound and important disagreements.\nAt its worst, politeness can make our disparities worse by fostering feelings of selfishness, pride, and superiority over others. Politeness can be and has been weaponized to penalize difference, silence dissent, and oppress vulnerable voices and populations.\nBy contrast, civility is a holistic disposition—one that our society desperately needs today.\nCivility is based on the fundamental truth that all human beings are created in God’s image and are therefore worthy of basic respect. It sees everyone as inherently valuable and endowed with essential dignity, invoking a general regard for our neighbors and citizens. Civility is rooted in the mutual deference we owe one another as fellow humans and allows us to consider even our enemies as moral equals.\nYet civility can be at odds with politeness, as it sometimes requires that we act in ways that many might consider impolite.\nJesus himself spoke of the perils of politeness and the dangers of being inordinately focused on a polished outward appearance. He constantly exposed and critiqued the religious hypocrites of his day—those who were smug in their self-righteous compliance with ceremonial customs and religious rituals. He knew their meticulousness was merely a cover for their selfishness.\nChrist demonstrated that the act of truth-telling isn’t always polite, but it is right and respectful when it speaks the truth in love. He did not hesitate when it came to calling out the duplicity of the Pharisees—who appeared to act well, though their hearts were angry and bitter:\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.

Bush at the same point in his presidency.\n        Subject(s): bush-administration,pundits,recreation\n        Speaker: al-sharpton\n        Speaker's Job Title: \n        State Info: New York\n        Party Affiliation: democrat\n        Barely-True: 2\n        False: 1\n        Half-True: 1\n        Mostly-True: 1\n        Pants-Fire: 0\n        Context: a segment of his MSNBC show, \"Politics Nation\"\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        PolitiFact: Who vacationed more, Bush or Obama>\nMark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who is considered the authority on tracking the president's daily activities, recently tweeted that \"no presidential numbers I report stir as much reaction and resentment as vacations - except one: golf.\"\nOn the Aug. 9. 2013, edition of Politics Nation, Rev. Al Sharpton said, \"We all love summer traditions, fireworks, barbecues, the beach. And we're seeing the return of a right-wing favorite - attacking the president's vacation.\"\nSharpton told viewers, Obama \"has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in. How many did President (George W.) Bush take by the same point in his presidency? Three hundred and sixty seven. Yes, more than a full year of vacation.\"\nWe wondered whether Sharpton was right that Obama's predecessor took many more vacation days than he has.\nWhen we asked MSNBC for the source of Sharpton's data, a spokeswoman pointed to a story in USA Today. The article says, \"At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller.\"\nTweets by Knoller himself back that up. On the eve of Obama's departure for Martha's Vineyard, Knoller tweeted that \"since taking office, Pres Obama has taken 14 vacation trips spanning all or part of 92 days.\" Knoller also tweeted that \"at the same point in office, Pres. GWBush had made 50 visits to this Texas Ranch totaling all or part of 323 days.\"\nAnother 26 of Bush's vacation days are accounted for by trips to Kennebunkport, with 18 days on vacation at miscellaneous locations, according to Knoller's data. Trips to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland are not included in either president's figures.\nAs the USA Today article noted, Obama doesn't own a vacation home, unlike Bush, who owned his ranch. So while Bush essentially used the ranch as as a working White House, Obama has traveled to a variety of destinations, including his native Hawaii. Because of this, the government may have been able to accrue some per-trip cost savings for Bush by going repeatedly to one location.\nOur ruling: Sharpton has correctly cited data from the leading authority, CBS News' Mark Knoller. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.\nPolitFact is a Pulitzer Prize-winning project of the Tampa Bay Times.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Fact Check: Does Obama spend more time on vacation than his predecessors?\nTimes-Union readers want to know:\nPresident Barack Obama is off on vacation - again. It seems as if he takes a lot of vacation. An email I received confirms that, saying that Obama has been on vacation more than his predecessors. Is that true?\nObama, scheduled to end his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., Sunday, seems to generate a lot of criticism for his family vacations. Viral emails complain about how much it costs for him to go on vacation - transportation, Secret Service protection, moving the White House to a vacation spot - at a time when the economy still hasn't fully recovered.\nRep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, earlier this year introduced a resolution calling on Obama to skip vacations until the White House restored the public tours that were cut because of sequestration. He said the president's trip to Martha's Vineyard appears \"tone deaf.\"\nSupporters contend that a president has to have all the decision-making capabilities while on vacation and, yes, that is pricey to establish.\nBut that is the case for any president, not just Obama.\nAnd they all draw their share of criticism. Franklin Roosevelt, for example, was blistered for vacationing on the presidential yacht and taking a seven-day fishing trip during World War II without letting the media know, according to an article on the vacation controversy in USA Today.\nBut are presidents really on \"vacation?\" Yes, they play golf and partake in other R&R. But they're never totally away from the demands of the presidency. Daily briefings are part of most vacation days. George W. Bush had to deal with Hurricane Katrina during one of his \"vacations,\" while his father, George H.W. Bush, was at his Kennebunkport, Maine, vacation spot when he planned the U.S. response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the USA Today article noted. And Clinton ordered airstrikes against al-Qaida terrorists after U.S. embassies were bombed while he was on \"vacation\" in Martha's Vineyard. Obama himself had to cut short his 2012 Christmas vacation to Hawaii to get back to Washington to avert drastic tax increases before the holiday. And just the other day, he had to address the situation in Egypt.\nSo while days might be counted as \"vacation,\" they might not be exactly fun times.\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton defended Obama on the Aug. 9. 2013, edition of \"Politics Nation,\" on MSNBC. He showed a clip of Fox News' Sean Hannity saying that Obama \"is living a pretty extravagant lifestyle, isn't he? Martha's Vineyard, big expensive vacations, Hawaii, while 50 million Americans are on food stamps.\"\nSharpton retorted, according to PolitiFact.com, that Obama \"has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in. How many did President [George W.] Bush take by the same point in his presidency? Three hundred and sixty seven. Yes, more than a full year of vacation.\"\nPolitiFact.com, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-finding project of the Tampa Bay Times, checked that out. An MSNBC spokeswoman told PolitiFact.com that the source of Sharpton's quote was an article in USA Today in which the information was attributed to CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who has covered every president since Gerald Ford and who keeps track of presidential travel.\nRight before Obama left for Martha's Vineyard, Knoller tweeted that \"since taking office, Pres Obama has taken 14 vacation trips spanning all or part of 92 days.\" Knoller also tweeted that \"at the same point in office, Pres. GWBush had made 50 visits to this Texas Ranch totaling all or part of 323 days.\"\nPolitiFact.com also reported that, according to Knoller's data, 26 more of Bush's vacation days were spent in Kennebunkport, while 18 others were at various other locations - a total of 367 days. (Trips to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland are not included in either president's figures.)\nHawaiiNewsNow has reported that, as of the first of the year, Obama was projected to spend 168 days on holiday. Over eight years, Bill Clinton took 174 vacation days at Martha's Vineyard and Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Ronald Reagan vacationed 349 days at his California ranch.\nPolitiFact.com looked at the two presidents' vacation patterns and what the costs might be.\nThe costs are tough to figure out as no White House has ever been open about expenses, PolitiFact.com notes. But because Bush and Reagan owned their ranches, often the site of working vacations, the government may have been able to save some per-trip cost money for them going repeatedly to one place compared to Obama's various vacation locations.\nCarole Fader: (904) 359-4635\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        George W.

A member of the Republican Party and the eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush, he served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\nBorn into the prominent Bush family in New Haven, Connecticut, Bush flew warplanes in the Texas Air National Guard in his twenties. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. He later co-owned the Major League Baseball team Texas Rangers before being elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind-generated electricity in the United States. In the 2000 presidential election, he won over Democratic incumbent vice president Al Gore while losing the popular vote after a narrow and contested Electoral College win, which involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida.\nIn his first term, Bush signed a major tax-cut program and an education-reform bill, the No Child Left Behind Act. He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based initiatives. He also initiated the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, in 2003, to address the AIDS epidemic. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 decisively reshaped his administration, resulting in the start of the war on terror and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan in an effort to overthrow the Taliban, destroy al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. He signed the Patriot Act to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. He also ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime on the false belief that it possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and had ties with al-Qaeda. Bush later signed the Medicare Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D. In 2004, Bush was re-elected president in a close race, beating Democratic opponent John Kerry and winning the popular vote.\nDuring his second term, Bush made various free trade agreements, appointed John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court, and sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed in Congress. Bush was widely criticized for his administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina and revelations of torture against detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Amid his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. Meanwhile, the Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued; in January 2007, Bush launched a surge of troops in Iraq. By December, the U.S. entered the Great Recession, prompting the Bush administration and Congress to push through economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\nAfter his second term, Bush returned to Texas, where he has maintained a low public profile. At various points in his presidency, he was among both the most popular and the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history. He received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, and one of the lowest ratings during the 2008 financial crisis. Bush left office as one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, with public opinion of him remaining highly divisive. Scholars and historians rank Bush as a below-average to the lower half of presidents.\nEarly life and career\nGeorge Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut.[1] He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings: Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[2] His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut.[3] His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.[4][improper synthesis?]\nEducation\nBush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a college-preparatory school in Piney Point Village, Texas.[5]\nBush later attended Phillips Academy, a boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year.[6][7] He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history.[8] During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.[9][10][11] Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.[12] Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.[13] He characterized himself as an average student.[14] His grade point average during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumerical rating system in his final year.[15]\nIn the fall of 1973, Bush entered Harvard Business School. He graduated in 1975 with a M.B.A. degree, and is the only U.S. president to have earned the degree.[16]\nFamily and personal life\nBush was engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement did not last. Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship.[17] While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year.[18] The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church.[19] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.[18] Bush describes being challenged by Billy Graham to consider faith in Jesus \"Christ as the risen Lord\", how he began to read the Bible daily, \"surrendering\" to the \"Almighty\", that \"faith is a walk\" and that he was \"moved by God's love\".[20]\nAlcohol abuse\nBefore his marriage, Bush repeatedly abused alcohol.[21] On September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was arrested for DUI, was fined $150, and received a brief suspension of his Maine driver's license.[22] Bush said that his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[18] and he attributes his decision to give up alcohol in 1986 to her influence.[23] While governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\"[18] Bush also says that his faith in God was critical in abstaining: \"I believe that God helped open my eyes, which were closing because of booze\".[20]\nHobbies\nBush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[24] During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily,[25] though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is \"not a literalist\" about Bible interpretation.[26][27] Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing \"books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf.[28] Bush has also painted many paintings. One of his best-known projects is a collection of 43 paintings of immigrants, titled Out of Many, One.[29] Another painting project was Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warrior.[30]\nMilitary career\nIn May 1968, Bush joined the United States Air Force and was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[31] After two years of training in active-duty service,[32] he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base.[31][33] Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[31] In June 2005, the Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[34]\nIn late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He had moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount.[35][36] In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.[37] He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.[38]\nBush remains the most recent president to have served in the military.[39]\nBusiness career\nIn 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, which began operations in 1978.[40][41] He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into Harken Energy Corporation,[42] with Bush becoming a member of Harken's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving Harken arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[43]\nIn April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest of Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers for $89 million and invested $500,000 himself to start. He then was managing general partner for five years.[44] He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.[45] Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15 million from his initial $800,000 investment.[46]\nIn the early or mid 1990s, before his gubernatorial campaign, Bush briefly considered a candidacy to become the Commissioner of Baseball.[47][48][49]\nEarly political involvement\nIn 1978, Bush ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election, receiving 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.[50]\nBush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.[51][52] He was a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[53] In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign as a campaign advisor.[54] The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu to resign.[55]\nTexas governorship (1995–2000)\nBush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship in Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement.[53] Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.[56]\nAfter easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent governor Ann Richards.[53][57] In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor.[58] According to The Atlantic, the race \"featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs\".[59] The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[60] but Rove denied being involved.[61] Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent of the vote against Richards' 45.9 percent.[62]\nBush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax cut, $2 billion.[56] He extended government funding for organizations providing education on the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence.[63] His administration lowered the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14.[64] Bush presided over 152 executions,[65] more than any previous governor in modern American history; critics such as Helen Prejean argue that he failed to give serious consideration to clemency requests.[66][67] Critics also contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.[53]\nIn 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[68][69][70] which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.[71][72]\nIn 1998, Bush won re-election with a record[53] 68 percent of the vote.[73] He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[53] During his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings, which ranged between 62 and 81 percent.[53][74] He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he urged all Texans to \"answer the call to serve those in need\".[75]\nThroughout Bush's first term, he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared, and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.[53]\nPresidential campaigns\n2000 presidential candidacy\nPrimary\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.[53] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and Arizona senator John McCain.[53]\nBush won the Iowa caucuses and, although heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, trailed McCain by 19% and lost. Despite this, he regained momentum and effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary, which according to The Boston Globe made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign.[76][77][78]\nGeneral election\nOn July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney – a former White House chief of staff, U.S. representative, and secretary of defense – to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.[79]\nBush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[53] During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent vice president Al Gore, over gun control and taxation.[80]\nWhen the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount.[53] The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.[81] On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling,[82] the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[53] The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million casts.[83] Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore had actually been awarded 267 votes by the states pledged to him plus the District of Columbia, but one D.C. elector abstained). Bush was the first person to win a U.S. presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.[83]\n2004 presidential candidacy\nIn his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy.[84] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[85] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[86] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,[85][87] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts,[85] creation of an ownership society,[85] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[88] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants,[85] which was criticized by conservatives.[89]\nThe Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,[53] and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the war on terror.\nFollowing the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.[90] After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.[91]\nIn the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7% to Kerry's 48.3%).[92]\nPresidency (2001–2009)\nBush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks.[93] Wars were begun in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[94] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[95] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[96]\nDomestic policy\nEconomic policy\nBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.[97] The September 11 terrorist attacks also impacted the economy.\nHis administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (66%), while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14%, corporate tax revenues by 50%, and customs and duties by 40%. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107%, discretionary domestic spending by 62%, Medicare spending by 131%, social security by 51%, and income security spending by 130%. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35% and spending by 65%.[98] The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.[99] The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.[100]\nThe surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion – the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[101] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.[102] Facing congressional opposition, Bush held town hall-style meetings across the U.S. to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program, one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[53] Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying \"the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.\"[53] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[103] Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.[104] O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[105] By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[53] Another tax cut was passed that year.[106]\nBetween 2001 and 2008, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125%,[107] less than for past business cycles.[108] Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.[109] Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began.[110]\nUnemployment originally rose from 4.2% in January 2001 to 6.3% in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5% in July 2007.[111] Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,[112] while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University noted that \"Median real after-tax household income went up two percent\".[113] The poverty rate increased from 11.3% in 2000 to 12.3% in 2006 after peaking at 12.7% in 2004.[114] By October 2008, due to increases in spending,[115]: 273 the U.S. national debt had risen to $11.3 trillion,[116] more than doubling it since 2000.[117][118][unreliable source?] Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the \"Bush tax cuts\" and increased national security spending.[119] In March 2006, then-senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: \"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\"[120] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2%.[121]\n2008 financial crisis\nIn December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession,[96] caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and other factors. In February 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record,[122] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.[123] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.[124] By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost 2.6 million jobs.[125]\nTo aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses.[126] The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,[127] and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[128][129][130] In September 2008, the 2008 financial crisis intensified, beginning with the Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85 billion.[131]\nMany economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.[132][133] Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.[134] Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.[135] Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said \"it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely\", and additionally, that it would have helped \"for Congress to have held hearings\".[129]\nEducation and public health\nBush undertook many educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.[136]\nOne of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[137] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[138] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \"No Child Left Behind\" into law.[139] Critics[who?] argue that it is underfunded[140][better source needed] and that NCLBA's focus on \"high-stakes testing\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[141]\nOn November 1, 2005, Bush launched a National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, which culminated in an implementation plan published by the Homeland Security Council in May 2006.[142][143]\nAfter being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in \"the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years\" – the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.[115]: 274 In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded healthcare benefits and plans to children of some low-income families. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[144] Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[145]\nOn May 21, 2008, Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person's genetic information. The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research.[146][147]\nSocial services and Social Security\nFollowing Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[148] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \"better choices and more control over their health care\".[149]\nBush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security,[150] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[150] In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[150] Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[150]\nBush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as \"Conversations on Social Security\" in an attempt to gain public support.[151] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined,[152] and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[153] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina.[154]\nEnvironmental policies\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80% of the world's population[155] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[156] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.\nIn May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,[157] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[158]\nIn 2002, Bush proposed the Clear Skies Act of 2003,[159] which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.[160] The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.[citation needed]\nLater in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[161] The move was hailed by conservationists for \"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area\".[162]\nBush has said he believes that global warming is real[163] and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a \"debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused\".[164] The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration[165] misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.[166]\nEnergy policies\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and launched his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research.[167]\nIn his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.[168] Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.[169] However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said: \"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\"[169] Bush had said in June 2008, \"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells ... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\"[170]\nIn his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush committed $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, \"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\" He also presented plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \"This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\"[171]\nStem cell research and first veto\nFederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey–Wicker Amendment in 1995.[172] Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.[173] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \"lines\" of stem cells,[174] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.[175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey–Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.[176]\nImmigration\nNearly eight million immigrants came to the U.S. from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.[177] Almost half entered illegally.[178][unreliable source?] In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than twelve million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \"temporary guest-worker program\". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border.[179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.[180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and worksite enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \"merit\" system for green cards; elimination of \"chain migration\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.[181] Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.[182]\nA heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[183] The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote.[184] Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[185] The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.[186]\nOn September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.[187]\nHurricane Katrina\nHurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.[188]\nBush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27[189] and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day.[190] The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana,[191] officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.\nOn August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \"an incident of national significance\",[192] triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans.[193] The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \"not enough\".[194]\nAs the disaster in New Orleans intensified, Bush received widespread criticism for downplaying his administration's role in the inadequate response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown;[195] federal resources to respond were also limited as a result of being allocated to the Iraq War,[196] and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.[197][198] Bush responded to mounting criticism by claiming to accept full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.[193] It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.[199]\nMidterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys\nDuring Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys.[200] The White House maintained that they were fired for poor performance.[201] Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.[202][203] The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten not to comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all his advisers were covered under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.[204]\nAlthough congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.[205] On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas.[206]\nIn all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales[207] and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson,[208] Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling,[209] aide to the president Karl Rove[210] and his senior aide Sara Taylor.[211] In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers[212] and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten[213] were both found in contempt of Congress.[211]\nIn 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,[214] the firings were \"inappropriately political\" but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.[215]\nForeign policy\nDuring his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationships with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense.[216] Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.[217]\nBush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.[218]\nIn March 2006, Bush visited India in a trip focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy, counter-terrorism co-operation, and discussions that would eventually lead to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.[219][220] This was in stark contrast to decades of U.S. policy, such as the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as \"sanctions and hectoring\".[221]\nMidway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.[222]\nBush signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia. He withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including, in 2002, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia.[223] This marked the first time in post-World War II history that the United States had withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.[224] Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that American withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was a mistake.[225]\nBush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.\nBush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.[226] Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but he opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.\nOn June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania.[227] He later voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo.[228]\nIn early 2008, Bush vowed full support for admitting Ukraine and Georgia into NATO[229] despite Russia's opposition to the further enlargement of NATO.[230] During the 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis, Bush condemned Russia for recognizing the separatist government of South Ossetia.[231] When Russian troops invaded Georgia later that summer, Bush said: \"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century.\"[232]\nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on rubble: \"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\"[233]\nIn a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \"hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate\".[234] The Taliban's leader, Mullah Omar, refused to hand over bin Laden.[235]\nThe continued presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia after the 1991 Gulf War was one of the stated motivations behind the September 11 attacks. In 2003, the U.S. withdrew most of its troops from Saudi Arabia.[236]\nWar on terror\nIn Bush's September 20 speech, he declared that \"our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there.\"[237][238] In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \"axis of evil\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Ba'athist Iraq was \"arming to threaten the peace of the world\" and \"pose[d] a grave and growing danger\".[239] The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.[240] This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks.[241]\nDissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.[242][243][244] The Iraq war sparked many protests and riots in different parts of the world.[245] In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the \"cause célèbre for jihadists\".[246][247]\nAfghanistan invasion\nOn October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[248] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[248] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.[249][250]\nEfforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[251] It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration.\nDespite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.[252] The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned.[253] In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success.[254][255][256] As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.[257]\nIraq invasion\nBeginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction.[239][258]\nIn the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.[259][260] Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.[261][262]\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.[263] The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.[264] The Bush administration's claim that the Iraq War was part of the war on terror had been questioned and contested by political analysts.[265]\nMore than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom) designated the \"coalition of the willing\" joined the United States[266] in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech was later criticized as premature.[267] From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq.[268] Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was \"grave and deteriorating\". While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regard to the stability of Iraq,[269] he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.[270][271] According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.[272]\nIn January 2005, elections recognized by the West as free and fair were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.[273] This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.[274]\nOn January 10, 2007, Bush launched a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion (equivalent to $1.8 billion in 2024) for these programs.[275] On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,[276] saying the debate over the conflict was \"understandable\" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.[277]\nIn March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's \"bold decision\" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it \"a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq\".[278] He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections.[279] By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,[280] and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush withdrew of additional American forces.[280] During Bush's last visit to Iraq in December 2008, Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes at him during an official press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.[281] Al-Zaidi yelled that the shoes were a \"farewell kiss\" and \"for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq\".[282]\nIn March 2010, Center for Public Integrity released a report that President Bush's administration had made more than 900 false pretenses in a two-year period about the alleged threat of Iraq against the United States, as his rationale to engage in war in Iraq.[283]\nSurveillance\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the President's Surveillance Program. The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[284] As of 2009[update], the other provisions of the program remained highly classified.[285] Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[286] The program proved to be controversial; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal.[287] In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional,[288] but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.[289] On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.[290] Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.[291] This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post[291] and The Guardian[292] emerged in June 2013.[291]\nInterrogation policies\nBush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture.[293][294][295][296] Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture, which was described as \"an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\".[297][298] The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn.[299] While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert \"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\",[297] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \"provided critical information\" to preserve American lives.[300] Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\"[301]\nOn October 17, 2006, Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law.[302] The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006),[303] which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denied the detainees access to habeas corpus and barred the torture of prisoners. The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes \"torture\".[302]\nOn March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,[304] a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that \"the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror\".[305] In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.[306] One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.[307]\nNorth Korea condemnation\nBush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an \"axis of evil\". He said that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\"[239] Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\"[308] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \"[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\".[239] Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and said that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable.[309] On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China.[310] On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.[311] By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.[312]\nOn June 22, 2010, Bush said: \"While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly,\" adding that communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation, and brutal suppression. \"In recent years,\" he went on to say, \"the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs.\"[313]\nSyria sanctions\nBush expanded economic sanctions on Syria.[314] In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction[315] and being supportive of terrorism.[316] Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and former leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.[317]\nAIDS Relief\nIn the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Bush announced $15 billion for this effort,[318] which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide.[319] The U.S. government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization),[320] which saved an estimated five million lives by 2013.[321] The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker wrote in 2013 that \"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\"[321] By 2023, PEPFAR was estimated to have saved over 25 million lives, alleviating the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and was called \"George W. Bush's greatest accomplishment\" by Vox.[322][323][324]\nSecurity incidents\n2001 White House shooting\nOn February 7, 2001, while Bush was in the residence area of the White House, Robert W. Pickett, standing outside the perimeter fence, discharged a number of shots from a Taurus .38 Special revolver \"in the general direction\" of the White House. Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S. Secret Service agent and arrested. Furthermore, he was initially charged with discharging a firearm during a crime, carrying a 10-year mandatory sentence, but following a plea agreement, Pickett instead entered a guilty plea to a firearms violation and an Alford plea to assaulting a federal officer. He was sentenced to three years at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester followed by three years of probation.[325][326][327][328]\n2005 Tbilisi grenade attack\nOn May 10, 2005, while President Bush was giving a speech in Freedom Square, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade toward the podium. It landed in the crowd about 61 feet (19 m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate because a red tartan handkerchief was wrapped tightly around it, preventing the safety lever from detaching.[329][330] Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. After escaping that day, Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005. During his arrest, he killed an Interior Ministry agent. He was convicted in January 2006 and given a life sentence.[331][332]\n2008 Baghdad shoe-throwing incident\nOn December 14, 2008, Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, threw both of his shoes at Bush during a press conference in Baghdad. Bush was not injured, having ducked the pair of shoes.[333] However, White House press secretary Dana Perino received a bruise on her face after being hit by a microphone boom knocked over by security.[334] Al-Zaidi received a three-year prison sentence which was reduced to one year. On September 15, 2009, he was released early for good behavior.[333]\nJudicial appointments\nSupreme Court\nOn July 19, 2005, following the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on July 1, Bush nominated federal appellate judge John Roberts as her replacement; however, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, that still-pending nomination was withdrawn on September 5, with Bush instead nominating Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2005.[335]\nOn October 3, 2005, Bush nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to succeed O'Connor; however, Miers withdrew her nomination on October 27 after encountering significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law.[115]: 278 Finally, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito, who was confirmed by the Senate to replace O'Connor on January 31, 2006.[336]\nOther courts\nIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 62 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts.[citation needed]\nCultural and political image\nImage\nBush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations to his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image.[337][338] \"I think people look at him and think John Wayne\", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror.[339]\nBush has been parodied by the media,[340] comedians, and other politicians.[341] Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms.[342]\nIn contrast to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.[343]\nTony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is \"ludicrous\" and that Bush is \"very smart\".[344] In an interview with Playboy, The New York Times columnist David Brooks said Bush \"was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so he puts on a Texas act.\"[345][unreliable source?]\nJob approval\nBush began his presidency with approval ratings near 60 percent.[346] After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent,[347] maintaining 80–90 percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term[348] and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term.[349]\nIn 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe \"has done the most to influence the events of the year\".[350] In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.[351] However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.[352]\nWithin the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.[353] While 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for Bush, 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry.[353] According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.[353]\nBush's approval rating surged to 74 percent at the beginning of the Iraq War, up 19 points from his pre-war rating of 55 percent.[354] Bush's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004.[355] Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[356][357][358] for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina,[359][360][361] and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies.[362]\nAmid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections. Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush,[363] the lowest for any second-term president at that point in his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28 percent),[355][364] which contributed to what Bush called the \"thumping\" of the Republican Party in the 2006 elections.[365] Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[366] the average for his entire second term was 37 percent, according to Gallup.[367]\nBy the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans.[349] Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being \"the worst president\",[368][369] Bush would say, \"I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.\"[370]\nThere were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action.[371] The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,[372] the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions.[373] Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was \"off the table\".[374]\nIn April 2008, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69 percent of those polled disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving – although the majority (66 percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.[375]\nIn polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent,[376][377] while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent.[377][378] In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24 percent).[379] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent, the lowest in American history.[376]\nForeign perceptions\nBush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization movements for his administration's foreign policy.[380][381] Views of him within the international community – even in France, a close ally of the United States – were more negative than those of most previous American presidents.[382]\nBush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the United Kingdom and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.[383][384][385] Other leaders, such as Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan,[386] Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,[387] José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain,[388] and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela,[389] openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.[390]\nIn 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.[391][392] In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.[393] The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express \"a lot of confidence\" or \"some confidence\" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.[394] A March 2007 survey of public opinion in six Arab nations conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked world leader.[395]\nDuring a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim[396] Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8 million,[397] has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy.[398] A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him.[399][400] A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana.[401] The Bush administration's support for the unilateral declaration of independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.[402]\nPost-presidency (2009–present)\nResidence\nAfter the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas, and then returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas.[403] They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas where they live.[404]\nBush made regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas–Fort Worth area, including the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys' first game in the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington[405] and an April 2009 Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in, which was met with a standing ovation.[406] He also attended every home playoff game during the Rangers' 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31.[407] He also threw the first pitch in Game 1 of the 2023 World Series.[408]\nOn August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination.[409]\nIn reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush said: \"Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities.\"[410]\nPublications and appearances\nSince leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile.[411] Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.[412][413]\nIn March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, Alberta,[414][415] appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a \"special place in American history\",[416] and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy.[417] Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the \"Get Motivated\" seminar in Dallas.[418] In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting on November 5, 2009, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and the victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.[419]\nBush released his memoirs, Decision Points, on November 9, 2010.[420] During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping \"the country safe amid a real danger\", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform.[421] He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, \"I'd do it again to save lives.\"[422]\nIn 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.[423][424] He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas.[425] Bush did not physically appear in that year's Republican National Convention (where Mitt Romney obtained the party's nomination for president), instead appearing in a videotape, in which he –alongside his father and immediate family– explains his motives to support Romney.[426]\nBush appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with his wife Laura. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said: \"I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor.\"[427] Despite this statement, Bush vocally disagreed with Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a \"strategic blunder\".[428] In December, Bush travelled with President Obama to the memorial service of South African president and civil rights leader Nelson Mandela.[429] There, they joined former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.[430]\nAlongside the 2014 United States–Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult.[431] On November 2, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C.[25][432] On November 11, Bush published a biography of his father titled 41: A Portrait of My Father.[433]\nIn an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said \"boots on the ground\" would be needed to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that they indeed were defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining Obama.[434]\nDuring the early stages of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Bush spoke and campaigned for his brother Jeb Bush at a South Carolina rally.[435][unreliable source?] However, the party's nomination eventually went to Donald Trump, whom Bush refused to endorse.[436] Furthermore, he did not attend the party's convention.[437][438] On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party, telling a group of his former aides and advisors that \"I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president.\"[439][440] According to a spokesperson for the Bush family, he did not vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton in the general election, instead choosing to leave his presidential ballot blank.[441]\nAfter the 2016 elections, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory.[442] On January 20, 2017, Bush and his wife attended Trump's first inauguration. Images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.[443] While leaving the event, Bush allegedly described the ceremony, and Trump's inaugural address in particular, as \"some weird shit\".[444]\nIn February 2017, Bush released a book of his own portraits of veterans called Portraits of Courage.[445] In August, following the white nationalist Unite the Right rally, Bush and his father released a joint statement condemning the violence and ideologies present there.[446] Subsequently, Bush gave a speech in New York where he noted of the current political climate, \"Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.\" He continued, \"Bigotry in any form is blasphemy against the American creed and it means the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation\", while urging citizens to oppose threats to American democracy and be positive role models for young people.[447] The speech was widely interpreted as a denouncement of Donald Trump and his ideologies, despite Bush not mentioning Trump by name.[447][448][449][450]\nOn September 1, 2018, Bush and his wife attended the funeral of John McCain at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., where Bush spoke.[451] On November 30, his father died at his home. Shortly before his death, Bush was able to talk with his father on the phone; his father responded with what would be his last words, \"I love you too\".[452] Bush attended his father's funeral on December 5, delivering a eulogy.[453] In May 2019 on the tenth anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's death, Bush visited South Korea to pay respects to Roh, delivering a short eulogy.[454]\nOn June 1, 2020, Bush released a statement addressing the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent nationwide reaction and protests.[455][456] In the statement, Bush wrote that he and former first lady Laura Bush \"are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country\".[457] He also elaborated on the racial injustices perpetrated by the police saying, that \"it is time for America to examine our tragic failures\", adding \"Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions\".[458] On July 30, Bush and his wife, along with former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, attended and spoke at the funeral for civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.[459]\nBush did not give any endorsements during the 2020 presidential election,[460] but held a virtual fundraiser for U.S. senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Martha McSally (R-AZ), and Thom Tillis (R-NC). All four were up for reelection and were struggling in the polls.[461] He also did not attend the 2020 Republican National Convention where President Trump was re-nominated.[462] In April 2021, Bush told People magazine that he did not vote for either Trump or Joe Biden in the general election. Instead, he wrote in Condoleezza Rice, who served as his national security advisor from 2001 to 2005 and as his secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.[463] When the election was called for Biden, Bush congratulated him and his running mate Kamala Harris. He also congratulated Trump and his supporters \"on a hard-fought campaign\". Bush's outreach to Biden was notable since Republican candidate Donald Trump had not yet conceded. Bush then issued a statement saying that while Trump was within his rights to call for recounts, he believed the election was \"fundamentally fair\" and that \"its outcome is clear\", and said he would offer Biden \"my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can\", as he had for Trump and Obama.[464][465][466]\nOn January 6, 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, Bush denounced the violence and attack alongside the three other living former presidents, Obama, Clinton, and Carter,[467] releasing a statement saying that \"this is how election results are disputed in a banana republic, not our democratic republic\",[468] and that \"it is a sickening and heartbreaking sight\".[469] He also echoed president-elect Biden's message saying that what occurred at the capitol was an \"insurrection\".[470] On January 20, Bush and his wife attended Biden's inauguration.[471]\nBush opposed President Biden's withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, saying that the withdrawal made him \"concerned\" and that it had the potential to \"create a vacuum, and into that vacuum is likely to come people who treat women as second class citizens\".[472] During an interview with Deutsche Welle on July 14, 2021, Bush reaffirmed his opposition to the troop withdrawal, calling the plan \"a mistake\".[473]\nOn September 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Bush gave a speech at the Flight 93 National Memorial, praising the heroism of the people on Flight 93 and the spirit of America. He also said that he \"saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor's hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America I know.\"[474]\nBush condemned the assassination attempt on then-former president Trump, who was the presumptive Republican nominee, on July 13, 2024, calling it \"cowardly\" and applauded the Secret Service's response.[475] However, Bush did not participate in that year's Republican National Convention, which took place two days after the attempt, and where Trump was nominated for a third time.[476] He also chose not to endorse any candidate in the presidential election.[477] After the election was called for Trump, Bush offered his congratulations to him and his running mate JD Vance. He stated that the large turnout for the election was a \"sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions\". He also congratulated Biden and Harris on their years of public office.[478] On January 20, 2025, Bush and his wife attended Trump's second inauguration.[479] On September 10, 2025, Bush released a statement condemning the assassination of Charlie Kirk. He wrote \"Today, a young man was murdered in cold blood while expressing his political views. It happened on a college campus, where the open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct.\" He also elaborated on political violence in the United States: \"Violence and vitriol must be purged from the public square. Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens. May God bless Charlie Kirk and his family, and may God guide America toward civility.\"[480]\nAfter Peyton Manning tried to get Bush to appear on Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli for five years, Bush relented. On the show on November 17, 2025, Bush said that he grew up a Houston Astros and a Houston Oilers fan watching Earl Campbell and Dan Pastorini (he called Pastorini, Dante Pastorini) play for the Oilers. Bush also mentioned Billy \"White Shoes\" Johnson. Bush said that he and his group bought the Texas Rangers and he moved to Dallas the same year that Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys. At that time, Bush got to know Jones well and switched his allegiance to the Cowboys. Bush mentioned that his father liked the Houston Texans and the Astros, calling him a loyal Houston guy. He said George H. W. Bush was a friend of the Texans' owner. When Peyton Manning asked George W. Bush if he thought that he would have a job in public service, Bush answered no and that he would have behaved a lot better in college if he had known. “I admired my dad a lot... he never said, this is what you have to do with your life, he just said, here's this kind of way I'd like you to live, honesty and decency and compassion, but you be what you want to be... it took me a while to figure out what I wanted to be, by the way.”\nBush talked about growing up in Midland, Texas. He said you either picked art or football. \"I chose football.\" He has run marathons. Willie Mays has been a hero of his.[481] On November 20, 2025, Bush and his wife attended the funeral of his former vice president Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., where Bush spoke.[citation needed]\nCollaborations\nIn January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month.[482] On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed.[483] The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who had lost five sons during the Civil War.[484]\nOn September 7, 2017, Bush partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[485] Over the years, President Bush has had a good-natured friendship with Michelle Obama. \"President Bush and I, we are forever seatmates because of protocol, and that's how we sit at all the official functions,\" Obama told the Today Show. \"He's my partner in crime at every major thing where all the 'formers' gather. So we're together all the time.\"[486] Bush famously passed mints to Obama during the McCain funeral in September 2018 and gave them to her again during the funeral of his father in December 2018.[487]\nArt\nAfter serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay \"Painting as a Pastime\". Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life.[488] He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair.[489][490][491] In February 2017, Bush released a book of portraits of veterans, Portraits of Courage.[445] The net proceeds from his book are donated to the George W. Bush Presidential Center. In May 2019, on the tenth anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's death, George Bush drew a portrait of Roh to give to his family.[454]\nLegacy\nBush's legacy continues to develop, as time passing allows the development of a more nuanced historical perspective. Supporters credit his counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the U.S. after the September 11 attacks and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction after claiming they were in Iraq, as well as Bush's handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis, as proof that he was unfit to be president.[492][493][494] Ben Ferencz, former chief prosecutor for the United States Army at the Nuremberg Trials, stated that Bush likely committed war crimes in relation to the Iraq War.[495][496][497]\nSeveral historians and commentators hold that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a \"transformative\" one, and said that \"some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on\".[498] Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as \"the most noteworthy president since FDR\" and said the Patriot Act \"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable\" as evidence.[499] Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the presidency of Ronald Reagan,[500] and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society.[501]\nBush has been widely portrayed in film and television, both during and after his presidency.[502][503][504] He has had various nicknames including \"Dubya\",[505] \"GWB\"[506] and \"Shrub\".[507]\nReception\nThe George W. Bush presidency has been ranked as below-average in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s.[508][509][510]\nA 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.[511] Bush said in 2013, \"Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did.\"[512] C-SPAN's 2021 survey of historians ranked Bush as the 29th-best president; Bush had initially been ranked the 36th in 2009.[513]\nAmong the public, his reputation has improved in the United States since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that \"Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office.\"[514] Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.[515] A poll conducted in June 2013 marked the first time recorded by Gallup where his ratings have been more positive than negative, with 49 percent viewing him favorably compared to 46 percent unfavorably.[516] Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[517] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005.[518] Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the Iraq War (57 percent).[519] His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[518] A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43 percent of independents calling it a success.[520] Bush's public image saw greater improvement in 2017, with a YouGov survey showing 51 percent of favorability from Democrats.[521] A 2018 CNN poll subsequently found that 61 percent of respondents held a favorable view of Bush, an increase of nine points from 2015.[522] The improvement has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to Donald Trump's first presidency,[523][524][525] an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.[526]\nHonors and awards\nA street in Tirana, Albania, located directly outside the Albanian Parliament and formerly known as Rruga Punëtorët e Rilindjes, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.[400] In 2012, Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO.[527] Two elementary schools are named after him: one in Stockton Unified School District in Stockton, California,[528] and one in Wylie Independent School District in St. Paul, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.[529]\nNotes\n- ^ He also became commonly known as \"Bush Junior\", \"Bush 43\", and \"Bush the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father, George H. W. Bush, who served as the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993.\nReferences\n- ^ Ahles, Dick (December 24, 2000). \"Bush's Birthplace? It's Deep in the Heart of ... New Haven\". The New York Times.
