Unintended pregnancies and short interpregnancy intervals are associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes (1,2). In 2001, the year for which the most recent data are available, 49% of all pregnancies were unintended (3), and 21% of women gave birth within 24 months of a previous birth (4). Two Healthy People 2010 goals are to increase the percentage of intended pregnancies to 70% (objective 9-1) and to reduce the percentage of births occurring within 24 months of a previous birth to 6% (objective 9-2) (5). To estimate the prevalence and types of contraception being used by women 2--9 months postpartum, CDC analyzed data from the 2004--2006 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 12 states and New York City. This report summarizes those results, which indicated that 88.0% of postpartum women reported current use of at least one contraceptive method; 61.7% reported using a method defined as highly effective, 20.0% used a method defined as moderately effective, and 6.4% used less effective methods. Rates of using highly effective contraceptive methods postpartum were lowest among Asian/Pacific Islanders (35.3%), women who had wanted to get pregnant sooner (49.9%), women aged ≥35 years (53.0%), and women who had no prenatal care (54.5%). State policy makers and health-care providers can use these results to promote use of highly effective contraception among postpartum women and target interventions for those with particularly low rates of usage, including women with no prenatal care.\nPRAMS began in 1987 as an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live infants. The system currently is active in 39 reporting areas in the United States. PRAMS uses a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered questionnaires are mailed monthly to a stratified random sample of mothers selected from birth certificates 2--4 months after delivery (median = 3.7 months). Nonresponders receive follow-up telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets.*\nThe PRAMS questionnaire in each state includes core questions that appear on all PRAMS surveys, optional standard questions, and questions developed by the state. The 2004--2006 surveys incorporated various topics, including current contraceptive practices. Respondents were asked, \"Are you or your husband or partner doing anything now to keep from getting pregnant?\" (core question) and \"What kind of birth control are you or your husband or partner using now to keep from getting pregnant?\" (standard question). Participants who responded \"no\" to the first question were classified as using no method and were not asked the second question, which included response options for 13 specific contraceptive methods and \"other,\" with instructions to \"check all that apply.\" The standard question about postpartum contraceptive method type was used by 14 reporting areas; however, to minimize bias resulting from nonresponse, this report only includes data from 13 reporting areas that achieved overall weighted response rates of ≥70% for at least 1 year of the study period. Responses from Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska, New York, New York City, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and West Virginia were assessed for this report. To focus on postpartum women at risk for unintended pregnancy or short interpregnancy interval, responses from women who were currently pregnant (n = 362) or not currently sexually active (n = 3,615) were excluded. Respondents who answered \"yes\" to the core question and either did not respond to the second question (n = 267) or only responded \"other\" (n = 310) also were excluded.\nContraceptive methods were categorized by effectiveness based on published effectiveness rates for typical use (6). Women reporting use of more than one contraceptive method were classified as using the more effective method based on a hierarchy of effectiveness rates during the first year of typical use (6). Contraceptive effectiveness was categorized as highly effective (<10% of women experience an unintended pregnancy; includes sterilization, intrauterine device, shot, pill, patch, and ring), moderately effective (10%--15% failure rate; includes condoms), and less effective (>15% failure rate; includes diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, rhythm, and withdrawal). Chi-square testing was used to identify statistically significant differences between subcategories of maternal characteristics.\nAmong 43,887 postpartum women in the sample, 88.0% reported current use of at least one method of contraception during 2004--2006 (Table 1). Women with the lowest rates of using at least one method included those with no prenatal care (76.9%), women who reported that for their most recent pregnancy they wanted to get pregnant sooner (80.1%), Asian/Pacific Islanders (82.8%), and women aged ≥35 years (83.2%) (Table 2). Among all respondents, 61.7% reported using highly effective contraceptive methods, 20.0% relied on moderately effective methods, 6.4% used less effective methods, and 12.0% used no method. Prevalence of using highly effective contraceptive methods varied from 43.2% in New York City to 79.3% in Mississippi (Table 1). Use of highly effective postpartum contraceptive methods also varied by the respondent's age, ranging from 53.0% among women aged ≥35 years to 72.9% among those aged <20 years; and by race, ranging from 35.3% among Asian/Pacific Islanders to 71.3% among black women and 71.5% among American Indian/Alaska Native women (Table 2). Women with Medicaid coverage before pregnancy had a higher rate of using highly effective methods (67.8%) than women without Medicaid (60.6%), and women with no prenatal care had a lower rate of using highly effective methods (54.5%) than women with early (60.5%) or late (66.5%) entry into prenatal care.\nReported by: M Whiteman, PhD, K Curtis, PhD, S Hillis, PhD, L Zapata, PhD, DV D'Angelo, MPH, SL Farr, PhD, Y Zhang, PhD, W Barfield, MD, P Marchbanks, PhD, Div of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; CL Robbins, PhD, EIS Officer, CDC.\nEditorial Note:\nDespite availability and use of contraceptives, the overall unintended pregnancy rate in the United States has remained stable (3) and is one of the highest among industrialized nations (51 per 1,000 women annually) (2,3,5). In addition, the percentage of births occurring within 24 months of a previous birth increased from 11% in 1995 (5) to 21% in 2002 (4) (the most recent data available), moving away from the Healthy People 2010 target of 6% (5). Increased use of highly effective postpartum contraception is an important strategy to both prevent unintended pregnancy in the postpartum period and prevent short interpregnancy intervals (7).\nThis is the first population-based report to examine the prevalence of contraceptive use among postpartum women by contraceptive method effectiveness. The finding that 88% of postpartum women reported current use of some form of contraception is consistent with previous estimates of 78%--90% (7--10). Rates of using at least one method were generally uniform across reporting areas and maternal characteristics, although women with no prenatal care had the lowest rate at 76.4%. However, the findings indicate substantial variation in use of highly effective contraceptive methods by reporting area and maternal characteristics. For example, some subgroups with the lowest rates of highly effective contraceptive method use included Asian/Pacific Islanders (35.3%), women who reported that their most recent pregnancy was wanted sooner (49.9%), women aged ≥35 years (53.0%), and women who had no prenatal care (54.5%). Additional analyses and research are needed to determine reasons for the variations found in the use of highly effective methods by reporting area and maternal characteristics.\nThese findings point to possible missed opportunities for promoting healthy birth spacing and reducing unintended pregnancies. Women who do not receive prenatal care, for example, might benefit from more consultation about postpartum contraceptive options. This population likely does not routinely access preventive health-care services. Therefore, for these women the period after delivery and before hospital discharge might constitute an especially opportune time for health-care providers to promote the use of effective contraception postpartum and adequate birth spacing.\nAlthough use of condoms for protection against sexually transmitted diseases was not a focus of the study, 13% of the women reported use of condoms along with a highly effective method. All women not using condoms should be counseled regarding the use of condoms for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infection.†\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, although population based, these findings are not nationally representative and are generalizable only to mothers with recent live births in the 13 reporting areas. Second, because PRAMS data are self-reported, prevalence rates of desirable behaviors might be overestimated and those for undesirable behaviors might be underestimated. Third, the survey did not ascertain use of some additional contraceptive methods, such as spermicides, emergency contraception, and lactational amenorrhea. Finally, because of the survey skip pattern, information was not obtained about contraceptive methods used by women who might have incorrectly reported they were not doing anything currently to keep from getting pregnant. If this occurred, particularly among respondents who had a tubal ligation or whose partners had a vasectomy, the use of highly effective contraceptive methods might have been underestimated.\nKnowing the characteristics associated with low rates of effective contraceptive use during the postpartum period will better enable health-care providers to target interventions. Health-care providers should consider encouraging postpartum women to use highly effective contraceptive methods to increase the proportion of pregnancies that are intended and promote healthy birth spacing.\nAcknowledgments\nThe findings in this report are based, in part on contributions by members of the PRAMS Working Group; the CDC PRAMS Team, Div of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.\nReferences\n- Zhu BP, Rolfs RT, Nangle BE, Horan JM.

Many rural areas have limited numbers of health care providers, especially women’s health providers. Rural America is heterogeneous where problems vary depending on the region and state. Health care professionals should be aware of this issue and advocate for reducing health disparities in rural women.\nSignificant health disparities exist between rural and urban women. Various definitions of “rural” are used to study and report population data, and to determine eligibility and reimbursement levels for federal and state programs. In this document, because of the complexities of definitions, the term “rural” will be used interchangeably with “nonmetropolitan” and the term “urban” will be used interchangeably with “metropolitan.”\nRural America represents 75% of the national landmass and is home to 22.8% of U.S. women aged 18 years and older 1 2. Rural communities are heterogeneous, with substantial regional differences in ethnic and racial composition 3 4. Whereas 83.5% of nonmetropolitan residents are non-Hispanic white, Hispanics and Asians are the fastest growing rural subgroups 2.\nRural Health Disparities\nAlthough national data on women’s health and outcomes according to residence are limited, disparities in rural women are apparent. General health conditions and behavior that U.S. rural women experience at higher rates than their urban counterparts include, self-reported fair or poor health status, unintentional injury and motor vehicle-related deaths, cerebrovascular disease deaths, suicide, cigarette smoking, obesity, difficulty with basic actions or limitation of complex activities 4 5, and incidence of cervical cancer 6. Other comparisons show that death rates from ischemic heart disease in rural women exceed that for all U.S. women. In some regions of the country, women in nonmetropolitan areas have higher rates of heavy alcohol consumption 4. Proportionately fewer rural women receive recommended preventive screening services for breast and cervical cancer. Rural African American, Hispanic, Asian, and white women are less likely to have cervical cancer screening. African American, Hispanic, and white women are less likely than their urban counterparts to have mammograms 7. Comparisons of female patients in whom invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in Georgia from 2000 to 2009 indicate that women living in small rural and isolated areas were 30% more likely to have surgery and 17% less likely to receive radiotherapy as first-course treatment than their urban counterparts. Also, within these rural areas, African American patients were 57% less likely to have surgery than white patients 8.\nObstetric and Reproductive Health Outcomes\nNational level data show relatively little difference between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan women for a number of obstetric outcomes 9. In contrast, risks vary by levels of rurality in many parts of the country. Prenatal care initiation in the first trimester was lower for mothers in more rural areas compared with suburban areas 10. Relative to women living in large fringe metropolitan and medium to small metropolitan areas, rural women experienced slightly higher rates of hospitalizations with complications during pregnancy in 2008 11.\nWith respect to adverse birth outcomes, a 2002 study in Pennsylvania found that women residing in the two most rural types of communities experienced risks of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth similar to those identified for women living in urban areas, even after controlling for pertinent maternal variables 12. Calculations of 5-year average (2000–2004) infant mortality rates for the United States and its counties indicated a rate of 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births. There were 1,041 nonmetropolitan counties (51%) with rates that exceeded the U.S. rate, and a subset of 128 nonmetropolitan counties (6.2%) with rates more than twice the national rate 3.\nReceipt of reproductive health services by sexually active women, aged 15–44 years, within the past year, was less likely for women living in nonmetropolitan areas 13; rural women relied on female sterilization (35%) to a greater extent than women living in central metropolitan (24%) or fringe metropolitan (25%) areas 14. A 2006 survey of women aged 18–44 years in Colorado found that women in small towns or rural areas indicated that they plan for contraceptive use less and were more likely to have had an unintended pregnancy than women in more urban areas 15.\nHealth Services Access\nAccess to health care for rural residents is complicated by patient factors as well as those related to the delivery of care. Rural residents are more likely to be poor, lack health insurance, or rely substantially on Medicaid and Medicare; they also travel longer distances to receive care or to access a range of medical, dental, and mental health specialty services 16. Less than one half of rural women live within a 30-minute drive to the nearest hospital offering perinatal services. Within a 60-minute drive, the proportion increases to 87.6% in rural towns and 78.7% in the most isolated areas 17 18. During 2008–2010, rural women aged 18–64 years reported the highest rates of delayed care or no medical care due to cost (18.6%) and no health insurance coverage (23.1%), both rates increased since 2002–2004 5. According to 2006 birth certificate data, home births were higher in counties with a population size less than 100,000 (0.87%) than in counties with a population size of 100,000 or more (0.50%) 19.\nRegional organization of perinatal services is an important strategy to improve outcomes for underserved women and their infants in rural communities. One outcome indicator is the percentage of very LBW (less than 1,500 g) deliveries that take place in subspecialty hospitals. Based on this indicator, 9 of the 12 lowest ranked states have rural populations that exceed one third of the state population 20 21. Some studies that examined deliveries of very LBW infants suggest that residing in more distant areas from a subspecialty facility, as well as inadequate prenatal care, increases the likelihood of delivery in a lower level facility 22 23 24.\nObstetric–Gynecologic Workforce in Rural Areas\nIn 2008, only 6.4% of obstetrician–gynecologists practiced in rural settings 25. By 2010, 49% of the 3,143 U.S. counties (home to 10.1 million women or 8.2% of all women), lacked an obstetrician–gynecologist. These predominantly rural counties exist in all states, but are particularly prevalent in the central and mountain west states. The ratio of obstetrician–gynecologists per 10,000 women is highest in metropolitan areas, and decreases in less populated and rural counties 18 26. In some rural areas, family physicians provide 100% of obstetric care. Even so, practice data show that obstetric services provided by family physicians is decreasing, with only 19.2% providing routine deliveries 27 28. At the same time, an increasing proportion of women are entering obstetrics and family practice; however, substantially fewer females compared with males in both specialties choose to practice in rural areas 26 29 30. These trends could contribute to a potential decrease in the rural workforce.\nAvailability of Specialty Women’s Health Services\nObstetric and gynecologic health services, including family planning, are limited in many nonmetropolitan areas. Substantial decreases in the availability of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) services from 1999 through 2005 reported for hospitals in Colorado, Montana, Oregon, and Wisconsin disproportionately affected smaller and more isolated or rural hospitals 31. Local availability of abortion services also is a concern. Eighty-seven percent of U.S. counties, in which 35% of reproductive-aged women lived, had no abortion provider in 2008. Obstetrician–gynecologists with rural mailing addresses were significantly less likely to perform abortions (6.5%) than their urban counterparts (17.0 %) 32. Rural women seeking abortions in 2008 traveled substantially greater distances than nonrural women. Thirty-one percent traveled more than 100 miles and an additional 42.9% traveled between 50 miles and 100 miles, compared with 3.8% and 7%, respectively, for nonrural women 33.\nAmong the 14 states ranked the highest on percentage of women aged 13–44 years in need of publicly funded contraceptive services and supplies, nine have rural populations exceeding 33% of the state population 20 34. Only 46% of the agencies providing publicly funded family planning services reported that their clinic sites are located in mostly rural locations, the majority of which are health departments and Federally Qualified Health Centers 35. In Colorado, where almost three-quarters of the counties are considered rural, substantial numbers of reproductive-aged women live in counties where there is no identified pharmacy or health clinic that either prescribes or fills prescriptions for contraceptives 36. Despite concern about access to emergency contraception, data on current over-the-counter availability of emergency contraception in U.S. rural pharmacies are lacking.\nCurrent Initiatives to Improve Services for Rural Women\nA variety of initiatives have been established to address the difficulties in providing care to rural women, funded by a range of state and federal programs and medical school department budgets. Examples of recent or current approaches include:\nWyoming, a state with no tertiary care centers for pregnant women or infants and few pediatric specialists, approves out-of-state health care providers and facilities as state Medicaid providers, allowing the state to reimburse transport to and care and delivery in an out-of-state subspecialty hospital when medically necessary 37.\nThe University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology developed its Regional Maternal & Child Health Program to serve geographically underserved women in multiple off-site clinics. The program addresses culturally relevant services and transportation needs, and uses electronic medical records to facilitate continuity of care. It also provides housing in its Regional Perinatal Residence for high-risk women (and family members) living in distant locations to facilitate their access to regional center care when hospitalization is not necessary 38.\nThe Arkansas Medicaid Program and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences are collaborating with the state’s medical community to enhance primary obstetric care in rural Arkansas and increase risk-appropriate referrals to maternal–fetal medicine subspecialists. The system uses telemedicine and clinic networks to facilitate access to maternal–fetal medicine consultation services, and to provide continuing education for practitioners 39.\nOregon enacted legislation to offer financial incentives, such as a state income tax credit for rural practitioners and assistance with medical liability insurance, for obstetricians practicing in rural areas. An evaluation of the program 2 years after full implementation found that the subsidy had not halted the overall decrease in rural clinicians who performed deliveries in that time frame. Clinicians receiving the subsidy, however, indicated that it was an important reason that they were able to continue maternity care 40.\nTwenty-four family medicine residency programs have incorporated a rural training track. Graduates of these programs are two to three times more likely to practice in rural areas than graduates of family medicine residencies overall. The majority of those physicians initially selecting rural sites remained in rural locations 2 years after graduation 30.\nRecommendations\nObstetricians and gynecologists in every region of the United States can work to reduce rural health disparities. The diversity of rural communities necessitates local solutions to local problems. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourages obstetrician–gynecologists to do the following:\nCollaborate with maternal–child and rural health agencies in their state to identify the health needs of rural women and barriers to health care.\nShare professional expertise as a member of an advisory committee or task force focused on improving the health of rural women.\nPartner with family physicians and other women’s primary care providers to ensure that appropriate consultation and training are available for practitioners in rural areas.\nPromote state initiatives offering financial incentives to rural health care practitioners and providers of rural obstetric care and reproductive health services.\nEncourage graduates of obstetric–gynecologic residency programs to participate in loan repayment programs that require practicing in rural locations for a specific length of time.\nReinvigorate the implementation of regionalized perinatal care in underserved, rural areas.\nShare and network resources as well as clinical expertise.\nFoster and participate in efforts to utilize effective telemedicine technologies (in accordance with state regulations) to expand and improve services for rural women.\nAdvocate for comprehensive professional liability reform to facilitate the practice of health care providers in rural areas.\nMonitor the availability of obstetric and gynecologic services in rural and underserved areas.\nPromote research to determine factors and conditions that support the retention of obstetrician–gynecologists in rural communities.\nConduct further research to understand acceptable conditions for performance of VBAC in rural areas and to study the effect of VBAC policies on access to care for rural women.\nAdvocate for increased access for rural women to contraceptive methods and emergency contraception.\nAdvocate for the availability of safe and accessible abortion services.\nInclude place of residence in the collection of data for health-related databases and their analyses to ensure improved understanding of rural–urban health disparities among women.\nEncourage research on the education, employment, and poverty disparities that affect the health of rural women.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening.

This tax went into effect January 1, 2021.\nThe SHS program is partially funded by a 1% personal income tax. For tax years 2021 through 2025, the SHS personal tax is owed by individuals with Metro taxable income above $125,000 if filing single or $200,000 if filing joint who live in Metro (including for only a portion of the year), work in Metro, or have income from Metro sources even if not a resident of Metro. Beginning in tax year 2026, these income exemption thresholds will be adjusted annually for inflation to prevent taxpayers from moving into higher brackets solely due to rising living costs. See the Personal Income Tax Rates and Exemption Thresholds table. Revenue is distributed within the portions of Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties that are inside Metro’s district.\nThe City of Portland Revenue Division administers the tax on behalf of Metro. Individuals who are liable for the tax must file a separate Metro SHS personal tax return and pay the tax to the City of Portland Revenue Division to be in compliance with the tax law.\nMultnomah County Preschool for All (PFA) Personal Income Tax\nIn 2020, Multnomah County voters approved a measure to establish a tuition-free preschool program.

If you were a part-year resident and also had income from Multnomah County sources while you were a non-resident, Multnomah County taxes the combined total of your part-year and non-resident income.\nIf you were a non-resident who traveled into Multnomah County to perform work, income from the work done in Multnomah County is taxable. If you were a non-resident employed by a Multnomah County employer but did not travel into Multnomah County to perform work (for example, work was done from a home office in a teleworking arrangement), the income received for that work is not taxable.\nPersonal Income Tax Return Filing Requirements\nYou must file your personal income tax return(s) and pay your personal income tax liability to the City of Portland's Revenue Division following the same schedule that federal and state income tax returns are due (generally April 15). These taxes are not included on your Oregon tax return and must be filed with and paid to the City of Portland Revenue Division.\nElectronic filing (e-File) is only available for select software programs at this time. Check with your tax preparation software provider to see if it allows the option for electronic filing or visit our eFile vendor page to see approved vendors. If your software does not provide an option for electronic filing, it may be able to generate a paper return for you to print and submit by mail.\nThe return(s) you are required to file will depend on your residency status within the jurisdictions. If you are liable for both the Metro SHS tax and the Multnomah County PFA tax and you have the same residency status for both jurisdictions, you do have the option to file a combined Metro SHS/MultCo PFA personal tax return on Portland Revenue Online (PRO).\nMetro Supportive Housing Services (SHS) Personal Income Tax\nIf you are a full-year resident of Metro, you are required to file a Metro SHS personal income tax return if your Oregon taxable income for the tax year is more than the tax year's income threshold for your filing status. See the Personal Income Tax Rates and Exemption Thresholds table.\nIf you are a nonresident or part-year resident of Metro with income from Metro sources, you are required to file a Metro SHS personal income tax return if your Metro taxable income for the tax year is more than the tax year's income threshold for your filing status.

However, if your employer has withheld taxes from your wages, you will be required to file a personal income tax return with the Revenue Division in order to receive a refund of the taxes withheld.\nRequesting an Extension to File\nTo request a filing extension, you must submit an extension payment by the original return due date for an automatic six-month filing extension. Extension payments may be made online or by mail using a payment voucher. The Revenue Division does not allow an extension of time to pay your tax.\nIf you do not have an estimated tax balance due but would like to request an extension to file, your federal or state extension will serve as your Metro SHS and/or your Multnomah County PFA Personal Income Tax extension. Check the “Extension Filed” box when you file your personal income tax return(s) and attach a copy of your federal extension or verification of your Oregon extension payment with your return.\nNOTE: Even if you file an extension, the tax liability must be paid in full by the original due date otherwise penalties and interest will be assessed.\nPaying Your Personal Income Taxes (Quarterly Estimated Payments, Payment Plans)\nThe payment for your personal income taxes is due at the same time you file and pay your federal and state taxes (generally April 15 for most filers). If you have requested an extension of time to file your tax return, your payment is still due on the original due date. There is no extension to pay your personal income taxes.\nFailure to pay the personal income taxes by the original due date will result in late payment penalties and interest. Payments apply first to any penalty accrued, then to interest accrued, then to taxes due.\nQuarterly Estimated Payments\nA taxfiler must pay quarterly estimated payments or have comparable employer withholding for the Metro SHS Personal Income Tax and/or Multnomah County PFA Personal Income Tax if the current year tax liability for either tax program will be $1,000 or greater, respectively, and the taxfiler's prior year tax liability for that tax program was also $1,000 or greater.\nEach quarterly estimated payment must equal 25% or more of the current year's estimated tax liability.\nFor calendar year filers, quarterly estimated payments are due on:\n| Quarter | Payment Due Date |\n|---|---|\n| 1st Quarter | April 15 |\n| 2nd Quarter | June 15 |\n| 3rd Quarter | September 15 |\n| 4th Quarter | January 15 |\nA taxpayer will be subject to quarterly underpayment interest if they are required to make quarterly estimated payments and by the due date of the 4th quarter payment have not made four quarterly estimated payments of 25% or more of the tax that equal:\n100% of the prior year liability, or\n90% of the current year liability\nQuarterly underpayment interest is calculated using the interest rate in effect for each quarter that payments are late or less than the amount due.\nPayment Plans\nThe Revenue Division recognizes that at times it may not be possible for a taxpayer to pay their tax liability in full. To encourage payment of all amounts due, the Revenue Division will consider entering into a payment plan agreement to ensure collection. Taxpayers are not eligible for a payment plan if the taxpayer fits into one of the following categories:\nThe taxpayer has defaulted on a payment plan with the revenue Division within the last 2 years.\nThe taxpayer has been referred to the City Attorney for legal action. They must enter into a confession of judgment instead.\nA payment plan may be approved when the taxpayer has no other method of financing this debt (such as a credit card cash advances, home equity loan proceeds, business loans, etc.) The taxpayer must remain in compliance with City and County tax codes during the term of the payment plan.\nPayment Plan Requirements\nGenerally, there is a $25 set up fee for a payment plan. The Revenue Division may discuss payment plan options and give approval to the taxpayer, provided the options meet the criteria established below.\nIf you can pay the full amount you owe within 12 months, you can avoid paying the fee to set up the payment plan agreement.\nIf a payment plan agreement of more than 24 months is needed, the set-up fee increases to $50 and supervisor approval is needed.\nIf terms outside these are requested, Revenue Division management will review the proposed alternate terms on a case by case basis.\nThe payment plan due date is the 5th or the 20th of the month, at least 16 days after the date the payment plan was set up. Interest continues to accrue during the repayment period.\nAll payments must be made by the due date. Failure to pay any installment of the payment plan by the due date will result in the payment plan being considered in default and any outstanding balance will become immediately payable.\nPayments not received within five (5) business days after the due date will be considered late. The Revenue Division will allow one late payment. A second late payment will cause the entire outstanding balance to become immediately due and any penalty waiver granted under the Revenue Division’s penalty assessment policy would be immediately reinstated to the outstanding balance.\nPenalties & Interest\nIf you have not paid your full tax balance and/or fulfilled your quarterly estimated payment requirements by the payment due dates, you may be subject to penalties for underpaying your tax liability, for filing a late personal income tax return, and/or for paying your income tax liability after the original due date of the return.\nYou will be subject to quarterly underpayment interest if you underpaid your required quarterly estimated payments and/or did not make the payments on time. Your quarterly estimated payment due dates, if required, are April 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and January 15th. You will be assessed monthly interest on any unpaid tax until the balance due is paid in full. The current interest rate can be found in our Tax Administration Policy – Personal Income Tax Interest Rates on Tax Due and Refunds.\nYour return payment due date is always the original due date of the return, which is typically April 15th. A filing extension allows you an extension of time to file your return but not an extension of time to pay your tax. You will owe penalties and interest on any tax not paid by the original due date of the return. For the purposes of penalty and monthly interest calculations, unpaid tax is your tax liability minus any payment of tax made by the original due date and any credit against tax that is claimed on the return.\nIf quarterly underpayment interest has been assessed, any payments or credits on the period that are made on or before the original due date will first apply to quarterly underpayment interest, which may leave a portion of tax unpaid. Any payments made after the original due date will first apply to penalties (from oldest to newest), then quarterly underpayment interest (if applicable), then monthly interest (from oldest to newest), then tax.\nUnderpayment Penalty\nYou may be subject to a penalty for underpaying your tax liability if, by the original due date of the return, timely payments are not made which are either:\nAt least 90% of the total tax balance due, or\n100% of the prior year’s tax liability paid by the original due date.\nIf you did not satisfy either requirement, you will be charged an underpayment penalty of 5% of the unpaid tax, but not less than $5.\nLate Filing Penalty\nIf you do not file your personal income tax return by the original due date, file an extension with the Revenue Division by the original due date, or include a copy of your federal extension with your return when you file by the extended due date, and you have unpaid tax on the original due date, the following late filing penalties will be applied:\n5% of the amount of the unpaid tax, but not less than $5.\nAn additional penalty of 100% of the unpaid tax of all tax years if the failure to file is for three (3) or more consecutive tax years.\nLate Payment Penalty\nYour personal income tax must be paid by the original due date even if you requested an extension to file your personal tax return. If you do not pay your tax by the original due date, the following late payment penalties will be applied:\n5% of the amount of the unpaid tax, but not less than $5.\nAn additional penalty of 100% of the unpaid tax of all tax years if the failure to pay is for three (3) or more consecutive tax years.\nAlthough there is a late penalty for both failing to file a personal tax return and failing to pay the total tax liability by the original due date of the return, only one of these penalties will be applied if there is a failure of both requirements by the original due date. You may be assessed both a late payment penalty and a late filing penalty if you request a filing extension and fail to file by the extension due date.\nQuarterly Underpayment Interest\nQuarterly underpayment interest will be due if estimated payments were required and were underpaid. Estimated payments can be made through quarterly estimated payments, employer-provided withholding from a filer’s wages, or a combination of both. Your quarterly underpayment interest is calculated at the rate in effect for the tax year from the due date of each quarterly estimated payment to the original due date of the tax return to which the estimated payments apply. The quarterly estimated payment due dates are April 15th, June 15th, September 15th and January 15th.\nThere is no quarterly underpayment interest assessed if:\nQuarterly estimated payments were not required because the total tax liability of the prior year was less than $1,000.\nQuarterly estimated payments were required, all quarterly estimated payments were made by the quarterly due dates in amounts equal to at least one quarter of 90% of the total tax liability for the current tax year, and 90% of the total tax liability of the current year was paid by January 15th, or\nQuarterly estimated payments were required, all quarterly estimated payments were made by the quarterly due dates in amounts equal to at least one quarter of 100% of the total tax liability for the prior tax year, and 100% of the total tax liability of the prior year was paid by January 15th.\nMonthly Interest on Tax Due\nMonthly interest is assessed on the 16th of each month on tax that remains unpaid after the original return due date until the tax is paid in full.\nDelinquent Taxes\nIf payment for taxes due nor a protest to increased taxes is timely received, the Revenue Division may assess additional interest and penalties, including civil penalties of $500 per violation of Metro and Multnomah County tax codes. The Revenue Division may also begin collection activity for the balance due for your account.\nIf the Revenue Division refers your account to a third-party collection agency, additional fees up to 25% of the total balance due may be added to your debt, and you must contact the collection agency about your debt.\nIf the Revenue Division refers your account to the City Attorney's office, additional court or legal fees may be added to your debt.\nPenalty Waiver Requests\nIn order to assist taxfilers with compliance, the Revenue Division is authorized to waive or reduce penalties at its own discretion, as detailed in our Penalty Waiver Requests Tax Administration Policy. Generally, penalty waiver requests may be granted one-time only, for a single tax period. If approved, waivers generally do not decrease penalties below the initial penalty assessment of 5% of the tax liability. The Division does not waive properly assessed interest, and all outstanding tax and interest must be paid in order to waive penalties.\nWhile there is no standard format for penalty waiver requests, they must be requested, in writing, within 30 days of the initial notice assessing the penalty and include the account, tax period, and reasonable cause for the request. There is no standard format for penalty waiver requests, nor is there a form that needs to be filled out. You can submit the written request online at Pro.Portland.gov, by email, mail, or fax – see the Contact section of this page for detail.\nRefunds\nYou will need to file a personal tax return to request a refund.\nRefunds for the Metro SHS and Multnomah PFA taxes are generally issued within 8-10 weeks after the return is filed (with all supporting tax pages). Due to high volumes of mail, returns filed in March/April and September/October may require additional time for a refund to be issued.\nRefunds will be issued only in the event of overpayment, duplicate payments, or a payment made when no tax was due, and a refund was requested on your return. All requests for refund must be made in writing.\nAn online payment made Monday through Friday may be voided on the same day it is made by canceling the payment before 4 pm Pacific Time.\nACH Refunds\nTo receive your refund via direct deposit, you must file your return electronically and request a refund on that return using Portland Revenue Online or through an approved eFile vendor.\nPersonal Income Tax Codes, Administrative Rules, and Policies\nMetro Supportive Housing Services (SHS) Personal Income Tax\nMetro SHS Personal Income Tax Codes (Chapters 7.05 and 7.06) and Administrative Rules\nPersonal Tax Administration Policies\nTax Administration Rule BTAR 510.24-1 - Requirement to File Returns Electronically (LIC-2.05)\nMultnomah County Preschool for All (PFA) Income Tax\nMultnomah County PFA Personal Income Tax Code\nMultnomah County PFA Administrative Rules\nPersonal Tax Administration Policies\nTax Administration Rule BTAR 510.24-1 - Requirement to File Returns Electronically (LIC-2.05)\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        FY 2010-11 TAX LEVY\nBinding City Policy\nBCP-FIN-5.07\nPURPOSE\nSection 1.

A recent paper by Millar et al. (2017) presented the same finding in a diagram of temperature change versus cumulative carbon emissions since 1870.\nThe horizontal axis is correlated with time but by using cumulative CO2 instead the authors infer a policy conclusion. The line with circles along it represents the CMIP5 ensemble mean path outlined by climate models. The vertical dashed line represents a carbon level where two thirds of the climate models say that much extra CO2 in the air translates into at least 1.5 oC warming. The black cross shows the estimated historical cumulative total CO2 emissions and the estimated observed warming. Notably it lies below the model line. The models show more warming than observed at lower emissions than have occurred. The vertical distance from the cross to the model line indicates that once the models have caught up with observed emissions they will have projected 0.3 oC more warming than has been seen, and will be very close (only seven years away) to the 1.5 oC level, which they associate with 615 GtC. With historical CO2 emissions adding up to 545 GtC that means we can only emit another 70 GtC, the so-called “carbon budget.”\nExtrapolating forward based on the observed warming rate suggests that the 1.5 oC level would not be reached until cumulative emissions are more than 200 GtC above the current level, and possibly much higher. The gist of the article, therefore, is that because observations do not show the rapid warming shown in the models, this means there is more time to meet policy goals.\nAs an aside, I dislike the “carbon budget” language because it implies the existence of an arbitrary hard cap on allowable emissions, which rarely emerges as an optimal solution in models of environmental policy, and never in mainstream analyses of the climate issue except under some extreme assumptions about the nature of damages. But that’s a subject for another occasion.\nWere Millar et al. authors right to assert that climate models have overstated recent warming? They are certainly not the first to make this claim. Fyfe et al. (2013) compared Hadley Centre temperature series (HadCRUT4) temperatures to the CMIP5 ensemble and showed that most models had higher trends over the 1998-2012 interval than were observed:\nOriginal caption: a, 1993–2012. b, 1998–2012. Histograms of observed trends (red hatching) are from 100 reconstructions of the HadCRUT4 dataset1. Histograms of model trends (grey bars) are based on 117 simulations of the models, and black curves are smoothed versions of the model trends. The ranges of observed trends reflect observational uncertainty, whereas the ranges of model trends reflect forcing uncertainty, as well as differences in individual model responses to external forcings and uncertainty arising from internal climate variability.\nThe IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report also acknowledged model over-estimation of recent warming in their Figure 9.8 and accompanying discussion in Box 9.2. I have updated the IPCC chart as follows. I set the CMIP5 range to gray, and the thin white lines show the (year-by-year) central 66% and 95% of model projections. The chart uses the most recent version of the HadCRUT4 data, which goes to the end of 2016. All data are centered on 1961-1990.\nEven with the 2016 EL-Nino event, the HadCRUT4 series does not reach the mean of the CMIP5 ensemble. Prior to 2000 the longest interval without a crossing between the red and black lines was 12 years, but the current one now runs to 18 years.\nThis would appear to confirm the claim in Millar et al. that climate models display an exaggerated recent warming rate not observed in the data.\nNot So Fast\nZeke Hausfather has disputed this in a posting for Carbon Brief. He presents a different-looking graph that seems to show HadCRUT4 and the other major data series lining up reasonably well with the CMIP5 (RCP4.5) runs.\nHow does he get this result?\nHausfather isn’t using the CMIP5 runs as shown by the IPCC; instead he is using data from a different archive that modifies the outputs in a way that tilts the post-2000 model trends down. Cowtan et al. (2015) argued that, for comparisons such as this, climate model outputs should be sampled in the same way that the HadCRUT4 (and other) surface data are sampled, namely using Surface Air Temperatures (SAT) over land, Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) over water, and with maskings that simulate the treatment of areas with missing data and with ice cover rather than open ocean. Global temperature products like HadCRUT use SST data as a proxy for Marine Air Temperature (MAT) over the oceans since MAT data are much less common than SST. Cowtan et al. note that in the models, SST warms more slowly than MAT but the CMIP5 output files used by the IPCC and others present averages constructed by blending MAT and SAT, rather than SST and SAT. Using the latter blend, and taking into account the fact that when Arctic ice coverage declines, some areas that had been sampled with SAT are replaced with SST, Cowtan et al. found that the discrepancy between models and observations declines somewhat.\nFigure 4 in Cowtan et al. shows that the use of SAT/SST (“blended”) model output data doesn’t actually close the gap by much: the majority of the reconciliation happens by using “updated forcings”, i.e. peeking at the answer post-2000\n.Top: effect of applying Cowtan et al. blending method (change from red to green line)\nBottom: effect of applying updated forcings that use post-2000 observations\nHausfather also uses a slightly later 1970-2000 baseline. With the 2016 El Nino at the end of the record a crossing between the observations and the modified CMIP5 mean occurs.\nIn my version (using the unmodified CMIP5 data) the change to a 1970-2000 baseline would yield a graph like this:\nThe 2016 HadCRUT4 value still doesn’t match the CMIP5 mean, but they’re close. The Cowtan et al. method compresses the model data above and below so in Zeke’s graph the CMIP5 mean crosses through the HadCRUT4 (and other observed series’) El Nino peak. That creates the visual impression of greater agreement between models and observations, but bear in mind the models are brought down to the data, not the other way around. On a 1970-2000 centering the max value of the CMIP5 ensemble exceeds 1C in 2012, but in Hausfather’s graph that doesn’t happen until 2018.\nApples with Apples\nThe basic logic of the Cowtan et al. paper is sound: like should be compared with like. The question is whether their approach, as shown in the Hausfather graph, actually reconciles models and observations.\nIt is interesting to note that their argument relies on the premise that SST trends are lower than nearby MAT trends. This might be true in some places but not in the tropics, at least prior to 2001. The linked paper by Christy et al. shows the opposite pattern to the one invoked by Cowtan et al. Marine buoys in the tropics show that MAT trends were negative even as the SST trended up, and a global data set using MAT would show less warming than one relying on SST, not more. In other words, if instead of apples-to-apples we did an oranges-to-oranges comparison using the customary CMIP5 model output comprised of SAT and MAT, compared against a modified HadCRUT4 series that used MAT rather than SST, it would have an even larger discrepancy since the modified HadCRUT4 series would have an even lower trend.\nMore generally, if the blending issues proposed by Cowtan et al. explain the model-obs discrepancy, then if we do comparisons using measures where the issues don’t apply, there should be no discrepancy. But, as I will show, the discrepancies show up in other comparisons as well.\nExtremes\nSwanson (2013) compared the way CMIP3 and CMIP5 models generated extreme cold and warm events in each gridcell over time. In a warming world, towards the end of the sample, each location would be expected to have a less-than-null probability of a record cold event and a greater-than-null probability of a record warm event each month. Since the comparison is done only using frequencies within individual grid cells it doesn’t require any assumptions about blending the data. The expected pattern was found to hold in the observations and in the models, but the models showed a warm bias. The pattern in the models had enough dispersion in CMIP3 to encompass the observed probabilities, but in CMIP5 the model pattern had a smaller spread and no overlap with observations. In other words, the models had become more like each other but less like the observed data.\n(Swanson Fig 2 Panels A and B)\nThe importance here is that this comparison is not affected by the issues raised by Cowtan et al, so the discrepancy shouldn’t be there. But it is.\nLower Troposphere\nComparisons between model outputs for the Lower Troposphere (LT) and observations from weather satellites (using the UAH and RSS products) are not affected by the blending issues raised in Cowtan et al. Yet the LT discrepancy looks exactly like the one in the HadCRUT4/CMIP5 comparison.\nThe blue line is RSS, the black line is UAH, the red line is the CMIP5 mean and the grey bands show the RCP4.5 range. The thin white lines denote the central 66% and 95% ranges. The data are centered on 1979-2000. Even with the 2016 El Nino the discrepancy is visible and the observations do not cross the CMIP5 mean after 1999.\nA good way to assess the discrepancy is to test for common deterministic trends using the HAC-robust Vogelsang-Franses test (see explanation here). Here are the trends and robust 95% confidence intervals for the lines shown in the above graph, including the percentile boundaries.\nUAHv6.0 0.0156 C/yr ( 0.0104 , 0.0208 )\nRSSv4.0 0.0186 C/yr ( 0.0142 , 0.0230 )\nGCM_min 0.0252 C/yr ( 0.0191 , 0.0313 )\nGCM_025 0.0265 C/yr ( 0.0213 , 0.0317 )\nGCM_165 0.0264 C/yr ( 0.0200 , 0.0328 )\nGCM_mean 0.0276 C/yr ( 0.0205 , 0.0347 )\nGCM_835 0.0287 C/yr ( 0.0210 , 0.0364 )\nGCM_975 0.0322 C/yr ( 0.0246 , 0.0398 )\nGCM_max 0.0319 C/yr ( 0.0241 , 0.0397 )\nAll trends are significantly positive, but the observed trends are lower than the model range. Next I test whether the CMIP5 mean trend is the same as, respectively, that in the mean of UAH and RSS, UAH alone and RSS alone. The test scores are below. All three reject at <1%. Note the critical values for the VF scores are: 90%:20.14, 95%: 41.53, 99%: 83.96.\nH0: Trend in CMIP5 mean =\nTrend in mean obs 192.302\nTrend in UAH 405.876\nTrend in RSS 86.352\nThe Tropics\nIn addition to the above comparison, if the treatment of Arctic sea ice is the major problem, there should be no issues when confining attention to the tropics. Also, since models project the strongest response to GHG warming in the tropical LT, this is where models and observations ought best to agree.\nAgain the blue line is RSS, the black line is UAH, the red line is the CMIP5 mean, the grey bands show the RCP4.5 range and the thin white lines denote the central 66% and 95% ranges. The data are centered on 1979-2000.\nTrends:\nUAHv6.0 0.0102 C/yr ( 0.0037 , 0.0167 )\nRSSv4.0 0.0139 C/yr ( 0.0085 , 0.0193 )\nGCM_min 0.0282 C/yr ( 0.0199 , 0.0365 )\nGCM_025 0.0277 C/yr ( 0.021 , 0.0344 )\nGCM_165 0.0281 C/yr ( 0.0207 , 0.0355 )\nGCM_mean 0.0289 C/yr ( 0.0209 , 0.0369 )\nGCM_835 0.0296 C/yr ( 0.021 , 0.0382 )\nGCM_975 0.032 C/yr ( 0.0239 , 0.0401 )\nGCM_max 0.0319 C/yr ( 0.023 , 0.0408 )\nH0: Trend in CMIP5 mean =\nTrend in mean obs 229.683\nTrend in UAH 224.190\nTrend in RSS 230.100\nAll trends are significantly positive and the models strongly reject against the observations. Interestingly the UAH and RSS series both reject even against the (year-by-year) lower bound of the CMIP5 outputs (p<1%).\nFinally, Tim Vogelsang and I showed a couple of years ago that the tropical LT (and MT) discrepancies are also present between models and the weather balloon series back to 1958.\nSummary\nMillar et al. attracted controversy for stating that climate models have shown too much warming in recent decades, even though others (including the IPCC) have said the same thing. Zeke Hausfather disputed this using an adjustment to model outputs developed by Cowtan et al. The combination of the adjustment and the recent El Nino creates a visual impression of coherence. But other measures not affected by the issues raised in Cowtan et al. support the existence of a warm bias in models. Gridcell extreme frequencies in CMIP5 models do not overlap with observations. And satellite-measured temperature trends in the lower troposphere run below the CMIP5 rates in the same way that the HadCRUT4 surface data do, including in the tropics. The model-observational discrepancy is real, and needs to be taken into account especially when using models for policy guidance.\nModeration note: As with all guest posts, please keep your comments civil and relevant.\nIs the Pope a catholic?\nAs well as IPCC AR5 WG1 chapter 9, this is also discussed in chapter 11:\n“This provides evidence that some CMIP5 models have a higher transient response to GHGs and a larger response to other anthropogenic forcings (dominated by the effects of aerosols) than the real world (medium confidence).’ The ASK results and the initialised predictions both suggest that those CMIP5 models that warm most rapidly over the period (1986–2005) to (2016–2035) may be inconsistent with the observations.”\nThe relevant figure in that chapter is Fig 11-09.\nWell obviously all these scientists/groups/organizations are in the pay of big oil because this science has already been settled. ~Sarcasm~ BTW heard you on FOX last night, Judith, you were great.\nReblogged this on Climate Collections.\nThey tried hard to get the models to predict the worst outcomes to induce policy changes, and they are trying hard now to get the models to predict less warming to reduce the disparity with observations. This is not science and they are not scientists, even if they are paid as such.\nCMIP5 RCP4.5 with 1961-1990 baseline compared to HadCRUT4 with 1961-1990 baseline, according to KNI climate explorer.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CXwGBte.png\nThe models believe we are stuck in a perpetual very strong El Niño that is getting worse with time. That is how wrong they are.\nHi Ross,\nIt won’t change your overall results (e.g. that TLT data is running a bit cooler than the models in the lower troposphere), but I would strongly suggest using CMIP5 pressure levels associated with the lower troposphere rather than the surface when doing comparisons. Conflating the surface and lower troposphere can create confusion, as they are really not that tightly coupled, particularly over short timeframes where tropospheric amplification of El Nino and La Nina effects can matter quite a bit. This recent Santer et al paper does a pretty robust comparisons of tropospheric models and observations: https://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v10/n7/abs/ngeo2973.html\nSimilarly, there is pretty large structural uncertainty among satellite records (and large differences between recent versions of both UAH and RSS) that needs to be taken into account: https://skepticalscience.com/surface_temperature_or_satellite_brightness.html\nRegarding the apples-to-apples comparisons, I don’t think that 1979-2001 values from the tropics are necessarily representative of a global relationship between SSTs and MATs. I’d be somewhat skeptical of the homogeneity of the MAT record they used over that period given changes in measurement times and devices. The NMAT dataset they use, MOHMAT, was pretty extensively revised in its most recent form (HADNMAT2). In Cowtan et al 2015 we spent quite some time comparing the model results to behavior in both reanalysis and observations, and these comparisons can be found in our supplementary materials. In general, reanalysis shows quite similar behavior to the models, while the differences between observational NMAT and SST are an order of magnitude larger and much noisier than in either models or reanalysis, making them difficult to glean much from: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2015GL064888/asset/supinfo/grl53276-sup-0001-supinfo.pdf\nAlso, its worth mentioning that masking models to common coverage with HadCRUT4 is just as important as using model SSTs, and I can’t really see any compelling argument as to why a mask shouldn’t be used.\nFinally, I’d direct interested readers to the recent Medhaug et al paper in Nature. They did a nice job of looking at the various factors responsible for differences between surface warming in models and observations in recent years: https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v545/n7652/full/nature22315.html\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/580sr6le1/Screen_Shot_2017-09-21_at_11.33.05_AM.png\nThe situation is much simpler than anybody here admits. There are hundreds of runs of models, creating a “spaghetti graph”,of which modelers selected some to include in AR4. Had they selected other runs – which they are selecting today – they would have created a good projection. But they did not know back then what projection would be “good”.\nIt is an old trick. Lord Knowitall to butler James:\n– Think of a number between 1 and 10.\n– Eight, Your Lordship.\n– I knew you would say Eight. Read a note in the flower pot on the windowsill.\n– “I knew you would say Eight”. How did Your Lordship do it?\n– Had you said Four, I have a note with Four in a vase.\nIt wasn’t the projections (the model results) that they’re selecting now, it’s the forcing scenarios; the model inputs.\nThe takeaway is that if you know what the solar and volcanic inputs are going to do over the next 30 years, then you can make a pretty good prediction of where the climate will be then.\nGeorge is correct – of the 1000’s of plausible, exponentially divergent, non-unique solutions for any model – the mystery of how a single solution ends up in the CMIP opportunistic ensemble is inexplicable.

There is that children’s joke about the constipated mathematician – except that they have progressed from pencils to supercomputers.\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/104/21/8709.full\nThen there is the surface temperature record.

And although it creates a titillation, a frisson in the hearts of climate commentators – it is not worth any depth of consideration. George is correct in another way – in digging down to fundamentals rather than interminably arguing with as much substance as angels on pinheads.\nI borrowed this comment from another website about the paper, abridged a little.”Authors response. it makes the point about the difference between emissions and concentrations. Makes another interesting argument which is essentially that GMST is defined in terms of the HadCRUT4 dataset and essentially that the 1.5oC limit is when HadCRUT4 would reach 1.5oC. Therefore, under this definition we have about 0.6oC to go.\nIt does illustrate that one of the issues seems to be that we haven’t properly defined the baseline. Does it mean an actual globally averaged warming of 1.5oC or 1.5oC as determined by one of the commonly used temperature datasets [HadCRUT4].”\nZeke, if it is he in Carbon Brief appears to be arguing from an extremely different period, 1970 to 2015 Hadcrut instead of 1870 to 2015 Hadcrut.\nThis lets him get away with comments like\n“In reality, the results obtained from the type of model-observation comparisons performed in the paper depend greatly on the dataset and model outputs used by the authors”. instead of asking why the 0.3 C discrepancy exists.\nThe data sets mentioned all use backward lowering of real temperatures in a method Zeke approves of. If these data sets were not adjusted so severely the actual temperature rise over this time would be a lot less and the CO2 effect grossly overstated. It is hard to argue on his terms and data sets when they switch from what has been in common usage to ” researchers have produced blended model outputs, which combine air temperatures over land with surface water temperatures over the ocean to mirror the way temperatures are actually measured.” because the traditional measures were overstating heating.\nThis only needed to be produced when an actual paper was published showing the massive discrepancy.\nThanks Zeke. My LT comparison does use RCP4.5 TLT levels, not TAS, from CMIP5, (though I’ll double check). I used both RSS and UAH in order to avoid having to get into the series’ differences, which turn out not to matter for this issue since RSS also rejects against the CMIP5 mean. I agree that the NMAT records have lots of problems, as do the SST products. Any issue in which the signal being sought is small relative to the size of measurement errors will defy easy resolution. That’s why I think looking at alternative measures that aren’t affected by those same problems helps clarify things.\nHi Ross,\nApologies if you did use CMIP5 TLT-analogues (it wasn’t very clear in the text). Did you use Christy’s version, Santer’s version, or make your own? It turns out it is actually fairly non-trivial to construct a TLT analogue since its not a single layer of the atmosphere and models don’t have any directly comparable fields (you end up needing a weighted average of different pressure levels with different weights over land and oceans, among other complications).\nThere is some variability of the precise levels that MSU represents. But both the MSU analyses (UAH and RSS) and RAOB clearly indicate the lack of Hot Spot:\nhttps://climatewatcher.webs.com/HotSpot2016.png\nThat’s false, Turbulent Eddie, and you’ve been shown this again and again. So I don’t know why you keep making this false claim.\nHere’s what Spencer says the hot spot is:\n“One of the most vivid predictions of global warming theory is a “hotspot” in the tropical upper troposphere, where increased tropical convection responding to warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is supposed to cause enhanced warming in the upper troposphere.”\nhttp://www.drroyspencer.com/2015/05/new-satellite-upper-troposphere-product-still-no-tropical-hotspot/\nMultiple satellite-based analyses show that in the tropics, upper tropospheric warming is greater than surface warming; i.e. there’s a hot spot. That includes RSS (DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1; DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00767.1), UW, NOAA/STAR (DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00767.1), UMD (DOI: 10.1029/2005JD006392), and an analysis from Weng and Zou (DOI: 10.1007/s00382-013-2012-5). The only exception is UAH (DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00767.1).\nFurthermore, multiple radiosonde analyses show that in the tropics, upper tropospheric warming is greater than surface warming; i.e. there’s a hot spot. That hot spot appears in all of the analyses from 30+ year periods beginning in 1959, and it shows up in every analysis (except HadAT2) for period beginning in 1979 (DOI: 10.1002/2017GL073798).\nI used Christy’s version. Regarding the use of masking, I concur with the reasoning but the Cowtan et al. paper Fig 4a suggests it doesn’t have a huge effect.\nThanks. On masking, its hard to see the relative effect of masking and blending from Figure 4. This post from Ed Hawkins back in 2012 looks at the impact of masking in isolation: https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2012/on-comparing-models-and-observations/\nCode and data for everything you did would be nice\nSee rossmckitrick.com, top entry.\nCool thanks.\nThis time, unlike last time, when I find an error will you fix it?\nHi Ross,\nFigure 4 conflates both blending and masking. Here is a good post by Ed Hawkins that just looks at the blending question: https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2012/on-comparing-models-and-observations/\nBy the way, in my original Carbon Brief article I did mention that obs are still running a bit cooler than the multimodel mean since 1970 (though they are still well inside the model envelope): https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-climate-models-have-not-exaggerated-global-warming\n“Since 1970, models on average predict around just over 0.19 C warming per decade globally. Observations show a bit less warming over the modern period, ranging from 0.17C to 0.18C per decade. Over this period, the model average predicts between 6% and 11% more warming than has actually been observed. However, those models that predict a bit less warming since 1880 or 1970 don’t necessarily show less warming in 2100 compared to today, so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the sensitivity of climate to greenhouse gases, or which models are more accurate, solely based on the historical surface temperature record.”\nApologies for the duplicate comment. The original one took its time showing up, and I assumed it had been devoured by an errant spam filter.\nIndeed it did land in spam for some reason\nAll you really need to know about “observations” and model comparisons:\nhttps://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screenhunter_3233-oct-01-22-59.gif\nPut data for the past ten thousand year ice cores or the data for several hundred thousand yeas on this chart and you lose your correlation.\nI love that chart.\nIt shows you that the adjustments are correct.\nlol\nerrrr….

Right ?\nThe answer is: it may vary from 1 to 3.5 in a ratio (245 GtCO2 vs 880 GtCO2) depending on the way you are computing the budget, right? ( depending the dataset, the baseline, etc etc )\nCan we seriously make a decision impacting billions of people with such an uncertainty?\nAll that I see here as a non=climate expert is low-level signal processing Science … How can we seriously conclude something? Sorry to be so abrupt.\nI think there are more uncertainties than that. One of them is that in the Paris agreement, it is agreed that:\n«1. This Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by:\n(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels…»\nCowtan et al. note that:\n«The results from the models use air temperatures over the whole globe, whereas the observations use a mix of air temperature over land and water temperature for the oceans» – Robust comparison of climate models with observations using blended land air and ocean sea surface temperatures\nThat makes me wonder – which definition of temperature forms the basis for the Paris agreement?\nTaking into account that the temperature measurements in 1850 was hardly representative for any definition of global average temperature, the Paris agreement seems like an attempt to keep the highly uncertain value of a poorly defined measurand below an arbitrary set limit.\nNot only do we not know the temp very well in 1850 or 1880, but CO2 levels did not start rising much until the 1950’s and pre-1900 was a colder period followed by some natural warming. There is no actual reason to believe that the temperature was ideal in 1880 and 2C above that is harmful. I much prefer using 1950 as a benchmark.\nSorry to keep harping on this, but the 2 deg. C number is simply an intuitive guess straight out of one man’s head.\nFrank Gue, Burlington, Ontario\n«The 2-degree temperature target … came from “a marginal remark in an early paper about climate policy”. That “marginal paper” was a 1975 working paper by economist William Nordhaus.»\nClimatologist Traces History Of The Meaningless 2-Degree Temperature Target By Roger Pielke\nCowtan et al are not unmotivated dispassionate observers and hence adjustments introduced (ie, Cowtanization) are necessarily suspect. One shouldn’t have to split hairs to this extent to produce coherence with the mean.\nI agree Shub, this level of data massaging is always questionable. As this post points out, in more localized measures, the result is clearer and shows that models overstate warming. It would be a surprise if the global averages didn’t also show this. This observation casts doubt on the data massaging.\nAlso, the hindcast portion of the model runs don’t seem to need this much hand-holding and babysitting to match the observations. Talk about apples to apples, or whatever fruity analogy you can think up.\nWith regard to forcing, this is apples-to-apples.\nFor the past, we generally know the real-world forcings that went into the hindcasts.\nFor the present simulations, they can get off if we don’t use the real-world forcings.\nThat’s part of the cause of the 1998-2014 temperature “slowdown”. Solar and volcanic forcings were a little cooler than expected. But running a hindcast with the real-world forcings still gives pretty good estimate of the resulting surface temperatures.\nSorry Benjamin but estimated ECS is still 1.5C – 4.5C @ 95% confidence. By definition that’s a constant forcing. That range hasn’t been improved in 60 years of climate “science”. The low end of that range is yawn-worthy and the high side is alarming. Observed ECS is near or below the low number.\nWake me up when climate science makes some progress in the science part of it. The narrative elements pushed by ideologues can be pushed where the sun don’t shine in the meantime, if you get my drift.\n@Winchester\nWe’ve been repeatedly informed by the global warming consensus that variation in solar “constant” is insignificant. The same have informed us that the CLOUD experiment has discounted any climate effect caused by solar magnetic field variation. Please provide citations which you believe support a case that solar variation caused observed warming to be less than anticipated.\nI’m not aware any greater-than-average volcanic sulfates in the stratosphere that would dampen warming more than anticipated. Please provide citations which corroborate that claim as well.\n/shrug. It’s science. All research is suspect and deserves skepticism. The question is whether the work is good or not.\nApplying a mask to compare apples-to-apples seems solid to me. Do you have a particular issue with their methodology, or is this a “I’m just suspicious of it” kind of objection?\nAnd yet… both the masking research and the forcings research seems to show that we do.\nI doubt the latter matters much, probably less than a tenth of a degree. But when we’re trying to “predict” climate, typically defined over 30 years or more, on 10-20 year timespans, even small forcing changes end up mattering. It’s a small margin of error.\nPingback: Climate Models | Transterrestrial Musings\n“Atmospheric and oceanic computational simulation models often successfully depict chaotic space–time patterns, flow phenomena, dynamical balances, and equilibrium distributions that mimic nature. This success is accomplished through necessary but nonunique choices for discrete algorithms, parameterizations, and coupled contributing processes that introduce structural instability into the model. Therefore, we should expect a degree of irreducible imprecision in quantitative correspondences with nature, even with plausibly formulated models and careful calibration (tuning) to several empirical measures. Where precision is an issue (e.g., in a climate forecast), only simulation ensembles made across systematically designed model families allow an estimate of the level of relevant irreducible imprecision.” http://www.pnas.org/content/104/21/8709.full\nThis post is bog standard climate blog fare. Tinkering at the edges of climate talking points with little to no rationale or resolution in sight. The more fundamental question to ask is on the theoretical justification – or lack thereof – of opportunistic ensembles such as CMIP5.\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/slingo-and-palmer-e1506451524627.png\nhttp://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1956/4751\nThe ‘systematically designed model family’ here is a schematic of a perturbed physics model. Potentially 1000’s of non-unique solutions for any model due entirely to sensitive dependence of nonlinear equations at their core. There are no unique solutions – and no methodology other than it matching expectations for warming – for choosing one solution over any other. Arbitrarily choosing a solution as a comparison with other models seems essentially a ludicrous pursuit with the sole rationale being continued public funding. Should we expect warm choices due to subjective bias? And then they construct a statistics over the motley collection based on an impossible convergence assumption.\n“Pure fluid dynamics may be at the core of the AOS modeling problem, but nature combines fluid physics with other processes, and we must look to more comprehensive model formulations to be able to assess simulation accuracy against the relevant empirical reality. Thus, we can consider the many comparison studies that show a substantial spread among the results from AOS models created by different groups, as well as in the degree of correspondence with observations. Because each of the models is created independently, such model ensembles are more opportunistically assembled than systematically designed. Furthermore, the compared models are typically being reformulated by their creators faster than they can be compared with each other. So the comparisons are more like snapshots of model differences than careful, enduring assessments…\nIn each of these model–ensemble comparison studies, there are important but difficult questions: How well selected are the models for their plausibility? How much of the ensemble spread is reducible by further model improvements? How well can the spread can be explained by analysis of model differences? How much is irreducible imprecision in an AOS?\nSimplistically, despite the opportunistic assemblage of the various AOS model ensembles, we can view the spreads in their results as upper bounds on their irreducible imprecision. Optimistically, we might think this upper bound is a substantial overestimate because AOS models are evolving and improving. Pessimistically, we can worry that the ensembles contain insufficient samples of possible plausible models, so the spreads may underestimate the true level of irreducible imprecision (cf., ref. 23). Realistically, we do not yet know how to make this assessment with confidence…\nAOS models are members of the broader class of deterministic chaotic dynamical systems, which provides several expectations about their properties (Fig. 1). In the context of weather prediction, the generic property of sensitive dependence is well understood (4, 5). For a particular model, small differences in initial state (indistinguishable within the sampling uncertainty for atmospheric measurements) amplify with time at an exponential rate until saturating at a magnitude comparable to the range of intrinsic variability. ” op. cit\nModels are powerful tools for exploring process in climate – but projections of surface temperature are egregiously and fundamentally hinkey. And this is before we get into questions of the temporal chaos of models versus the spatio/temporal chaos of the Earth system. Reality is that prediction is not possible and therefore whether the opportunistic ensembles are running warm or not is fundamentally irrelevant. I suggest just not going down the rabbit hole with anyone on this.\nThere’s only one small flaw – like all academics this ridiculous forecast starts with the false assumption that any change that already occurred must be human caused. The simple fact – is yes we did change the global temperature – but not through CO2.\nAt which point the whole rotten prediction is as useless as a limp lettuce.\nBut it gets worse – because academics and those like NASA have been falsifying warming that doesn’t exist. So not only is the warming not due to CO2, but much of the warming is pure fiction in the first place.\nThis whole climate nonsense makes many Monty Python sketches seem sane.\nIPCC AR4:\nBest estimate for a “high scenario” is 4.0 °C (0.4C/decade)\nBest estimate for a “low scenario” is 1.8 °C (0.18C/decade)\nMost of the observations, particularly those of thirty years length or more, are around the “low scenario”.\nThe models aren’t necessarily overstating the warming,\nmore like the advocates are overstating the warming.\nNice guest post. Denizens may also want to refer to John Christy’s March 29 2017 written congressional testimony, which reaches Dr. McKitrik’s conclusions using somewhat different methods. Christy goes further, showing that most CMIP5 models are actually now statistically invalidated, period. The exception is Russian INM-CM4, which has higher ocean thermal inertia, lower water vapor feedback, and low ECS.\nRud, Do you know if any one has an explicit refutation of Christy’s analysis? I would like to see what people say about it who don’t agree.\nDpy, I am aware of none, yet, in the literature. (Disclaimer, am not a full time climate junkie). His congressional arguments are pretty bullet proof. So I think mostly just ignored. IMO no way to refute him in peer review based on present observational history.\nChristy is pointing out ( which he has for 25 years now ) that the hot spot is not occurring as modeled. This is pretty much a matter of observation.\nThis does not ( as Christy has also said for 25 years or so ) indicate that global warming is not occurring at the surface in the mean. Of course, Christy has also pointed out that increasing mean temperature doesn’t necessarily mean increasing extreme temperature, and in fact, has occurred with decreasing extreme temperatures in the US.\nFirst hit:\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD002670/full\nIts proper to adjust data sets, provided that the adjustment value be applied to all previous years back to 1850. What’s right for the current goose is proper for the previous gander. In this fashion adjustments simply become a more real number (if the adjustment is proven correct) and in no way changes the global temperature up or down. However, advocates of warming would lose an all important tool.\nI have not had time fully to read, let alone digest, this enormous and very scholarly report, BUT:\nThere seem to be several hidden assumptions behind it, one being that anthropogenic CO2 has been proven to be the culprit in AGW ACC(anthropogenic climate change).\nIt has not, and good cases can be made that:\n* we need more CO2, since it is a vital component of all life and,\n* pre-historically, there have been eras in which high CO2 has corresponded with vegetation much more lush than now, supporting enormous herbivores whose caloric demands could not be supported today, and\n* there have been episodes in which warming preceded CO2 rise.\nBeing only an observer, I have no idea what would happen to the models and to your paper of any of these were true?\nFrank Gue,\nProfessional Engineer,\nBurlington, Ontario\nFrank Gue,\nI agree with you on this and add some more reasons.\nIt seems there is a lack of valid evidence to suggest global warming would be harmful. On the other hand, there are many lines of evidence that seem to suggest global warming would be net-beneficial, not detrimental, for life on earth, human well-being and the global economy.\n1. The planet is currently in about the severest coldhouse phase it has been in since complex life began (around 650 Ma ago) (Scotese, 2016, Figure 15) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275277369_Some_Thoughts_on_Global_Climate_Change_The_Transition_for_Icehouse_to_Hothouse_Conditions .\n2. According to Scotese, the average global temperature was around 7 °C warmer than now for the past half billion years (Scotese, 2016)\n3. Life thrived when the planet was warmer, but struggled when colder\n4. About 10 times more C is tied up in the biosphere now than at the last glacial maximum (IPCC AR4 WG1 Chapter 6)\n5. Tol, 2013, Figure 3 (bottom panel), projects the economic impacts of global warming would be beneficial up to around 4 °C warmer than now, if the projected negative impacts of energy consumption are excluded. Empirical evidence does not appear to be consistent with the projected negative impact of GW on energy consumption – GW is likely to also be positive for the global economy.\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-012-0613-3#page-1\nOr (Free access to working paper version): http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/climate_change.pdf\n“anthropogenic CO2 has been proven to be the culprit in AGW”\nGiven the uncertainties, probably never will be proof.\nHowever, doing a thought experiment: put a spherical shell around earth at the tropopause and consider the change of net energy flux at the shell, and increased CO2 does very likely increase mean surface temperature.\nBut as you indicate, there are benefits to increased CO2. This includes, as you mention, CO2 fertilization, but also the climate effect of increased CO2 is thought to reduce temperature variability and the kinetic energy of storms. It would seem that for some time to come, increased CO2 is an overall benefit to humanity.\nfranksgue: There seem to be several hidden assumptions behind it, one being that anthropogenic CO2 has been proven to be the culprit in AGW ACC(anthropogenic climate change).\nI don’t think Ross McKitrick makes that assumption anywhere.\nIt is interesting to see the enormous range in energy fluxes in the CMIP5 models (CMIP5 =Climate Model Incomparison Project) used by IPCC in their Assessment Report 5. The energy balance over land and oceans: an assessment based on direct observations and CMIP5 climate models – Wild et al 2014\nHere are some examples of the range of energy fluxes from the models (See Table 2: Simulated energy balance components averaged over land, oceans and the entire globe from 43 CMIP5/IPCC AR5 models at the TOA, atmosphere, and surface)\nSurface (All units: W/m2): Solar down: 18.6 W/m2\nSolar up: 10.5\nSolar net: 17.2\nThermal down: 18.5\nThermal up: 11.8\nThermal net: 15.7\nNet radiation: 17.2\nLatent heat: 13.9\nSensible heat: 13.1\n(Averages are taken over the period 2000–2004)\nThe level of current energy accumulation on earth is estimated from observation of ocean warming to be 0.6 W/m2 (Ref.: “considering a global heat storage of 0.6 W m–2» ref.: IPCC;AR5;WGI;page 181; 2.3.1 Global Mean Radiation Budget).\nBy the range of energy fluxes compared to the energy accumulation, I think it is reasonable to assume that the models would have been all over the place if not constrained by heavily tuning to previous observations like for example the warming from the 1970´s to 2000. That many models may have seemed right for the wrong reasons should be beyond reasonable doubt.\nIf anthropogenic carbon dioxide is significantly effecting atmospheric CO2 levels, it should show up in the Mauna Loa CO2 data. Using Excel I plotted Mauna Loa data beginning with decimal year 1958.208 thru 2017.375 and got a trend line of 9E-05(X 2)+0.0656X+314.36 with an R sq of 0.99304. Since there has been a year to year fluctuation in anthropogenic CO2 release, if anthropogenic CO2 significantly affected atmospheric CO2 levels I would have expected a much lower R sq. Where is the anthropogenic signal in remarkably smooth Mauna Loa data?\nThis shows accumulated emissions versus accumulated CO2. They are proportional to an extent that can’t be coincidental.\nhttp://www.ferdinand-engelbeen.be/klimaat/klim_img/acc_co2_1900_2004.jpg\nSource please.\nHow do you know that the values on the y axis was not estimated from the values on the x axis in the first place?\nBecause they are proportional not equal, and not perfectly proportional.\nSo you are just guessing.\nWhich part don’t you believe, the emissions or the accumulated CO2 in the atmosphere. Both are easy datasets to check for yourself. Here’s another one. Coincidence that they ramp up at the same time? I think not. I thought this part was settled, but apparently there’s still folks out there who haven’t even looked at data like this before or have some wacko theory about a coincidence occurring.\nhttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.moyhu.org/misc/ghg/m1.png\nIt is not about what I believe. It is about what you know.\nIt seems more about what you don’t know about actual numbers. Do these plots come as a complete surprise to you? Have you seen other versions that you have believed? Did you know that our emissions (nearly 2000 GtCO2 by now) account for about double the CO2 increase in the atmosphere (about 900 GtCO2), and that these are both well known numbers? How about that 75% of these emissions, CO2 increase, and temperature rise have occurred since 1950?\nI just asked for the source. I had some questions about that figure and the basis for it.\nYou can tell from the web page it is from Ferdinand Englebeen, but it looks like standard data that you can find from any source.\nYes, you seemed completely taken by surprise by it. Anyway there it is.\nhttp://www.ferdinand-engelbeen.be/klimaat/klim_img/acc_co2_1900_2004.jpg\nI´m not surprised, and I´m not believing anything, I´m just curious. I understand that the figure comes from the sites of Ferdinand Engelbeen, but I still don´t know the basis for it and I can not find the basis for it at his sites. It was a simple question. I just wanted to have a look at the basis for that figure. I just asked for a link to the source for that figure, as I expected that the source might contain traceability for the numbers that are represented by that figure. I now got the figure twice, but I still don´t got the basis for it.\nThere are places you can find the data such as this one, so it is possible to create your own plot to check if you are really interested.\nhttp://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob_2014.html\nhttp://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/mauna-loa-co2-vs-emissions.jpg\nHere are the growth rates in the MLO era of those cumulative emissions. As can readily be seen, the growth rates are all over the place. (the parameters in cumulative emissions graphs are as such that these details don’t show up) Of particular note are the step rises in the carbon growth rate circa 1980 & 2000 that coincide with well known step rises in temperature. Were it not for those step rises, trends would be nowhere near ferdinand’s 53% ratio. So, yes, it’s easy to see that the cumulative emissions graphs ARE mere coincidence. A coincidence that is clearly identifiable as being maintained solely by the rise in temperature…\nAnnual increases are affected by the global temperature, but these don’t have a cumulative effect. The amount emitted is about twice that in the atmosphere. So you may ask why does the annual increase depend on the temperature? It because in warmer years less can be absorbed by the natural processes that remove about half of the emissions. For example, warmer water holds less CO2 than colder water.\nAfonzarelli, The CO2 rise does seem to like the upper bonds of the temperature chart.\nhttp://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/esrl-co2/from:1958/mean:24/derivative/plot/hadsst3sh/from:1850/scale:0.25/offset:0.1/plot/esrl-co2/from:1958/mean:24/derivative/trend/plot/hadsst3sh/from:1958/scale:0.25/offset:0.1/trend\nThe rise in co2 is also coincident with the rise in temperature of the southern ocean over and above an equilibrium state…\n(the above wft graph shows the calculated growthrate of co2 from temperature going back to 1850)…\nThis is just that Salby stuff of nonsense, isn’t it? He thinks all our CO2 comes from outgassing but doesn’t explain how the ocean acidifies at the same time, which is a neat trick in carbon nonconservation. He is clueless about where all that carbon could be coming from. He shows graphs and charts that fool many, but can’t answer the basic question.\nThis is just that Salby stuff of nonsense, isn’t it?\nNo, jim, it’s just data…\nYou seem to have a penchant for things that are highly coincidental. Well, it’s highly coincidental that temperature has been tracking with the carbon growth rate since the inception of the MLO data set over half a century ago, the pinatubo years being the lone exception. An examination of the carbon data and emissions data (spencer’s graph) shows only two data sets that trend alike, but don’t look alike. The carbon data and the sst data, on the other hand, actually look alike. THAT, my friend, is highly coincidental. Data shouldn’t be ignored when it runs counter to our biases. i’m not suggesting here that the rise isn’t anthropogenic, only that there seems to be something going on that i’ve never seen adequately explained…\nThe natural carbon sink tracks the temperature for obvious reasons, so there is no surprise there. This means CO2 increases faster in warmer years and less fast in colder years even for a constant emission. So the growth varies between fast and less fast, but growth it is, because of the emissions.\nJim D, are you saying emissions have to go to zero before atmospheric CO2 is stabilized? That it will be impossible to prevent further increases in atmospheric CO2 until accumulated emissions ‘flat-line’? Because that certainly is what your plot implies (assuming the proportionality it shows isn’t coincidental).\nNo, the proportionality is because of the exponential growth and the sink trying to keep up. The fraction absorbed would increase if we reduce the emission growth rate below 2% per year. If we stop emission growth, we would eventually reach an equilibrium CO2 level that depends on the emission rate.\nJim D, your plot doesn’t really support that assertion. For a claim about the relationship between accumulated CO2 and the exponential growth rate of emissions, you would need to plot the year-over-year increase in CO2 against the year-over-year increase in emissions.\nTaken at face value, your plot (accumulated CO2 vs accumulated emissions) implies emissions have to go to zero in order for atmospheric CO2 to stabilize. The plot shows that CO2 would still accumulate in the atmosphere even if we reduce the emission growth rate below 2% per year.\nNo, the plot implies that the absorption time scale of CO2 is longer than the current emission time scale. If we reduced the rate of emission growth, the percentage absorbed would be higher, but so far the rate has been fixed at a 33 year doubling time scale for the last century or so, so we don’t see any other fractions yet. The way I see it, natural absorption has a time scale and it can be calculated from the fraction.\nNo, Jim D, the plot has no time scale on it and therefore doesn’t imply anything about time scale. Nonetheless you seem to be claiming that the slope of the plot depends on a time scale parameter, the emissions growth rate.\nYou assert with no evidence that if the growth rate were to decrease the slope of the plot would decrease. You assert with no evidence that if the growth rate were to decrease below 2%, the slope would go negative. And you also assert with no evidence that the only reason the current plot shows a constant, increasing slope is because the emission growth rate has been rock solid for over a century at a 33 year doubling time scale, which is a highly dubious contention in itself.\nNothing in the plot supports any of these assertions.\nI am not asserting this from the plot alone. We emit CO2 with a growth rate time scale of 25 years. The earth absorbs with a time scale of 50 years. The net is the observed CO2 growth with a time scale of 50 years. If the emission time scale and absorption time scale remain constant, you get that linear behavior. Maybe you don’t believe there is either an emission or absorption time scale and that is up to you. I am not sure what leads you to think absorption only stops when emission stops. It doesn’t. It continues until an equilibrium is reached with the ocean and biosphere.\nCalculations of FF emissions of CO2 are more uncertain than acknowledged. They take fuel consumption from fuel stocks transactions and multiply by emission factors involving many assumptions with considerable varibility depending upon the burning conditions.\nWhy not just compare FF consumption with temperatures, since the remedy is supposed to be FF reductions?\nhttps://rclutz.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/wffc-and-gmtuah2.png\nhttps://rclutz.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/fossil-fuels-≠-global-warming/\nBased on the 3 replies, the anthropogenic signal shows up in calculated emissions but not in actual Mauna Loa data. Unless someone wants to challenge the Mauna Loa data I would think the Mauna Loa data says either (or both) the calculations are wrong and/or CO2 atmospheric interchange is poorly understood. I hope data still trumps calculations.\nEmissions account for double the Mauna Loa increase, so I am not sure what you are trying to account for. Do you need to understand where else the emissions are going apart from what ends up in the atmosphere? There are sinks in the ocean and biosphere.\n“a diagram of temperature change versus cumulative carbon emissions since 1870.”\nThe problem with their projections likely derive from their reliance on cumulative emissions. Please see:\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3000932\nFifteen-year trends are somewhat unreliable because in a few decades they are all over the place. For example, look at this below. The models underestimated the trend prior to 1998, probably for the same reason they overestimated it after, because these trends are not stable and predictable but varied by a factor of at least three between these periods, spanning the model trends. On the other hand, thirty year trends are very steady and have been just under 0.2 C per decade since the one centered on 1980. When evaluating models, you need at least 30 years to define a true climate trend. This came up again recently in a posted item, where they say you need 27 years because of the signal to noise ratio for surface temperatures. Models can’t be expected to fit the noise in a 15 year period.\nhttp://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/ipcc/sites/default/files/AR5_SYR_Box_1.1_Figure_1.png\nFashion models can’t afford to misjudge a trend.\nBack to Gavin’s “discovery” : Apparently models can model anything. The only trouble is that we don’t know in advance what the future will bring.\n(c)\nThat’s great news.\nThe first two show a bistable system. This stuff is cool.\nNow, if we had models that showed the same barbell distributions on 14-15 year timescales.\nIt depends which 15 years you take. This shows the smoothed 15 and 30 year trends since 1950. You will see that the 30-year trend is stable to a few percent, while the 15-year trend is variable to a factor of three in the last 15 years. The 15-year noise is not likely to be predictable and when you average the models, this type of noise cancels out, but you should see this kind of variability in a single model run.\nhttp://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:240/mean:120/derivative/scale:120/from:1950/plot/gistemp/mean:120/mean:60/derivative/scale:120/from:1950\nAnyway, bottom line, pointless to try to verify 15 year trends because they are not climate, just noise, and only represent the particular 15 years they were measured, not the next or previous.\nJim D can you explain what you are plotting here and why you started at 1950?\nHAS, it shows the derivative of smoothed 15-year and 30-year temperatures to show how much variability you have in 15-year trends that don’t show up in 30-year trends. The smoothing is done with a triangular filter that removes end effects in the derivatives. The derivative is scaled to a decadal trend, e.g. 0.2 C per decade. Since 1950 you can see the differences in recent decades. If you look before 1950, 15-year trends show some massive swings especially around 1940 that dominate the scaling, and further reinforce how unhelpful they are for climate trends, so I focused in on more recent decades which is what the discussion was about.\nWell I guess discussion on how well the climate model projections match actual observations is a step up from global warming denial.\nIs it a step down for anyone we can think of?\nAre Climate Models Overstating Warming?\nHas the output of Climate Models been so ideologically motivated and politically dictated as to be materially biased and wholly unreliable? Yup! Global warming is a Left versus right issue, not science. Given their prejudices and preconceptions, the Western academics of CAGW can no longer be trusted; they believe history and the scientific method are trite. Reality is not a, collection of platitudes. We cannot ignore the truth embodied in nature and the lessons of the past by simply dismissing them as trite.\nPingback: Ross McKitrick: Despite Denial, Climate Models Are Running Too Hot | The Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF)\nSo, as regards surface temperatures, the models do indeed overestimate warming and even the occurrence of strong El Nino warming in 2015/16 has failed to bring them into line with reality. Zeke’s graph was a ‘statistical trick’, a conclusion which he appears not to have directly challenged.\nIf the oceans come off the boil in the next decade or two and we see a preponderance of La Nina events perhaps, AMO turns down and Arctic sea-ice increases, it’s going to be nigh on impossible for climate scientists to convince us that urgent reductions of CO2 emissions are justified by climate projections which are increasingly divergent from reality, however many statistical sleights of hand are used to demonstrate that the models are still performing reasonably well. Will that be enough to derail a multi-trillion dollar green industry? Somehow I doubt it, sadly.\nAnybody can play if.\nIf the PDO remains positive and El Niño events come even close to matching La Niña events, models would eventually appear to be running very cold.\nJaime,\nWas it evah about the science?\nThis whole discussion is about the wrong set of observations.\nThey observed that celebrating a Paris agreement that gives a pass to the world’s largest emitter of CO2 was intellectually indefensible.\nThey observed that the European policy of subsidizing wind/solar and shutting down nukes created cost without benefit while the American approach of natural gas and keeping nukes created both economic and environmental benefit.\nThey observed that the American pull out of Paris meant the EU proposal to be generous with American tax dollars wasn’t going to happen.\nThey observed that all these political problems go away, and you can keep the grant dollars flowing to climate research, simply by saying it isn’t as bad as they thought (but might be one day).\nSo, science and observations are now in alignment.\nReblogged this on ClimateTheTruth.com.\nThe answer to the post question is yes. In fact, CMIP5 models forecast future warming at 5 times the rate of past warming. And as Rud says, the one model closest to observations does not project alarming warming.\nhttps://rclutz.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/temperatures-according-to-climate-models/\nBetteridge says no.\nThe earth is the receptor of radiation. The sun is the emitter. Please discuss the variations in emitted radiation.\nLies, Damn Lies, and\nStatisticsClimate ModelsDoes it really matter whether the models are spot-on accurate or not? Bottom line is that all the charts show the earth getting warmer, which is not a good thing ( see reports of barrier reef dying, extreme weather etc.) Equally if there is some doubt about effectiveness of approaches to fixing the problem, surely it is safer to try things like reducing co2 emissions? After all, at best we fix warming, at worst we get longer before fossil fuels run out and have a less polluted environment.\nDave\nIf you could have had news reports from the past they would have shown the same in the 1730’s, the 1500’s, much of the 1300’s, much of the period 850 to 1150, much of the Roman Period and during the Bronze Age. it is nothing new.\nA good read is ‘times of feast times of famine’ by le Roy Ladurie or for a more scholarly analysis ‘climate history and the modern world’ by Hubert Lamb who established UEA..\ntonyb\nThis isn’t correct. Paleoclimate data doesn’t show warming during these periods of the same rapidity and magnitude as today.\nI trust you are using the same temp proxies to measure both when you say that.\nBenjamin\npaleoclimate provides an extremely coarse filter, due to data that provides coarse resolutions often spanning many years. They do not show the rapid annual or decadal changes which often occur\ntonyb\nAnd you know they “often occur” because they’re not shown, right?\nAnd you can provide figures for how large and rapid these “not shown” decadal changes are in order to back up your claim that current changes are “nothing new”?\nBenjamin and Tall Guy, You can see the fast changes in the temperature data from 1910 to 1940.\nOr from winter to summer…\n1910 to 1940 was about 0.3 degrees at 0.1/decade.\n1960 to present was about 0.9 degree at 0.16/decade. Three times larger in total, 60% faster.\nPresent warming is both faster and at a total greater magnitude.\nClimatereason: as you point out, the paleoclimate proxies currently do not have the resolution to show past warming this fast (though, maybe this large), which directly refutes your argument that the warming in the past was just as big and fast.\nYou can’t have it both ways. Your argument is self-contradicting.\nBenjamin, where are you getting your data from? (most data sets peg early twentieth century warming at .5C)…\nAlforonzi, GISS temperature trend from 1910 to 1940.\nBenjamin,\nIf you look at Hadcrut4 it looks like about 0.5 degrees from 1910-1940 and about 0.5 to 0.7 from 1978-2008 or 1970-2000. Might be why the IPCC believes that more than half of the warming is anthropogenic. Not 3/4. And gee that’s about 0.16 C/decade for 1910-40. And remember there are error bars on all these. That’s why I am a lukewarmer rather than an alarmist.\nMaybe this helps.\nhttp://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:240/mean:120/plot/gistemp/from:1985/trend\nProxies do reveal inter-decadal changes, for example sharp cooling from solar minima during the MWP from the 790’s and from the 1120’s.\nhttps://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/esperetal2014b.jpg\nBottom line is that all the charts show the earth getting warmer, which is not a good thing ( see reports of barrier reef dying, extreme weather etc.)\nMaybe it is a good thing.\nBenefits: use of the energy with existing infrastructure, CO2 enriched plant growth and crop yields, CO2 increased drought tolerance of plants, CO2 increased heat tolerance of plants.\nFurther, increased mean temperature means reduced temperature variability. It also means less violent storms because of reduced kinetic energy.\nAt some amount, which we’re probably at, global warming doesn’t matter much. At some amount beyond that, global warming may be positive. At some amount beyond that, the net benefit might phase into net detriment. But those that have fallen in love with the solution rather than the problem are ready to declare catastrophe to suit their agendas.\nTurbulent Eddie.\n” It also means less violent storms because of reduced kinetic energy.”\nNo, it does not. Warmer water means more kinetic energy.\nIf you worked this out for yourself, go check you calculations you are wrong. If you read it on a blog somewhere, change your choice of blogs.\nEither we get to 700 ppm within a century which is not a good thing, or easily obtained fossil fuels run out by 2100, also not a good thing. The one solution for both is a wholesale fossil energy source replacement as soon as possible, and definitely by 2100. Just common sense.\nHarry, I thought the kinetic energy in the atmosphere increased from summer to winter, but that was before climate science came along.\nIt [increased mean temperature] also means less violent storms because of reduced kinetic energy.\nNo, it does not.\nhttp://www.cesm.ucar.edu/experiments/cesm1.0/diagnostics/b40.rcp8_5.1deg.001/atm_2080-2099-b40.20th.track1.1deg.005/set4/set4_ANN_EKE_c.png\nHAS.\nNot really sure what your point is. When it is winter in one place, it is summer elsewhere. The amount of energy received from the sun does vary a lot (around 7% I think) but it is more to do with the earth’s elliptical orbit around the sun, not the seasons.\nHarry, in summer its hotter and the kinetic energy is lower.\n( see reports of barrier reef dying, extreme weather etc.)\n(see reports of barrier reef recovering) well, not in the mainstream media.\nhttps://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/how-climate-scientists-mislead-the-world-about-the-great-barrier-reef/#more-34038\nDave Robinson.\nWell said. The models predict warming, and warming is what is being observed. That is certain. The model nit-pickers ignore that simple fact.\nThe rational thing to do is reduce CO2 pollution.\nHarry, it’s also a simple fact that the earth is generally either warming or cooling. So on the basis of this simple fact, models by your definition have a 50/50 chance of being correct. (even worse, it appears that climate models have been superimposed on a hundreds year period of natural warming)…\nIt’s impossible for the Earth’s temperature to stay the same?\nPaleoclimate records show that the Earth’s temperature generally seems pretty stable. We don’t see any warming in the past 5k years as fast and as large as today’s.\nIt would seem that the rational thing to do would be to begin to protect or minimize the population’s exposure to negative consequences. Not to spend multiple lifetimes and the world’s GNP guessing at what brought about the negative consequences. There’s ample evidence (not computer models) all around us of consequences that happened in just the recent past. The Sangamon, Wisconsin, and even the current Holocene have left evidence of negative consequences of something we don’t understand other than our African ancestors having nothing to do with it. Sea-level rise and fall multiple times in just the last 120,000 years. The Florida Keys formed less than 100,000 years ago from sand pushed onto “dead coral” and the formation of limestone (see history of Windley Key). And an entire 50,000 year old bald cypress forest discovered 15 miles out in the Gulf south of Gulf Shores, AL. The only thing totally clear about attribution is that we and our ancestors had nothing to do with it and very likely can never “fix” or control it in the next thousand years. Such a waste of money and time that would be better spent developing plans and policies to minimize loss of life and property (adaptation) for the many Miami, Houston, etc episodes to come.\nafonzarelli.\nI don’t see what your point is. The earth does receive about the same amount of energy from the sun year to year. But that is not what the issue is, the issue is how warm does it get on the surface and lower atmosphere. Green house gases change the distribution of the heat.\n50/50 chance of being correct? No. It is not a coin-toss. The climate models predict a trend of rising temperatures at the surface and lower atmosphere with rising green house gases, and this is exactly what is happening. “Warming or cooling” is not what is being observed, unless you are referring to natural fluctuations. But fluctuations are not a trend.\n“a hundred year period of natural warming”, that is an interesting hypothesis. I don’t see where you are getting the evidence for that. Also, if you claim a hundred years of natural warming, you might want to tell us what you think is causing the natural warming.\nPhillip Parrish.\n“The only thing totally clear about attribution is that we and our ancestors had nothing to do with it and very likely can never “fix” or control it in the next thousand years”.\nNo, just no. There is plenty of evidence that rising greenhouse gases do indeed change the climate. A 40% increase in CO2 in 200-300 years is huge, and I do mean huge.\nBenjamin Wichchester.\n“It’s impossible for the Earth’s temperature to stay the same?”\nCorrect. It is possible for the Earth’s temperature to stay the same, once the natural variability has had enough time to cancel out. A change requires a forcing.\nIt’s too cold for growing crops in much of the northern hemisphere.\nThe rational thing to do is keep adding CO2 to the atmosphere so all the frozen wasteland becomes productive farm land.\nReply to David Springer:\nDead-right, David: add CO2! Most commentators will persist in conflating CO2 with contamination, pollution, and garbage. But no, CO2 alone will PROMOTE pant (and therefore animal) life.\nFurther, there apparently have been times in prehistory when temperature rise PRECEDED CO2 rise, and also times when the temperature rise reached 9 deg. C from today’s.\nFurther, it is a sad facts that I can sit here and invent, if I choose, a “series” of something-or-other data, credit it to the Environment Ministry of Lower Bullroarvia, and start a big argument.\nFrank Gue, Professional Engineer, Burlington, Canada.\n>\nHarry Twinotter | September 29, 2017 at 1:02 am |\n“A 40% increase in CO2 in 200-300 years is huge, and I do mean huge.”\nA 40% increase in white blue-eyed alligators is huge, and I do mean huge.\nReply to David Springer and so many others:\nCO2 IS NOT A POLLUTANT.\nFrank Gue Professional Engineer, Burlington, ON Canada >\nNice spin job, harry, you misconstrued everything i said.

The warming paused because overall ice extent decrease paused.\nAlbedo decrease has paused, look at earthshine and CERES data\n“Natural warming was caused by ice extent decrease since the little ice age.”\nIf true, what do you think the natural forcing is?\n“Albedo decrease has paused, look at earthshine and CERES data”\nIf you have a link to the chart or whatever, I will have a quick look.\n“If true, what do you think the natural forcing is?”\nChanges can happen without external forcings.\nPope is describing a feedback loop that results in an oscillation over many decades. The feedback is change in albedo. When the ocean is warming it evaporates faster and that causes more snow to fall. As more snow falls albedo increases as it accumulates causing the ocean to cool. As the ocean cools less snow falls and albedo starts dropping causing the ocean to begin warming again.\nThere is a decades long cycle to snow advancing and retreating. No external change in forcing required to keep it going.\nFeeback loops are common in both nature and technology.\nThis isn’t correct. Paleoclimate data doesn’t show warming during these periods of the same rapidity and magnitude as today.\nThat is because the past warming records are actually real data. When time passes and current warming forecasts are recorded as real data, it will be well inside the bounds of past warming.\nRoss McKitrick, thank you for the essay. I think it was good.\nYou’re welcome!\nDave, Does it really matter whether the models are spot-on accurate or not?\nYour wording is bad. “Spot on” is not what is being discussed. The problem is that the error is consistent, and large enough that the forecasts (scenarios, predictions, expectations, etc) are undependable for formulating public policy.\nGA, all.\nWhy ON EARTH are we spending so much time and energy on anthropogenic climate change (ACC), which is the biggest “maybe” ever to arrive on the Internet?\n-especially when anthropogenic garbage accretion absolutely, without any doubt whatsoever, visible to our own eyes, easily measured, readily proved to be human-caused, right now is killing millions of food fish and other creatures and is threatening our own medium-term survival?\nFor the big picture, look at the Pacific Gyre, thousands of square kilometers circulating slowly in the Pacific Ocean, much of it debris from those confounded, unnecessary personal water bottles.\nFor the little picture, look at your own municipal land fill, which is probably, like ours, overflowing and causing your officials to hunt desperately for more places to throw things away, when there actually isn’t any place called “away”.\nWe should quit arguing about ACC and get serious about things like Energy From Waste (EFW) and proper pricing of garbage disposal.\n– all the while trying to avoid all those hidden agendas.\nFrank Gue Professional Engineer.\n>\nto whoever commented that Ross didn’t say or imply anything about AGW or ACC:\nNo, and I didn’t say he did.

This perspective extends to the component discrete algorithms, parameterizations, and coupling breadth: There are better or worse choices (some seemingly satisfactory for their purpose or others needing repair) but not correct or best ones. The bases for judging are a priori formulation, representing the relevant natural processes and choosing the discrete algorithms, and a posteriori solution behavior.” http://www.pnas.org/content/104/21/8709.full\nThat’s right. They pull it out of their arses.\nThe exam (CMIP5) may give a clue about which models were selected:\n«RCP8.5 is a so-called ‘baseline’ scenario that does not include any specific climate mitigation target. The greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations in this scenario increase considerably over time, leading to a radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2 at the end of the century. While many scenario assumptions and results of the RCP8.5 are already well documented, we review in this paper some of the main scenario characteristics with respect to the relative positioning compared to the broader scenario literature. In addition, we summarize main methodological improvements and extensions that were necessary to make the RCP8.5 ready for its main purpose, i.e., to serve as input to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) of the climate community. CMIP5 forms an important element in the development of the next generation of climate projections for the forthcoming IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).»\nhttps://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0149-y.pdf\nThat is not exactly a blind test, the expected answer was pretty much known upfront. Obviously the models that didn´t provide something in the vincinity of the expected output would not even be suggested as a candidate for the Intercomparison Project.\nRepresentative concentration pathway 8.5 is a scenario for forcings used as inputs to the models, not the models themselves. The models are developed by different modelling teams around the world and because national pride is involved there is no real sign that survival of the fittest applies. All the models use the same standard rcps.\nThe rcp8.5 scenario was developed to represent the high emissions scenarios used in the literature at the time.\nThe particular real world developments to get to this scenario are well nigh impossible, so don’t use it for anything other than giving an upper bound.\nBy the following paper, both RCP 8.5 and RCP 6.0 seem to be wildly exaggerated: The implications of fossil fuel supply constraints on climate change projections: A supply-driven analysis\nFrom the abstract: «The emission scenarios used by the IPCC and by mainstream climate scientists are largely derived from the predicted demand for fossil fuels, and in our view take insufficient consideration of the constrained emissions that are likely due to the depletion of these fuels. This paper, by contrast, takes a supply-side view of CO2 emission, and generates two supply-driven emission scenarios based on a comprehensive investigation of likely long-term pathways of fossil fuel production drawn from peer-reviewed literature published since 2000. The potential rapid increases in the supply of the non-conventional fossil fuels are also investigated. Climate projections calculated in this paper indicate that the future atmospheric CO2 concentration will not exceed 610 ppm in this century; and that the increase in global surface temperature will be lower than 2.6 DegC compared to pre-industrial level even if there is a significant increase in the production of non-conventional fossil fuels. Our results indicate therefore that the IPCC’s climate projections overestimate the upper-bound of climate change.»\nFigure 2 and figure 4 in the linked paper indicate that both RCP8.5 and RCP6.0 may be totally unrealistic ( SD-PC = supply-driven peak conventional fossil fuels’ scenario / SD-PCU = supply-driven peak conventional & non-conventional fossil fuels’ scenario )\nPingback: Are Climate Models Overstating Warming? | Watts Up With That?\nThere is no global warming due to CO2/GHG effect. So what the models are or not doing amounts to nothing but noise because all the pillars AGW is based on have not come to be.\nThey are the lower tropospheric hot spot, a call for the evolution of a more +AO/NAO , and the call for a decrease in OLR.\nIt can be shown that it is given solar activity tied into oceanic temperatures which govern the global temperatures. Not to mention the likelihood of an increasing albedo during very low solar periods of time due to an increase in clouds, snow cover and major volcanic activity.\nI have said year 2017 is the year things change, because it is the first year which my two qualifiers have come into play for solar to have a cooling effect upon the climate.\nThose being 10 + years of sub- solar activity in general followed by low average value solar parameters which I have listed many times as to what they are.\nThe data and climatic history does not support AGW. I will send a graph which shows what correlates and will continue to correlate to global temperatures.\nIf one is following overall global temperatures the trend over the last few months has been down and without the aid of favorable oceanic temperatures kiss AGW goodbye.\nhttp://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2010/01/climate-modeling-ocean-oscillations.html\nThis is how you evaluate given solar activity versus global temperatures.\nIt is the ocean cooling effect tied into solar activity which gives you a given global temperature. CO2 has nothing to do with it.\nThe GHG effect is a by product of the climate/environment.\nWe will know much more starting now and going forward but I am confident this correlation will hold up going forward.\nIn my previous post I meant to say the overall sea surface temperature trend has been down for the last few months .\nThe answer is yes, for many years. I have been calling for the modeling system to be shut down because scientific prediction method that gives wrong answers consistently is clearly wrong science. But no, they keep using wrong predictions to justify billions spent on Kyoto, Copenhagen, Paris and others. This perverse insistence upon wrong methods makes climate science into nothing more than a pseudo-science.\nI would not even begin to question the theoretical or calculated amounts of CO2 that humans are putting into the atmosphere, but I would point to 71% of the globe, the oceans, (95% unexplored) that might hold some staggering potential contribution. Volcanoes are typically laughed at and quickly dismissed, but what about those submarine volcanoes and vents in the 95% unexplored areas of the oceans? We have small amounts of simple data from thousands of ARGO floats down to 2000 meters, but the average depth of all the oceans approaches 4000 meters. And even if ARGO floats could listen, water can’t boil (no bubbles) at depths below ARGO. So what is the real CO2 contribution here and is there a measureable heat contribution also over long time scales that would promote release into the atmosphere? I’m not even convinced that CO2 from all sources (in the atmosphere) is being accurately captured/measured. If not, then the models are more broken than anyone suspects.\nThe oceans are not releasing CO2, they are absorbing it. CO2 from submarine volcanoes gets dissolved and transformed.\nFull fathom five…\nNothing that\ndoth fade,\nBut doth suffer\na sea-change\nInto something\nrich and strange.\nSo there is no CO2 in the ocean and the notion that there is 60 times more CO2 in the ocean than the atmosphere is false. The ocean eats and transforms CO2 just as it ate the model predicted elevated warming over the past 20 years. OR.. The ocean can distinguish between CO2 that falls out of the atmosphere and that belched from a submarine volcano or vent. Sounds plausible to me. That shoots holes in my notion that transfer might actually happen and be quite different from one region to another. Guess I should run along and pick up some salad dressing to pour over my green leafy CO2 pollution.\nNo. We are talking about net transfer. The ocean is a net carbon sink.\nMost of the carbon in the ocean is not as CO2, but bicarbonates and carbonates.\nBeing a net sink means more CO2 enters the oceans than leaves them, and more CO2 is made into bicarbonates than the opposite.\nDuring warming periods usually the oceans release CO2. This is a special warming period, because the oceans are taking CO2 instead of releasing it. The reason is partial pressure difference dominates over temperature-driven gas solubility changes. After all the oceans are warming very little.\nDang, Javier. Looks like we might be 70% or more in agreement after all. It’s amazing what you can entice out of someone by dragging some silly bait in front of them to draw them out of the now normal 140 character limitation mode. Thanks for the response.\nJavier, even if aco2 was entirely absorbed by carbon sinks (and the entire rise was natural), then nature would still be a net sink for carbon. Thus, the observation that nature (or the ocean for that matter) is a net sink for carbon tells us nothing about attribution…\nThere is a report somewhere in this monstrous (and mostly pointless) file to the effect that Mount Pinatubo, in four days, emitted more CO2 than all of humankind for all the time we humans have been here. Similarly with that volcano in Iceland that stopped all passenger jets for several days. There are hundreds of volcanos on earth, most far under water. Then there is the Great Atlantic Rift …….\nGood grief. We humans are a pimple on the pimple of CO2 generation. Let’s spend our energies on something useful.\nFrank, Burlington Ontario\nA point, that someone may have already made (apologies if so) is that the Millar et al. paper is really looking at how much we have warmed for a given total emission, not for a given total change in forcing. Normally we represent climate sensitivity as a relationship between temperature changes and changes in forcing, not temperature changes and changes in total emission. It is possible (although this is not obvious) that we have warmed less than expected, given how much we’ve emitted. This, however, does not mean that climate models are warming too much relative to the change in forcing.\n…’This, however, does not mean that climate models are warming\ntoo much relative to the change in forcing.’\nDoth it not?\nIt means we have been sold a 2-3°C warming that is not going to take place.\nI don’t like being shortchanged. I demand the full amount of warming that my emissions deserve.\nEven with the Paris agreement, 2-3oC of warming is still quite likely.\nThat’s what the models say, but we already know that the models are wrong and overheating. The whole thing has been built over shaky assumptions, and then the assumptions assumed to be facts. We have seen this process many times since Malthus. Population bomb, limits to growth, acid rain, ozone hole, global warming. All built over assumptions that turn out to be incorrect. And we even see the same people moving from one false scare to the next.\nhttps://whatwillwedotoday.com/images/2013/03/HALquotes.006-e1363869879703.jpg\nSounds like the Javier Conjecture.\nhttps://judithcurry.com/2016/09/20/impact-of-the-2400-yr-solar-cycle-on-climate-and-human-societies/#comment-813217\nNever my conjecture.

They are 2 cents a piece, like everybody else’s opinion. What I care about is the data and the evidence presented. If the scientist works well, the data is correct forever. It can always be interpreted to support a new hypothesis hopefully more correct.\nSo I don’t care much what Haigh thinks or supports. I care a lot about the evidence she is uncovering and showing in her articles. As every scientist, she will be proven right on some things and wrong on others.\nI let faith and priests that interpret the scriptures to religion.\nGotta admit Javier, for someone maintaining your dogma over the views of the very people whose science you claim to represent, that’s pretty funny.\nNo dogma, here. Just sticking to the evidence as much as I can. If the evidence changes I’ll change.\nPeople, people, people!\nIt’s SO MUCH simpler than we are making it.\nThe four-step scientific method (supplemented by Frank) has been used for centuries and ALWAYS WORKS:\n0.

Frank’s supplement: Challenge the law constantly by obeying the adage: Skepticism is the soul of science.\nI won’t plug my numbers into this as it would be a waste of MORE time. If anyone else wants to – be my guest. The first question such a brave person must ask is: Where in the four steps are we, cuz we sure as heck ain’t close to the 4th or 5th.

RSS trends showing the millennial cycle temperature peak at about 2003 (14)\nThe RSS cooling trend in Fig. 4 and the Hadcrut4gl cooling in Fig. 5 were truncated at 2015.3 and 2014.2, respectively, because it makes no sense to start or end the analysis of a time series in the middle of major ENSO events which create ephemeral deviations from the longer term trends. By the end of August 2017, the strong El Nino temperature anomaly had declined rapidly. The cooling trend is likely to be fully restored by the end of 2019.\nForecasts and trend calculations which ignore this turning point are clearly useless see Fig. 12\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iSxtj9C8W_A/WKNAMFatLGI/AAAAAAAAAkM/QZezbHydyqoZjQjeSoR-NG3EN2iY93qKgCLcB/s1600/cyclesFinal-1OK122916-1Fig12.jpg\nFig. 12. Comparative Temperature Forecasts to 2100.\nFig. 12 compares the IPCC forecast with the Akasofu (31) forecast (red harmonic) and with the simple and most reasonable working hypothesis of this paper (green line) that the “Golden Spike” temperature peak at about 2003 is the most recent peak in the millennial cycle. Akasofu forecasts a further temperature increase to 2100 to be 0.5°C ± 0.2C, rather than 4.0 C +/- 2.0C predicted by the IPCC. but this interpretation ignores the Millennial inflexion point at 2004. Fig. 12 shows that the well documented 60-year temperature cycle coincidentally also peaks at about 2003.Looking at the shorter 60+/- year wavelength modulation of the millennial trend, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the cooling trends from 2003 forward will simply be a mirror image of the recent rising trends. This is illustrated by the green curve in Fig. 12, which shows cooling until 2038, slight warming to 2073 and then cooling to the end of the century, by which time almost all of the 20th century warming will have been reversed.\nLet’s just pick a solution in the ‘observational’ range of TCR and and see how long we can get away with it for? Then they can be ensembled with others modelers choices within the ‘observational range’… and a statistics of angels on pinheads produced.\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/slingo-and-palmer-e1506451524627.png\n“In 1963, Lorenz published his seminal paper on ‘Deterministic non-periodic flow’, which was to change the course of weather and climate prediction profoundly over the following decades and to embed the theory of chaos at the heart of meteorology. Indeed, it could be said that his view of the atmosphere (and subsequently also the oceans) as a chaotic system has coloured our thinking of the predictability of weather and subsequently climate from thereon.\nLorenz was able to show that even for a simple set of nonlinear equations (1.1), the evolution of the solution could be changed by minute perturbations to the initial conditions, in other words, beyond a certain forecast lead time, there is no longer a single, deterministic solution and hence all forecasts must be treated as probabilistic.” http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1956/4751\nHere is what it comes down to which is will the oceanic temperatures fall as we move forward and will there be a slight uptick in albedo? I am talking 1/2 of 1% for albedo increases..\nNext is what determines or influences albedo /oceanic temperatures?\nIs it solar or the GHG effect?\nI say solar and if this is correct then oceanic temperatures should continue to fall while the albedo increases and there goes AGW.\nI will send the most recent data on oceanic temperatures and if one is for cooling the past three months look quite promising.\nI have been calling for this for quite a long time.\nWithout the aid of favorable oceanic temperatures kiss global warming good bye.\nThe second the wind starts blowing, SST starts going down; the second it stops blowing, SST pops right back up.\nhttps://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/\nAnother year has gone by, it’s now the Fall of 2017, and it’s time once again to put up ‘Beta Blockers Parallel Offset Universe Climate Model’, a graph first posted here in the summer of 2015.\nhttp://i1301.photobucket.com/albums/ag108/Beta-Blocker/GMT/BBs-Parallel-Offset-Universe-Climate-Model–2100ppx_zps7iczicmy.png\nThe above illustration is completely self-contained. There is nothing on it which can’t be inferred or deduced from something else that is also contained in the illustration.\nFor example, for Beta Blocker’s Scenario #1, the rise of GMT of + 0.35 C per decade is nothing more than a line which starts at 2016 and which is drawn graphically parallel to the rate of increase in CO2 which occurs in the post-2016 timeframe. Scenario #1’s basic assumption is that “GMT follows CO2 from Year 2016 forward.”\nBeta Blocker’s Scenario #2 parallels Scenario #1 but delays the start of the strong upward rise in GMT through use of an intermediate slower rate of warming 2025 – 2060 that is also common to Scenario #3. Scenario #2’s basic assumption is that “GMT follows CO2 but with occasional pauses.”\nBeta Blocker’s Scenario #3 is simply the repeated pattern of the upward rise in GMT which occurred between 1860 and 2015. That pattern is reflected into the 2016 – 2100 timeframe, but with adjustments to account for an apparent small increase in the historical general upward rise in GMT which occurred between 1970 and 2000. Scenario #3’s basic assumption is that past patterns in the rise of GMT occurring prior to 2015 will repeat themselves, but with a slight upward turn as the 21st Century progresses.\nThat’s it. That’s all there is to it. What could be more simple, eh?\nAll three Beta Blocker scenarios for Year 2100 — Scenario #1 (+3C); Scenario #2 (+2C); and Scenario #3 (+1C) — lie within the IPCC AR5 model boundary range; which it should also be noted, allows the trend in GMT in the 2000 – 2030 timeframe to stay essentially flat while still remaining within the error margins of the IPCC AR5 projections.\nScenario #3 should be considered as the bottom floor of the three scenarios; and it is the one I suspect is most likely to occur. The earth has been warming for more than 150 years and it isn’t going to stop warming just because some people here and on WUWT think we are somehow at or near the top of a long temperature fluctuation cycle.\nIf I’m still around in the year 2031, I will take some time to update the above illustration to reflect the very latest HadCRUT numbers published through 2030, including whatever adjusted numbers the Hadley Centre might publish for the period of 1860 through 2015. In the meantime, I’ll see you all next year in the fall of 2018 when the topic of ‘Are the models running too hot’ comes around once again.\n“The above illustration is completely self-contained.”\nFiction then, as pure as it gets?\nNice illustration though.\nSorF, as long as GMT as tracked by HadCRUT4 and its eventual successors continues to rise in a statistically significant way, however slowly it may be rising, then my illustration contains an element of truth.\nAlong about 2030 or so, enough time will have passed so that we can then make a proper assessment as to just how much truth my illustration does actually contain, if any. And if I’m not around at that time to write the assessment, you have my permission and encouragement to write your own.\nNo projections for carbon being reduced from the atmosphere.\nI’m here to tell you that self-reproducing robots the size of bacteria powered by sunlight will be using the carbon in the atmosphere to produce every carbon compound you can name, programmatically assemble it into structures as big & complex as anything physically possible, and it will cost essentially nothing because the robot workforce is self-reproducing.\nSo I predict that before CO2 in the atmosphere builds up to any detrimental level that emerging technology will be using it as a carbon source to produce both fuel and durable goods and we’ll need international agreements on limiting CO2 removal from the atmosphere. In other words atmospheric CO2 is a valuable resource for future manufacturing and we want plenty of it.\nIn other words atmospheric CO2 is a valuable resource for future manufacturing and we want plenty of it.\nAtmospheric CO2 is a valuable resource for growth of green things and making better use of water and we want plenty of it.\nBeta Blocker See 12:14 post above. and\nhttp://climatesense-norpag.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-coming-cooling-usefully-accurate_17.html\nWhy do you think the earth was created in 1860.?\nDr. Page, another thirty to fifty years worth of empirical data must be collected before any predictions made here in the year 2017 concerning where GMT might be headed over the next hundred years can be confirmed or refuted.\nAs long as the 30-year running trend line shows any statistically significant warming at all, regardless of how small that upward trend might be, climate change will continue to be pushed as a major public policy issue by the progressive left.\nSooner or later, another progressive liberal will be elected president. That politician’s inaugural speech is likely to include something like, “The nightmare era of anti-science politics and of climate change denialism is over. Climate change will once again be at the very center of America’s environmental policy agenda.”\nIt does help that the 30-year running trend for surface temperatures is quite close to that predicted by the models, both simple and complex. Right in the 0.15 – 0.2 C/decade range.\nHmm. It’s almost like a century of atmospheric physics research got it more-or-less right.\nBenjamin Winchester: It’s almost like a century of atmospheric physics research got it more-or-less right.\nIt’s reminiscent of the Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse, when most of the physics and engineering was more-or-less right. Or when the Spruce Goose pretty much flew. A higher standard than “more-or-less” right is required for policy to be based on the model.\nThis is the trend line of the 30-year temperature. No pause.\nhttp://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:240/mean:120/plot/gistemp/from:1985/trend\nGISTEMP is a pencil-whipped mess.

I have been attempting to generate interest among those authors whose papers show an interest and innovation in analyzing these temperature series in an analysis I have been doing. I have been most recently interested in the global mean surface temperature series (GMST) and attempts to decompose those series into a secular trend, cyclical and noise (red and white) components. That interest was piqued by an email exchange with Tom Karl and some of the authors of their paper “Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global warming hiatus” (Karl 2015) which can be found at the following link:\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469/tab-pdf\nDuring those exchanges we discussed using linear trends from regression versus other available methods for deriving tends and decomposing series that can handle non-linear trends and non-stationary series such as Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The Karl authors brought up the use of EMD for a future paper as a sequel to their original Karl 2015 paper. We were comparing results of SSA and EMD. I was more familiar with SSA, but I noted after doing a quick survey of the literature on EMD that the Karl authors were using the combined trend and most significant cycle component as the trend without acknowledging the separation of these components by EMD. That is where the exchanges between the Karl authors and me stopped.\nI continued my work analyzing both observed and CMIP5 RCP 4.5 model GMST series. I used the combined SST (for ocean) and SAT (for land) temperatures for observed and modeled GMST so that I would avoid the apples to oranges comparisons that are sometimes seen in the literature where the observed ocean temperatures (SST) are used in a comparison with models where the ocean (SAT or tas and not tos) are used. I initially had some consternation about the SSA method not readily separating any cyclical components until I began looking at simulated series where I combined known trend, cyclical and noise series and found that the heuristics of the SSA method could not make a clear separation of cyclical components that would be expected from a GMST series – whereas EMD could.\nIn my investigations of the use of EMD I read the Huang article linked here: http://www.academia.edu/14188939/On_the_time-varying_trend_in_global-mean_surface_temperature that uses EEMD to decompose an observed GMST series. I have read other related articles on the use of EEMD and CEEMD in decomposing time series and the use of plots of log(variance) versus log(period) for the series components and with the confidence intervals for the series noise to determine the significant components. I have been using EEMD and CEEMD from R and the library hht.\nI am of the view that the recent global warming is caused partly by anthropogenic and partly by natural effects and that the big question going forward is the relative portions from these two sources. Estimations of the sensitivity of temperature to radiative forcings, and particularly anthropogenic sourced green house gases, from observations and for determining the validity of climate model output depend critically on estimating these portions.\nIf there are methods available for demonstratively improved separation of the global warming series components and to thus better estimate these portions – such as EEMD/ CEEMD – then one has to wonder whether the seeming lack of interest by the climate science community to this newer approach is due to unfamiliarity with that method. Making no claims of originality, novelty or propriety for my work I have put it out to innovative authors noted above with hopes of getting the climate science community interested in looking further into this approach and its application to temperature series. Hausfather and Cowtan were among those from whom I solicited a response on my work. Thus far the I have received no responses from any of those authors I solicited.\nThe trends in degrees C per decade I found for the critical 1975-2016 GHG period for the means of 102 CMIP5 RCP 4.5 runs was for EEMD 0.115, for OLS with breakpoints was 0.181 and for the OLS for the 1957-2016 period was 0.192 while for the GHCN GMST it was 0.101 for EEMD, 0.165 for OLS and breakpoints and 0.171 for OLS for the 1975-2016 period. These results indicate that by taking reoccurring low frequency cyclical components out of the climate model and observed series lesser differences between models and observed series are produced, but it reduces, in both cases, the 1975-2016 period trend by approximately 40%.\nThe most successful decompositions involve a fit to temperature changes expected from an exponentially growing anthropogenic CO2 component. Here is one from Vaughan Pratt.\nhttp://clim.stanford.edu/GC23C-1085.pdf\nCyclic functions make no sense unless you take the background exponential out properly.\nThe advantage of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is that no assumptions for parameters need to be made a prior – it is an empirical method as the name implies.\nInteresting that from EEMD analysis the CMIP5 models show cyclical components in the historical period where the modelers are inclined to match or attempt to match the observed GMST. The periods of the model and the observed are not necessarily the same but have the same effect of reducing the trends that might otherwise be attributed to a secular trend caused by GHGs in the critical 1975-2016 time period.\nCyclic behavior is an assumption that is often wrong in systems, especially growing ones.\nMost all of the CMIP5 models (as well as the observed series) show cyclical modes in EEMD analysis of GMST and of varying frequencies within an individual model.and observed series.\nI have had one poster speculate that the climate modelers require the presence of these cycles in order to match the observed series in the historical period.\nI have not to date found a published detailed analysis disputing the findings of EEMD cyclical components in GMST series.\nCyclic behavior is a poor approximation to exponential behavior. In fact it doesn’t work at all. There is exponential forcing in the last century or so, so it has to be included. It has also been poorly approximated as a linear secular trend, for example in the AMO definition on woodfortrees, and in some papers who do linear detrending when trying to analyze long-term cycles without the background trend.\nJim D, do you have a good understanding of how the method EEMD decomposes a series into periodically reoccurring, trend and noise components -and further how the results can be used to determine statistical significance? Do you know what the separated components look like? Do you have any references that critique the application of EEMD in analyzing observed and CMIP5 modeled GMST series?\nNo, but have you tried applying that method to a simple exponential function to see what it gives? I think it is not fit for purpose.\n> I have not to date found a published detailed analysis disputing the findings of EEMD cyclical components in GMST series.\nI have yet to find any explanatory power given to EEMD, e.g.:\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAS-D-14-0296.1\nDisputing definitions may not be to every scientist’s taste.\nI have tested EEMD using many different simulations with various known reoccurring periodic, trend and noise components with good results. An exponential function, in and by itself, in a series would be decomposed as a trend.\nA series with a high level of autocorrelation can show as a reoccurring periodic component but not as part of the trend – and it is, of course, the trend that is the critical component to cleanly separate in these series.\nIt has been an increasing trend for a century, and unless you have a suitable function, you would be deceiving yourself.\nWillard, from that article you linked above (which I have previously read) the author states in the conclusions what my initial post here on this topic is asking, i.e. more attention to the MDV.\nCyclic behavior is an assumption that is often wrong in systems,\nWhen Cyclic behavior appears in all of the past fifty million years you can be sure it will appear in future behavior.\n> the author states in the conclusions what my initial post here on this topic is asking, i.e. more attention to the MDV.\nThe authors also admit in the introduction that there’s no real explanation for the MDV to date. Could be ENSO. Could be Jupiter and Saturn.\nLots of theories.\nThey don’t mention stadium waves, however.\nMy point was to recall that EEMD’s just a tool. Just like any tool, it has limitations. You could go for MEEMD for all I care:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792406/\nThere might be other limitations.\nAs far as we’re interested in a scientific explanation, it’s the MDV that matters.\nWillard, you make two points that are obvious and often stated in papers on these subjects but should be repeated and those being (1) the theoretical basis and physical meanings for periodically occurring components of climate model and observed GMST series have been subject to speculation but not hard proofs and (2) the EEMD analysis is limited to temporal series. I do not think either of these points detracts from these analyses results from EEMD or the thoughts that more work by the mainstream climate science community is required in this area.\nMEEMD may be able to overcome some of the problems that can occur with EOF/PCA as the excerpt from your link says here: “EOF analysis, which in many other fields is called PCA, and principal oscillation pattern analysis. In these methods, spatial structures and temporal evolutions are assumed separable and the spatial structures remain unchanged throughout the climate system evolution. However, the high sensitivity of the results obtained using these methods to both spatial and temporal domains cast shadows on the validity of this assumption. Indeed, such methods often meet difficulties in interpreting physical meanings of the results.” Certainly better analysis methods of spatial components could lead to a better understanding of temperature changes and perhaps insights into temporal evolution of these changes.\nI would much prefer looking at temperatures with EEMD and perhaps MEEMD than taking the conventional approach of using linear OLS trends without regards to what is GHG and naturally caused or whether the series trends might well be non linear.\nKen.\nNo amount of statistical analysis will show the physical thing you want to show. Physics will show that. Trends and cycles..are…not..in..the…data. they are in the model of the data.\nJim D: The most successful decompositions involve a fit to temperature changes expected from an exponentially growing anthropogenic CO2 component. Here is one from Vaughan Pratt.\nAll of these fitted models, that by Vaughan Pratt, the EEMD results, etc, entail forecasts/projections/models/expectations/predictions/etc for the future. Some like Pratt’s are dependent on the future evolution of CO2 concentration, some are not. None should be considered successful before a few decades of (future) out of sample data have been obtained. Right now, you can get high model fits with or without CO2 in the model. Every model that fits well has at least a quasi-periodic component, either in the estimate of the signal or in the spectral decomposition of the estimate of the residual (“noise”). If there is a cause for the cyclical component, it isn’t very completely or accurately characterized.\nI am looking forward to updates of model forecasts (when dependent on CO2 evolution, as is Pratt’s model), and on updates of model to data comparisons as time goes by. I also look forward to newer models. I expect to have to wait a couple decades before I see a model that has been accurate for a long enough time to produce confidence in its predictions for what comes after that.\nMeanwhile, model forecasts are highly dependent on modeling assumptions that have not been “stringently” tested.\nPratt did not model the future. The exponential function of CO2 level is a fit, and a good one, to the past. It is needed to do a better detrending than some of the linear efforts, or just plain ignoring trends, and a correct detrending helps to show the non-GHG part of the variation. Mann also does this in his PMO paper.\nSteven Mosher | October 3, 2017 at 10:42 pm |\nIf the physics can clearly explain the trends and cycles of observed and climate model GMST series from first principals, I would agree with your implication that the physics stands alone. If the data were intractable to modeling like we see in many attempts to model economic data, I would agree that we need some a prior insights in analyzing climate phenomena like temperature change. The present state of climate science lends itself to (better) analyses of evidentiary data in attempts to confirm or reject general suppositions from the realms of physics. That we can all agree by first principals of physics that GHGs in the atmosphere will lead to global warming is not sufficient in revealing how much warming.\n> I do not think either of these points detracts from these analyses results from EEMD or the thoughts that more work by the mainstream climate science community is required in this area.\nMore work is always required in most if not all areas, KenF, even those that would encounter technical difficulties. In this area, I suspect we’ll never really get “hard proofs,” but maybe it’s just a vocabulary thing. In any case, the social network of those who use EEMD still looks rather small.\nSuppose we got an MDV signal that would bigly explain a generalized MWP. What would that entail regarding climate sensitivity?\nWillard, your first comment above is part of the puzzlement of mine on this issue. It is not so much that the practitioners form a small group but rather that those in the main stream climate science community have not bothered to critique the method or even discuss it informally. Recall in my original post that it was the Karl (2015) authors of the paper “Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global warming hiatus” that were going to use EMD as part of an analysis in a follow on paper of this original paper. When I pointed out that they were using the combined trend and MVD as trend our email correspondence stopped. I have not seen that follow on paper published to date.\nI have not ventured into the what the removal of the MVD per EEMD would do for climate sensitivity estimates. It would depend on the starting and ending points used in the estimation and where those time periods were in the MVD cycle.\nAlso recall that in one of my above posts that the argument of this thread, at least for the historical period, would be rendered somewhat different since removal of the MVD per EEMD puts the trends for the observed and ensemble of climate models in close proximity. It should also be noted that under EEMD analysis some of the CMIP5 models trends in the critical 1975-2016 period are significantly different from one another (where multiple runs of the individual model were performed) and that in some cases the observed trends would be out of the 95% CIs of a model with multiple runs. Comparing individual models to the observed is my preferred mode of analysis.\nJim D: Pratt did not model the future.\nPratt’s model entails a model of the future. The only really good test of model fitting is how well the resultant model predicts out of sample data, in this case future global mean temperature, conditional on the evolution of atmospheric CO2. Without “passing” the test, the model has no basis for being relied upon for guiding policy — it’s just another model, not necessarily better than a high-order polynomial, where those are known to be absurd for out of sample predictions.\nClearly you did not see Pratt’s AGU work on this. The future is not mentioned, and to extrapolate emissions based on past growth is not a good way to predict a scenario. Pratt’s paper was to fit past temperatures to millikelvin accuracy. A large part of the variation was removed by the assumption of exponential emission growth and the log response to it in temperature.\n> It is not so much that the practitioners form a small group but rather that those in the main stream climate science community have not bothered to critique the method or even discuss it informally.\nThat was quite clear from the start, Ken. Here’s also quite clear: those who are into “intrinsic MDV” are into cyclology. From the paper you read:\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAS-D-14-0296.1\nAlso note that the authors are even talking about “the so-called accelerated warming at the end of the twentieth century”!\nI mean, come on.\nSince I need to hone my Contrarian Matrix, I care about Scafetta’s astrology. Not all researchers have the luxury of studying farfetched ideas. They can safely ignore most of this crap.\nScience is more a race than a boxing match.\n***\nHere’s Richard Alley on the MWP:\nhttps://neverendingaudit.tumblr.com/post/45187548866\nJim D: The future is not mentioned, and to extrapolate emissions based on past growth is not a good way to predict a scenario.\nThat’s why I wrote that the forecasts are conditional on the CO2: as CO2 evolves we can calculate what Pratt’s model gives for that time and concentration.\nThe only parameter to possibly use going forwards would be 2.83 C per doubling that he used to fit the last century or so of temperature trend to the exponentially growing CO2 additions.\nThe only parameter to possibly use going forwards would be 2.83 C per doubling that he used to fit the last century or so of temperature trend to the exponentially growing CO2 additions.\nBasically, Yes. But there is also his model for the residual process.\nThat would assume a repetition of the pattern after 150 years, which would not be easy to justify. However, Wally Broecker did something similar in his global warming paper and turned out not far wrong.\nJim D: That would assume a repetition of the pattern after 150 years, which would not be easy to justify.\nWhat is that about?\nThe hypothesis that would be tested is that the model is an accurate representation of the process that generated the data — in this case the quantitative effect of CO2 accumulation.\nThe residual non-CO2-proportional part is not predictable, so the main process can only project to +/-0.1 C, and only that if we know how much CO2 will be emitted in the intervening time. That is, if you can tell me the CO2 level in a given year, this model can project its suitably smoothed (see Pratt) temperature to within 0.1 C. This works for any year in the past as Pratt showed. However, if the growth of emission deviates much from the past’s 2% per year, I expect that there would be some added uncertainty.\nWillard can you provide some details on Richard Alley’s excerpted comment you provide on how the subtracting a 60-70 year cycle from the current modern warming period trend that some have attributed mainly to increasing GHG levels in the atmosphere will suggest greater future variability.\nThe part where Alley states: “..that would suggest stronger amplifying feedbacks and larger future warming from rising greenhouse gases than originally estimated” is an interesting comment given that we are unsure of the cause of the cyclical portion of the temperature series. Would not there need to be presented some potential natural sources with at least hypothetical feedback processes?\nI have read with interest and applaud the work by Cowtan and Hausfather in papers that deal with making better comparisons between CMIP5 model and observed GMST. I have been attempting to generate interest among those authors whose papers show an interest and innovation in analyzing these temperature series in an analysis I have been doing. I have been most recently interested in the global mean surface temperature series (GMST) and attempts to decompose those series into a secular trend, cyclical and noise (red and white) components. That interest was piqued by an email exchange with Tom Karl and some of the authors of their paper “Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global warming hiatus” (Karl 2015) which can be found at the following link:\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469/tab-pdf\nDuring those exchanges we discussed using linear trends from regression versus other available methods for deriving tends and decomposing series that can handle non-linear trends and non-stationary series such as Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The Karl authors brought up the use of EMD for a future paper as a sequel to their original Karl 2015 paper. We were comparing results of SSA and EMD. I was more familiar with SSA, but I noted after doing a quick survey of the literature on EMD that the Karl authors were using the combined trend and most significant cycle component as the trend without acknowledging the separation of these components by EMD. That is where the exchanges between the Karl authors and me stopped.\nI continued my work analyzing both observed and CMIP5 RCP 4.5 model GMST series. I used the combined SST (for ocean) and SAT (for land) temperatures for observed and modeled GMST so that I would avoid the apples to oranges comparisons that are sometimes seen in the literature where the observed ocean temperatures (SST) are used in a comparison with models where the ocean (SAT or tas and not tos) are used. I initially had some consternation about the SSA method not readily separating any cyclical components until I began looking at simulated series where I combined known trend, cyclical and noise series and found that the heuristics of the SSA method could not make a clear separation of cyclical components that would be expected from a GMST series – whereas EMD could.\nIn my investigations of the use of EMD I read the Huang article linked here: http://www.academia.edu/14188939/On_the_time-varying_trend_in_global-mean_surface_temperature that uses EEMD to decompose an observed GMST series. I have read other related articles on the use of EEMD and CEEMD in decomposing time series and the use of plots of log(variance) versus log(period) for the series components and with the confidence intervals for the series noise to determine the significant components. I have been using EEMD and CEEMD from R and the library hht.\nI am of the view that the recent global warming is caused partly by anthropogenic and partly by natural effects and that the big question going forward is the relative portions from these two sources. Estimations of the sensitivity of temperature to radiative forcings, and particularly anthropogenic sourced green house gases, from observations and for determining the validity of climate model output depend critically on estimating these portions.\nIf there are methods available for demonstratively improved separation of the global warming series components and to thus better estimate these portions – such as EEMD/ CEEMD – then one has to wonder whether the seeming lack of interest by the climate science community to this newer approach is due to unfamiliarity with that method. Making no claims of originality, novelty or propriety for my work I have put it out to innovative authors noted above with hopes of getting the climate science community interested in looking further into this approach and its application to temperature series. Hausfather and Cowtan were among those from whom I solicited a response on my work. Thus far the I have received no responses from any of those authors I solicited.\nThe trends in degrees C per decade I found for the critical 1975-2016 GHG period for the means of 102 CMIP5 RCP 4.5 runs was for EEMD 0.115, for OLS with breakpoints was 0.181 and for the OLS for the 1957-2016 period was 0.192 while for the GHCN GMST it was 0.101 for EEMD, 0.165 for OLS and breakpoints and 0.171 for OLS for the 1975-2016 period. These results indicate that by taking reoccurring low frequency cyclical components out of the climate model and observed series lesser differences between models and observed series are produced, but it reduces, in both cases, the 1975-2016 period trend by approximately 40%.\nKenfritsch See post at 12:!4 pm above\n“It makes no physical sense to calculate trends across the millennial temperature peak and inflection point at 2003-4\nSee Fig 4 from\nhttp://climatesense-norpag.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-coming-cooling-usefully-accurate_17.html“\nMany of the model/observation graphs contain projections that increase with time. Most people would know that most of Nature is bounded; there are increases with time that do not exist because the upward curve becomes an inflection, a downturn.\nIt has never been clear to me why these models have not included this concession to reality, observation and conservatism by projecting an eventual downturn. If it is fossil fuel consumption that causes concern, there are ways to predict a downturn and there is reality that one will happen in time. It will be approximate, it will have errors, but it is surely better than a phantom ongoing increase.\nWhere would Denizens here put the global temperature downturn on these model graphs if they were asked to do this?

If fossil fuels can’t sustain a 1% growth, that would require mitigation and finding ways to replace that dwindling energy source as its costs soar. People should be skeptical that fossil fuels can be cost-competitive for the next few decades given their self-limiting nature which is often overlooked. That’s a conversation that the skeptics don’t seem to want because we don’t see it here for sure. Maybe because it is another argument for replacement.\nPingback: New Boost For Healthy Climate Scepticism | Principia Scientific International\nI’ve been in this global warming debate going on 20 years now. The only way any of us stop arguing about it is when we die. Nothing has been settled in all that time. ECS still the same. Inability to predict regional weather or climate has not improved. No alarming rate of sea level rise where cost of dealing with it exceeds the benefit of abundant low cost fuel that keeps the industrialized world functioning.\nThe planet however has gotten measurably greener in those 20 years according to NASA. Crop production has never been better. Energy intensive fish farming, made less expensive by low cost fuel, relieves pressure on wild seafood populations. Fewer killer frosts for agriculture. Water needs for plants reduced in higher CO2 means less irrigation needed. Growing seasons getting longer. Arable land increasing through warming exceeds arable land lost to sea level rise.\nI’m just not seeing a net downside to fossil fuel use. The only downside to it is it’s not in infinite supply. Sunlight however is in great abundance and there will arrive a technological solution to inexpensive harvesting and storage via gas & liquid hydrocarbon fuels compatible with existing infrastructure. The atmosphere is the carbon source for those fuels. The more carbon in the atmosphere the more efficient it is to pull it out to produce synthetic fuels.\nI’m not alarmed by the energy future. Synthetic biology is almost certainly within 50 years of making hydrocarbon fuel production cheaper than fossil fuels ever were. Organisms that thrive in brackish water fertilized with municipal wastewater able to dominate natural competitors in open ponds whose metabolisms are tweaked so they excrete alcohol and fuel oils are close at hand (one or two human generations away at most I’d say).\nI’m glad the adults finally got put in control of energy & environment in the USA.

Today we know that the cause is the interaction between ocean and atmosphere…\nProf. Latif cautions against too much optimism regarding short-term regional climate predictions: “Since the reliability of those predictions is still at about 50%, you might as well flip a coin.” https://www.geomar.de/en/news/article/klimavorhersagen-ueber-mehrere-jahre-moeglich/\nNot only are climate models unable to project anything but non-linear divergence – but climate is intrinsically unpredictable – and this is all just totally nuts. I know you all have been thinking about it for a long time – just very badly.\nMojib Latif, a climate expert at the Leibniz Institute at Kiel University in Germany, said he “cannot understand” reports that used his research to question the scientific consensus on climate change.\nHe told the Guardian: “It comes as a surprise to me that people would try to use my statements to try to dispute the nature of global warming. I believe in manmade global warming. I have said that if my name was not Mojib Latif it would be global warming.”\n“The chances of correctly predicting such variations are much better than the weather for the next few weeks, because the climate is far less chaotic than the rapidly changing weather conditions,” said Latif. This is due to the slow changes in ocean currents which affect climate parameters such as air temperature and precipitation. “The fluctuations of the currents bring order to the weather chaos”.\nSo prediction for next years winter are a coin flip. Predictions across decades are better than that, and predictions for 2100? He’s Mr. Global Warming.\nLike I said – nuts.\nLatiff has done interesting work in decadal variability over at least the last decade.\ne.g http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3945.1\n“Thus, some useful decadal predictability of economic value may exist in the Atlantic–European sector. To exploit this decadal predictability, however, a suitable ocean observing system must be installed since the memory of the climate system resides in the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, the thermohaline circulation should be monitored carefully since its variations are most interesting in light of decadal predictability in the Atlantic sector. The current ocean observing system, however, is not suitable to produce ocean analyses that would provide a realistic description of the state of the MOC. A lot of effort should be spent in the next years to implement an “adequate” ocean observing system so that the decadal predictability potential can be exploited. A multimodel approach may be an effective way of sampling model uncertainties. Dealing with the uncertainties of anthropogenic climate forcing seems a bigger problem. But, as 20 years ago people may have wondered if seasonal forecasting would ever be possible, in 20 years from now routine decadal to multidecadal predictions may become accepted.”\nSeasonal forecasting is a reality in a probabilistic sense for hydrology. And while greenhouse gases may be a wild card in the 4 dimensional, spatio/temporal chaos of climate – it is by means certain that climate has or will fundamentally shift as a result.\nPerhaps he should call himself Mr. Abrupt and Uncertain. But claiming things are uncertain is a sure way of provoking rabid responses from poorly informed climate fanatics like JC.\nThere are new observing systems\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/26-degree-n-array.png\nAnd interesting data emerging.\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/26-degree-n-array.png\nBut it is not really about science is it JC? Or rather it is a science that JC doesn’t get and substitutes feral science for instead.\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/smeed-fig-72-e1501370181996.png\nSTFU.\nPredicting a cold winter in Germany is impossible – predicting multi-decadal climate shifts in the Pacific is as accurate as tossing a coin. Predicting temperature over the 21st century? Yeah right.\nPrediction of how long it will take a rock to fall is pretty accurate. Prediction of how it will tumble through the air..\nReally tough.\nGlobal stats..those governed by energy balance are easy.\nIt’s been done with accuracy since Hansen.\nPrediction of flow fields in EAR\nPrediction of flow fields in Earth’s spatrio/temporal chaos is impossible – and energy balance is the wrong term. Energy dynamics in the maximum entropy system is far more relevant. There are large changes in radiant flux at TOA with ocean and atmospheric circulation – and circulation changes in regimes in the spatio/temporal…\nMosh and his absurd metaphor notwithstanding.\n“Prediction of flow fields in Earth’s spatrio/temporal chaos is impossible – and energy balance is the wrong term.

Skillful prediction is a matter of degrees.\nEnergy balance is the right term.\nWe know, for example, that if the sun should go out, that the temperature will decrease. Chaos NOTWITHSTANDING. Lack of accurate prediction of flow fields, NOTWITHSTANDING.\nAt the highest levels the climate is not chaotic. It obeys very simple laws.\nLike that rock falling. It will obey the law of gravity. Now we might be able to predict the first few tumbles, but the long range prediction of the flow field around the rock and how it tumbles second by second, will not be predictable with any significant or actionable skill.\nYou would not bet on it.\nnevertheless, we know that just as the rock must fall, the planet must cool if radiative forcing decreases. At the limit we can predict the temperature of the earth should the sun extinguish. The global value, the lowest order metric of the system is highly predictable.\nThe exact pathway from 15C down to the temperature of space.. will probably not be predictable with actionable skill. But we know that despite chaos at the smaller scales that at the largest scales the outcome is certain.\n“Prediction of how long it will take a rock to fall is pretty accurate. ”\n“No prediction is very simple”\nJCH good to see you winning 2 months in a row.\nTime to adjust that satellite sensor it seems to have drifted hot.\n“…we know that just as the rock must fall…”\nIf it was a feather, it would be more interesting.\nI’ve been winning since 2011-2012.\n“… nevertheless, we know that just as the rock must fall, the planet must cool if radiative forcing decreases…”\nOne of the simple rules chaos is that turbulent flows are chaotic at scales from micro-eddies to planets and stars. But my answer is that it depends on the planetary response to changes in control variables. Climate is a dynamical mechanism at a scale of thunderstorms to millennial patterns of flood and drought. It tends to equilibrium and thus to maximum entropy – largely through the simple physics of the Planck response. But it is massively more complex than a tumbling rock. Climate shifts at 20 to 30 year intervals over millennia.\nEnergy dynamic is the right term given large change in TOA radiant flux with changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation.\nRobert I am glad you bring sense to the conversation.\nRight. So the guy you’re quoting is saying that the long-term warming trends will swamp out the short-term fluctuations.\nWe’ll still have short-term fluctuations in a century, just like we do now. But when people here are talking about the “failing models”, they’re literally talking about surface temperatures changes of 0.1 or 0.2 degrees. That’s how far off the models are. Well, that’s how far off they “were” off, anyway, before the last few years.\nMeanwhile, the expected warming is 2-3 degrees.\nSo DeSmogBlog is your go to science source? I was actually being ironic.\nWe predicted multi-decadal climate shifts – said that it added to late century warming and caused the pause. Nor do we know just how much was natural and how much anthropogenic – but natural seems large if we can believe ERBS and ISCCP data. Noe is there any basis for expectations of temperature at all in the far future – although I am pretty sure that the 20th century ‘fluctuations’ – ie abrupt climate shifts – won’t be repeated.\nInept post hos rationalizations notwithstanding – it seems clear that climate is nothing like your memes. The next climate shift will be in a 2018-2018 window. Will that be a surprise – because climate shifts in 1976/77 and the late 1990’s is what the study was about?\nOn the contrary — thus far, if you have solar, GHG, and volcanic forcings, you can do a pretty good job of predicting the climate.\nSo uncertainties in future solar and volcanic forcings translate into uncertainties in future temperatures. But the expected changes in CO2 totally swamp out those uncertainties.\nAnastasios Tsonis, of the Atmospheric Sciences Group at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and colleagues used a mathematical network approach to analyse abrupt climate change on decadal timescales. Ocean and atmospheric indices – in this case the El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the North Pacific Oscillation – can be thought of as chaotic oscillators that capture the major modes of climate variability. Tsonis and colleagues calculated the ‘distance’ between the indices. It was found that they would synchronise at certain times and then shift into a new state.\nIt is no coincidence that shifts in ocean and atmospheric indices occur at the same time as changes in the trajectory of global surface temperature. Our ‘interest is to understand – first the natural variability of climate – and then take it from there. So we were very excited when we realized a lot of changes in the past century from warmer to cooler and then back to warmer were all natural,’ Tsonis said.\nAs you almost said – these are ‘fluctuations’ in surface temperature caused by shifting sea surface temperature in the eastern Pacific at 20 to 30 year intervals.\nThe trajectory of surface temps during the 20th century – warmer, cooler, warmer – was determined by these regimes.\nYou misread Latif, and you are too dishonest to admit it.\nI doubt if JC has read much of anything at all – and has no depth to speak of. It is all just seeing if he can interpret words to agree with his preconceptions – and not understanding what’s really going on at all. When he is not just totally talking through his arse.\nRAZ: Now, your research, Dr. Latif, has been cited by climate change skeptics here in the U.S., by for example, George Will, a conservative columnist with the Washington Post, to show that the Earth actually goes through natural warming and cooling trends and that climate change is really being overhyped. Do you think your work is being misused?\nDr. LATIF: Yes. It is misused. I must say this, unfortunately, because these changes we are talking about, these short-term changes, you know, their amplitudes are much smaller than the long-term warming trends. So we are talking about a hold, okay, in the last 10 years. We are not talking about a net cooling to, say, (unintelligible) temperatures, (unintelligible), you know, which we observed 100 years ago or so. Okay, and also what we predicted for the future is basically that this hold may continue for another 10 years or so, okay, but we did not predict a cooling. We basically said that we would stay for some more years on this plateau. [1]\nIt seems a bit difficult to misinterpret – but JC manages it. It is all fairly obvious – when they are not busily denying it.\nThe model should not be including and hence following the AMO assisted warming from 1995 to 2005. It was bound to overshoot from when the AMO leveled off into its warm phase.\nWhat’s the difference between masking and blending, Ulric?\nThe issue of masking the Arctic is specious, because the Arctic warming is predominately driven by the warm AMO phase. And with the warm AMO being driven by increased negative North Atlantic Oscillation conditions, it is irrational to associate it with an increase in GHG forcings, or a net increase in any climate forcing.\nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-3-5-6.html\nThank you for your non-response, Ulric.\nThat’s a pertinent response to a fairly irrelevant question.

Your understanding of fairly a elementary point, which seems to have escaped Ross, is fairly irrelevant to your drive-byed point.\nI’m not sure your drive-bys are that relevant to this op-ed, though.\nDear friends,\nAfter the April USA solar induced blackout, McGill University started an international campaign to\n“create solar shields against coronal mass ejections”, and an extinction!\nhttp://www.mcgill.ca/iasl/files/iasl/global_space_governance_-executive_summary_and_key_proposed_actions.pdf\n8 institutions have already started the simulations on the ultimate truce tool: Laser Earth Shield vs all deadly space threats, as asteroids, comets and solar superstorms that may blow up all nuclear, as we thankfully escaped in July 2012!

Climate models have 0 predictive power. They are invalid; they do not rank as scientific theories, but no more than scientific hypotheses.\n2. What models have shown is that George Simpson, head of the MetOffice, was correct 80 years ago when he told Guy Callendar “it was impossible to solve the problem of temperature distribution in the atmosphere by working out the radiation.” Climate prediction (weasel word: projections) from Radiative Forcing (Greenhouse Effect, aka the Callendar Effect) is a dead horse.\n3. Since the models fail to account for temperature sensitive albedo and for the oceanic regulatory effect of atmospheric CO2 concentration (Henry’s Law), two dominant feedbacks missing from the models of the climate, the models are the wildest kind of scientific conjectures, the kind in need of repair, teetering on pseudoscience.\n> Climate models have 0 predictive power. They are invalid; they do not rank as scientific theories, but no more than scientific hypotheses.\nModulz. Theories. Please learn the difference, JeffG.\nModulz are indeed realizations of hypotheses.\nIt’s not like we’ve never been there before.\nWillard, you may not have seen this.\nScience creates models of the real world to predict the real world. These models come in four flavors: conjectures, hypotheses, theories, and laws. Conjectures are incomplete, not ready for experiment. Hypotheses are complete, describing an experiment unambiguously, but as yet no novel, non-trivial part empirically validated. Theories were once hypotheses with some non-trivial prediction experimentally validated. Laws are theories which have had all possible predictions from the model validated.\nComputer models are only a method of computation, but with sufficient text become an integral part of a scientific model. GCMs are computer models. With a dozen or so volumes of text, they become an integral part of the Radiation Forcing model of climate, which has been invalidated — invalidated on its prediction of the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity.\n> you may not have seen this.\nBut now I did, Jeff, and I can’t unsee it.\nYour wordology is interesting, but too foreign to what I’m used.\nIs it based on any work in formal epistemology?\nNo Willard Jeff has his own private language and epistemology.\nthe Key is Jeff gets the “prediction” of ECS wrong.\nNothing in observations “invalidates” the models. And particurly not ECS.\nhe also gets Law wrong, but where do you start with junk philosophy of science?\nWillard says I can’t unsee it, and that is a good thing, and finding my wordology is interesting, asked Is it based on any work in formal epistemology?.\nMy goodness, yes, WIllard. Notwithstanding Mosher’s off-the-wall mud balls, the dialogue is not some personal epistemology. It’s Modern Science, alive and well, key works by Aristotle, Bacon, Kant, Neyman-Pearson, Kolmogorov, illuminated by the great works of science and further illuminated by its popular deconstruction by Popper, Fisher. But this thread is no place to hash out epistemology. We need to take this outside.\nMaybe you could be specific, as in saying what part of what I described you find unnerving. And don’t pull an empty Mosher by saying x is wrong.\n> Maybe you could be specific\nI already told you. You’re conflating modulz with theories.\nTo keep it simple, a model is a realisation of a theory. See for instance how to model Gettier cases:\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formal-epistemology/#ModGetCas\nModels are just not theories, so your “[models] do not rank as scientific theories” is pure gibberish.\nYour distinction between hypothesis and a conjecture makes little sense to a Popperian, BTW.\nHope this helps.\nWell said, Jeff.\nPermit me to add:\nThe comment you so accurately criticize takes us only to Step 2 of the Scientific Method’s four steps. Proceeding farther is impossible; we humans cannot do Step 3 (test the hypothesis) because a test of this hypothesis would require centuries or millennia.\nFrank Gue, B.Sc., MBA, P.Eng. Professional Engineer\n>\nAgree completely Jeff.\nThe reason Callendar became famous and nobody has heard of Simpson is because Simpson was wrong and Callendar turned out to be right. It is said Simpson rejected the Arrhenius theory too. No one today rejects Arrhenius, so Simpson was on the wrong side of history.\n“It is said” is senseless. What was said follows.\nCallendar (1938) said that Arrhenious thought that CO2 radiation absorption was negligible, disagreeing with him. P. 223. Callendar provided Table VI of results, which happened to disagree with Arrhenious’ results, and Callendar explained why. P. 232. Callendar (1938) did not reject Arrhenious.\nIn this distant past, reviewers comments appeared in the Discussion section of technical papers (an excellent practice lost), and Callendar (1938) includes Simpson’s snarky remarks. P. 237. People who actually rely scientific papers instead of just puffing out opinions “heard” of Simpson, coincident with hearing of Callendar.\nYou are right to this extent, no one (in this arena) today rejects Arrhenius. Instead, IPCC relegates him to a single historical footnote, once in AR4 and once in AR5.\nCallendar was right to this extent: the Callendar Effect (Greenhouse Effect) exists. Simpson was entirely right, it isn’t sufficient to solve the problem of global temperature, as IPCC has demonstrated at great expense and political disruption. And we now know why it isn’t sufficient: cloud albedo regulates surface temperature, and ocean absorption regulates atmospheric CO2 concentration, two essential feedbacks not modeled in the GCMs.\nCallendar did not include the water vapor feedback that Arrhenius had, so his greenhouse effect was conservative by today’s standards. Only including the water vapor feedback can today’s warmth be explained given the greenhouse effects of the added CO2.\nJim D. … today’s standards, i.e., models that predict measured ECS with a 3% confidence, and that predict a catastrophe in a century if we don’t immediately cough up the treasury and reduce our economy to 3d word standards. This is junk science, Jim D.\nThe problem with the original Callendar Effect is not the omission of water vapor feedback. It’s the same with the AGW model, and changing the name to Greenhouse Effect didn’t help. A sufficient cause for the model failure is that CO2 does not accumulate in the atmosphere.\nThe atmospheric concentration is regulated by the Global Average Surface Temperature of the ocean. The GE has the causation vector backwards. GAST causes CO2 concentration, not the reverse. A principle of science missing here is that in the real world a cause must precede every one of its effects. Of course, GCMs can do whatever the programmer lets them do. Models are as good as their predictions, except for scaring the policymakers.\nNo, you’re just regurgitating the debunked Salby stuff. I have no patience for that.\nWith no specifics, much less support, Jim D 10/517 @ 8:59 am claims, No, you’re just regurgitating the debunked Salby stuff.\nSalby deserved to be debunked for referring to trapping heat, that Earth does things to maintain equilibrium, or, for that matter, that anything in the climate system is ever in equilibrium. Heat and equilibrium are defined words in thermodynamics, and Salby’s references abuse those definitions. IPCC does as well, using words off the grid without stipulating their novel meanings. I have never had any call to reference any of Salby’s work, but if I did it would be to debunk such junk.\nOn the other hand, Salby does recognize that the ocean breathes CO2, and that cloud albedo is a variable. Are you claiming that those rather basic bits of physics, omitted by IPCC-type climatologists, were part of the “debunked Salby stuff”?\nWhat I regurgitated were principles of science, like the two omitted feedbacks of CO2 and temperature, and causation. Are you contending that these rather elementary principles were part of the “debunked Salby stuff”?\nThis is what happens, Jim D., when you fire blanks.\nExplain how the ocean acidifies (gains carbon) while also outgassing. The carbon is clearly coming from fossil fuels. Explain where the fossil fuel carbon is going if not to the ocean and atmosphere. You have clearly not thought it through from a carbon budget perspective, and Salby never provided a budget either.\nJudith Curry,\nI appreciate your statement ”how much warming is caused by humans is THE key issue of debate”.\nThere are two key points we have to learn to understand:\nAt first CO2 content in atmosphere is determined by dynamic balance between all CO2 emissions to atmosphere and all CO2 absorptions from atmosphere to other parts of environment.\nAt second longer trends of CO2 changes in atmosphere follow changes of climate temperature trends and not vice versa.\nAs far as I am aware you have stated, that the climate sensitivity – i.e. increase of climate temperature as CO2 content in atmosphere doubles – adopted by IPCC is highly uncertain and exaggerated. In addition, I have understood, that you et al. have stated, that the climate sensitivity is less by about half of the value adopted by IPCC as you have replaced the climate model calculations by using real temperature observations available instead of climate model results. As to ”THE key issue” of yours you seem to require a more exact result for the issue ” how much warming is caused by humans”.\nEven though Svante Arrhenius proved that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, he did not regard it as any threat of climate warming. Instead he regarded any increase of CO2 content in atmosphere as useful for vegetation.\nThere is a lot of scientists, who, on the bases of experiences of their own, are agreeing with your statement on the ‘uncertain and exaggerated’ climate sensitivity adopted by IPCC. Especially I appreciate Nir Shaviv’s princible, too: do not believe any solution of problem if you have not scrutinized that yourself! And concerning the climate sensitivity, he agrees with you: the climate sensitivity adopted by IPCC is highly uncertain and exaggerated. Scafetta and Lindzen say, that it is lower than 1 and 0.5 C, but they do not state any lowest value. Wojick, Arrak and Cripwell have said that it can not be distinguished from zero, with which I agree, too.\nI have in my earlier comment https://judithcurry.com/2011/08/04/carbon-cycle-questions/#comment-198992 stated:\n”Salby’s abstract for his talk agrees with what Tom V. Segalstad has been claiming already during two last decades, according to which maximum 4% of air CO2 has anthropogenic origin, found by carbon isotope mass balance calculations.”\nConcerning the key point on dynamic balance between all CO2 emissions to atmosphere and all CO2 absorptions from atmosphere to other parts of environment in my comment https://judithcurry.com/2017/02/10/the-new-climate-denial/#comment-838229 I have further written:\n”In the same way as [water from] a small ditch has only minimal influence on lake flooding compared to all the amount of water coming to lake, the small amount of 4 % CO2 from fossile fuels in the total CO2 emissions to atmosphere has only minimal influence on total increase of CO2 content in atmosphere.\nThis proves that CO2 from fossile fuels has recently conrolled only about 4% of the total increase of recent CO2 content in atmosphere at the most; https://judithcurry.com/2011/08/04/carbon-cycle-questions/#comment-198992. In the same comment I have proved that warming of sea surface water in oceans – especially on the areas where sea surface CO2 sinks are – dominates the recent increase of CO2 content in atmosphere.\nIn addition, [even] the more minimal influence of total CO2 content in atmosphere on climate warming has been proved by the observations, according [to] which trends of increase of CO2 content in atmosphere follow trends of climate temperature and not vice versa i.e. according to geological observations during last 100 million years in 10 million years periodes CO2 contents in atmosphere have followed changes of climate temperture; during glacials and interglacials trends of CO2 content in atmosphere have followed trends of temperature changes in climate; and the last nearly two decades prove that CO2 content in atmosphere has been increasing by lag after climate warming. This all should make anyone true that climate sensitivity is so minimal that it can not be distinguished from zero.”\n“For example, from the beginning of this century until recently, the tropical Pacific was locked into a negative Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation phase (that is, low-frequency La Niña-like pattern) in association with increased Walker and Hadley circulation winds and eastern Pacific cooling2,3. The La Niña-like pattern is thought to be a factor contributing to the recent so-called ‘warming hiatus’2,3 and earlier twentieth century cool and warm decades4. Therefore, our analysis of multicentury hydroclimate variability suggests that projections of tropical rainfall patterns, and global temperature extremes, will remain uncertain until paleoclimate records and models consistently capture the lower-frequency variability, and associated feedbacks, in the tropical Pacific.” https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11719\nLarge changes in top of atmosphere radiant flux result from changes in atmosphere and ocean circulation. The changes dominate global energy dynamics over recent decades – despite the carbon dioxide idée fixe. It is presumed that radiative effects from albedo change influence climate over a very long time as well – in a way that is not limited to ice sheet feedbacks.\nModels do not capture the low frequency modes of climate change at all. They have their own low frequency modes due to ‘Hurst effects’ emerging from the temporal chaotic dynamics of the core equations – but otherwise have zero connection to the spatio/temporal chaos of the climate system.\nHurst effects emerged from very long term Nile River flow data. It is the result of regime behavior in a dynamical system.\n“Here we show that one of the most seminal models of deterministic chaotic dynamics, Lorenz’s 1963 model19 which he abstracted from Rayleigh-Benard convection, exhibits the Hurst effect. We show that the origin of the Hurst effect in the Lorenz model is regime behavior.” https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09068\nRegime behavior is of course found in ocean and atmospheric circulation.\n“The fractionally dimensioned space occupied by the trajectories of the solutions of these nonlinear equations became known as the Lorenz attractor (figure 1), which suggests that nonlinear systems, such as the atmosphere, may exhibit regime-like structures that are, although fully deterministic, subject to abrupt and seemingly random change.” http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1956/4751\nClimate reality is that the atmosphere and oceans exhibit regime behavior for which the dynamical systems paradigm provides the best explanation for abrupt shifts in climate time series.\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ghil-sensitivity.png\nClimate is neither cyclical or periodic around a trend. The next climate shift is due in a 2018-2028 window – and no one knows where that will go. It will be marked by a break in the Pacific Ocean state.\nIf very low solar does impact the climate through overall oceanic cooling and increasing the albedo that the next climate shift 2018-2028 is going to be toward colder global temperatures.\noverall oceanic cooling due to less UV light\nalbedo, slight increase due to\na more meridional atmospheric circulation N.H.\nincrease in global ice, snow ,cloud coverage\nincrease in major volcanic activity\nI think the shift has already started.\nRoss McKitrick,\nThank you for this interesting post, and for this recent paper:\nKevin Dayaratna, Ross McKitrick, David Kreutzer (2016). Empirically-Constrained Climate Sensitivity and the Social Cost of Carbon.\nMy interest is in what is needed to justify climate policies. Some points I’d make are outlined below.\nECS, projected future emissions rates, and projected future temperatures are important inputs to the Integrated Assessment models, which are used to project the economic impacts of projected global warming. However, these inputs are relatively unimportant for policy analysis if the impacts of global warming, over the 21st Century, would be beneficial rather than damaging. IPCC AR5 WG3 Chapter 3 mentions ‘damage functions’ eighteen times. It says, for example:\n• “Damage functions in existing Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are of low reliability (high confidence).” [3.9, 3.12]”\n• “Our general conclusion is that the reliability of damage functions in current IAMs is low.” [p247]\n• “… the aggregate damage functions used in many IAMs are generated from a remarkable paucity of data and are thus of low reliability.”\nIt seems there is a lack of valid evidence to support the contention that global warming would be harmful. On the other hand, several lines of evidence seem to suggest that, overall, global warming would be net-beneficial not detrimental for life on earth, human well-being and the global economy.\n1. According to Scotese (2016), the planet is currently in about the severest coldhouse phase since complex life began, around 600 Ma ago (see Figure 15): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275277369_Some_Thoughts_on_Global_Climate_Change_The_Transition_for_Icehouse_to_Hothouse_Conditions .\n2. According to Scotese (2016), the average global temperature was around 7°C warmer than now for the past half billion years.\n3. Life thrived when the planet was warmer, but struggled when colder.\n4. About 10 times more carbon is tied up in the biosphere now than at the last glacial maximum (IPCC AR4 WG1 Chapter 6).\n5. Arguably, the optimum for life on Earth is around the average global temperature over the period complex life has existed.\n6. Global warming of 3°C would not get the planet even half way up to the average temperature that existed during the period complex life began – arguably the optimum for life on Earth.\n7. Tol, 2013, Figure 3 (bottom panel), projects the economic impacts of global warming would be beneficial up to around 4°C warmer than 1900, if the projected negative impacts of energy consumption are excluded\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-012-0613-3#page-1\nOr (Free access to working paper version): http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/climate_change.pdf.\n8. However, empirical evidence does not appear to be consistent with the projected negative impact of global warming on energy consumption. Empirical evidence seems to indicate global warming would decrease not increase expenditure on energy; this means the economic impact would be positive not negative for the global economy.\n9. In which case, contrary to the commonly held belief that global warming of 2°C or more would be harmful and must be avoided at all costs, the economic impacts of global warming would be beneficial, not harmful, up to around 4°C (relative to 1900).\nhttps://html1-f.scribdassets.com/235ko6pvuo4jol5p/images/25-164cf099f7.jpg\nSource: Scotese (2016): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275277369_Some_Thoughts_on_Global_Climate_Change_The_Transition_for_Icehouse_to_Hothouse_Conditions\nPeter Lang,\nyour main reference seems to be an unfinished, single – author paper on Researchgate not subject to peer review.

From the abstract:\nThe enboldened sentence is the clue as to why your oft-repeated argument on the relevance of temperature ranges over 600M years is entirely clueless.\nVTG,\nScotese is a professor of Geology and has been responsible for the PaleoMap Project since the 1970s. It was supported by NASA, USGS and the many of the main Geologic representative organisations and universities. He is a world authority on plate tectonics paleo history and paleo climate over the Phanerozoic Eon. In 2014 Gavin Schmidt had a post on RealClimate stating that it was a serious deficiency that the climate research community could not provide a good chart showing that average global temperature profile for the Phanerozoic Eon. Scotese responded with an updated version of his famous schematic. The 2016 Working paper I linked to contains that updated chart and a full explanation of how it was produced. This post is to be part of a book he is writing.\nScotese accepts the consensus view that global warming will occur as projected by IPCC. The projection is shown in the chart. However, this is not data; it is speculation.\nThe validity of the comparison you highlighted in bold has been discussed many times before on Climate Etc. and elsewhere. If you’d followed those discussion you’d understand it is not valid to compare rates of change over 20,000 years with rates of change over decades and centuries.\nTo your question, “what is needed to justify climate policies” — as with any policy, a demonstration that benefits exceed costs. As to the form of policy, I prefer a temperature-indexed carbon tax for reasons given here: http://www.rossmckitrick.com/temperature-indexed-tax.html.\nRegarding the cost-benefit question, what must be considered is not just whether warming is taking place, but what the tax system looks like, how the policy is structured, whether it is used in isolation or in the presence of other regulations, etc. See\nhttp://www.uoguelph.ca/economics/repec/workingpapers/2017/2017-05.pdf\nRoss McKitrick,\nThank you for your reply. I have read many of your papers since your 2007 book “Taken by Storm”, which you co-authored with Christopher Essex, and which I have on my bookshelf. I read your paper on evidence based approach to CO2 pricing when it was published and your GWPF presentation. My concern is that most of the proposed policy solutions are based on a premise that global warming would be net-damaging – i.e., that the costs of global warming would exceed the benefits.\nThis seems to leave out the most important step, which is investigating the cost-benefit question itself – whether warming would be net-detrimental or net-beneficial after taking into account adaptation, which would inevitably occur. If global warming would be net-beneficial, mitigation policies other than ‘no regrets’ policies are not justified. I suggest the key questions that need to be addressed are:\n1. Is global warming taking place, how much is projected over the 21st Century, probabilities, uncertainties, etc.?\n2. Is warming net-detrimental or beneficial?\n3. Quantify the costs and benefits per degree of GMST change, and the uncertainties, etc.\n4. Only after that is established should we be evaluating, advocating and implementing mitigation policies.\nA great deal of work has been done on #1 but large uncertainties remain, as this post and many other researchers have been pointing out for at least a decade. However much less work has been done to answer questions #2 and #3 and the uncertainties are huge, as stated in IPCC AR5 WG3 Chapter 3.\nI realise you know much more about this than I do. However, having been following the climate policy debates for 26 years since I was an energy policy adviser (during and after the period Australia was preparing its position for the 1992 Rio ‘Earth Summit’), I remain concerned that the assumption that global warming would be detrimental to life on Earth, economic growth and human wellbeing is not justified. The world is spending an enormous amount of money and effort on climate policies. I suspect this is retarding economic growth and improvements in human wellbeing globally for no benefit.\nIndeed. And equally you’d understand that comparing average temperatures over 600 million years with changes over a century or two is clueless.\nThat’s seven orders of magnitude difference; about the same as the difference between the size of the earth and the size of Peter Lang.\nYou do have a point (though the opposite one you’re trying to make) with economic models but your obsession with trying to compare impacts of a geologically instantaneous temperature rise with eonal mean temperatures is frankly idiotic.\nVTG,\nThank you for your personal opinion. Do you have valid evidence demonstrating that the overall impact of global warming up to say 3C relative to 1900 over a century would be negative for life on Earth, for the global economy and for human well-being. I am not interested in statements of your beliefs and innuendo, just the evidence, please.\nAnd do you have evidence to refute the damage functions for agriculture and health used in FUND?\nAnd, can you show that the impacts of global warming since the Little Ice Age have been negative for humanity and life?\nPeter,\nthank you also for your personal opinions, which are extremely insightful!\nIf you can forgive me, I will note but not respond to your *new* questions, preferring to attempt a resolution to your *existing*, extremely novel and rather problematic thesis, that being the relevance of the average temperature for the past “half a billion years” to current changes. Perhaps then we could then move on to other doubtless weighty and fascinating topics you raise?\nNow, you propose that\nand base that proposition on\n5. Arguably, the optimum for life on Earth is around the average global temperature over the period complex life has existed.\n6. Global warming of 3°C would not get the planet even half way up to the average temperature that existed during the period complex life began – arguably the optimum for life on Earth.\nNow, I’m sure this is not merely you “personal opinion”, so please, can you provide evidence of the relevance of this to the assessment of the impact of current and projected climatic change on the timescale of a short number of centuries?\nI expect, given your insistence on others providing PDFs for damages that you have this, so it should be trivial for you to provide, but *any* reputable peer reviewed research on the irrelevance of the seven orders of magnitude difference in rate that you dismiss would be welcome.\nThank you!\nApples with Apples\nPlot this modern temperature with the warming during all the other warming periods in the past ten thousand years.\nThis modern warming is will below the upper bounds of many other warming periods.\nIt is a natural cycle and the causes have not changed in ten thousand or even millions of years. one molecule of manmade CO2 has not changed the temperature of ten thousand other molecules enough to measure.\nGet Real!\nHerman Alexander Pope,\nI agree. Life has flourished during rapid warm periods (other than when GMST is near the high end of the temperature range, which is about 13C above present). Coxon and McCarron (2009) http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/1983/ , Figure 15:21, shows rapid warming from near ice age to near current temperatures occurred in 9 years and 7 years 14,500 and 11,500 years ago in Ireland, Iceland and Greenland. The text explains how life flourished during these rapid warming periods. While this climate change is regional, not global, the point is that life impacted by local climate change not global, and life flourished during these rapid warmings, as it has since the Little Ice Age.\nThere does not seem to be valid evidence to show that global warming this century will be harmful rather than beneficial.\nTol (2013), using FUND3.6n, projected that global warming would be beneficial for agriculture and health up to about 4C warming relative to 1900. Most other impact sectors other than energy (which as I mentioned in my earlier comments appears to be incorrect) are projected be little impacted – including sea level rise, fresh water, storms, extreme weather.\nThe warmist problem is that climate scientists have made a basic mistake no competent engineer would make. Dissenters were kicked out of Academia and publications of dissenting papers banned. They then grabbed grants and promotions by pushing this fake science, the precursor of of fake news.\nAnd as for the mistake; it’s to fail to understand that Max Planck’s 1913 treatise is based on an assumption of equilibrium between radiative emitters in a vacuum. The atmosphere is not a vacuum. This explains the details of OLR and means extra extinction coefficient for rain/convective clouds. NASA claims that is due to lots of small droplets when it’s large drops that create dark undersides, high albedo.\nIt creates 40% more radiative transfer in the atmosphere than reality. They then do a work-around using a big mistake in cloud physics – van der Hulst in1967, Hansen 1969. Thus they pretend rain and convective clouds are dark underneath – high albedo – is because droplets are small when it’s a large droplet phenomenon; ultimate scientific incompetence that was used as the basis for the NASA/IPCC fraud\nSorry folks but allegedly even Stephen Hawkins is involved in the scam and has been protected by colleagues for 25 years. Planck’s vacuum assumption is fine but prohibits the use of his theory for much of radiative energy transfer at the junction between a solid surface and a ghg-containing gas.\nMyles Allen is escaping by blowing the whistle to survive the denouement of the incompetents.\nFour multi-decadal climate shifts were identified in the last century coinciding with changes in the surface temperature trajectory. Warming from 1909 to the mid 1940’s, cooling to the late 1970’s, warming to 1998 and at least less warming since.\nThe surface temperature record is replete with poor data, inadequate coverage and artifacts related to soil moisture. e.g. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GL048442/full\nBut let’s assume that it roughly gets the trajectories right. The warmer and cooler regimes are evident and associated with warmer and cooler sea surface temperatures in the tropical and sub-tropical eastern Pacific. There is more, thicker and lower clouds with cold SST and vice versa. It is a natural feedback to regime change in the Pacific.\nThe moisture artifact is more significant this century as seen in the land/ocean temperature divergence. Based on very simple physics of surface heat flux as in the study linked above. It is implicated in the recent spike in surface temperature. Regardless of the denial around satellite records – the less pronounced spike in the satellite records is a smoking gun for obvious and simple physics of reduced latent heat flux – in drought conditions – and higher surface temperatures.\nThe changes in surface temperature trajectory are the result of Hurst effects, regime change, quasi standing waves – however you want to describe this – in the spatio/temporal chaos of Earth’s turbulent flow fields. The difference in temps between the end of the warm regime in the mid 1940’s and the end of the late century warming was about 0.4 deg C. Seemingly negligible in the scheme of things. It is the maximum that can be attributed to greenhouse gases – but unless you take into account ‘first the natural variability of climate’ then you are inevitably talking out of your ass. Starting your count in a cold regime in 1950 seems especially absurd.\nThe latest climate regime that started at the turn of the century has not finished yet – perhaps. It seems very likely to shift again within a decade – and imagining that this can be modeled realistically is tragically laughable. No one knows where it will go to or by how much. These are not cycles – they are shifts in the multi-dimensional state space of the climate system. This notion puts paid to the simple memes of both sides of the climate war. The fundamentals are well understood and the future paradoxically even less obvious.\nDon’t you think the shift to a cooler climate regime is more is likely ?\nI sure do.\nIn the last 7 days, the PDO, now on the way back up, ate the lunch of the looming La Niña:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8NggaTw.png\nAnd the first 10 days of October are looking hot:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NjVzHGH.png\nAll signs are we remain in a spring-back warming event.\nWow, 7 days and 10 days. Glad to see you are focusing on climate.\nThank you. Climate can change a dime; you wouldn’t want to miss it.\nI sure don’t know. If we perturb flow in the system – this will change many or few quasi-standing waves. It depends. Greenhouse gases are a wild card in a probabilistic deck.\n“… this will change many or few quasi-standing waves. It depends.” Tomas\nRobert: “I sure don’t know.”\nI remember watching a television documentary about the search for the Higgs boson made a year or so before its existence was confirmed. The documentary attempted to explain how the investigation was being conducted, what would constitute a positive result, what was at stake, etc.\nThe documentary-maker conducted an informal poll of the experimental and theoretical physicists at CERN on whether they hoped the experiments being conducted there would confirm theory, and therefore buttress the ‘standard model’, or produce a negative result and throw their field into disarray. Like good physicists each answered that they cared not a fig one way or the other – they just wanted to know the answer whatever it may be. Like a good documentary-maker, he pressed each respondent on which outcome they would find more aesthetically pleasing. On this question opinion was divided 50/50. Half of the physicists thought that a negative result would be more pleasing because it would shake the elaborately constructed foundations on which their current understanding was based and leave them clueless about how they might begin to construct another.\nAll scientists are interested in answers, but good scientists find questions equally, if not more compelling. Put another way, they are far more anxious to discover the precise boundaries of their knowledge than to have their assumptions confirmed. They do not presume that nature will give up her secrets easily, and will have conveniently organised herself to gratify their petty concerns, especially their vanity.\nWhen half of climatologists regard the prospect of proving themselves fundamentally wrong as a fabulous and deeply gratifying outcome, the practice of climatology will be worthy of being considered ‘scientific’. As far as I can see it is moving further from, rather than closer to, that destination.\nThe Higgs boson story tells us that scientists don’t ignore a 5-sigma signal especially when a theory predicts it, and there are few deniers left when the signal reaches that size. Likewise with temperature, the signal is already at an equivalent to 5-sigma for the centennial scale temperature rise, and the 100-year-old theory would have predicted that. In both cases the exact size of the signal was not predicted, but a confirmatory signal was there. E.g.\nhttps://www.livescience.com/44950-global-warming-natural-fluctuation.html\nThe ‘trend’ over the last two 20-30 year – warmer and cooler – climate regimes. Not so much warming in the scheme of things.\nhttps://watertechbyrie.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/berkley-trend.png\nIs it all anthropogenic? What will the next regime bring? Where is Mr. T?\nThe 30-year temperature smooths out the non-climate noise.\nhttp://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:240/mean:120/plot/gistemp/from:1986/trend\nSeems obvious which way things are going and why. Still too early to tell according to some who haven’t figured out why it is warming so much having ruled out the dominant rapidly rising GHG forcing for some reason known only to themselves.\nWith Jimmy it is all ‘non-climate noise’.\nAnything that doesn’t show up in the 30-year temperature is not climate. Don’t let that stuff distract you. It self cancels within 30 years – noise.\nRobert I Ellison: I sure don’t know. If we perturb flow in the system – this will change many or few quasi-standing waves. It depends. Greenhouse gases are a wild card in a probabilistic deck.\nI welcome this rare expression of humility. It has been pointed out many times that your many citations of dynamical systems theory do not address the issues of the effects of accumulating CO2, or the effects of a warming Earth surface, or the effects of changing hydrological cycle.\nThere is internal variability on multi-decadal scales influencing surface temps and hydrology – and no it doesn’t cancel out.\nAnd, here comes the haughty humility:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6HY0Bg3.png\nIt is inevitably from these people commentary that is technically far too silly to bother with – and they perversely always make a point of what? That I consider their pompous and pedantic little points not worth bothering with? Matthew’s pretentious and muddled noise with a vaguely sciencey tone – but without much in the way of a knowledge base. Jimmy’s perpetual recourse to stock standard memes and narratives around how dumb skeptics are. JCH’s feral science in which he claims to foretell the future by examining climate augury’s. Hard done by all of them by me thinking that they are all a bit obtuse? Sorry – but I haven’t found any of these to be conspicuously polite – so it seems a little ingenuous to complain yet again about me not taking them at their own estimation. Not much I can do about that. Nor do I follow any of them around dropping quite pointless comments of a personal nature – I ignore them all as a rule.\nRIE, the linearity of the trend for the last few decades is not natural. Look again.\nhttp://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:240/mean:120/plot/gistemp/from:1986/trend\nthat is technically far too silly to bother with\nAnd yet, you always do. You’re a spoon bender.\nRobert I Ellison: Hard done by all of them by me thinking that they are all a bit obtuse?

Greenhouse gases are a wild card in a probabilistic deck.\nYou do not know what will happen if we perturb flow in the system. Full stop.\nThe next climate shift is due within a decade – whether that’s enough time for Matthew to get a clue is unknown.\nKeep right on ignoring that the PDO flipped positive in 2014. And, for the first time in the record, has remained positive for 44 straight months in a row: soon to be 45 straight months.\nThe PDO is swallowing La Niña events before they can earn to walk:\nhttp://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2017/anomnight.9.21.2017.gif\nhttp://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2017/anomnight.10.5.2017.gif\nThe current positive phase of the PDO could last a few years or a few decades.\n“Intensified circulation in subtropical gyre systems enhances upwelling and productivity in the California and Peru systems. Strengthened easterly trade winds increase equatorial current circulation in the Pacific.” http://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/3/4/833/htm\nIt is hypothesised that upwelling in the Pacific Ocean is modulated by solar activity over periods of decades to millennia – with profound impacts on communities and ecosystems globally. The great resonant systems of the Pacific respond at variable periods – the tempo increased last century for instance – of La Niña and El Niño alternation. There are variations in this tempo at 20 to 30 years that – throwing this out there – suggest a trigger in the 22 year Hale solar cycle of magnetic reversals. The solar butterfly flutters and the cyclone ensues. Longer term indicators of solar activity show changes over millennia that mirror the state of upwelling in the Pacific. The mechanism proposed is a spinning up of the Pacific trade winds and surface gyres as a result of colder and denser polar air. Low solar activity spins up the gyres producing more frequent La Niña and a cooler northeastern Pacific (more upwelling) – and vice versa. With a cooling Sun – it suggests that the next climate shift – due in a 2018-2028 window – will be to yet cooler conditions in the Pacific Ocean. This has implications for global heat content, hydrology and biology.\nIf JHC did anything but eyeball sea surface temps – and make silly little rhetorical flourishes about lunches – if there were any knowledge of the physical linkages – it might be different. As things stand it is all just utter nonsense he pulls out of his ass.\nRobert I Ellison: The next climate shift is due within a decade – whether that’s enough time for Matthew to get a clue is unknown.\nI sure don’t know.

They claimed we were to build the EU wide Virtual power station – solely renewables. I told them it would never work above 20%. The rest should be nuclear to be CO2 free.\nThis Green dream is a Marxist ego trip by technologically-ignorant bullies backed up by corrupt climate scientists pushing false science based on two fundamental mistakes. Only now the experiment has been done have they realised their big mistake. The likes of Tesla’s batteries as a way of keeping Grid oscillation in short bursts are simply a way of Tesla corporate survival now electric cars have been proved to be uncommercial without owners bludging subsidies. Their use in SA is Musk using Obama’s subsidies to bail out SA temporarily, whilst SA deindustrialises to the level that the average voter realises their technologically ignorant MPs have forced their power system to revert to diesel – low efficiency, high pollution.CA is embarking on the same experiment but have more Hydro.\nOK, like SA, they are now desperately installing high efficiency CCGTs but fail to realise they must be operated at > 60% maximum output, otherwise you lose the steam cycle. So, over 15 years they will have converted a cheap coal base load system to an expensive gas base load system even less able to cope with the wind and PV supply fluctuations.\nIn the UK we face the same level of dogma in Theresa May and the people who run power in her government. With a bit of luck she’ll soon be gone to be replaced by a non-Marxist pragmatist, willing to take the heat by confronting the technologically ignorant, including the National Grid Company. Our Grid is now on the verge of becoming SA-II. Huge diesel packs in government buildings and old quarries do the power humping whilst the Marxist politicians boast about the windmills, essentially a modern version of Easter Island statue virtue signalling.\nCentral Europe is using Czech and French nuclear baseload. Our nukes are nearly gone. The social effects are now being felt as Brexit progresses. However, that will allow us to operate independently of EU Marxists to keep unemployment <10%.\nGreetings comrade Davidson,\nThanks for reminding us of the magic of the Free Market and nuclear power. Back in August there was a post on CE about renewable energy in Texas and I made the observation that Georgia electricity customers were being soaked for the huge cost overruns on the new Vogtle nuclear power plant.

An excellent article by Paul Kelly in the Weekend Australian is here: http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/paul-kelly/conservative-failures-open-door-to-return-of-socialism/news-story/811914e125decfa1227cc44c720257a6 . I’ll try to post it, but it may be too long and get caught by the SPAM filter.\nConservative failures open door to return of socialism\n“Within the Anglosphere, the ideological lines are being drawn sharply and Britain leads the way. Speeches from Tory leader Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have raised the existential question: Are we returning to socialism?\nThe euphoria of British Labour, facilitated by Conservative Party traumas, has been on display. A slicker Corbyn told a rousing party conference his agenda is that of a “modern progressive socialist party that has rediscovered its roots and its purpose”.\nThe politics of the left has been in turmoil in the Anglosphere. Virtually all parties have moved to more radical positions tempered by different degrees of pragmatism: the ALP is among the most pragmatic and British Labour the most extreme.\nMocking the May government, Corbyn says Labour is now “winning the arguments” about a new direction for Britain with its agenda of expanded public services, higher taxes on the rich and corporates, renationalisation of railways, energy companies and water, rejection of welfare cuts, abolition of tuition fees and a transformation of power in British society away from elites and back to the people, reminiscent of Donald Trump on the hustings.\nThe Economist magazine says “the unthinkable image of a left-wing firebrand in 10 Downing Street is increasingly plausible”. It reports the bookies have Corbyn favourite to be the next prime minister, probably an exaggerated call. Incredibly, The Economist even offers a semi-apologia for Labour, saying there is a “good Corbyn” as well as a “bad Corbyn”. Yet it concludes with harsh realism that PM Corbyn would do “serious and lasting harm” to Britain.\nThe cultural phenomenon in the Anglosphere is the resurrection of socialist ideas seeded by the decade-old global financial crisis and the monumental ineptitude of ruling elites, unmatched since the 1930s. Corbyn says the centre ground of politics is not “where it was 20 or 30 years ago” and that “a new consensus is emerging from the great economic crash and the years of austerity”.\nHe says the conservative mantra of deregulate, privatise, cut taxes for the rich, austerity and restrictions on the public sector is unpopular and consigned to the dustbin of history. Have no doubt, Corbyn’s propaganda is powerful. Yet the real story is how conservative failure has given a bankrupt agenda new life — an insight into the deeper cultural crisis of the Anglosphere, where the Enlightenment legacy seems finished.\nIn a recent interview with Unherd.com, commentator, academic and historian Niall Ferguson warns Britain and the US are making a major historical blunder by misinterpreting the current age and the causes of their economic malaise originating in the GFC. Ferguson repudiates the entrenched dogma that the problem is a crisis of capitalism; he says it comes instead from bad public policy and government failures.\nFerguson warns of the consequences arising from a false diagnosis seen in Britain, above all, in the rise of Corbyn and in the US in the rise of Bernie Sanders with similar views.\n“The real worry is not that capitalism is in crisis,” Ferguson says. “It’s not. The real worry is that socialism is making a comeback, and that’s different. The reason it’s concerning is we thought we had killed it off about 1989 but as I discover every day students have no memory of that great battle in the 1980s that led to the defeat of the communist states and socialism as an ideology.\n“They (students) are ready to lap it up as though the 1980s never happened. If I were living in Britain now I would be worried, above all, by the rise of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader from being a kind of lunatic fringe Militant Tendency element.”\nFerguson calls Corbyn an “unreconstructed leftist who I think is tempting younger voters with implausible promises along the lines of jam today, jam tomorrow and regulate anything you don’t like”.\nHe says the lesson from history is that “the more you attempt to pursue socialist policies in pursuit of egalitarian outcomes the worse it goes for the economy and potentially for political freedom”. Yet this is the direction being taken by the left.\nThe British Labour Party has marched far down this road, intoxicated by legions of activists. The related fear is that the Democratic Party in the US might follow. The data shows this is a generational event. The proposition yet to be tested is obvious: is Australia any different?\nFerguson says “we’ve seen this movie before” — witness Britain in the 70s with high taxes, strong government intervention and powerful trade unions. He says the issue is whether there is a reversion to the failed policies of mid-20th-century socialism. Will the Anglosphere decide to forget its history?\nFerguson highlights that Trump, not Sanders, became US President. This was not a vote against capitalism — given Trump is a capitalist. It was, rather, a vote saying globalisation had “overshot” and gone too far. Trump was a critic of globalisation: of free trade, open immigration, outsourcing US jobs.\nThe US public wanted globalisation “dialled back” in its economic benefit, not the demise of capitalism or any lurch to socialism. This was completely understandable. Addressing the malaise facing the US and British economies, Ferguson says the “central problem” has been “bad government policy”, citing the West’s fiscal crisis, the decline in educational standards and problems in health systems.\nThe data shows the problems in the US public school system are “shocking” and the main problem is not funding but teacher unions. The left’s agenda of huge increases in social spending is unlikely to deliver better services.\nFor Ferguson, this evidence is clear: he predicts that if robust policy reforms are instituted by governments, the upshot will be productivity gains and stronger economic growth. What is overdue is “taking a long, hard look” at fundamental state policy failures. Good luck with that.\nIn her blunder-ridden speech to the Conservative Party conference this week, May tried to rally a dispirited party, aware of the great ideological war now at hand. She said she aspired “to root out injustice and to give everyone in this country a voice”, and then, aiming at Corbyn, declared her mission was to win the battle of ideas “in a new generation all over again”.\n“Free and open markets” she said, had raised living standards for everybody, had entrenched freedoms and had been central to Britain’s role “as a force for good in the world”.\n“So don’t try and tell me that free markets are no longer fit for purpose, that somehow they’re holding people back,” May said. “The free market and the values of freedom, equality, rights, responsibilities and the rule of law that lie at its heart remains the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created. So let us win this argument for a new generation and defend free and open markets with all our might.”\nAfter her disastrous effort at the Conservative conference, May’s leadership hangs by a thread. The issues are: when will she be replaced, and by whom? The crisis of the Conservatives suggests they are ill-equipped for any battle of ideas. This gifts Corbyn an immense opportunity, yet it is also possible Labour has reached its zenith and that British common sense will deny him the PM’s office, given the next election is a long way off.\nMay’s speech revealed the huge problems the Conservatives face in the coming battle of ideas.\nAs part of her defensive tactics, May pledges more funds to education, a better health system, urgent action to confront housing affordability (the average British home cost is eight times average earnings), price caps on energy bills and intervention to limit student debt.\nBut Corbyn merely says if these interventions are essential, then let Labour do the job properly.\nHe mocks May by demanding she “go the whole hog, end austerity, abolish tuition fees, scrap the public sector pay cap”.\nHe says the Tories won’t change. They stand for “rampant inequality, the hollowing out of our public services, disdain for the powerless”.\nThe language is reminiscent of Bill Shorten in our 2016 campaign. Corbyn says British Labour has become the “political mainstream” and that its once denounced manifesto is now “popular”. The harsh truth, however, is that Corbyn’s history suggests that he stands to the left of even the formal manifesto.\nGiven the length of time Corbyn has espoused disreputable ¬positions, there is no certainty he will be tempered by electoral pragmatism. Corbyn has long been sceptical about NATO and Britain’s membership; he attributes much of the Islamist terrorist problem to the foreign policy of successive British governments; he is a sceptic about globalisation; and as a fan of the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, he refused to condemn his hero even when the economy collapsed and there was warfare in the streets.\nThe Economist suggests ¬Corbyn “would instinctively line up against America in a geopolitical emergency and he would see a financial crisis as Act One in the collapse of capitalism”.\nYet sections of the Australian left take him seriously.\nCorbyn says his aim in Britain is not just redistribution but a transformation in the system and ¬nature of power in British society. Nationalisation of utilities and an expanded public sector are the heart of this construct.\nHis slogan is that “socialism for the 21st century” is “for the many not the few”.\nBritish conservatives have made two shocking mistakes this year. First, they overestimated public abhorrence towards a radical left agenda, along with their own ability to demonise Corbyn. Second, their astonishing and accumulated ineptitude — as shown in politics, policy and business — has created the serious option of the most decisive leftward shift for more than half a century. The dominant story of the times is conservative failure.\nMay’s central dilemma is an insight into the problems faced by most Anglosphere incumbents: Malcolm Turnbull is a relevant example. The public is hostile to the status quo: weak growth, poor wages, high energy prices, inept government service delivery and failing schools.\nBecause of chronic failures of public policy, May must also present as an agent of change. She must defend the kingdom against the socialists while seeking to re-position the kingdom with new policies. In May’s case, this is a task beyond her. It is the exact challenge facing Turnbull.\nThe arrogance of both sides is astounding. The Conservatives have simply assumed for too long the mad and radical ideas involved in the return to socialism make their oppositions unelectable. The British left, on the other hand, is infatuated with the quasi-revolutionary belief the status quo is indefensible and that they represent, as they always have, the “right side of history”.\nThe Corbynites have made a mistake Shorten would never entertain: the delusion of the revolutionary mindset. It is likely to be their downfall.\nYet there is one message the ALP is probably ¬absorbing, that British Labour may be more defined as the party of youth than the party of the working class.\nIf true, it is an unprecedented event with both pluses and negatives. It injects Labour with great energy, another aspect of the Sanders phenomenon in the US. British party activists carry a sometimes embarrassed Corbyn as their hero, a process likely to be as fickle as it is fashionable.\nThere is nothing inevitable about the victory of the more radical left. May won the 2017 poll against Corbyn. New Zealand PM Bill English far outpolled Labour in the recent election and should — we cannot be certain — form a new government. Trump, not Sanders, became US President. Turnbull, not Shorten, won the 2016 election in Australia.\nIn each case, the opponents on the left, representing various degrees of radicalism, were defeated. Yet their momentum was unmistakable. The issues for the future are how strong this tide runs and whether the optimal strategy for the radicals lies in pragmatic adaptation or tougher quasi-socialism.\nInvoking a mood of ideological anger, May denounced Corbyn as a politician who wants to pile taxes on business when business investment is essential; borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to nationalise industry; strip Britain of its nuclear deterrent; and play with progressive culture’s descent into anti-Semitism and intolerant hatreds.\nSuch rhetoric was once a winning position. But it will no longer suffice. The vault of conservative scare campaigns — justified or not — is increasingly ineffective. Young people are unconcerned and unpersuaded.\nThey live in the present, not the politics of the past.\nMeanwhile, the dilemma for conservative incumbents arises in their repeated failures to manage the economy and spread the benefits, the traditional hallmark of conservative success.\nThey live in the extended shadow of the GFC, the growth showdown of the past decade, the excesses of the rich 1 per cent and their own inability to devise policies to revive their economies.\nIt is tempting to think much of the current battle of ideas is fraudulent. This is not like the 20th century, when socialists and communists offered an alternative model to democratic capitalism and a number of nations originating with the Soviet Union embraced this alternative.\nOn display today is something very different: the failure of conservative management, the ¬romantic and self-interested impulse of radical politics unable to reinvent itself and the delusions of large sections of Western populations, angry, frustrated, looking for a better way and susceptible to the greatest hoax of the previous century.”\nMy latest –> The “Climate Science Special Report” demands a “red team”\nhttp://www.cfact.org/2017/10/03/the-climate-science-special-report-demands-a-red-team/\nHere is the beginning (important links not included): “Several months ago there was a brief furor when the New York Times leaked the final draft of the upcoming Climate Science Special Report (CSSR), which is extremely alarmist. The CSSR is being prepared by the federal Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and has been in the works for several years, mostly under Obama and still staffed by die-hard alarmists.\nThe USGCRP consists of the 13 federal agencies that do climate science and it was speculated that one of these, especially the EPA under Pruitt, might block the CSSR. This has not happened and the Report is now scheduled for release next month. The CSSR is far more alarmist than any IPCC report, as most USGCRP reports have been, thanks in particular to NOAA. It will be an official Federal report. Even worse, the Report is slated to be Volume I of the National Climate Assessment (NCA), which is due out late next year. The NCA is mandated by law, which gives the CSSR even more status as federal policy.\nIt would be ironic indeed if the skeptical Trump Administration were to simply issue this alarmist report as federal policy on climate change science. In fact it would be tragic, a major defeat for climate realism and sound science. But there is a simple way to turn this looming defeat into a major victory. The solution is to do an official Red Team critique of the CSSR.” (end of quote)\nThere is more to the article of course.\nDavid\nHere is my crowd funded project to teach the debate, not alarmism:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/climate-change-debate-education\nJ’accuse\nCess 1976 made a fundamental Physics’ mistake – to claim OLR/theoretical ground IR emission was Earth’s radiative emissivity. This was puerile and claimed falsely increased ground IR emission absorbed by the atmosphere by 40%.\nAlso in 1976, NASA claimed this was offset by an opposite flow negative convection, which is impossible. Hansen later admited this was a ‘fudge’. So GISS has admitted the 1976 fraud.\nTo hide the fraud, which was obvious to any professional, the Met. Office devised a fake Kirchhoff’s claim based on faulty cloud physics, that also creates false positive feedback. The person responsible for this frauds was Reading Universities’ late husband of Julia Slingo. There is a hitherto undiscovered increase of extinction coefficient in rain clouds missed by Hansen in 1969. This gives fake positive feedback when in reality low level cloud removal of latent heat from the surface plus peculiar properties of 16 – 23 micron water vapour nearly exactly offset GHG warming.\nSo, we have a story of deliberate fraud in climate modelling since 1976. It is proven. Reality is now entry to a new LIA as tsi falls.\nAnd there’s the effect of albedo rise caused by tinfoil hats..\nOn Climate Etc particularly one should *never* underestimate the numbers of tinfoil hats being worn.\nDown those temperatures will plummet.\nCan you imagine any ‘science professional’ claiming Earth’s radiant emissivity is 18 deg C OLR and 15 deg surface IR emission?\nPhysics 101 requires equal temperatures; to claim otherwise is to betray at the very least substantial scientific ignorance.\nThis outrageous error needs to be corrected, reducing atmospheric IR absorption by 40%. The GISS modelling fraud in 1978, invoking fallacious negative convection, later covered up by Julia Slingo’s late husband to give fake positive gain, is another shameful fraud. It may apparently work but it’s still wrong, hence the models ‘run hot’.\nAll in all I am ashamed that so many people accept false science – the end justifying the Marxist means.\nNo, the radiated emission is observably -18 C and the surface is observably +15 C. This is the measured value of the greenhouse effect. It works like insulation and there is no mystery about these observations.\nSorry: the quotient of OLR and surface Planckian emission assuming it is the Planckian vacuum level – wrong.\nThe GISS 2D model using fictional negative convection to offset the imaginary 40% extra IR heating of the atmosphere was in 1976. 25 years’ later Hansen admitted ‘this was a fudge’. It partially cleared his conscience but the bandwagon could not admit climate models were a Goebbels-like propaganda ploy with lefty politicians strutting around, claiming only peer-eviewed science approved by scientific ignorami.\nI feel ashamed that ignorant people are forcing energy poverty onto our populations to assuage their Marxist beliefs.\nThose are observations. Your problem must therefore be with the instruments rather than the science, but you have not said that.\n@JimD\nTell me any physcis’ text outside of fake climate science that claims radiant emissivity calculation can be done with different temperatures – it needs rel IR emitter/black body at the same temperature.\nTo inform you further, the real science involves the real IR self absorption data, but I suspect that you may be ignorant of this: it’s tough science.\nWell, “self absorption” seems about right.\nKeep going Alexander, you fit right in, though it’s a bit OTT, you’re in danger of sounding like satire.\nDoes your house radiate with an external temperature the same as its internal temperature when the inside is warmer? No, its external radiation is less. There is a temperature gradient sustained by insulation. If you know how insulation works, you see how the physics works for the atmosphere because GHGs insulate the surface. Plus, you are still saying that the actual observations are impossible for you to understand.\nAlexander Davidson: Cess 1976 made a fundamental Physics’ mistake – to claim OLR/theoretical ground IR emission was Earth’s radiative emissivity. This was puerile and claimed falsely increased ground IR emission absorbed by the atmosphere by 40%.\nAlso in 1976, NASA claimed this was offset by an opposite flow negative convection, which is impossible. Hansen later admited this was a ‘fudge’. So GISS has admitted the 1976 fraud.\nLinks or exact citations of sources would be helpful.\nI wanted to post this again, and add the solar parameters I think are needed. These parameters are not in full force, but close and coming I believe.

The word you’re looking for is models, not modulz, which uncapitalized seems to be a stand-in variable in a computer program pronounced like its parent, modules.\nW. said, a model is a realization of a theory as in to model Gettier cases. A Tinkertoy representation of a molecule is a model in science. A computer program that simulates something external to the computer is sometimes a model in science. A scientific proposition that objectively accounts for something in the real world is again a model, this time a scientific model in its full form.\nScience creates models of the Real World. It’s propositions define experiments, mapping existing facts onto future facts, where facts are observations reduced to measurements and compared to standards. Gettier cases are from philosophy, in particular epistemology, dealing with truth values in knowledge. And truth is a methaphysical notion, not epistemological. Scientific propositions are on the reals, they are real valued, not truth valued. When a metaphysical proposition happens have scientific validity, that is a Gettier case. It’s a matter of luck, not knowledge. See Ichikawa, J.J., The Analysis of Knowledge, SEP, 3/7/2017\nFor a fair discussion of what science is, you might want to read Jennings, B.K., On the Nature of Science, La Physique au Canada, V. 63, No. 1, February 2007. He has a good grip on scientific models, along with their forms as conjectures, hypotheses, theories, and laws.\nW. worried that the distinction between hypothesis and a conjecture makes little sense to a Popperian.\nWhat Willard and Jennings didn’t know was, in philosophical terms, that Popper is irrational. Stove, D.C., Popper and After : Four Modern Irrationalists, December 1982. Stove set up two delightful but erudite criteria for what it means to be irrational, and provided ample examples from the scribblings of Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend in support. Popper was a metaphysician.\nHere is an even more fundamental indication of irrational behavior: Popper didn’t hold with definitions. Now he wasn’t above using definitions here and there when it suited his theses, but that just adds inconsistency into the dense mix of his irrational quirks.\nPopper didn’t understand induction, yet wrote volumes about the Problem of Induction. Popper criticized Bacon for advocating Aristotle’s infinite regression induction, but never understood that Bacon specifically replaced that form of induction with what he called real induction, i.e., deduction, a word that was just coming into use in the 17th Century.\nPopper thought all scientific propositions were either Universal Generalizations, or equivalent to one. “All Ravens Are Black” was his model of a scientific propositionl that helped launch his fame. No scientist worthy of the title would propose such a scientific proposition. Popper knew that a UG cannot be empirically affirmed but can be disproved by a single counterexample. So he created falsification as a necessary equivalent statement, one that conceivably could be empirically tested, for every scientific proposition. Moreover, Popper was implying that scientific propositions are truth valued. They never are.\nFalsification solved Popper’s imagined empirical problem, but he went further to claim that it solved his demarcation problem to separate science from nonscience. His need for demarcation problem existed because he lacked the knowledge and discipline to define science at the outset. Then for icing on the cake, Popper simply assumed that propositions from a nonscience field could never be UGs.\nSo Popper was forced to conclude that only false scientific propositions could be validated empirically, but never true ones. Falsification cannot be a method for validating a true model! So Popper removed empirical testing from his model of science, replacing it with intersubjective testing, consisting of the triad of peer review, publication, and consensus, (all within a certified community, of course). Perfect!\nPerfect for Publish-or-Perish academia. It was like pushing a car downhill. Scientific propositions no longer actually had to work. Deconstruction was complete, and Post Modern Science was born. Popper would confess, “I am not a scientist”, but he wasn’t above deconstructing Modern Science into Post Modern Science, which has captivated and captured most of academic science. AGW is one of the consequences, doomed to vanish like facilitated communications mired in molasses.\nPopper was a rank crackpot and a crank. Pity his followers.\nDear readers, it’s about time I nail the failure of R D Cess, backed up by fallacious GISS 2d modelling by GISS in the same year, 1976, to use the right definition of emissivity, aka emittance.\nWhat is the definition of surface emissivity?\nA Combustion File downloaded from the IFRF Online Combustion Handbook ISSN 1607-9116/b>\n“The emissivity of a surface may be defined as the ratio of the radiance from the surface to that from a black body viewed under identical optical and geometrical conditions and at the same temperature.”\nI’m a metallurgical engineer who has designed radiant heating furnaces. Cess’ claim that Earth’s emissivity is OLR (-18 eg C) divided by Planckian surface emissivity (15 deg C), giving rise to 40% extra atmospheric IR thermalisation and 33 K GHE is as wrong as can be imagined.\nThus the climate models are wrong from the ground up, and must be withdrawn from the literature. This is an attempt for objective science to reject the ignorant and the fraudsters who have made a corrupt living from pretending the climate models are accurate. I do hope that climateetc now realises it has simple proof of how climate science has beeen corrupted for 40 years. There are two more major errors, including a hitherto aspect of the extinction coefficient of rain clouds missed by Hansen in 1969 and van der Hulst in 1967. I’m working on the real physics.\nJim D, 10/5/2017 @ 1:49 pm asked,\nExplain how the ocean acidifies (gains carbon) while also outgassing. The carbon is clearly coming from fossil fuels. Explain where the fossil fuel carbon is going if not to the ocean and atmosphere. You have clearly not thought it through from a carbon budget perspective, and Salby never provided a budget either.\nIPCC defines acidification as a consequence of the equations of Marine Carbon Chemistry, which it attributes to Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow (2001). It also relies on this statement: Equilibration of surface ocean and atmosphere occurs on a time scale of roughly one year. AR4 §7.3.4, pp. 528-9.\nZeebe & Wolf-Gladrow (2001) derives the marine carbonate equations under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium with gaseous carbon dioxide [sic, bold added], and where the concentration of dissolved CO2 is given by Henry’s law … with … the solubility coefficient of CO2 in seawater. P. 2.\nA detailed understanding of the carbon dioxide system in seawater is a prerequisite for the investigation of a variety of phenomena in the marine environment. … the storage capacity of the ocean for … CO2 … chemistry in the global carbon cycle is the CO2 exchange between ocean and atmosphere. … ocean chemistry between glacial and interglacial periods. ¶ While a description by equilibrium properties is reasonable for most of the mentioned phenomena an analogous treatment of processes on small time and length scales is inadequate. Bold added, Zeebe, R.E., D.A. Wolf-Gladrow, & H. Jansen, On the time required to establish chemical and isotopic equilibrium in the carbon dioxide system in seawater, Marine Chem. V.65, 1999, 135-153, pp. 1336-7.\nOceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 leads to a decrease in seawater pH and thus lowers the saturation state for carbonate minerals such as calcite and aragonite (CaCO3). This process, termed ocean acidification, … . … carbon emissions must be reduced to avoid these consequences. Bold added, Zeebe, R.E, et al., Carbon Emissions and Acidification, Science, V. 321, 7/4/2008, p. 51.\nFirst, a definitional problem: these authorities define acidification as a change of pH caused by added CO2. That is is not observable and hence not measurable and not factual. In the science of AGW hysteria, acidification is measured by scattered reports of increased oceanic pH. The idea that pH change has any relation to CO2 uptake is a bald assumption. The model that ocean pH depends on CO2 uptake is a conjecture. Conflating pH with ph due to CO2 is like confusing CO2 following a temperature change with CO2 a cause of temperature change. These are a matched pair of bone-headed errors for anyone working in science.\nSecond, treating natural and anthropogenic CO2 differently, per Zeebe, is unsupported. The only difference climatologists claim between the two species of CO2, other than their origin, is in the mix of the three isotopic forms of CO2, hence a different isotopic weight. This is far from the state of the art in specifying Henry’s coefficient for CO2 in any kind of water.\nThird, no part of Earth’s climate system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, much less the surface layer of the ocean. And surely that is where investigators make most of their pH measurements, because that is the only part of the ocean where the scare tactic is operational. Thermodynamic equilibrium is a specific state between a thermodynamic system and its environment. Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow reference to thermodynamic equilibrium with gaseous CO2 requires some quite friendly parsing to have any meaning. Nonetheless, thermodynamic equilibrium is the state of simultaneous mechanical, chemical, and thermal equilibrium. Not one of these conditions is even close to holding for the surface layer of the ocean, presuming a colloquial distance in disequilibrium.\nNeither a valid à posteriori (empirical) nor a valid à priori (theoretical) reason exists to believe that dissolution of CO2 causes a lowering of ocean pH. Nothing is left to explain.\nAs for Salby, my response 10/5 @ 1:43 pm and Jim D’s question just after at 1:49 pm seem to have crossed in the ether.\nAs to the fate of CO2 emissions, they just get mixed with the CO2 in the several reservoirs and in flux. And it’s not the carbon coming from fossil fuels that counts; it’s the entire flow from over 90 (to the ocean) to 485 GtC/yr (including leaf water and all reservoirs). Atmospheric CO2 on climate time scales follows Henry’s Law, and the coefficient of solubility depends on the temperature of the solvent, recognizing that atmospheric pressure, salinity, and isoptoic weights are negligible. The carbon budget is determined by long term global surface ocean temperature, and that’s about as thought through as anything gets in this climate business.\nYour carbon budget goes something like this. The atmosphere’s CO2 level goes up by x. We emit 2x. Those 2x are absorbed by something you can’t specify and 3x come from somewhere else you can’t specify to make the increase of x. The view in real science is that 2x is emitted, the atmosphere gains a net x while the land and ocean also gain a net x. The ocean and atmosphere have to obey Henry’s Law so both have to increase in some proportion to maintain the chemical equilibrium.\nYou also seem confused about acidification which is defined from the level of H+ ions. As CO2 is absorbed by the ocean, H+ ions do increase because CO2 plus water is carbonic acid (H2CO3). As carbonic acid increases, so does acidification. Carbonated drinks are acidic. Imagine carbonating seawater. So pH has nothing to do with how the H+ ions increased, but only measures the fact that they have increased.\n“Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 leads to a decrease in seawater pH and thus lowers the saturation state for carbonate minerals such as calcite and aragonite…”\nThere is a multi-phase chemical equilibrium process. The end state is a reduction in carbonate oversaturation – and a presumed impact on shell formation. It leads to models that forecast under-saturation of aragonite in southern oceans towards the end of the century.\nOceans retain the chemical reactions that maintain the state of carbonate oversaturation with an altered stoichiometry. In practical terms – it means that more carbonate is remobilized in the photic zone of open oceans – or from benthic deposits of carbonates in shallow waters – and neutralizing carbonic acid. There is a massive supply of carbonate available in the Earth’s oceans to neutralize carbonic acid and retain carbonate oversaturation.\nThis doesn’t mean that changing ocean chemistry is not a problem – with unknowable impacts on ocean ecology. In the end – we always come up against the unknowable. Get used to it. Just that the problem is not properly posed.\nPingback: Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #286 | Watts Up With That?\nOh, here we go again.\nMcKitrick says:\n“the majority of the reconciliation happens by using “updated forcings”, i.e. peeking at the answer post-2000”\nCalling it “peeking” is a distortion and a misleading insinuation. The “inputted forcings” is not some unfair “peeking”; it’s a justified explanation of why model projections can differ from observations (DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1, page 379; DOI: 10.1038/NGEO2973). Maybe some people don’t like that explanation because it doesn’t suit their politically-motivated narrative?\nThere are still at least four possible explanations for the differences between the models and the observations:\n1) Observational uncertainty / heterogeneities in the observational data\n2) Internal variability / chance fluctuations\n3) Error in inputted forcings\n4) Model error (ex: models over-estimate climate sensitivity)\nIf McKitrick really wants to claim that the models over-estimate warming (i.e. there’s something wrong with the models), then he needs to justify explanation 4. Simply pointing out model-data discrepancies is not enough, since discrepancies are often explained using explanations 1, 2, or 3. And he can’t dodge the other explanations by calling them “peeking”.\nTo illustrate this point, look at how explanation 1 addresses some of the model vs. observations discrepancies McKitrick discusses for satellite-based analyses:\nRSS admits that their version 4.0 TLT likely under-estimates lower tropospheric warming (DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0768.1, page 7715). And I don’t see how folks can take UAH versions 6.0 TLT seriously when:\n1) UAH TLT is about the same as for ERA-I (DOI: 10.3402/tellusa.v68.31503, figure 3), even though the ERA-I team admits that they under-estimate lower tropospheric warming (DOI: 10.1002/qj.2317; DOI: 10.1002/qj.2949).\n2) UAH’s has history of under-estimating tropospheric temperature (for example, DOI: 10.1126/science.1216273).\n3) There’s continuing criticism of UAH’s homogenization methods (for example, DOI: 10.1175/JTECH-D-16-0121.1).\nThe UAH analysis is so bad, that some researchers aren’t even bothering with it anymore (DOI: 10.1002/2017JD027158).\nSo UAH and RSS both under-estimate lower tropospheric warming, and thus explanation 1 contributes to the satellite-based discrepancies McKitrick discusses.\nMcKitrick says:\n“Finally, Tim Vogelsang and I showed a couple of years ago that the tropical LT (and MT) discrepancies are also present between models and the weather balloon series back to 1958.”\nThis is the paper in question doesn’t really help McKitrick’s case. To see why, note that there are still at least four possible explanations for the differences between the models and the observations DOI: 10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1, page 379; DOI: 10.1038/NGEO2973):\n1) Observational uncertainty / heterogeneities in the observational data\n2) Internal variability / chance fluctuations\n3) Error in inputted forcings\n4) Model error (ex: models over-estimate climate sensitivity)\nIf McKitrick wants to claim that the models over-estimate warming (i.e. there’s something wrong with the models), then he needs to justify explanation 4. Simply pointing out model-data discrepancies is not enough, since discrepancies are often explained using explanations 1, 2, or 3.\nDiscrepancies between models and radiosonde trends largely stem for internal variability and heterogeneities in the radiosonde data (DOI: 10.1002/2017GL073798). Basically, a 1980s shift in radiosonde equipment caused 1980s radiosonde tropospheric temperatures to be artificially high, affecting radiosonde-based tropospheric temperature trends (DOI: 10.1175/JCLI3717.1; DOI: 10.1126/science.1115640; DOI: 10.1175/2008JCLI1929.1).\nSo much of the discrepancy between models and radiosondes is due to explanations 1, 2, and 3, not explanation 4. That’s been known for years. McKitrick’s paper does nothing to show otherwise (DOI: 10.1002/env.2294). In fact, as far as I can tell, McKitrick’s paper doesn’t mention the previous scientific literature in support of explanations 1, 2, and 3. I guess that makes it easier for him to lead readers towards accepting his preferred conclusion of explanation 4.\nNone of your citations offer anything close to conclusive evidence and your 4 cited reasons are merely guesses.\nNowhere is it mentioned that CO2 just does not cause the warming assumed, assumed.. assumed, junk science\nAll of the papers you refer to provide no conclusive evidence for any claims including McKitrick’s.\nWhat we have is another field polluted by cancerous thinking of mathematics replacing physics.\nPingback: Energy & Environmental Newsletter: October 16, 2017 - Master Resource\nPingback: Energy And Environmental Newsletter – October 17th 2017 | PA Pundits - International\nReblogged this on Utopia – you are standing in it!.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement.

Yet we can’t languish at the bottom anymore without seriously jeopardizing Wisconsin’s economic vibrancy,” said Rothman. “The budget proposal before the state legislature for the UWs would simply bring us up to the middle nationally in funding, but it would provide essential investments to preserve the quality and advance the innovation that Wisconsin expects of its UWs.”\nRothman also announced today that nearly 800 business officials, business groups, and individuals had signed a letter of support for additional state investment in the UWs. They include 20 state and regional business organizations that have signed on their support for the UWs.\n“The UWs are proud to be joined today by business leaders to share the support of hundreds of representatives of businesses and organizations throughout the state,” said Rothman. “Coming from the private sector, they know what I know – that Wisconsin will not win the war for talent if it does not make sound and competitive investments in higher education.”\nHe made the announcement ahead of a panel discussion at TitletownTech about the role the UWs play in the economic vibrancy of northeast Wisconsin as well as the entire state.\nAmong the signatories are representatives of the following: Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks, Northwestern Mutual, Sentry Insurance, Rockwell Automation, Epic Systems, Skyward, Delta Dental, Bartolotta Restaurants, Quad, Snap-on, Exact Sciences, Uline, and Oshkosh Corp. Twenty business groups from around the state have also signed on, including New North, Greater Oshkosh Economic Development Corporation, Oshkosh Chamber, Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, Greater Milwaukee Committee, BioForward, HOAN Group, and the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce.\n“When the Green Bay Packers need talent, we scout more than the football field,” said Packers President and CEO Mark Murphy. “In order to remain one of the most successful and beloved sports franchises in the world, we also need that talent the Universities of Wisconsin develop for our state.”\n“From day one, TitletownTech has partnered with the Universities of Wisconsin because breakthrough ideas become great companies when education and industry collaborate,” said Craig Dickman, managing partner of TitletownTech. “Investment in our universities unlocks the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovations that will drive Wisconsin’s economy forward.”\nDickman is a member of the panel at TitletownTech to be led by Regent Ashok Rai, President and CEO of Prevea Health. In addition to Dickman, the panel features Anna Murphy-Pociask, Marketing Coordinator, Oshkosh Convention and Visitors Bureau; April León, Manager of Nursing Education, Aurora BayCare Medical Center, Green Bay; and Jose Villa, Vice President of Commercial Lending, Fox Communities Credit Union, De Pere.\n“Larger employers, especially in health care, know of the critical need to recruit and retain talent here in Wisconsin,” Rai said. “Our UWs, from our comprehensives to our flagship, are key to meeting the future workforce needs here in northwest Wisconsin and across the entire state.”\nThe State Higher Education Finance report (SHEF) was produced by the State Higher Education Executive Offers Association and has been a respected source on state higher education funding for years. It defines public funding as both state funding and tuition. Find the report, including state rankings in Figure 4.2, at https://shef.sheeo.org/report/.\nThe Universities of Wisconsin serve approximately 164,400 students. Awarding nearly 36,000 degrees annually, these 13 public universities are Wisconsin’s talent pipeline, putting graduates in position to increase their earning power, contribute to their communities, and make Wisconsin a better place to live. Nearly 90 percent of in-state Universities of Wisconsin graduates stay in the state five years after earning a degree. The universities provide a 23:1 return on state investment. The Universities of Wisconsin also contribute to the richness of Wisconsin’s culture and economy with groundbreaking research, new companies and patents, and boundless creative intellectual energy.

Mr. Stupak. This meeting will come to order. We are going to ask the press to please clear. This hearing of the subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, will commence. Today we have a hearing titled, ``The Role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill.'' We have a number of Members present for this hearing who are not members of the subcommittee but are members of the full Energy and Commerce Committee. I welcome them, and I note that they will be allowed to submit written statements for the record but will not deliver verbal opening statements. In addition, after all subcommittee members complete their questioning, full committee members will be allowed to ask questions. Members who are not on the subcommittee or on the Energy and Commerce Committee are welcome to observe, but they will not be permitted to provide opening statements or ask questions, due to time constraints. The chairman, ranking member, and chairman emeritus will be recognized for 5-minute opening statements. Other members of the committee will be recognized for 3-minute opening statements. I will yield to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Waxman, for the first opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this important hearing. And, Mr. Hayward, thank you for being here today. Yesterday, BP pledged to establish a $20 billion escrow account and to suspend its dividend payments for the rest of the year. I am sure these were not easy decisions for you, but they were the right ones, and I commend you for them. Congress has multiple committees examining the gulf oil spill. Some are evaluating the impact of the spill. Some are working on the reorganization of the regulatory agencies. And some, including Chairman Markey's subcommittee, are drafting legislation to reform our oil exploration laws. You are testifying today before the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee, and this subcommittee has a special role: to examine the facts and determine what went wrong and to make recommendations to prevent future spills. When it is time for questioning, I and other members of the subcommittee will ask you about a series of internal BP documents. They appear to show that BP repeatedly took shortcuts that endangered lives and increased the risks of a catastrophic blowout. And I sent you a letter in advance indicating that we are going to question you about those issues. But what is equally important is what is missing from the documents. When you became CEO of BP, you promised to focus ``like a laser on safe and reliable operations.'' We wanted to know what you had done to keep this promise, so we asked what e-mails you had received, what documents you had reviewed about the Deepwater Horizon rig or the Macondo well before the blowout. Deepwater drilling is inherently dangerous. As the entire country now knows, an uncontrolled blowout can kill rig workers and cause an environmental disaster. We wanted to know whether you were briefed about the risks and were monitoring the safety of the drilling operation. We could find no evidence that you paid any attention to the tremendous risks BP was taking. We have reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from BP, including your e-mails. There is not a single e-mail or document that shows you paid even the slightest attention to the dangers at this well. You are the CEO, so we considered the possibility that you may have delegated the oversight responsibility to someone else. We reviewed the e-mails and briefing documents received by Andy Inglis, the chief executive for exploration and production, and Doug Suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production and the person now leading BP's response to the spill. According to BP, these are the senior officials who were responsible for the Macondo well. But they, too, were apparently oblivious to what was happening. We can find no evidence that either of them received any e-mails or briefings about the Deepwater Horizon rig or drilling activities at the well. BP's corporate complacency is astonishing. The drilling engineer for the rig called Macondo a ``nightmare well.'' Other BP employees predicted that the cement job would fail. Halliburton warned of a ``SEVERE gas flow problem.'' These warnings fell on deaf ears. BP's corporate attitude may be best summed up in an e-mail from its operations drilling engineer who oversaw BP's team of drilling engineers. After learning of the risks and BP's decision to ignore them, he wrote, quote, ``Who cares, it's done, end of story, will probably be fine,'' end quote. There is a complete contradiction between BP's words and deeds. You were brought in to make safety the top priority of BP, but under your leadership, BP has taken the most extreme risks. BP cut corner after corner to save a million dollars here, a few hours or days there, and now the whole gulf coast is paying the price. Today's hearing will focus on BP's actions, but we learned from our hearing earlier this week that the other oil companies are just as unprepared to deal with a massive spill as BP. We are seeing in the oil industry the same corporate indifference to risk that caused the collapse on Wall Street. And that is why reform is so urgently needed. Part of this reform must be legislation to put teeth into our regulatory system, but part must also be a transition to a clean energy economy. We are addicted to oil. This addiction is fouling our beaches, polluting our atmosphere, and undermining our national security. We can't snap our fingers or transform our energy economy overnight, but we need to start down a path to a clean energy future. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to today's hearing. And, Mr. Hayward, I thank you for appearing and cooperating with our investigation.

We will next go to the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton of Texas. Mr. Burgess and I will do our openings after the chair and the ranking. Mr. Barton, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE BARTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Barton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Hayward, for appearing before us. We have kind of a dual track under way, in my opinion. We obviously are trying to gather the facts of what happened in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a month and a half ago, trying to find out the causes of that spill, what can be done to prevent it in the future. And we are obviously very concerned about the mitigation and the cleanup. We have a system in America, built up based on the British tradition over 200 years, of due process and fairness, where people that do bad things, in this case a corporation that is responsible for a bad accident, we want to hold them responsible, do what we can to make the liable parties pay for the damages. Mr. Stupak and Mr. Waxman are doing an excellent job, working with Dr. Burgess and myself, in conducting, I think, a very fair oversight investigation. We are going to get into a number of those issues in this hearing, and we are going to ask you some pretty tough questions. I am speaking totally for myself. I am not speaking for the Republican Party. I am not speaking for anybody in the House of Representatives but myself. But I am ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday. I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown--in this case, a $20 billion shakedown--with the Attorney General of the United States, who is legitimately conducting a criminal investigation and has every right to do so to protect the interests of the American people, participating in what amounts to a $20 billion slush fund that is unprecedented in our Nation's history, that has no legal standing, and which sets, I think, a terrible precedent for the future. If I called you into my office and I had the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Stupak, with me, who was legitimately conducting an oversight investigation on your company, and said, ``If you put so many millions of dollars into a project in my congressional district,'' I could go to jail and should go to jail. Now, there is no question that British Petroleum owns this lease. There is no question that BP--I am sorry, it is not ``British Petroleum'' anymore--that BP made decisions that objective people think compromised safety. There is no question that BP is liable for the damages. But we have a due process system where we go through hearings, in some cases court cases, litigation, and determine what those damages are and when those damages should be paid. So I am only speaking for myself. I am not speaking for anybody else. But I apologize. I do not want to live in a country where, any time a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong, is subject to some sort of political pressure that, again, in my words, amounts to a shakedown. So I apologize. But on this hearing today, I am with Mr. Waxman, with Mr. Stupak. There are questions that need to be asked, that are legitimate, because we don't want another oil spill of this magnitude or of any magnitude in the Gulf of Mexico. And if this subcommittee can do things that make it much more difficult for this type of an incident to occur in the future, then we will have done our work for the American people. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Barton follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.008 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BART STUPAK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Barton. I will do my opening statement now. Today is the 59th day of the BP oil spill that has devastated much of the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven men lost their lives the day the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, and in the 59 days that have followed, countless people have lost their livelihood, as the oil spill closes fishing grounds and pollutes the shores of the three States. This is the third hearing the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee has held and the fifth hearing overall in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Our first hearing exposed problems discovered with the blowout preventer and several other factors that contributed to the disaster. Our second hearing was a field hearing in New Orleans where we heard from the widows of two men who died in the Deepwater Horizon explosion as well as shrimpers and other small-business owners who have suffered from the environmental catastrophe that followed. Our staff has spent weeks combing through hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, sitting through more than 50 hours of briefings by corporate, governmental, and academic experts, in an attempt to piece together what went wrong with BP exploration of the Macondo well. We have reviewed several questionable decisions made by BP in the days and hours leading up to the explosion, and what we have learned so far is alarming. We have learned that, time after time, BP had warning signs that this was, as one employee put it, a ``nightmare well.'' BP made choices that set safety aside in exchange for cost-cutting and time-saving decisions. For example: BP disregarded questionable results from pressure tests after cementing in the well. BP selected the riskier of two options for their well design. They could have hung a liner from the lower end of the casing already in the well and install a tieback on the top of the liner, which would have provided additional barriers to the release of hydrocarbons. Instead, they lowered a full string of new casing, which took less time and cost less but did not provide the same protection against escaping hydrocarbons. BP was warned by their cement contractor Halliburton that the well could have a ``SEVERE gas flow problem'' if BP lowered the final string of casing with only six centralizers instead of the 21 Halliburton recommended. BP rejected Halliburton's advice to use additional centralizers. In an e-mail on April 16th, a BP official involved in the decision explained, and I quote, ``It will take 10 hours to install them. I do not like this,'' end of quote. BP chose not to fully circulate the mud in the well from the bottom to the top, which was an industry-recommended best practice that would have allowed them to test for gas in the mud. BP chose not to use a casing hanger lockdown sleeve, which would have provided extra protection against a blowout from below. These are just a few of the issues that led to the disaster. Once the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank to the bottom of the sea, BP's response to contain the leak and clean up the spilled oil was equally as poor. They issued lowball estimates of the amount of oil flowing from the well, which may have led to a scaled-back response. We discovered that BP's oil spill response plan was virtually identical to other oil companies' plans. In a hearing Tuesday, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson admitted that once the spills occur, he says, quote, ``We are not well-equipped to handle them,'' end of quote. All the other oil companies testified at Tuesday's hearings that they would not have drilled the well as BP did. Our witness today, Mr. Tony Hayward, is the chief executive officer of BP. Shortly after Mr. Hayward took over as the CEO in 2007, he held a town hall meeting with employees in Houston. At this meeting, he discussed the need for BP to be leaner, with fewer people in decision-making processes. This article--and I will ask you put up the Guardian article--an article from September 27, 2007, Guardian newspaper in London, entitled, ``Hayward Says Oil Company Has Become Too Cautious,'' reads, and I quote, ``'Assurance is killing us,' Mr. Hayward told U.S. staff, noting that too many people were engaged in decision-making, leading to excessive cautiousness, something that critics of its safety performance in the U.S. might question.'' Let me put up these other notes from the same meeting. We received notes from BP of employees and their note-taking from this meeting. The employee notes summarize Mr. Hayward's statements as follows: ``I don't think having all these layer of assurance reduce risk, and it can actually increase it. The best way to reduce risk is to have deep technical competence where we need it. Individuals need to be accountable for risk and to manage it,'' end of quote. I find this cavalier attitude towards assessing risk unbelievable, given the fact that, at the time of these statements, BP had just been responsible for the largest oil leak in Alaska's history on the North Slope, as well as the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion, which killed 15 workers and injured another 170. I must ask, Mr. Hayward, whether it was wise to adopt this leaner decision-making process with input from fewer people and a new approach to managing risk. Under the leadership of Bob Malone, the former chairman and president of BP America, BP created an independent office of the ombudsman, headed by Judge Stanley Sporkin. The ombudsman's office was established because line workers reported fearing retaliation if they reported safety concerns to management. When the current chairman and president, Lamar McKay, took over, I met with him, and he suggested that he hoped to improve the culture enough to make the ombudsman office unnecessary so he could shut it down. I urged him not to eliminate the office because it serves a significant role in investigating employee complaints. I am more concerned now than ever about BP's safety and the role they take in assuming risk. I am concerned that the corporate culture, from BPCEO Tony Hayward down to chairman and president of BP America, Lamar McKay, and Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles, that there is a willingness to cut costs and take greater risks. I look forward to hearing Mr. Hayward answer the many hard- hitting questions that our committee members will ask today. I hope we will hear honest, contrite, and substantive answers. Mr. Hayward, you owe it to all Americans. We are not ``small people,'' but we wish to get our lives back. For the Americans who live and work on the gulf coast, it may be years before they get their lives back. For the Americans who lost their lives on the rig, their families may never get their lives back. Mr. Hayward, I am sure you will get your life back, and with a golden parachute back to England. But we in America are left with the terrible consequences of BP's reckless disregard for safety. I yield back my time and turn to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Burgess, for an opening statement. [The prepared statement of Mr. Stupak follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.010 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Chairman Stupak. Today does open our third hearing, and a very critical hearing, into this subcommittee's ongoing investigation into the tragic accident of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, which continues 24 hours a day to wreak economic and environmental havoc on our gulf coast. This hearing provides the subcommittee with an important opportunity to directly question the man who ultimately leads BP, Mr. Tony Hayward, the company's chief executive officer. And BP's role has been central to the causes of the incident and to the response. Over the course of our inquiry to date, committee investigators, working in a bipartisan fashion, have conducted numerous interviews and briefings and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents. Our subcommittee staff has done an excellent job. And this subcommittee has been focused on gathering the facts, rather than rushing to judgment. And from this intensive effort, we have begun to identify a number of serious questions about BP's decision-making that led up to the disaster. Exploring these and related questions today will help us identify for Congress and identify for the country what went wrong on April 20th and the days thereafter. And while we are investigating, a picture of the chain of events leading to this incident is emerging. Mr. Chairman, you and Chairman Waxman recently outlined some critical questions that we hope Mr. Hayward will address. For example, you noted the investigation has identified questionable choices by BP engineers to use a particular well design over another one that would appear to have provided more built-in barriers to an uncontrolled gas discharge. There was the choice made by BP to move forward with what appears to be an inadequate cementing plan and the related failure, despite clear warnings to test that the cement was properly set and in place. And it appears there may have been a rush to move off this well. Whether there may have been economic or other time or performance pressures or some combination thereof, it is not clear, but that clarity needs to emerge today. The questions arising from our investigation outline the central role that BP's decision-making appears to have had in this incident. We need to understand that decision-making, Mr. Hayward, what factors influenced it, whether the decisions reflected a management and an operational mindset that failed-- failed to maximize safety in a challenging deep-sea environment. It is important to note that the picture developing from this investigation is not one of technological limits in deep- sea drilling. The construction of an 18,000-foot well was not pushing the envelope of engineering know-how, so far as we have identified. But the picture developing is one of unsafe industry practices. Although clear, more focused industry standards may be in order going forward, available evidence suggests that the use of best industry practices would have resulted in more cautious designs and more testing, more safeguards, and ultimately no loss of control of the well. Rather, and quite clearly, the picture developing from our investigation is one of questionable decision-making, decision- making by people charged with designing and successfully drilling, constructing, and controlling a well that was a mile under water. It is a picture composed of a series of choices which, taken together, created an oil well particularly vulnerable to a blowout and of all the people who may have been distracted, unaware, or resistant to recognizing the problems around them. Documents show that BP was prepared to run a test on the quality of the cement job but chose not to. I can't understand why, given the history of this particular well, with four previous well control incidents in the 2 months prior to April 20th. The rig personnel appear to have taken their eye off the ball. BP employees were the key decision-makers. Certainly, others--contractors, subcontractors, certainly Federal regulators--may have contributed to this incident. The role of the Federal Government especially, including the overall effectiveness of the response and the efforts to help those harmed by the incident, remains a critical piece that, Mr. Chairman, we must pursue at the level of this committee. And I am still disappointed that we have not done that. But it is BP's decision-making about the well design, the cementing program, the preparation, the integrity test, or the lack thereof, or just the general lack of curiosity as to why these would be necessary, the failure to follow best practices, that our investigation to date is showing were critical factors in this incident. But this decision-making is difficult to square with avowed priorities of BP's chief executive. Mr. Hayward, in an interview before you became chief executive, you described how the death of a worker in an operation that you were leading in Venezuela shaped your opinions. You said, and I am quoting, ``I went to the funeral to pay my respects. At the end of the service, his mother came up to me and beat me on the chest. 'Why did you let it happen?' she asked. It changed the way I think about safety. Leaders must make safety of all who work for them a priority,'' end quote. Mr. Hayward, I respectfully request that you answer this question in your opening statement, if not for me, then for the two ladies who testified before our committee at the field hearing who lost their husbands on the Deepwater Horizon. You have been chief executive since 2007. You said safety is your number-one priority and you would focus like a laser beam on safety. As chief executive, one would expect your directives and priorities would be carried out by your employees. We have now learned from this investigation that BP employees made five critical decisions that may have contributed to well failure where well safety was traded off. In fact, it was not the priority. So, today, will you assert before this subcommittee that all decisions by BP employees related to the Deepwater Horizon reflected your priority--your priority--of safety first? Mr. Chairman, the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico shows the consequence of a series of unchecked bad decisions. We in Congress and the Federal Government must also be mindful of the consequences of bad decision-making. At a field hearing last week in Chalmette, Louisiana, the subcommittee heard some of the administration's decisions are threatening the livelihoods of workers and families who depend upon the energy industry. We have killed half of their fishing with the Deepwater Horizon spill, and it looks like we are going to kill the other half of their economy with our moratorium. Our hearing today looks at the consequence of bad decisions and the lessons learned. May we have the wisdom and humility to take some of those lessons and apply them to ourselves. And I will yield back the balance of my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Burgess follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.016 Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Burgess. I would next like to turn to the chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee and chairman of the Select Committee on Climate, Mr. Markey, 5 minutes for an opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. I want to begin by disagreeing in the strongest possible terms with what Mr. Barton said in his opening statement. Not only is the compensation fund that was created yesterday at the White House in an agreement reached between BP and President Obama not a slush fund and not a shakedown; rather, it was the Government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country right now, the residents of the gulf. It is BP's spill, but it is America's ocean and it is American citizens who are being harmed. We cannot wait, as unfortunately so many citizens who were victims of the Exxon Valdez spill had to wait years in order to see those families compensated. We can't lose sight of the fact that the 1984 Bhopal disaster and the lawsuits that were related to it were only settled last week. We have to ensure that the citizens of the gulf are protected. In a hearing which this subcommittee conducted in New Orleans last Monday, we heard from a fisherman who brought absolutely impeccable records which proved that he and his family had made $27,000 last May. And, after examining the documents, BP gave the family $5,000. The families in the gulf will be crushed financially unless this compensation fund is put into place. As each day and week and month goes by, the history of these families are going to be altered, and permanently altered, unless they are given the financial capacity to take care of their loved ones, their children, their families. That is why this compensation fund is so important. That is why it is not a slush fund. That is why it is not a shakedown. It is, in fact, President Obama ensuring that a company which has despoiled the waters of our Nation is made accountable for the harm which is done to our people--a company which said for the first week that it was only 1,000 barrels of oil per day, when we now know that they knew it was at least 1,000 to 14,000 barrels; a company which continues to deny that there are underwater toxic plumes; a company which has not been providing the proper protective gear for the workers in the gulf; a company which contended it could respond to a spill of 250,000 barrels per day. No, this is not a shakedown of their company. This is the American Government, President Obama ensuring that this company is made accountable and sending a signal to all other companies that seek to treat ordinary American families in a way that can destroy their entire family's history. This is, in my opinion, the American Government working at its best. This is creating truly the kind of partnership between the public and private sector that can make sure that innocent victims are not roadkill as a result of corporate plans that did not actually factor in the harm that can occur to ordinary families. So I just could not disagree more strongly. I think that this is, in my opinion, one of the most important hearings that this Congress will ever have, because it is sending a signal to any corporations out there, including the ones that testified on Tuesday that all admitted that they had no plans either to respond to the harm which could be done in the gulf if one of their rigs had the same kind of catastrophic event, that they will be made accountable. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. And I thank you, Mr. Hayward, because yesterday was the day where the page began to be turned and we moved to a new era where, in fact, your company is made accountable and the citizens of the gulf are made whole. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Markey. I next turn to Mr. Sullivan for an opening statement. Three minutes, please, sir. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN SULLIVAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Mr. Sullivan. Chairman Stupak, thank you for holding this hearing today. On April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred on the British Petroleum-Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. This terrible disaster resulted in the loss of 11 lives and injured many more members of the 126-person crew. There is no question that the BP oil spill is a tragedy. In fact, it is the worst environmental disaster in our Nation's history. I believe we must do everything in our power to cap the leak, find out what caused the explosion, and ensure nothing like this ever happens again. BP must bear the entire financial burden for this disaster, and the American taxpayer should not be on the hook for a dime. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, there is mounting evidence that BP has one of the worst safety records of any major oil company operating in the United States. To this end, I am looking forward to examining with Mr. Hayward whether there is a deficient safety culture at BP that led to this disaster and other recent ones, including the BP refinery explosion in 2005 in Texas City, Texas, and a BP pipeline spill in 2007 which released 200,000 gallons of oil into the Alaskan wilderness. Mr. Hayward, why is BP's record on safety so spotty? What is equally as important as our efforts to combat the spill is the knee-jerk legislative reaction from this Congress. Right now, the administration and their allies in the House are more focused on the politics of putting the oil and gas industry out of business than on solutions to the problem. Instead of working in a bipartisan way to push for rigorous safety standards on all offshore rigs, the administration is exploiting this disaster to advance this disastrous cap-and- trade energy policy, which won't stop the well from leaking but, rather, will only serve as a national energy tax on the American people, crippling our economy and making the unemployment lines longer. I believe Congress should work towards implementing rigorous safety inspection standards for all offshore rigs, but with nearly 30 percent of our Nation's oil and 11 percent of our gas reserves located offshore, a ban on offshore drilling will only put Americans out of work. And it will send energy and gas prices through the roof and increase our reliance on foreign, imported oil. We still have work to do to uncover exactly what went wrong, and many questions remain on the ongoing efforts to contain the leak. This tragedy should not be used as an excuse to roll back the gains we have made in finding new ways to develop our energy resources, as we will need more oil and natural gas to meet the crucial needs of our Nation. And I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Next we would like to hear from the chairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell of Michigan, for 5 minutes, please, sir. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. DINGELL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN Mr. Dingell. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for holding this important hearing today. We sit here on day 59 of the worst environmental disaster in the history of this country. Eleven people are dead. The already-fragile economy of an entire region is in real danger of shattering. We will be feeling the environmental consequences for years to come. And God Almighty alone knows what the health and environmental effects of the containment and cleanup strategies will be--millions of gallons of chemical dispersants and controlled burns. Sadly, we can't even get a decent estimate of the amount of oil and gas that is spewing out into the water. BP has been before this committee many times, and rarely has it been a pleasant meeting, because invariably they have appeared here to defend serious failures on the part of the company. The company has a history of cutting corners, apparently for the almighty dollar. Texas City, they paid there $50 million in criminal fines. Alaska's North Slope, which was investigated by this subcommittee, where a pipe corroded, allowing 1 million liters of oil to spill. In each instance, we were hoping, but the assurances given by BP that this would not happen again have been, regrettably, untrue. In reference to a decision on how to secure the final 1,200 feet of the well, a single casing, or tieback, a BP engineer said, ``Not running the tieback saves a good deal of time and money.'' In reference to installing more centralizers, BP's well team leader said, ``It will take 10 hours to install them. I do not like this. I am very concerned about using it.'' So, also, were we. On the same matter, BP's operations drilling engineer said, ``Even if the hole is perfectly straight, a straight piece of pipe even in tension will not seek the center of the hole unless it has something to centralize it.'' And I want you to listen to this. ``But who cares? It is done. End of story. It will probably be fine''--and note the word ``probably''--``and we will get a good cement job. I would rather have to squeeze than get stuck. So guard right on the risk-reward occasion.'' Mr. Chairman, the comments of our witness today reveal little sorrow for the events that have occurred. And here he said, ``The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting in is tiny in relation to the total water volume.'' And then, ``The environmental impact of the disaster is likely to be very, very modest.'' I wonder if he wishes to stand on that statement today. When Mr. Hayward responded to the claims that cleanup workers were becoming ill because of oil fumes and such, he said this: ``Food poisoning is clearly a big issue.'' And, finally, most famously, Mr. Hayward informs us he ``wants his life back.'' Last year, Mr. Hayward enjoyed a splendid 41 percent pay raise, even as BP's profits dropped 45 percent. Now, I just happen to be a poor Polish lawyer from Detroit, but it seems to me that this is a curious response to a drop in profits. It makes me wonder what the compensation package of our witness will be this year. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank you for your diligence and hard work on this issue. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and look forward to working with you on this matter. Thank you. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Next, Mrs. Blackburn for an opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and Ranking Member Burgess for holding the hearing today. Mr. Hayward, I thank you for your willingness to testify before this committee. You know, when news of the BP spill began and information about the well started to circulate, it seemed that there were problems not only with BP but also with the MMS bureaucracy and that maybe the problem lay there, rather than with anything that could have gone wrong with BP, that it was there with MMS. What we have learned and confirmed is that that is not correct, that the problem does lie with BP in what went wrong. And while there are many faults with MMS in doing its job on inspection and safety oversight, most of the data now points to wrong decision-making by BP's management. And this is not the first time--and we have talked about that in several of our opening statements this morning--it is not the first time that you have been before this committee on safety problems. And, certainly, as recently as the Texas 2005 and Alaska 2007 incidents, which revealed insufficient protocols in BP's management and safety hierarchy, there was this statement from BP that you all would, quote/unquote, ``focus like a laser on safety.'' And it is concerning to us that the appearance is, Mr. Hayward, that BP has not learned from previous mistakes. So it leaves us asking the questions of you and of BP: Was this accident caused by negligence? It was caused by risk-taking? Was it caused by cost-cutting measures by BP decision-makers? And, unfortunately, for citizens, beaches, and wildlife all along the coastal region, they are paying a price for those misplaced decisions. BP cannot blame Mother Nature or equipment failure or even other subcontractors. Their actions have put at risk the livelihood of communities and businesses that depend on the gulf not only for seafood and tourism but also energy production that this Nation as a whole relies upon. In addition, the current administration also shares a significant portion of the blame for the oil spill. I mentioned MMS earlier. And the MMS officials approved inadequate spill response plans, and field inspectors rubber-stamped inspection papers submitted by oil companies. This is another area where we, as Members of Congress, in doing our due diligence, will ask you all and MMS why. But what is the most damaging is that the President and senior officials knew on day one the blowout preventer was not working and knew of the potential spillage. While BP shoulders much of the responsibility for this spill, the lack of effort by this administration to contain the spill has doomed the economy and wildlife of the gulf coast from an oil spill which could have been contained. And now, recently imposed drilling moratoriums will further devastate America's energy production and will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in the gulf coast region. Thank you for being with us today. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. We will next turn to the vice chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Braley, for an opening statement. Three minutes, please, sir. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRUCE L. BRALEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Mr. Braley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, you are not going to get a lecture from me today, and you are not going to get an apology either, because we are here to get to the bottom of the decision-making process that BP followed, and I think, quite frankly, the people who live along the affected area of the gulf coast deserve those answers from you. We were in Chalmette, Louisiana, last week, and we had the opportunity to hear from a variety of individuals whose lives have been devastated by this oil disaster. And I use the word ``disaster'' specifically because I don't think ``spill'' quite captures the magnitude of what is going on. The American people are frustrated because we were first told that this was a 1,000-barrel-per-day release, and then about a week later that was updated to 5,000 barrels per day, and then at the end of May it was adjusted upward to 15,000 to 19,000 barrels per day, and then this week we were informed that it could be as high as 60,000 barrels per day. That works out to 2.5 million gallons a day, 17.5 million gallons per week. And over the length of this disaster, it could be up to the level of the largest release of oil in the North American continent in history, unintended. One of the things I think we need to know about today is the decisions that your company made and who made them that led to this explosion and the subsequent disaster, what your company is doing to fix this enormous problem, and about your future commitments to all of the affected workers, families, and communities who have been devastated by this disaster. And I think it would be helpful for you and everybody in this hearing room to hear from the two women who testified at our hearing in Louisiana last week, because they raised some very pointed questions that were directed to your company, sir. And they were questions that were raised after they gave passionate testimony of wanting the oil and gas business to continue in Louisiana and the gulf coast region. So I would like to have you listen to their comments in the hearing. This is Natalie Roshto. [Video played.] Mr. Braley. These are now widows with small children to take care of, and they are the symbols and the faces of this disaster. And I look forward to your testimony. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. We will next turn to Mr. Gingrey from Georgia for a 3- minute opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PHIL GINGREY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA Mr. Gingrey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to again express my sorrow to the families of those who lost their lives on April the 20th, 2010. Through all the hearings and legislative consideration, we must remember those lives and the lives of their families, as we just saw, that were forever changed on that fateful April day. And we certainly must continue to keep them in our thoughts and in our prayers. Further, we have an obligation, not only to those families but also to everyone affected by the aftermath, to get to the bottom of the causes of this accident and the failure to secure the situation and stop the devastation wreaked upon the gulf coast. Mr. Chairman, we have an opportunity in this oversight hearing to ask questions that get to the facts of what happened. However, today's hearing is incomplete. We can only ascertain half of the story today because we do not have anyone representing the administration, the Minerals Management Service, to discuss their oversight role and their responsibility in ensuring that an accident like this didn't happen. Deep-ocean drilling is not new. In fact, we have been doing it for decades in the gulf coast. Why did this happen now? I have heard some assert that it was the lax oversight of the previous administration that led to this accident. Well, if that is the case, why did this not happen during the last decade? Why did this occur almost a year and a half into the current administration? We need to hear from our own Department of Interior and the Minerals Management Service. Certainly, Mr. Hayward should be prepared to answer for BP's responsibility, but we will also need answers from the administration so that we can demand accountability and implement prudent reforms to return us to safe drilling in our oceans. Because simply saying ``no'' to further and new drilling is not a realistic answer. I further realize there are some in this administration who have a penchant for not letting a crisis go to waste. But for a nation dependent on foreign oil, for a nation with unemployment hovering at 10 percent, we can't just say we can't do this. We can't take our ball and go home, when the consequences mean a weaker America. Everyone dependent on foreign fuels are all too inclined, it seems, to let jobs leave this country. No, Mr. Chairman. We have to understand what happened on and leading up to April 20th. We need to answer those questions to determine if the rules or the agency oversight were insufficient or if this was purely an act of negligence or wanton disregard for sound regulations. Now, we can try to enact the perfect reform that ensures this never happens again, but it will not change the path or the toll upon the lives forever changed. Mr. Hayward, the responsibility to make these families whole falls to you and your company, BP. You have an obligation to right this wrong, and not only the public trust but also the belief in the free market and entrepreneurship demand it. And, Mr. Chairman, I await the opportunity to ask questions, with the hope that we will soon discuss these same matters with our own administration. And I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Gingrey. Ms. DeGette for an opening statement, 3 minutes, please. Ms. DeGette. Mr. Chairman, as this is an investigative hearing, I will submit my excellent opening statement for the record in order to have more time for questioning the witness. Mr. Stupak. Very well. [The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette was unavailable at the time of printing.] Mr. Stupak. Mr. Doyle, opening statement? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Doyle. Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this hearing today so we can begin to understand what went so tragically wrong on the Deepwater Horizon. We are now 59 days into this environmental and economic tragedy, and oil continues to gush into the Gulf of Mexico. The estimates for how much oil spills into the gulf each day continue to rise, and we still have no way to cap the well in the near future. We sit helplessly as we wait for a relief well to be completed. As the details and facts about Deepwater Horizon come to light, it is clear to us all that the decisions made by officials at BP reflected bad judgment at best and criminal negligence at worst. Through this committee's investigation, we have learned that, at nearly every turn, BP cut corners. In well design, the number of centralizers they used, whether to run a cement bond log, circulating drilling muds and securing the wellhead with a lockdown sleeve, BP took the path of least resistance. On Tuesday, colleagues and competitors from the oil and gas industry provided sworn testimony that they believed BP had delinquencies in well design and failed to follow the best practices of the industry. Now we learn that BP had several warnings about the Macondo well, with one of their own engineers calling it a ``nightmare well.'' But instead of treating the well with caution, it seems that BP's only interest was in completing the well quickly and cheaply. Many questions still need to be answered. Were BP employees on the Deepwater Horizon given orders from BP officials to speed up the Macondo well? Were they told to slash costs wherever possible? Why would a team onboard the rig that tests the cementing of the well be sent home before performing the test? Surely if a cement bond log was ever necessary, it would be in a ``nightmare well'' situation. But sending the team home, BP saved $100,000 and 9 or 10 hours of work. Mr. Hayward, I hope you are here today to answer questions about the decision made on Deepwater Horizon that led to this tragic and deadly blowout. Earlier this week, this committee sent you a letter with detailed information about topics we would like you to address today. In reviewing your statement submitted for today's hearing, I am extremely disappointed in your avoidance of the requested topics. I certainly hope that you use the opportunity today to answer our questions openly and truthfully. I know BP has committed to clean up the gulf region, and I expect that commitment to be ongoing. I welcome your pledge to pay damages through a $20 billion escrow fund. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Rebuilding the public's trust in your company and your industry will take years and many serious changes in the way you do business. When you operate on our land and in our waters, you are only there because the public's trust has allowed you to be there. You violated that trust in the worst possible way. Mr. Hayward, I look forward to your testimony. I look forward to your answers to our questions and your ongoing efforts to regain America's trust. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Doyle. Mr. Griffith for an opening statement, 3 minutes, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PARKER GRIFFITH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, for calling this important hearing today and, Mr. Hayward, for taking time to come before our subcommittee to discuss what happened on the Deepwater Horizon. I know that, like us, your number-one priority is stopping the flow of oil. Congress and this committee owe it to the American people to do whatever we can to aid the unified command in reaching this goal. This is a time for engineering and action, and I hope you will let us know what we can do in Congress to be helpful. There are still many questions to be answered about what happened on the Deepwater Horizon, and unfortunately we do know that, from the documents that we are reviewing, it does not look good. My hope for our hearing today is that we will be able to put political public-relations shenanigans aside and focus on understanding why decisions were made and how BP and the industry can ensure that they learn from this incident so that drilling safely for our valuable resources can continue. And I might say this to you: You are never as good as they say you are or as bad as they say you are. So this hearing will go back and forth. The other thing I would like to remind the committee is that the greatest environmental disaster in America has been cigarettes. Sixty thousand Americans this year will die from cigarette-related cancer. So if we are going to talk about the environment, let's be sure we don't leave that out. I am a cancer specialist, by the way, by training, and I never fail to bring that up. So the environment is an important concept. We regret the loss of life. But there is much that we can do and we will put this in perspective. This is not going to be the worst thing that has ever happened to America. Thank you. Mr. Stupak. Ms. Schakowsky, 3 minutes opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At this very moment oil is gushing from the Deepwater Horizon blowout at a rate between, we learned, 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day, killing animals, destroying fragile wetlands, and wiping out entire populations of fish, and along with it the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people. Most upsetting about this travesty is that it could have been avoided. As the ongoing investigation by this committee has already discovered, BP executives created an atmosphere where safety concerns were ignored in order to ensure that the company's already staggering profits this year, approximately $93 million a day in the first quarter, continued unabated. This appalling disregard for the Gulf Coast and its inhabitants is without question one of the most shameful acts by a corporation in American history. Sadly, the Deepwater Horizon spill is just the most significant example of BP's disregard for the environment and the well-being of its workers. A report published by the Center for Public Integrity found that between June 2007 and February 2010, BP received a total of 862 citations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Of those, a staggering 760 were classified as being egregious and willful, compared with 8 at the 2 oil companies tied for second place. Inexcusably this pattern of behavior continued in the spill's aftermath. I hold in my hand a document called Voluntary Waiver of Release that BP made unemployed fishermen sign before they could be hired for spill cleanup. The waiver states, I hereby agree on behalf of myself and my representatives to hold harmless and to indemnify and to release, waive and forever discharge BP Exploration Production, Inc., from all claims and damages that I or my representatives may have with regard to my participation in the spill response activities. I know that you said this was an early misstep and that this was just a standard document, but this was a first response that you had to people that were hired. And outrage does not begin to express my feeling. These are people who are unemployed because of the recklessness of BP, forced to take jobs cleaning up BP's mess in order to survive, yet to qualify for those jobs they had to hold BP harmless for any further damages that they may suffer in BP's employ. This from a company that made $93 million a day. Fortunately, a court trumped your fancy lawyers who wrote this document, but still it begs the question, how could you do that? I am glad that you are here, Mr. Hayward. I expect you to explain why your company has operated in such a wholly unacceptable manner. In the final analysis, the simple fact remains that if BP had thought more about the residents, as these widows said, and the workers, as these widows said, rather than the already exorbitant profits of its shareholders, we would not be here today. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Latta for an opening statement, 3 minutes, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT E. LATTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Latta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Burgess. I want to thank you for holding this subcommittee hearing on the role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. First and foremost, I also want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who have lost loved ones and to those who have been injured. The unprecedented scale of the spill and its increasing harmful impact on the gulf economy and environment demand a thorough investigation of BP's actions and inactions, as well as BP's current and future plans. The flow of oil must be stopped. Every day anywhere from 35,000 to 60,000 barrels are spilling into the gulf, and only 15,000 barrels a day are being captured. The environmental effects on the oil spill are harming shorelines and coastal wetlands, fisheries and fishery habitat, as well as marine mammals and sea turtles. What is worse, we will not fully know the ecological ramifications of the oil spill until years down the road. Furthermore, local businesses suffering great losses, including jobs and revenues that are dependent on tourism, are being threatened. The NOAA announced a revised commercial recreation fishing closure in the oil-affected portions of the Gulf of Mexico, accounting for 33 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's exclusive economic zone. As oil continues to flow, this area is sure to enlarge, further exasperating the economic damage. A recent economic impact study by the American Sportfishing Association indicated that the entire Gulf Coast will close to recreational fishing from May through August. The region will lose $1.1 billion in revenue, which supports 2.5 billion in total sales, 1.3 billion value added, 811.1 million income and 18,785 jobs. This potential economic damage is devastating to an area that has already suffered greatly from the aftermath of natural disasters. Americans continue to be frustrated at the lack of management and solutions from all parties involved, and I am interested to hear more about the coordinated efforts between BP and the administration. The economic and environmental magnitude of this disaster necessitates a clear understanding of what went wrong, and BP needs to be held accountable for the disaster. I also look forward to having MMS and the Department of Interior before this subcommittee to also--for them to answer some tough questioning. I look forward to hearing Mr. Hayward's testimony, and I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you. Mr. Stupak. Thanks, Mr. Latta. [The prepared statement of Mr. Latta follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.019 Mr. Stupak. Mr. Ross, 3 minutes opening statement, please, sir. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROSS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Mr. Ross. Thank you, Chairman Stupak, for holding today's hearing to examine BP's actions and decisions that directly led to the tragic explosion and oil spill that continues to gush and wreak havoc on the Gulf Coast at a rate up to over 1,700 gallons per minute. In fact, Mr. Hayward, since this hearing began a little over an hour ago, up to 112,847 gallons have been dumped into the gulf. On day 59 of this environmental and economic disaster, with up to 60,000 barrels a day spilling into the gulf, I continue to be frustrated and downright angry by BP's response and lack of a clear and productive plan to stop the leak or efficiently clean up the oil that is destroying the ecosystems that surround the gulf. Reports have surfaced revealing that in the days and weeks before the explosion, BP knowingly made a number of decisions that increased the danger of an explosion and spill occurring. It seems apparent that BP put profit before safety. Many people are dead; millions of gallons of oil continue to spew into the gulf. I am hopeful that Mr. Hayward can explain today why these decisions were made, how his company's actions led to this disaster, and what they are doing to remedy it. As oil floats into the marshes and onto the beaches, as shrimping vessels sit tied to docks, as restaurants and businesses during their peak season remain without tourists and customers, and as homeowners see their property values plummet, the people and wildlife of the Gulf Coast wait and wonder about how extensive the damage to the ecosystem or the economy will be. This spill is not only affecting the Gulf Coast, the jobs and economies of the surrounding States are hurting as well. My State of Arkansas borders Louisiana, and many of my constituents, people I know in my hometown, work on offshore rigs. These jobs are also at risk, and I hope BP will take responsibility for all those who are affected by this spill, regardless of where they live, and work to help pull them through this disaster as well. This bill is a wake-up call that must result in better government oversight, more advanced technology, stronger response plans and improved safety standards not only by BP and every oil company in America, but also by our government. Above all, this disaster is a learning experience that will help us prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again, and I am hopeful this hearing can provide the answers and solutions necessary to begin that process. Mr. Hayward, I truly hope that you will give us open and honest answers today and not those prepared by your legal team. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Stupak. I would next like to call on Mrs. Christensen of the Virgin Islands for an opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DONNA M. CHRISTENSEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE VIRGIN ISLANDS Mrs. Christensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this important hearing. The explosion on the Deepwater platform and the subsequent outpouring of hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into one of the most sensitive and important bodies of water in their country is indeed a tragic accident which caused 11 deaths, many injuries and will have deep, longlasting, debilitating and expensive repercussions. The people of this country need to know what happened and who is responsible. All that has transpired since April 20 says to me that not only BP, but no company that is drilling anywhere in our Outer Continental Shelf is prepared to deal with a spill at this depth. They are all there applying the best efforts, using the best available technology, and still 59 days later an end is not in sight. This is not acceptable. What has also become clear is that while BP repeatedly used shortcuts, they were warned not to, which may have turned out to have caused the explosion, the deaths, injuries and the devastating spill. They are not the only ones at fault. They could not have cut some of those corners without the complicity of employees at some of the responsible government agencies who did not do their job. We are all appalled that lives are lost by decisions made apparently in the interest of cutting costs, but also by the lack of adequate preparation for this worst-case scenario that we are facing today. The fact that the industry did not ensure that response technology kept pace with deeper drilled wells lays blame at all of their feet, but we still cannot ignore the decisions made by BP, which, if they had been different, 11 people might still be alive today. We as a Congress, along with our President, who has had more than his share of crises that are not of his making, have some major challenges and critical decisions ahead. I hope in the name of the 11 who died, the many more who were injured, the affected families, and those who now depend on OCS platforms for their livelihood that this and all of the hearings will help us to go beyond a knee-jerk reaction to do the right thing for the region and our country; that BP and any other responsible party will be held fully accountable and responsible; and that the petroleum and natural gas companies learn important lessons to ensure this does not happen again. I want to thank you, Mr. Hayward, for being here. I look forward to your full testimony and the answers to the questions we will ask on behalf of the people of the region and on behalf of the American people. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. Mr. Welch, opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Mr. Welch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, in the 59 days since the Deepwater Horizon explosion caused this extraordinary environmental catastrophe and economic catastrophe, we have heard time and again from BP that this was an aberration. The facts regrettably tell a very different story. In 2005, when BP's Texas City operation blew up, 15 workers lost their lives. In 2006, a BP oil pipeline in Texas ruptured and spilled 200,000 gallons of crude oil. In 2007, the year you became CEO, the BP Corporation settled a series of criminal charges--not civil charges, criminal charges--and paid $370 million in fines. And according to RiskMetrics, independent organization, BP has one of the worst health, environment and safety records of any company in the world. And in only 1 year, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, found more than 700 violations at BP's Texas City refinery, and BP paid a record $87 million in fines. An independent review panel charged BP with putting profits before safety, and earlier this year a BP refinery in Toledo was fined $3 million for willful safety violations, including the use of valves similar to those that contributed to the Texas City blast. And finally, of course, we have the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, and the more evidence that comes in, the more it's clear that that event was foreseeable, and it was avoidable. After the explosion, the BP said there was no oil leaking. Then it said there was 1,000 barrels a day leaking. Then it went to 5,000 barrels. We are now up to 60,000 barrels. For 59 days, Mr. Hayward, BP has told the American people that this was an aberration, that it was a singular occurrence, and that it wouldn't happen again. Mr. Hayward, it's not an aberration. For BP, regretfully, this is business as usual, it's deja vu again and again and again. And the question I think many of us have is whether a CEO who has presided over a company that has incurred $370 million in criminal fines; whose company, according to independent assessors, has one of the worst records in the world for safety and consistently puts money ahead of safety; whose peers, including Mr. Tillerson from Exxon Mobil, who testified from where you are 2 days ago they never--Exxon never would have drilled a well the way it did at BP Deepwater Horizon; and who, as CEO, has presided over the destruction of nearly $100 billion in shareholder value and the suspension of an annual $10 billion dividend; does that leader continue to enjoy and have a valid claim on the trust and confidence of his employees, his shareholders, the public regulators and, most importantly, the families and small businesses of the Gulf Coast, or is it time, frankly, for that CEO to consider to submit his resignation? I thank you and yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. Mr. Green for an opening statement, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, I appreciate your testimony and your being here this morning. And most people on this committee know I am a big supporter of Outer Continental Shelf drilling and domestic energy production. And I understand from your testimony and our other hearings we have held and meetings with the administration that efforts to cap the well are going as expeditiously as possible. However, like many of my colleagues here, I am frustrated. I am frustrated that it has been almost 2 months, and we still have thousands of barrels of crude oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. I am frustrated by the threat of this disaster's impact on our wildlife and coastline. And I am particularly frustrated this single incident, one well out of thousands of successful wells of this type have been drilled, is threatening my constituents' livelihoods and the livelihoods of most of the communities on the Gulf Coast, literally from Alabama all the way back to Brownsville, Texas. This disaster has caused the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico to shut down. Even if the moratorium does not last 6 months, it will be too late for many of these folks. But these people are not the ones to blame. They are the hardworking people with a work ethic like none other that take their responsibility on these rigs seriously. However, according to the investigation of this subcommittee has conducted, it's obvious that several BP officials on and off the Deepwater Horizon rig did not take their responsibility of this rig seriously. Halliburton and many others warned BP officials that the decisions they were making were bad ones that could lead to serious trouble. And now people were losing their jobs because of a moratorium on drilling that could have been prevented if BP had not chosen expediency over safety, which brings me to my next point. Whether it was the Alaskan pipeline disaster or the Texas City refinery fire where 15 people died, time after time it has been shown that BP chooses expediency over safety. Yet, Mr. Hayward, in your testimony you write that none of us knows why it happened. However, this subcommittee has uncovered five areas where BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time and expense. I added up the hours that these extra precautionary actions would have taken, and it comes to about 3 to 4 days. That's assuming that many of these actions would not have occurred simultaneously, which they know they could have. For an extra 3 days of work, men's lives would have been saved, and an industry record of safe and responsible production in the Outer Continental Shelf would still be in place, which brings me to my last point. In your testimony, Mr. Hayward, you say that this incident calls into question whether the oil and gas industry can explore for oil and gas in safer and more reliable ways and what the appropriate regulatory framework for the industry should be. Mr. Hayward, the decisions made by a handful of BP individuals called this into question, not this accident, and you should take the responsibility for the workers who did nothing wrong and are now losing their jobs. Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Green. Ms. Sutton for an opening statement, 3 minutes, please. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BETTY SUTTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Ms. Sutton. Thank you, Chairman Stupak. It's been nearly 2 months since the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig resulted in the deaths of 11 workers and injured additional workers. Since that time we have witnessed the worst environment disaster in our Nation's history, a disaster that continues to pour an estimated 60,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, a disaster that has led to over 66,000 victims filing claims to receive compensation. Through this subcommittee's work, several alarming decisions by BP have come to light, decisions that were made to save money and time. It's unconscionable when companies pay more attention to their costs and their profits than to their own workers' safety and to our environment. At our last hearing one witness from Transocean testified that a duplicate blowout preventer system cost roughly $15 million, a system not used on the Deepwater Horizon rig. BP also utilized a more risky option for steel tubing, saving at least $7 million. BP also did not fully circulate drilling mud or secure casing hangers between pipes of different diameters. And critical signals were brushed aside. When standard methods were not followed to center the steel pipe in the drill hole, one of BP's operations drilling engineers remarked in an e- mail, quote, ``Who cares? It's done. End of story.'' But these cut corners have been anything but the end of the story. As the workers and volunteers from around the country help clean up the oil from the disaster, many are becoming ill. Between April 22 and June 10, 485 of BP's own workers have been injured. The Louisiana Department of Health is reporting 109 illnesses in cleanup workers, and the money and time BP tried to save has long been lost as they have already paid $81 million in claims. Mr. Hayward, like many Americans, I feel physically sick when I see the clips of the oil gushing in the gulf, witnessing the devastation of our waters and our coast and the wildlife, thinking about the lives of the workers killed, and hearing and seeing the pain in the faces and the hearts of the people, the families, the small businesses, the fishermen and others in the gulf, all consequences of this catastrophe. This culture of carelessness and taking shortcuts to maximize profits at the expense of safety, this ``come what may, we will cross that bridge when we come to it'' attitude is unacceptable. It's outrageous. BP must be accountable for the consequences of that approach, and we must take actions necessary on behalf of the American people to make sure that such a reckless approach will be forever abandoned. The risks and costs to our environment and to the workers in the Gulf Coast, to the workers throughout our economy, are simply too great to allow otherwise. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Ms. Sutton. That concludes the opening statements of all members of our subcommittee. As I noted in the opening, as I noted in the opening, we have members of the full committee here. I would like to recognize them. They will be allowed to ask questions by order of seniority. Mr. Inslee is here, a member of the committee; Ms. Castor is here; Mr. Gonzalez; Mrs. Capps; Ms. Harman; Mr. Weiner; Mr. Melancon; and Mr. Scalise. I would like to comment that Mr. Melancon and Mr. Scalise are members of our committee. They also hosted us when we had a field hearing, the field hearing in New Orleans a few weeks ago, last week. And we had nine Members go down, one of the largest field hearings we have ever had. So you can see the interest in here. I should also note that Ms. Jackson Lee is with us, not a member of the committee. She will not be allowed to ask questions, but we welcome her, and I know she has sat in on previous hearings we have had. So let's move on with our first witness. Our first witness is Mr. Tony Hayward, who is the chief executive officer of BP PLC. Mr. Hayward, it's the policy of this subcommittee to take all testimony under oath. Please be advised that you have a right under the rules of the House to be advised by counsel during your testimony. Do you wish to be represented by legal counsel? Mr. Hayward. I do not. Mr. Stupak. OK. The committee also asks if you would have a technical person with you so you could consult if we have some questions that you want to run it by your technical person. Do you have a technical person with you? Mr. Hayward. I do. Mr. Stupak. Could you state his name and position for the record, please? Mr. Hayward. Mike Zangy, drilling engineer. Mr. Stupak. OK. At any time during the questioning, if you want to consult with that individual, please let us know. We will give you a moment to do so before you answer, but you would be the only one who could answer that question. Is that clear? Mr. Hayward, I am going to ask you to please rise, raise your right hand and take the oath. [Witness sworn.] Mr. Stupak. Let the record reflect the witness answered in the affirmative. Mr. Hayward, you are now under oath. We would like to hear an opening statement from you. You may submit a longer statement, if you will, for the record. But if you would, please, begin your opening statement, and let me state again, on behalf of all members of the committee, we appreciate your willingness to appear here today. STATEMENT OF TONY HAYWARD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BP PLC Mr. Hayward. Chairman Waxman, Chairman Stupak, Ranking Members Barton---- Mr. Stupak. If you will suspend, please, sir. [Disturbance in hearing room.] Mr. Stupak. Before we begin with Mr. Hayward, let me again just mention those of you in our audience, emotions run high on this issue, but we have a hearing to conduct here. We are going to conduct our hearing; it's going to be done with proper decorum. Mr. Hayward, when you are ready, we are going to start the clock over. You may begin. Mr. Hayward. Chairman Waxman, Chairman Stupak, Ranking Member Barton, Ranking Member Burgess, members of the committee, I am Tony Hayward, chief executive of BP. The explosion and fire of the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill resulting in the Gulf of Mexico---- Mr. Stupak. Excuse me, Mr. Hayward. Could I ask you to pull that up? Some of the Members are having trouble hearing, probably over the clicking of the cameras. But if you could just pull it a little closer. Thank you. Mr. Hayward. The explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened, and I am deeply sorry that it did. When I learned that 11 men had lost their lives, I was personally devastated. Three weeks ago I attended a memorial service for those men, and it was a shattering moment. I want to offer my sincere condolences to their friends and families. I can only begin to imagine their sorrow. I understand how serious this situation is. It is a tragedy. I want to speak directly to the people who live and work in the gulf region. I know that this incident has had a profound impact on your lives and caused great turmoil, and I deeply regret that. I also deeply regret the impact the spill has had on the environment, the wildlife, and the ecosystem of the gulf. I want to acknowledge the questions that you and the public are rightly asking. How could this happen? How damaging is the spill to the environment? Why is it taking so long to stop the flow of oil and gas into the gulf? We don't yet have all the answers to these important questions, but I hear and understand the concerns, frustrations and anger being voiced across the country, and I know that these sentiments will continue until the leak is stopped and until we prove through our actions that we are doing the right thing. Yesterday we met with the President of the United States and his senior advisers. We discussed how BP could be more constructive in the government's desire to bring more comfort and assurance to the people of the Gulf Coast beyond the activity we have already done. We agreed in that meeting to create a $20 billion claims fund to compensate the affected parties and pay for the costs to Federal, State and local governments of the cleanup and environmental mitigation. We said all along that we would pay these costs, and now the American people can be confident that our word is good. I have been to the Gulf Coast. I have met with fishermen, business owners and families. I understand what they are going through, and I promised them, as I am promising you, that we will make this right. After yesterday's announcement, I hope that they feel we are on the right track. I am here today because I have a responsibility to the American people to do my best to explain what BP has done, is doing, and will do in the future to respond to this terrible accident. First, we are doing everything we can to secure the well and in the meantime contain the flow of oil. We are currently drilling two relief wells. We believe they represent the ultimate solution. We expect this to be complete in August. Simultaneously we have been working on parallel strategies to minimize or stop the flow of oil. While not all of them have met with success, it appears that our latest containment effort is now containing about 20,000 barrels a day. By the end of June, we expect to have equipment in place to handle between 40- and 50,000 barrels a day, and, by mid-July, between 60- and 80,000 barrels a day. Second, I have been clear that we will pay all necessary cleanup costs. We have mounted what the Coast Guard has recognized as the largest spill response in history. We have been working hard on the leadership of the unified command to stop the oil from coming ashore, and while we are grateful these efforts have reduced the impact of the spill, any oil on the shore is deeply distressing. We will be vigilant in our cleanup. Third, as I have made clear from the beginning, we will pay all legitimate claims for losses and damages caused by the spill. Those are not just words. We have already paid out more than $95 million, and we have announced an independent claims facility headed by Ken Feinberg to ensure the process is as fair, transparent and rapid as possible. Fourth, we need to know what went wrong so that we as a company and we as an industry can do better. That is why, less than 24 hours after the accident, I commissioned a nonprivileged investigation. I did it because I wanted to know what happened, and I want to share the results. Right now it's simply too early to say what caused the incident. There is still extensive work to do. A full answer must await the outcome of multiple investigations, including the Marine Board. To sum up, I understand the seriousness of this situation and the concerns, frustrations and fears that have been and will continue to be voiced. I know that only actions and results, not mere words, ultimately can give you the confidence you seek. I give my pledge, as the leader of BP, that we will not rest until we make this right. We are a strong company, and no resources will be spared. We and the entire industry will learn from this terrible event and emerge stronger, smarter and safer. Thank you. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Hayward. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hayward follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.024 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.027 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.028 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.029 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.030 Mr. Stupak. One of the bad parts about conducting a hearing, we get interrupted every now and then by votes, and we have three votes pending right now. There's, I think, about 10 minutes remaining on this vote. I would suggest, instead of trying to get into questions, we take a break right now. Let's stand in recess for 30 minutes. Let's come back at noon and continue this hearing. We will start with questions from all the Members. OK. This committee will be in recess until 12 noon. [Recess.] Mr. Stupak. The committee will come back to order. When we left off, Mr. Hayward had finished his opening statement. We would begin with questions. I will begin. Mr. Hayward, when we heard about the explosion in the gulf, the immediate company that popped into my brain was BP, and that's because the last number of years from Texas City where people died and 170 people were injured; the North Slope, the problems we have had there; and BP's own 2007 report on the management accountability project in which it stated there was a culture that evolved over the years that seemed to ignore risk, tolerate noncompliance and accepted incompetence. So I wasn't surprised when we heard about the explosion in the gulf and BP was part of it. Since then this committee, the oversight and investigations committee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have methodically looked at this issue, and I know you have and your company has also. On May 12, we had a hearing in which we looked at a number of things that went wrong. On May 25, our committee, Chairman Waxman and myself, put out a memo. It was based on BP's preliminary report, and I am sure you are familiar with that report; are you not, sir? Mr. Hayward. I am. Mr. Stupak. And then on June 14, Chairman Waxman and I sent you a letter, 14 pages, where we talk about the crazy well and the nightmare well. Quite frankly, BP blew it. You cut corners to save money and time. And as the chief executive officer of BP, as I stated in my opening, you called for a leaner decisionmaking process. You called for fewer people in the decisionmaking process. You stated, individuals need to be accountable for risk and to manage risk. Therefore, BP's leadership managed their risk in this well. Did you manage the risk properly? Mr. Hayward. Since I have been the CEO of this company, I have focused on safe, reliable operations. I have set the tone from the top by making it very clear to everyone in BP that safe, reliable operations are our number one priority. Of course, this is about more than words. Safety is about three things. It's about plants, it's about people, it's about process. In the last 3 years, we have invested more than $14 billion in plant integrity. Mr. Stupak. But then what happened here? I mean, the June 14 letter we put out the other day went through five major areas. The head of--the CEOs of the oil companies who were before this committee Tuesday all said you did it wrong. They never would have done a well this way. You made decisions, whether to do a casing or the string with the tie-back, which everyone said the tie-back would have been safer; the lockdown sleeves; centralizers, instead of doing 21 as was recommended, you only do 6. That defies the safety emphasis; does it not? Mr. Hayward. We launched an investigation, which we have shared with yourself, Mr. Chairman, and all of your Members, which has identified seven areas. It's identified areas around cements, casing, integrity pressure measurements, well control procedures, and three areas around the blowout preventer which failed to operate. An investigation is ongoing. It's not complete. Mr. Stupak. Sure. But you are CEO of this company. You said you were here to answer the questions of the American people. You were an exploration manager, exploration manager with BP. You were the director of BP's exploration. You were vice president of BP's exploration and production. You hold a Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh. Based on our May 12 hearing, the May 25 memo, our June 14 letter to you, based on all those facts, are you trying to tell me you have not reached a conclusion that BP really cut corners here? Mr. Hayward. I think it's too early to reach conclusions, with respect, Mr. Chairman. The investigations are ongoing. They have identified seven key areas, and when they complete-- -- Mr. Stupak. Every one of those seven key areas, sir, dealt with saving time and saving money and accepting the risk. So if we use your own words, if you are going to hold BP accountable, then we have to manage the risk. Should leadership at BP be held accountable here? Mr. Hayward. There is no doubt that I have focused on safe, reliable operations. We have made major changes in everything we do over the last 3 years. We change people---- Mr. Stupak. What changes have you made since April 20 when the BP Deepwater Horizon exploded? What changes were made then? Mr. Hayward. Based on what we know so far, we have made changes with respect to the testing and evaluation of blowout preventers. We have made changes with respect to ensuring that people who are likely to be dealing with well control are up to date and fully validated for well-control procedures. And as we learn more about what happens here, we will continue to make changes. Mr. Stupak. My time is just about up. I am going to try to hold Members quickly to our time because we want to get through at least one more round. Let me just ask you this: The last 5 years I have been up here, your safety record, you have 26 people dead, more than 170 injured. You have the largest spill ever in Alaska, and you now have the largest environmental disaster to hit the United States with no end in sight with this disaster. Do you believe the U.S. Government should continue to allow companies that have poor safety records, poor environmental records, to explore minerals or oil exploration in our country? Should there be a ban on companies that have miserable safety and environmental records? Mr. Hayward. In the 3 years that I have been CEO, I have focused on improving dramatically our safety and environmental performance. At the price of this accident, that has indeed been the case, and that is why, amongst all the other reasons, I am so devastated by this accident. Mr. Stupak. I agree, and under your tenure, you said you had the 2007 report that was scathing of BP's culture. We still have problems with Alaska. You said you are going to hold people accountable. Who are we going to hold accountable here? Mr. Hayward. We have engaged in a systemic change at BP over the last 3 years. We have begun to change the culture. I am not denying that there isn't more to do, but we have made dramatic changes in the people we had in our organization, the skills and capabilities they have. We have invested heavily into that. We have changed significantly the processes that we use to manage our operations, and, most importantly perhaps, we have made safe, reliable operations the core of the company. It is the thing that I talk about every time I talk internally and every time I talk externally about BP. Mr. Stupak. In your opening statement you said as long as you were CEO of BP, these things would occur. Do you expect to be CEO of BP much longer? Mr. Hayward. At the moment I am focused on the response. I think everyone here believes that the highest priority is to stop the leak, continue on on the surface and clean it up. That is what my focus is. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Burgess for questions. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The highest priority is stopping the leak. Let me ask, Mr. Hayward, is your presence here today in any way interfering with that number one task of stopping the leak? Mr. Hayward. It is not. Mr. Burgess. Thank you. Let me just ask you--or let me just make a statement for clarification. I am not going to apologize for you. It was, after all, BP executives who were on that rig, BP executives who ultimately could have made the call to stop operations when things became unsafe, and ultimately you are the person at the top, and you are responsible. We lost 11 men on that rig. Transocean and other companies lost 11 men on that rig. I don't feel that apologies are in order. But, Mr. Chairman, I do have serious questions about the setup of this fund that we heard about from the White House yesterday. And I hope this committee will stay engaged in the oversight of that activity as well. It's still disturbing to me that we have not had anyone from the Federal regulatory side. We have brought a ton of other people in here and questioned them, but really we need Mr. Salazar here. We need whoever the minerals management people were who approved that exploration plan that BP submitted that was woefully inadequate. Shame on you, Mr. Hayward, for submitting it, but shame on us for accepting it with simply a rubber stamp. Now I have got some questions I do need to ask. BP, unfortunately, it's not the first time you have been in front of our committee. And in 2006, although you were not CEO that year, I pulled the transcript last night and looked through it again. The Big Oil spill in Alaska had to do with not proper maintenance on the pipelines. And when you came in, you said you were going to focus like a laser beam on safety, and certainly that had to be welcome news after Texas City, after the North Slope accident. So what safety briefings do you get as your office's chief executive officer, and who provides them to you? Mr. Hayward. The basis of management of safety performance is through something that we call our group operating risk committee. It's a committee that I set up, I chair. It involves the heads of all of the business streams, and we meet upon a bimonthly basis to review the safety performance across the company. That process is mirrored down through the company. Mr. Burgess. And what type of safety directives then, or what types of directives do you issue in terms of safety as a result of those meetings, and perhaps would you be willing to share some of that information with the committee as we go forward? Mr. Hayward. We can certainly share that information with the committee. They range from changes to procedures to requirements of--to have people where there are issues with safety to come and present to us. Mr. Burgess. But somebody records minutes during those meetings, and then your directives that come as a consequence of those briefings are written down and delivered to the appropriate managers on the ground? Mr. Hayward. There are minutes of those meetings. Mr. Burgess. I beg your pardon? Mr. Hayward. There are minutes of those meetings. Mr. Burgess. Let me ask you this. Mr. Stupak already alluded to the fact that should we allow someone who is perhaps not following the best practices, drilling practices, continue to drill. Is there any other well, to your knowledge, in the Gulf of Mexico that has been done in the same manner as this well that was drilled under the Deepwater Horizon? Mr. Hayward. There are many wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Burgess. Are there any other wells where you haven't put the proper number of centralizers in? Mr. Hayward. There are many wells in the Gulf of Mexico that have the same casing design. There are many wells that have been drilled where the same cement procedure has been---- Mr. Burgess. Now, have the Minerals Management Service people been there and looked over those with a fine-tooth comb? Mr. Hayward. Everything that we do is subject to regulatory oversight. Mr. Burgess. Are you changing your procedures of those wells as a result of things that you have encountered in your investigation---- Mr. Hayward. I apologize, sir. As we learn from our investigation, we will make appropriate changes, as I have already indicated. Mr. Burgess. Are there any of those changes that are ongoing right now? Mr. Hayward. The ones that I have talked about are ongoing. Mr. Burgess. Well, let me ask you this. Now, the question came up about centralizers, and someone said that they would rather push more cement or squeeze more cement than getting something stuck. I am not technically savvy enough to know exactly about that, but if that's the statement, and you are going to push cement and deal with a fewer number of centralizers to hold this thing steady in the center of the column, is there any way to find out that, in fact, that cement went where you intended it to do, and that rod didn't, in fact, get off to one side or the other? Mr. Hayward. I wasn't part of the decisionmaking process on this well. I have looked at the material---- Mr. Stupak. Yes. That's not the question I asked you. Was there a procedure that could have been followed that would have actually given that information? Mr. Hayward. I can't answer that question. I am not a cement engineer, I am afraid. Mr. Burgess. There is, and those people were available, and for whatever reason they decided not to do that. Do you think that might have made a difference in the ultimate story of the Deepwater Horizon? Mr. Hayward. I am not prepared to speculate on what may or may not have made a difference until such time as the multiple investigations that are ongoing are concluded. Mr. Burgess. Well, but prior to April 20, when the well blew up, were you briefed on the progress of the drilling of the Macondo well? Mr. Hayward. The only knowledge that I had of the Macondo well occurred in April when it was evident to the team drilling it that we had made a discovery, and they notified myself that we made a discovery. That was my only prior involvement in the well. Mr. Burgess. Who briefed you? Who briefed you on that discovery? Mr. Hayward. The person who would have briefed me would have been the chief executive of exploration and production. Mr. Burgess. Were you privy then to any other information, the difficulties that they had had the multiple gas kicks, the losing the tools down the hole, the length of time they have been over the hole, the decisions to move quickly because we had spent too much time over this well? Mr. Hayward. I had no prior knowledge. Mr. Burgess. Who would have had that information? Mr. Hayward. Certainly the drilling team in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Burgess. But you are the CEO of the company. Do you have any sort of technical expert who helps you with these things who might have been there? Mr. Hayward. With respect, sir, we drill hundreds of wells a year all over the world. Mr. Burgess. Yes, I know. That's what is scaring me right now. Did you have a technical expert who was advising you there on this well, because we have heard from other people that there were problems, it was a bad well, it was a dangerous well; gas kicks, and the mud was not degasified or whatever the procedure was. So did you have a technical expert advising you? Mr. Hayward. I had no prior knowledge or involvement in the drilling of this well, none whatsoever. Mr. Burgess. But who was? If you are the CEO of the company, if I were a shareholder of BP, which I am not, but if I am, how can I have comfort that the CEO knows what's going on as far as safety on the rigs, or is it true it's just all about profit? Mr. Hayward. There was a drilling team providing oversight of this well. Mr. Burgess. There was a drilling team. Mr. Stupak. We will go to Mr. Waxman. Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, when you became CEO 3 years ago, you said that safety was going to be your top priority; you would focus on it like a laser. Your Website said, safe and reliable operations are integral to BP's success. I want to ask you whether you think that BP met that commitment that you made when you became CEO? Mr. Hayward. Since I became CEO, we have made a lot of progress. We have made it very clear to everyone in the company that safe, reliable---- Mr. Waxman. Have you met that commitment that you made? Mr. Hayward. And we made major changes. We made major changes to our---- Mr. Waxman. You made major changes, but now we see this disaster in the gulf. Does that indicate that you didn't keep that commitment? Mr. Hayward. And one of the reasons that I am so distraught. Mr. Waxman. Could you answer yes or no? I don't want to know whether you are distraught. I want to know whether you think you have kept your commitment. Mr. Hayward. We have focused like a laser on safe and reliable operations, that is fact, every day. Mr. Waxman. OK. Well, let me follow up on that. We had a hearing earlier this week with CEOs from the other oil companies. They were unanimous in their view that you made risky decisions that their companies would not have made. And in particular they criticize your decision to install a long, single string of casing from the top of the well to the bottom on April 19, the day before the blowout. They said this well design choice provided an unrestricted pathway for gas to travel up the well in the annulus space that surrounded the casing, and, of course, it blew out the seal. How do you respond to their criticism? Did BP make a--a fundamental misjudgment in selecting a single string of casing? Mr. Hayward. I wasn't involved in any of that decisionmaking. Mr. Waxman. Well, I want to know your view of it, now that you know about it, now that you know what your company did. Pursuant to your laser request that they be attuned to safety, do you think that that was a mistake? Mr. Hayward. The original well design was to run a long string. It was approved by the MMS. There was only discussion in the course of the drilling of the well whether a long string or a 7-inch line that would be most appropriate. That is what I understand based on having looked at the documents and listened to our investigation team. The decision to run a long string, at least in part, was to do with the long-term integrity of well. Mr. Waxman. But let me be fair to you, because I am asking you to look with hindsight as to what happened and the decision that was made. But your own engineers warned in advance that this was a risky approach. And I would like to put on the screen what's called a planned review that your engineers prepared in mid- April warning against the long string of casing. As you can see, your engineers said that if you used a long string of casing, that it is unlikely to be a successful cement job. You would be unable to fulfill MMS regulations, and there would be an open annulus to the wellhead, and I have that on the screen. Now, those are serious risks, a failed cement job, a violation of MMS safety regulations, an open pathway for gas to travel to the top of the well. The same document says that if you use the liner and tie-back approach, which is what Exxon Mobil and other companies said you should have used, you would have avoided or lessened these risks, and here is what the plan review said: If you used the liner, there would be less issue with landing it shallow. There would be a second barrier to gas in the annulus and a higher chance for a successful cement job. Now, you said that BP is supposed to be focused like a laser on safety. Yet BP apparently overruled the warnings of its own engineers and chose the more dangerous option. How can you explain that decision by BP? Why were the safety recommendations of your own engineers ignored? Mr. Hayward. I wasn't involved in any of the decisionmaking. It's clear that there was some discussion amongst the engineering team, and an engineering judgment was taken. Mr. Waxman. It's clear to me that you don't want to answer our questions, because isn't it true that you have served your life in BP? You have only recently become the CEO, but haven't you been in this business most of your professional life? Mr. Hayward. I have been in this business 28 years. Mr. Waxman. Twenty-eight years. So you should have some knowledge about these issues. And I sent you a letter in advance asking you--we were going to be asking these questions and to be prepared to answer it. How can you explain this decision where you ignore--not you, yourself, but people who work for you who should have known that it was your directive to be a laser on safety. How could they have ignored these warnings from people right within your company? Mr. Hayward. There was clearly a discussion between the engineering team as to what was the most appropriate course of action to take. An engineering judgment was taken that involved long-term integrity---- Mr. Waxman. It was more than an engineering judgment, because April 15th there is a document, which is 5 days before the blowout, that said that using the safer liner will add an additional 7- to $10 million to the completion cost. The same document calls it the single string of casing, the best economic case for BP. And the conclusion I draw from these documents is that BP used a more dangerous well design to save $7 million. What do you think about that? What is your response? Mr. Hayward. I believe that document also highlights that the long-term integrity of the well will be best served by a long string. The long string is not an unusual well design in the Gulf of Mexico. As I understand it---- Mr. Waxman. Say that again. Mr. Hayward. The long string is not an unusual design in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Waxman. As I understand it from Halliburton's witness that was interviewed by our staff, that only 2 to 10 percent of those wells might use this particular string. Now, ExxonMobil and other CEOs said they wouldn't proceed this way. It appears to me that BP knowingly risked well failure to save a few million dollars. And even drilling 18,000 feet below the sea, if you make mistakes, the consequences of those would be catastrophic and, in fact, it turned out to be catastrophic. Don't you feel any sense of responsibility for these decisions? Mr. Hayward. I feel a great sense of responsibility for the accident. We need to allow---- Mr. Waxman. How about for the decisions that made the accident more likely? Mr. Hayward. We need to determine what were the critical decisions and---- Mr. Waxman. Did you get my letter and did you review it? Mr. Hayward. I have read your letter, Chairman. Mr. Waxman. Do you realize in the letter that we asked you to be prepared to discuss these issues? Mr. Hayward. As I said, I have seen the documents following your letter, and I cannot pass judgment on those decisions. Mr. Waxman. Even though you have worked 28 years in the oil industry, you are the BP CEO, and you said like a laser you are going to--safety is the biggest issue and you have people under you making these kinds of decisions and now you are reviewing them. Do you disagree with the conclusion that this was riskier to use this particular well lining? Mr. Hayward. I am not prepared to draw conclusions about this accident until such time as the investigation is concluded. Mr. Waxman. This is an investigation. That is what this committee is doing. It is an investigatory committee. And we expect you to cooperate with us. Are you failing to cooperate with other investigators as well? Because they are going to have a hard time reaching conclusions if you stonewall them, which is what we seem to be getting today. Mr. Hayward. I am not stonewalling. I simply was not involved in the decisionmaking process. I have looked at the documents. And until the investigations are complete, both yours and others---- Mr. Waxman. That is somebody else's conclusion. What is your conclusion? Mr. Hayward. I haven't drawn a conclusion, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Waxman. I see. My time has expired and I am just amazed at this testimony, Mr. Hayward. You are not taking responsibility. You are kicking the can down the road and acting as if you had nothing to do with this company and nothing to do with its decisions. I find that irresponsible. Mr. Stupak. Along those lines, do you disagree with the conclusions of Chairman Waxman's June 14th letter, the one Mr. Chairman and I sent you? Do you disagree with those five conclusions, five areas we hit, the conclusions we reached? Do you disagree with it? Mr. Hayward. I think there are very legitimate issues for concern, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. They are very what? Mr. Hayward. Legitimate areas for concern. Mr. Stupak. So we reached legitimate conclusions that people could then base the decision, cut corners to save money and we had this accident, correct? Mr. Waxman. It doesn't appear you are very concerned about them, are you? Mr. Hayward. I am very concerned that we get to the bottom of this incident and understand exactly what happens such that we can be sure that it never happens again. Mr. Waxman. Easy to say. Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. Chairman, just a request, please. If Mr. Hayward could move the microphone a bit closer. I am having difficulty hearing. Mr. Stupak. Right. I think we all are. Pull it a little closer if you could, please. Mr. Sullivan for questions, please. I should note Mr. Upton is here from Michigan, a member of the full committee and so is Mr. Engle. They want to ask questions, they can at the appropriate time. Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, there is mounting evidence that BP is one of the worst--has one of the worst safety records of any major oil company operating in the United States. Is there a deficient safety culture at BP that led to the Deepwater Horizon and other disasters like the refinery explosion in Texas City, Texas, and the Alaskan oil pipeline spill? Mr. Hayward. I think we acknowledged in 2005 and 2006 that we had serious issues, and as a consequence set out to implement systematic change in the culture and safety of BP. I set the tone from the top by saying very clearly, safe, reliable operations were our number one priority. We have invested billions of dollars in the integrity of that plant. We have recruited many thousands of engineers and technologists into our company, including many from other industries such as the nuclear industry and other parts of the chemical and oil and gas industry, and we have changed fundamentally our whole approach to the management of our operations through the implementation of significant changes to our processes. Mr. Sullivan. It doesn't seem like that. If you look at the reports of what happened on the Deep Horizon, it doesn't look like many safety procedures have changed much at all. And, Mr. Hayward, do you feel that your safety record compared to other major oil companies is comparable? Mr. Hayward. As I said, it is clear that we had some serious issues to deal with in the 2005-2006 time frame and we have worked hard to improve our safety performance since that time for it. Mr. Sullivan. It doesn't seem to be changing Mr. Hayward; your safety performance doesn't. Here are some highlights of your safety procedures. BP had 760 safety violations and you paid millions of dollars, 373 million in fines to avoid criminal prosecution for manipulating the propane markets. Also, if you look at other industries, sir--let us take some of your competitors, for example. Sunoco--you had 760 violations in 5 years. Sunoco had 8 safety violations. ConocoPhillips had 8 safety violations in the same time you had 760. Citgo had 2 safety violations at the same time you had 760. And ExxonMobil had 1 safety violation in the same time period you had 760. How in the heck do you explain that? Mr. Hayward. As I said, we acknowledged the problems we had in 2005 and 2006. The vast number of those things that you refer to date from that time period and we have made major changes in the company over the last 3 to 4 years. Mr. Sullivan. Do you think the changes you made in that time period you are talking about when you were CEO--I understand why you are saying that--do you think that they were using those measures and protocols on the Deepwater Horizon? Mr. Hayward. To my best knowledge, they absolutely were. Mr. Sullivan. You don't think they short-cut anything on the Deepwater Horizon? You are CEO of a major company. Do you, in fact, looking back, sir, do you think that they cut corners? Mr. Hayward. I believe we should await the results of the investigations before we draw conclusions. Mr. Sullivan. Sir, you had to have looked at some of the results--your internal investigation. Internally, your investigation, did it show any kind of breakdown, something that you--with your protocols you said you put in place, were any of those short-cut? Mr. Hayward. The investigation is still ongoing as you know. It has identified seven areas: the cement casing, the integrity pressure well control procedures, and three failures of the blowout preventer. And when the investigation is concluded we will make a judgment. Mr. Sullivan. I would say that this problem is with your organization and your safety and the culture of your company's safety culture, and not a culture of our domestic oil and gas producers. As we can see, they haven't had the kind of problems you have had with cutting corners on safety. They have a lot of redundancies, contingency plans. I venture to say that this may not have happened if one of these other companies was operating that rig. Would you say that would be true? Mr. Hayward. I don't think I can make that judgment. Mr. Sullivan. Do you think the other companies have different or stricter or--stricter guidelines with their safety and spend more money on it? Because you probably compare yourselves to other companies, I am sure. Mr. Hayward. I cannot make that comparison, but I can clear what we have done. We have invested billions of dollars, we have recruited thousands of people, and we have changed significantly our process, systems, and procedures in the course of the last 3 years. Mr. Sullivan. Well, thank you. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. Before Mr. Dingell begins questions, we have votes on the floor again. There is less than 10 minutes remaining. So I am going to at least get through Mr. Dingell's questions and then we will recess. Mr. Dingell. Mr. Dingell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, you had two choices, using single casing or tieback. The risks are substantial associated with single casing, which is what BP chose. Please answer yes or no. Can you assure us, under oath, that that was not a decision made to save time and money? Mr. Hayward. I wasn't part of that decisionmaking process. I was not part of that decisionmaking process. So I cannot possibly know the basis on which that decision was taken. Mr. Dingell. How much money was saved by using the single stream casing? Mr. Hayward. I believe the documents refer to a sum of I think, I think 7- to $10 million, and they also refer to the fact that the casing would have longer-term integrity as a long stream. Mr. Dingell. Please submit that for the record. How much time was saved? Mr. Hayward. I don't recall the time that was saved. Would there have been some time saved? Mr. Dingell. Would you submit that for the record, please? Now, you had the option of using a number of centralizers to keep the casing in the center of the bore hole. Halliburton recommended 21. You ultimately chose to use 2. Could you tell us under oath that the decision to use 6 centralizers instead of the recommended 21 was not made to save time and money? Mr. Hayward. I was not involved in that decision, so it is impossible for me to answer that question. Mr. Dingell. All right. Could you tell us how much money BP saved by not using the proper number of centralizers? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I cannot recall that. Mr. Dingell. Would you submit that for the record? How much time was saved? Mr. Hayward. I don't recall that either, I am afraid. Mr. Dingell. Please submit that for the record. You and BP decided not to conduct a cement bond log, an acoustic test to find out whether the cement was bonded to the casing and surrounding formations. Despite Mineral Management Service regulations, can you state under oath to the committee that BP did not decide to--against using the cement bond log to save time and money, yes or no? Mr. Hayward. My understanding from what I have read--again I was not involved in the decisionmaking--is that the team on the rig, the transition team, the BP team and the Halliburton team, concluded that they had sufficient evidence that the cement job was good and therefore decided not to use the cement bond log. Mr. Dingell. Does that mean yes or no? Mr. Hayward. It means I cannot answer your question in that form. Mr. Dingell. How much would this test have cost BP? Mr. Hayward. I cannot recall that number, I am afraid. Mr. Dingell. Please submit it for the record. How long would the test have taken? Mr. Hayward. Probably a number of hours, I believe; but I am not certain. Mr. Dingell. Please submit that for the record. You were supposed to engage in circulating drilling mud on the well bottom when the casing is on the bottom and before cementing. This is referred to as ``bottoms up.'' Did BP fully circulate the mud, yes or no? Mr. Hayward. I don't believe the mud was fully circulated. The process that the team on the rig were following was in line and approved by the MMS. Mr. Dingell. Thank you. Can you assure us, under oath again, that the decision not to fully circulate the mud was not made to save money and time? Mr. Hayward. I cannot answer that question because I wasn't there. Mr. Dingell. Thank you. How much money did avoiding this procedure save? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I cannot recall. Mr. Dingell. Would you submit it for the record, please? How long would the fully circulating of the mud have taken? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I cannot recall that either. Mr. Dingell. Would you submit that for the record, please? Now, BP made the decision not to install a casing hanger lockdown sleeve. Can you assure the committee under oath that the decision not to install such lockdown sleeve was not made to save time and money? Mr. Hayward. That was a decision I was not a party to. Mr. Dingell. How much did the installing of the lockdown sleeve save BP? Mr. Hayward. I don't know. Mr. Dingell. How much time did installing the lockdown sleeve save? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I don't know that either. Mr. Dingell. Now, you have received a letter from the chairman of the subcommittee and the full committee asking a series of questions. When will the committee have the response to that letter? Mr. Hayward. You will get it as soon as we can make it available to you. Mr. Dingell. Now, did BP have an emergency response plan in the event of a failure at the well? Mr. Hayward. We had a response plan which we have---- Mr. Dingell. What was the date of that response plan? Mr. Hayward. The response plan was approved, as I recall, in June of 2009. Mr. Dingell. Please submit to us the date of the response plan and the number of times which it was updated and who it was that did the formulation of the plan. Please inform us for the record whether or not that plan was approved by the Mineral Management Service and on what date? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to seeing those answers in the record. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Dingell. To let members know, we are going to stand in recess for 1 hour. We have six votes plus a motion to recommit. The good news is when we come back--these are the last votes of the day--we will be able to finish the hearing then. Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Hayward has brought up a point about he followed the procedures of MMS. Once again it is so critical that we get the Federal regulatory agencies in this committee to ask them questions. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Burgess, as you know---- Mr. Burgess. The fact that we haven't here, after all these hearings, is really disturbing to me. Mr. Stupak. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Burgess. As you know, we have a methodical method we have been using in this investigation. We have gone through it very methodically. You know we have at least two more hearings. One was scheduled for Tuesday, but at your request and my request we moved it back a little more. There will be at least two more hearings. We will do our job. We will have all parties here before this committee at the appropriate time. Mr. Burgess. Clearly, Mr. Hayward is not prepared to answer the questions and we need to get MMS in here to do that as well. Mr. Stupak. MMS isn't going to help Mr. Hayward answer the questions. Mr. Hayward has to answer the questions himself. Mr. Burgess. I would just submit that with the depth---- Mr. Stupak. We are in recess until 2 o'clock. Mr. Burgess. Any one of us could do his job. [Recess.] Mr. Stupak. The committee will reconvene. Mr. Hayward, during the last series of votes, I was approached by several members of the committee who are extremely frustrated with your lack of candor and your inability to answer their questions. We initially wanted to have this hearing last week. However, your staff pleaded with the committee to give you an additional week so you could be adequately prepared for this hearing and we agreed. In addition to the extra week, we allowed you to prepare, Chairman Waxman and I sent you a 14-page letter outlining five issues you should be prepared to address in today's hearing. You did not address any of those issues in your opening statement. And thus far, you have responded to our questions with little substance and many claims of not knowing or not being part of the decisionmaking processes. You first accepted responsibility for actions to your staff in town hall meetings, and yet you have not yet provided us with direct answers or taken responsibility thus far today. I sincerely hope that you will reconsider your approach to these questions. I hope you will be more forthcoming and less evasive with your answers for the remainder of this hearing. We are done with votes, so we should be able to get through the rest of this hearing; and we will probably go a second round because members do want to push you on some of these issues. You are the CEO. Great experience. You have got a Ph.D. You have been head of exploration. You know what is going on. We would hope that we would have more candid responses to our questions. With that, let me turn it to Mrs. Blackburn for questions. Five minutes, please. Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And indeed, Mr. Hayward, we are a little bit frustrated with hearing you say you were not a party to certain decisions or were not in that chain of command or that you can't comment because of ongoing investigations. So I am going to try a little different tactic because I do want to get some answers and get some items--get some of these questions answered. I want to go back to the safety issues. I mentioned that in my opening statement to you. I am one of those individuals that grew up down on the Gulf Coast and then moved away. I am familiar with people working offshore, if you will. And what I would like to know from you, have you been briefed on the safety issues and the safety concerns; and then if you were a part of the decisionmaking process on what would be considered the best operating practices, were you a part of the chain of command, and what is the chain of command for dispute resolution when there is a difference about how to approach safety? Go ahead. I would love your response. Mr. Hayward. As I have said, I wasn't involved in the decisionmaking on the day---- Mrs. Blackburn. Let us do this, then. If you were not involved in the decisionmaking of how safety is approached on these rigs and platforms, would you submit to us in writing for the record a description of what that chain of command is and what the process is when there is a difference of opinion on how you approach rig safety? Would you be willing to submit that? And I will ask you and your team to submit that to us for the record. In addition, since becoming CEO, have you been briefed on the significant safety incidents that have occurred in BP's explorations, Alaska and production facilities over the past year? Have you been briefed? Mr. Hayward. I had discussed those issues at the group operating risk committee. Mrs. Blackburn. As a result of these briefings, did you authorize any changes to BP policies and practices for dealing with the safety? Mr. Hayward. We took actions in Alaska to change both the organization and some of the processes. Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you. Since the Deepwater Horizon incident, have you made changes? And what are those? Will you submit those to us for the record? Mr. Hayward. We have made changes to our testing procedures on BOPs. We have made changes to the intensity with which well- site leaders are aware of well control procedures and a variety of other interventions that are predicated on what we have learned from the incident so far. And as we learn more, we will make more changes as we deem appropriate. And I would be very happy to submit to you, Congresswoman, the changes that we have made. Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you. Did you ask other companies for help in cleaning up the BP oil spill? Last week for the hearing, we had several different companies. Did you all approach other companies or other countries and ask for their help and their expertise in plugging that leak and in participating in the cleanup? Mr. Hayward. We sought help from both our immediate peers and competitors in the Gulf of Mexico, and globally from around the world and across America. There are several hundred entities involved in the effort. All of the major operators in this country, major operators from elsewhere in the world such as Petrobras, many of them major academic institutions in this country. Some of the greatest minds in the country are involved in trying to deal with this problem. Mrs. Blackburn. Did they participate at your invitation or the government's invitation? Mr. Hayward. They participated, in the first instance, at our invitation; and subsequently the Federal authorities brought some of the great academic institutions in this country to bear. Mrs. Blackburn. Are you currently--is BP currently working on industry efforts to look at rig safety? Mr. Hayward. We have made recommendations to the MMS with respect to the things that we have learned so far, particularly with respect to blowout preventers. And we will continue, as we learn what the realities of this accident are, to make our recommendations to the relevant authorities. And I believe that in the course of the coming months, the industry will work together to determine what is the best way forward. Mrs. Blackburn. We hope that you are working together because I hope you understand our frustration. You have stated before safety would be a priority for BP. And we expect you all to take action on lessons learned. And when you tell us that you are taking that action and then you return because of what has occurred, Mr. Hayward, I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointing it is to us that you are saying--and you mentioned actions and words in your testimony. But, sir, you are giving the rhetoric. What we want to see going forward is the action that indeed you have learned these lessons, that BP has learned these lessons and that you are going to share these best practices with the industry. That would be very helpful. Thank you for being before us today. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. I thank the gentlelady. Mr. Hayward, you indicated that you made recommendations on the blowout preventer your company has. Would you provide those to this committee? Mr. Hayward. We certainly can, Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Next I will turn to Mr. Markey for questions, please. Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, the existence of large clouds or plumes of oil suspended deep beneath the ocean surface are of concern because the toxic oil and dispersants can poison the aquatic plants and animals, and they also consume oxygen, potentially asphyxiating marine life. On May 30th, you stated that your samples showed no evidence of such plumes. On June 7th in a response to my letter, BP again denied the plumes existed, citing a BP document saying that there is no coherent body of hydrocarbons below the surface. Even after NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco confirmed the plumes' existence on June 8th, your COO, Jeff Suttles, went on national television and continued to deny their existence. These are photographs presented to us on the committee by Dr. Samantha Joy of the University of Georgia, who has sampled the deep water of the gulf and found such plumes. On the right there is a filter with oil clearly present from water from within a plume as it passed by. Now, it isn't just university scientist data. I have here up on the screen as well from EPA's Web site entitled, ``Subsurface Plume Detected.'' It was prepared using BP's data. There are 17 red dots indicating that your own data shows evidence of subsurface plumes. This is your data, Mr. Hayward. Are you now once and for all prepared to concede that there are plumes or clouds of oil suspended deep beneath the surface of the ocean? Yes or no, Mr. Hayward. Mr. Hayward. As I understand the data, Chairman, it indicates that there are--there is oil in very low concentrations, 0.5 parts per million distributed through the column. The detailed analysis that NOAA conducted in three locations around the spill show that in one location, 0.5 parts per million, clearly attributed to this spill. Mr. Markey. Are there plumes of oil beneath the ocean's surface? Mr. Hayward. There are concentrations of oil about 0.5 parts per million in the water column. Some of it is related to this spill. Other samples from been typed to other oil. Mr. Markey. So you do not define that as a plume? Mr. Hayward. I am not an oceanographic scientist. What we know is that there is---- Mr. Markey. I am going to take it as a continuing ``no'' from you. And your testimony continues to be at odds against all independent scientists. Yesterday at the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, during the hearing the director of the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety told me in answer to my question that he has asked BP for a roster of all workers multiple times and BP has failed to give him that information that is critical to tracking chemical exposure. Representative Eshoo and I were both outraged at BP's failure to take such a straightforward step to protect the health of their workers. Mr. Hayward, will you commit to immediately provide the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety and the Centers for Disease Control with all of the information that they need to evaluate health impacts and to protect these workers? Mr. Hayward. We have endeavored to provide all information requests as quickly as possible, and we will endeavor to do that as well. Mr. Markey. The head of the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety testified yesterday that you are not doing that. Will you provide all of the information that they have requested of you? Mr. Hayward. We are endeavoring to provide all of the information requested that we receive, and we will certainly do it for that one. Mr. Markey. Again, the equivocation in your answer is something that is not reassuring to those workers who potentially have been exposed to these chemicals in ways that can impact on their health. BP has dumped 30,000 gallons of drilling mud in the ocean. Drilling mud is often made using synthetic oils and other chemicals, and in this case also may have used significant quantities of antifreeze which is toxic. Mr. Hayward, will you commit to disclosing the ingredients of the drilling mud? Mr. Hayward. Yes, we will. I believe that all of the mud that has gone into the ocean is water-based mud with no toxicity whatsoever. Mr. Markey. Will you also commit to disclosing all other measurements you have made related to chemical, oil, and methane concentrations in the water immediately? Mr. Hayward. Those are being published, as we make them, on a variety of Web sites. And we will continue to do that. And we will make them available in whatever form is available to all of you. Mr. Markey. And you will give us all of the measurements which you have made? Mr. Hayward. All the measurements we have made have been made available and we will continue to do that. Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. Mr. Gingrey for questions, please. Mr. Gingrey. Mr. Hayward, as demonstrated by the number of cameras in this room, interest in this hearing is at a fever pitch. The anger at BP and the anger at our administration is palpable. You just look at the polls. And we members of this committee have an obligation to get to the bottom of this to address the frustrations of the American people. The chief executive of ExxonMobil testified just yesterday at the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of this committee that, quote, We would not have drilled the well the way they did, end of quote. In addition, the president of Shell, John S. Watson, stated, and I quote, It is not a well that we would have drilled in that mechanical setup and there are operational concerns, end of quote. Mr. Hayward, my profession before Congress was the practice of medicine, obstetrics and gynecology. If I had delivered a baby that resulted in a bad outcome, a seriously bad outcome, and two of my friendly competitors, well-respected peers, said that Dr. Gingrey in this instance practiced below the standard of care, I would be in a serious world of hurt. Reflecting on the fact that two of your major competitors admitted that BP drilled the Macondo well in a nonstandard way, in retrospect what is your opinion of BP's design plan for the Macondo well? Mr. Hayward. As I tried to explain, there are clearly some issues that our investigation has identified. And when the investigation is complete, we will draw the right conclusions. Mr. Gingrey. With all due respect, you have had 59 days and you are not exactly moving with fever pitch here. Do you believe BP was drilling the well following the best safety practices you were focused on reinvigorating when you were promoted to the position of CEO a couple of years ago? Mr. Hayward. I have no reason to conclude that wasn't the case. If I found at any point that anyone in BP put cost ahead of safety, I would take action. Mr. Gingrey. Do you believe that the decisions made regarding Deepwater Horizon on and leading up to April the 20th, such as a decision to use only 6 centralizers instead of 21, the decision to not run a cement bond log, do you believe those decisions reflect the normal decision making process at BP, or would you characterize those decisions as an exception to normal operating procedures? Mr. Hayward. There is nothing I have seen in the evidence so far that suggests that anyone put costs ahead of safety. If there are, then we will take action. Mr. Gingrey. Let me put it this way, Mr. Hayward, in the remaining time that I have left. If you had been physically present on that rig, along with the 11 men that were killed, would you have made the same decisions as were made? Would you have approved the decision to use only 6 centimeters, despite the recommendation to use 21? Would you have made the decision to not run a cement bond log if you had been standing on that Deepwater Horizon rig? Mr. Hayward. I am not the drilling engineer, so I am not actually qualified to make those judgments. Better people than I were involved in those decisions in terms of the judgments that were taken. And if our investigation determines that at any time people put costs ahead of safety, then we will take action. Mr. Gingrey. With all due respect, Mr. Hayward, I think you are copping out. You are the captain of the ship, and it has been said by members on both sides of the aisle of this committee, we had a President once that said, the buck stops on my desk, a very distinguished President. And I think the buck stops on your desk. And we are just not getting, I don't think, the answers from you that need to be presented to this committee in a forthright manner. It is a little frustrating for all of us and it seems like your testimony has been way too evasive. Mr. Chairman, I will yield back at this time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Gingrey. Mr. Braley for questions, please. Mr. Braley. I want to follow up on my friend from Oklahoma's questions about the culture of safety at BP, Mr. Hayward, because you have stated repeatedly since you took over as CEO of BP, that safe reliable operations are a number one priority, correct? Mr. Hayward. That is correct. Mr. Braley. And you have been CEO for the past 3 years, correct? Mr. Hayward. Correct. Mr. Braley. Then explain to us why between June of 2007 and February of 2010, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration checked 55 oil refineries operating in the U.S.; 2 of those 55 are owned by BP, and BP's refineries racked up 760 citations for egregiously willful safety violations accounting for 97 percent of the worst and most serious violations that OSHA monitors in the workplace. That doesn't sound like a culture of safety. Mr. Hayward. We acknowledge we had very serious issues in 2005 and 2006. Mr. Braley. I am not talking about 2005 and 2006. I'm citing from an OSHA study between June of 2007, on your watch, and February of 2010 where OSHA said BP has a systemic safety problem. And of those 760 that were classified as egregious and willful, it is important to note that that is the worst violation that OSHA can identify. And their definition is a violation committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health; 97 percent of all of those egregious violations at U.S. refineries on your watch were against your company. That doesn't sound like a company that, to use your words, is committed to safe, reliable operations as your number one priority. There is a complete disconnect between your testimony and the reality of these OSHA findings; do you understand that? Mr. Hayward. I understand what you are saying. Mr. Braley. So we also had Mr. Barton earlier make this comment about what happened at the White House yesterday. Were you there for that conference with the White House? Mr. Hayward. I was. Mr. Braley. Do you think that BP was shaken down by the Obama administration to come up with this $20 billion compensation fund? Mr. Hayward. We attended the White House at the invitation of the government to form a way forward and try and work together to deal with the leak, the response to the leak, and to make a return of the Gulf Coast to its past. And that is what we are going to do. Mr. Braley. I realize that we speak the same language, but it is not always the same language when we speak English in the United States and English in Great Britain. So I want to make sure I am clear on this. Here in this country, the word ``shaken down'' means somebody in a position of disadvantage is forced to do something against their will. Is that how you viewed these negotiations at the White House yesterday? Mr. Hayward. As I said, we came together to figure out a way of working together to resolve what is clearly a very, very serious situation. Mr. Braley. And the reason you came together, sir, is because it was not only in the best interest of the United States taxpayers and the citizens of this country, it is also in the best interest of BP to try to get this problem solved so that it can move forward; isn't that true? Mr. Hayward. It is undoubtedly true. We would like to resolve this issue, as would everyone else. Mr. Braley. When the ranking member referred to this compensation fund--which I applaud as a positive step forward-- as a slush fund, I want you to know that in this country that implies a very negative connotation as something illegal, below the surface of what is acceptable. Did you consider this compensation fund for people who had lost their lives, lost their businesses, lost their environment, lost their ability to--did you consider that to be a slush fund? Mr. Hayward. As we said yesterday, the fund is a signal of our commitment to do right; to ensure that individuals, fishermen, charter boat captain, small hotel owner, everyone who has been impacted by this is kept whole. That is what I have said from the very beginning of this and that is what we intend to do. And as I said in my testimony, I hope people will now take--see that we are good for our word. Mr. Braley. Can we take that as a ``no'' in response to my question, sir, that you did not consider this to be a slush fund? Mr. Hayward. I certainly didn't think it was a slush fund, Congressman. Mr. Braley. Thank you. I will yield back. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Latta for questions, 5 minutes. Mr. Latta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being with us, Mr. Hayward. Earlier in the morning, our ranking member, Mr. Burgess, had asked a question and you responded by--if I wrote it down here correctly, that everything we do is subject to regulatory oversight. And who is that when we are talking about regulatory oversight? Mr. Hayward. The regulatory oversight of the deepwater drilling operations is the Minerals Management Service. Mr. Latta. But here in the Federal Government, who would be out on the rig for that oversight? Mr. Hayward. It is the inspectors of the Mineral Management Service, I believe. Mr. Latta. I am sure there are records out there. When was the last time that the MMS would have been on the rig? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I am not aware of that date. But I imagine it was relatively shortly before the incident. Mr. Latta. Do you know of any citations that were issued during the time they were on the rig? Mr. Hayward. I am not aware of any citations, no. Mr. Latta. Let me ask this question. I know I have talked to quite a few Members from the Gulf Coast and also from these reports, and there have been many, many cases out there where they are talking about it takes almost 5 days for a turnaround time and once it starts--I came from local government. So the chain of command out there for local government, the State Government and depending what is the chain is out there, but they are saying over and over and over it takes about 5 days. A lot of times they say they have to go talk to BP. And I was just wondering--because knowing that time is of the essence out there because of all of these critical matters that are happening, why is this, that they say they have to go ask BP and this turnaround time takes so long? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I cannot answer that question. I don't know. Mr. Latta. Could you get that information for us? Mr. Hayward. We can, yes, sir. Mr. Latta. I guess the next question, you will probably have the same response. The question is: Who set the procedure up this way that we would have a situation where it would take a 5-day turnaround time? Do you have any knowledge of that? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I don't know. Mr. Latta. After the disaster occurred, have you had direct contact with the White House, and do you have a direct person at the White House that you have been dealing with when problems arise that you can get things turned around quickly? Mr. Hayward. My primary contact through all of this has been with Admiral Thad Allen who is the National Incident Commander. And he and I talk on a very regular basis. Mr. Latta. When you say ``on a very regular basis,'' how often would that be? Mr. Hayward. Typically once a day, often more than once a day. Mr. Latta. Again, as the lady from Tennessee, we have a kind of frustration level on getting some responses. But with that, Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Latta. Ms. DeGette for 8 minutes, please. Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, in your initial testimony, you testified that BP has drilled hundreds of wells around the world. How many of them are deepwater wells? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the precise number, but we drill a lot of deepwater wells in various parts of the world. Ms. DeGette. OK. You don't know how many. Do you think that BP wells--irrespective of where they are drilled--should be drilled to the highest industry standards? Mr. Hayward. I believe that is what we try to do. Ms. DeGette. So your answer would be yes? Mr. Hayward. Uh-huh. Ms. DeGette. As this well was being drilled, were you informed as CEO of the company, of the progress of the well? Mr. Hayward. I was not. Ms. DeGette. You were not. Before I continue, I know you had difficulty answering some of the technical questions members have asked you, so I know you brought a technical expert with you, Mr. Zanghi. Would you like us to swear him in so he can help you answer some of my technical questions? Mr. Hayward. I think that depends on the question. Ms. DeGette. Let's see how it goes. Mr. Hayward, you said that you received the chairman's June 14th letter to you which talked about five decisions that compromised the safety of this well: well design, centralizer, cement bond log, mud circulation and lockdown sleeve. I want to ask you in my question about one of those issues and that is the cement bond log. First thing I want you to do, if you can take that notebook that is to your left, open it up. In the front flap there is a memo which was written from Brian Morel to Richard Miller on Wednesday, April 14th. And that memo says, This has been an nightmare well, which has everyone all over the place. Did anybody inform you as CEO of the country--company--in April of this year that this was a nightmare well? Mr. Hayward. They did not. Ms. DeGette. Did you consequently see this memo? Have you seen this memo? Mr. Hayward. I saw this memo when it was raised by your committee. Ms. DeGette. And that is the first you ever heard of it? Mr. Hayward. That is the first time---- Ms. DeGette. Is that the first you ever heard it of being a nightmare well? Mr. Hayward. When I first saw this---- Ms. DeGette. Now, let us talk for a minute about the cementing job because all of the testimony that we have had in this committee through our hearings, also in the Natural Resources Committee through their hearings, indicates that the choices that BP made--and its subcontractors--in order to save money led to blind faith in a successful cementing job. Let me just walk through it first so that you can understand. First of all, BP chose a riskier well design and the chairman, Chairman Waxman, talked about this for a moment. The best practice would have been to use a liner and a tieback which provides four barriers to prevent the flow of dangerous hydrocarbons to the wellhead. Instead, BP as the chairman said, chose a long-string approach which has only two barriers. An internal document of the company warned that this approach was not recommended because, quote, cementing simulations indicate it is unlikely to be a successful cement job. And you can look at Tab 6 of the notebook you have in front of you to see that, Mr. Hayward. It says, Cement simulations indicate it is unlikely to be a successful cement job due to formulation breakdown. This is an internal BP confidential document from mid- April. Have you seen this document before? Mr. Hayward. I saw it as a consequence of the letter that-- -- Ms. DeGette. But you did not see it at the time? Mr. Hayward. I did not see it at the time. Ms. DeGette. But there were BP folks who saw it, correct? Mr. Hayward. There were certainly BP people who saw this. Ms. DeGette. So the document says there would be a potential need to verify with the bond log and perform a remedial cement job, but BP chose the riskier approach. Secondly, BP chose the riskier centralizer option. Experts have told us in testimony to this committee that the best practice would have been to use 21 centralizers, but BP only used 6. If you take a look at Tab 8, it says on Page 18, it says you did this even though your cementer, Halliburton, said this would create a, quote, severe risk that the cement job would fail. It says based on--it says that it would be a severe risk. And BP's operations drilling engineer wrote about this decision: Who cares, it's done, end of story; will probably be fine and get a good cement job. Were you aware of that document at the time, Mr. Hayward? Mr. Hayward. I was not aware of any of these documents at the time. Ms. DeGette. When did you learn about that memo? Mr. Hayward. That memo was, again, when I was made aware of it by your committee. Ms. DeGette. But you wouldn't deny that BP employees and supervisors were aware of that document at the time, correct? Mr. Hayward. There were people in BP who were aware of that document. Ms. DeGette. Would you say it is the best business practices to say, Who cares, it is done, end of story, will probably be fine and we will get a good cement job? Mr. Hayward. I think that is, you know, a cause for concern. I would like to understand the context in which it was sent. And as I have said a number of times, if there is any evidence that people put costs ahead of safety, then I will take action. Ms. DeGette. I understand. Let me finish with the cement bond. Now, BP failed to perform the most effective test that was known to determine whether the cement was properly sealed, and that is the cement bond log test. There was a contractor, Schlumberger, on board, hired to perform this test, but they were sent away 11 hours prior to the explosion. This test was described by Halliburton's chief safety officer, Tim Porbert, as quote: The only test that can really determine the actual effectiveness of the bond between the cement sheets, the formation and the casing itself. Now, the committee has consulted an independent expert who said that cement bond loss should always be used. Another expert said it is unheard of not to perform this test. He called your decision, and I am quoting, horribly negligent. So I want to ask you a question. Do you think, as CEO of this company, it was a mistake not to conduct the cement bond log test? Mr. Hayward. That is what our investigation will determine. As I---- Ms. DeGette. So your answer would be, yes, it was a mistake, correct? Mr. Hayward. I am not able to answer ``yes'' or ``no'' until the investigation is complete. When we finish---- Ms. DeGette. Have your lawyers told you not to or what? Mr. Hayward. Simply because I wasn't involved. I am sorry. Ms. DeGette. OK. But you just said you think that all the evidence shows it was a mistake, correct? Mr. Hayward. That is not correct. That is not what I said. Ms. DeGette. OK. Do you think it was all right not to conduct it? Mr. Hayward. I think we need to complete the investigation---- Ms. DeGette. OK. Well---- Mr. Hayward [continuing]. And determine whether running a cement bond log or not would have created a major difference to what happened here. Ms. DeGette. OK. Let me ask you this: Are you aware of the fact that it would have cost about $128,000 and taken 9 to 12 hours to complete the cement bond log test? Mr. Hayward. I am aware of that fact, yes. Ms. DeGette. Yes. OK. OK, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. Mr. Doyle for questions, please. Mr. Doyle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, in your testimony, you said that some of the best minds and the deepest expertise are being brought to bear on the oil spill and that it is difficult to imagine the gathering of a larger, more technically proficient team in one place in peacetime. Now, I know that is meant to reassure us that everything possible is being done, but it does make me wonder who was making these key decisions before the accident. Now, one of these key decisions was which type of pipe to insert in the well, a single tube from the top or a two-piece liner with a tieback set-up. Now, the second design offers more barriers to unintended gas flow. And, on Tuesday, the other oil companies that we talked to told us they would have chosen that design. Looking back, the decision that BP made appears to have had serious consequences. Mr. Hayward, were you involved in that decision? Mr. Hayward. I was not involved in that decision. Mr. Doyle. Were you aware of that decision? Mr. Hayward. I was not involved or aware of any of the decisions around this well as it was being drilled. Mr. Doyle. We asked your representatives, who are the senior BP executives who are responsible for the Macondo well. They told us it was Andy Inglis, the chief executive for exploration, and Doug Suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration. Can you tell me, was Andy Inglis involved in this decision? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid I can't answer that question. I genuinely don't know. I would be very surprised. Mr. Doyle. What about Doug Suttles, was he involved in the decision? Mr. Hayward. I would also be very surprised if Mr. Suttles was involved in any decision. Mr. Doyle. So we have reviewed all of their e-mails and communications. We find no record that they knew anything about this decision. In fact, we find no evidence that they ever received briefings on the activities aboard the Deepwater Horizon before the explosion. These decisions all seem to have been delegated to much lower-ranking officials. Well, Mr. Hayward, then, who was the one who made the decision to use a single tube of metal from the top of the well to the bottom? Who did make that decision? Mr. Hayward. I am not sure exactly who made the decision. It would have been a decision taken by the drilling organization in the Gulf of Mexico. They are the technical experts that have the technical knowledge and understanding to make decisions of that sort. Mr. Doyle. But you can't tell this committee who that person was? Mr. Hayward. I can't, sitting here today, I am afraid. Mr. Doyle. You can get this information to our committee? I mean, I think it is pretty amazing that this is the decision that had enormous consequences and you can't even tell the committee who made the decision on behalf of your company. And the reason I am asking you these questions is because your industry is different than many. You are not the CEO of a department store chain where it is fine to leave decisions about running the store to branch managers. You know, if a department store middle manager makes a mistake, there are no life-or-death consequences. What you do is different. You are drilling far below sea level into a region that is more like outer space than anything else. The consequences of that drilling are huge. If a mistake or misjudgment is made, workers on the rig can get killed and an environmental catastrophe can be unleashed. The best minds in the senior leadership of a company should be paying close attention to those risks. But it didn't happen here. And now we are all paying the consequences because those of you at the top don't seem to have a clue about what was going on on this rig. Now, I am sitting here thinking I could be a CEO of an oil company. I hear it pays a little bit better than being a Member of Congress. Because I have watched you in front of this committee; you are not able to give us much information on anything here. I want to ask you one last question while I have some time. You told us that you are doing everything possible to stop this well from leaking, but it seems to me that what we are left with now is waiting for this relief well to be drilled. And that is going to happen sometime in August. So, you know, today is June 17th. Now, back in 1979, the Ixtoc I took over 9 months to cap after drilling several relief wells. And that well was only 160 feet down into the ocean, while the Macondo well is over 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean. Can you tell us today, have you abandoned any other efforts to kill this well? Are we at the point now where BP is doing nothing until the relief well gets down there? Or are you trying some different technology or some other way to kill the well, you know, before you get a relief well down there? Is there anything else on the horizon? Mr. Hayward. I am afraid there are no other options to kill this well other than from the well at the base of the reservoir. As you are all aware, we tried to kill the well from the top, using the Top Kill operation, and the pressures in the well are such that it is not possible to do that. So we have to rely on the relief wells. In the interim, we are continuing to contain as much of the oil we can. And that operation is currently containing 20,000 barrels a day. By the end of this month, we will have the ability to contain between 40,000 and 50,000 barrels a day and, by the middle of July, between 60,000 and 80,000 barrels a day. Mr. Doyle. I will ask you the same question I asked other oil executives on Tuesday. Why wouldn't you just drill relief wells when you drill the main well, so that if something like this happened, instead of us waiting 2, 3 months and watching millions of barrels of oil come into the ocean, destroying our ecosystem and our way of life on the gulf coast, that you could kill that well in a short period of time? I understand the extra relief well would cost you a little bit more money, but it seems to me, in this case, it would have saved you billions of dollars. What are your thoughts on drilling relief wells along with main wells? Mr. Hayward. I think we will need to look at all of the options available to us going forward with respect to deepwater exploration. Mr. Doyle. I see my time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Doyle. Ms. Schakowsky for questions, please. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to focus on the mindset of BP when it comes to its workers. You said in your opening statement that you were personally devastated, you attended a memorial service for those men. ``It was a shattering moment. I want to offer my sincere condolences to their friends and families. I can only imagine their sorrow.'' Probably not as devastated as the widows that testified before our committee. And I asked them: What about BP, what kind of contact have you had with BP since the incident-- letters, phone calls, visits? And Natalie Roshto said, ``Two BP men attended James's services, and they never extended a hand, a hug, never extended a `we're sorry,' their condolences. The only words that came out of their mouth was where they were to be seated, and I never saw them after that.'' I asked, ``What about you, Mrs. Kemp?'' ``Two BP men came to Wyatt's services, and one extended his hand. I shook it. He told me he was very sorry for my loss. He asked if he could hug me; he did. The other gentleman extended his hand, told me who he was. And they sent two plants to the service. And that is the extent of my conversation or any dealings with BP.'' That's it. Do you feel that you owe something more to those women, just in terms of expressing something and some--and more? Mr. Hayward. As I said, I am devastated by the accident, absolutely devastated. And I feel great sorrow for the people who have been impacted by it. Ms. Schakowsky. Well, they haven't heard anything. Mr. Hayward. The people who were killed in the accident were not BP employees. They were employees of Transocean and another contractor. And both of them made it very clear that they wanted to deal with the families. We have provided support to both Transocean and---- Ms. Schakowsky. I guess I was talking about human beings-- -- Mr. Hayward. And we have made it clear that we will provide all and every need for the families, but the---- Ms. Schakowsky. OK, let me ask another question. There were BP personnel on the rig, and we read that oil workers from the rig were held in seclusion on the open water for up to 2 days after the April 20 explosion while attorneys attempted to convince them to sign legal documents stating that they were unharmed by the incident. The men claimed that they were forbidden from having any contact with concerned loved ones during that time and were told that they would not be able to go home until they signed the documents they were presented with. After being awake for 50 harrowing hours, Stephen Davis caved in and signed the papers. He said most of the others did, as well. Do you think this is an appropriate way to treat people that experience that? And since you are executives, you had people on the rig, what was their feeling about that, what is your feeling about that? Mr. Hayward. I think it is inappropriate, and it was nothing to do with BP. Ms. Schakowsky. I see. And BP had no comment on it and had no opportunity--I mean, did the company know about it? Was there any---- Mr. Hayward. I don't believe we were aware it was taking place, but it was certainly nothing to do with BP. Ms. Schakowsky. OK. Well, I did mention during my opening statement this document that basically says, ``Such voluntary effort shall be at my own risk,'' that people were made to sign. And there were two court appearances that were needed to finally get BP to take responsibility. But what I understand is that BP continued to fail to provide adequate protective gear to the fishermen. And on May 16th, OSHA issued a detailed directive on the training requirement for specific tasks to responders and stated that OSHA had officials monitoring the training and observing the cleanup. But, according to testimony we heard in Louisiana, still, BP failed to provide respirators to the workers exposed to the crude oil, and the workers experienced health impacts. The workers were afraid to speak up due to the potential to lose their jobs. Those fishermen who attempted to wear respirators while working were threatened to be fired by BP due to the workers using the respirators. Do you know anything about that? Mr. Hayward. I am not aware of that. What we clearly are endeavoring to do is to ensure that anyone involved in the response is appropriately provided with whatever safety equipment is required. Ms. Schakowsky. Endeavoring to provide? Mr. Hayward. Well, we---- Ms. Schakowsky. Are the workers currently provided with what they need? Mr. Hayward. Absolutely. In every case, we are trying to make certain that people do not put---- Ms. Schakowsky. You are trying to make certain, but is all the equipment there and are all these workers protected? Mr. Hayward. To my knowledge, yes. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. We will next turn to Mr. Ross for questions, please. Mr. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Hayward, since my opening statement, up to 416,666 gallons of oil have leaked into the gulf. That was about 4 hours ago. In our opening statement 4 hours ago, I asked you to be open with us and honest with us in your responses. And, instead, it seems as though we are getting statements memorized by you and provided by your legal counsel. I don't know if BP quite understands how angry the American people and the world is at them. I can tell you it is rare that you see Democrats and Republicans on this panel agreeing with one another, and yet it has been pretty consistent today, with a few major exceptions, the level of discontent and anger and frustration at BP. I also watch this on the news, and it seems to me that BP has not been honest with the American people, it has not been honest with our government, and it seems as though you are trying to hide something. Sir, it is hard to hide 2.5 million gallons of oil a day pouring into the gulf. We want answers. We want you to be honest and open with us. And we want to finally see the kind of transparency that you have been talking about. I have a few questions for you. BP is currently in the process of drilling two relief wells to stop the flow of oil that may or may not work, which you have said will be finished by August. After these relief wells are finished and the leak has been stopped, what does BP plan to do with these wells? Do you plan to put these wells into production to make a profit off of them, or do you plan to shut them down after the situation has been resolved? Mr. Hayward. They will be shut down after the situation has been resolved. The first relief well, we will pump mud down the relief well to kill the well, to kill the current well that is flowing, and then cement it up. Mr. Ross. A recent article in the New York Times reported that the cleanup effort thus far has created over 250 tons of solid waste and 175,000 gallons of liquid waste that are now being carted away from the gulf coast and shipped off to landfills. BP executives have stated that had this waste, which is admittedly hazardous and destructive to our ocean environment, is perfectly safe to dump in our Nation's landfills. You have polluted our coast and our air with this tragic spill, and now you are shipping the waste you collect and dumping it near our homes and our water sources. I want to know where this waste is going. And are you shipping it throughout the country? How can we be sure it has been treated and is safe? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the details of that, but I can assure you that we will do the right thing to ensure that it is treated in the proper and appropriate way. Mr. Ross. Can you provide me and this committee with a response? Mr. Hayward. We certainly can. Mr. Ross. Let me try this, in the time I have left. This has been asked several times, and I don't think we have gotten an answer yet. We all know about the e-mails from BP employees expressing their concerns about the casing procedures, including an April 15th e-mail from your drilling engineer, Brian Morel, who described the well as, quote, ``a nightmare well.'' How much were the drilling engineers consulted in the decision to use the single string casing? Was this a bottom-up decision in which the people actually connected to drilling the operation had some influence, or did it come from the top down? Mr. Hayward. As I understand it from the discussion with our investigation team and from the review of the documents, there was a discussion taking place amongst the drilling engineering team responsible for this well. And that is how the decision and the judgments were taken. Mr. Ross. So would you call that a bottom-up decision or a top-down decision? Mr. Hayward. I would say it was a decision taken by the right experts with the right technical knowledge to make the decision. Mr. Ross. In your testimony, you note that you are currently drilling two relief wells which will ultimately stem the flow of oil. In previous testimony from BP and Transocean, we have heard that there are numerous redundancies built into all of your equipment and in all of your personnel procedures to ensure that your company does the very best it can to ensure that tragedies like the one we have seen unfold over the past 59 days don't occur. My question is this: Do you view these relief wells as an on-off switch? When these wells are complete, are they going to stop the flow of oil into our ocean? If so, why didn't you predrill emergency relief wells prior to this whole mess? It has been asked before; we are still waiting for a good answer. Did you do cost-benefit analysis and determine that it was cheaper to drill one well, spend years rolling in profits from the oil you managed to capture, and then potentially pay a massive sum to clean up an inevitable tragedy? Which was it, sir? Mr. Hayward. We believed that the blowout preventer was the ultimate fail-safe mechanism. That clearly was not the case in this instance. It failed on three separate indications: It failed when it was activated on the drilling rig at the time of the incident. It failed to operate when the drilling rig separated from the blowout preventer, as it should have done. And it failed to activate when we had submersible robots at the blowout preventer within 24 hours of the incident. That was the fail-safe mechanism. Mr. Ross. Mr. Chairman, I see I am out of time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Ross. Mrs. Christensen for questions. Mrs. Christensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, you have pledged $20 billion for a trust fund, which I see is a commitment to meet BP's obligation--and not a slush fund, just for the record. My question is, are health payments such as for any illnesses that residents or workers may develop as a result of the spill covered in your statement to cover all legitimate claims? And what about Federal and local government outlays of health and other personnel, are they covered under that? Mr. Hayward. Claims of that sort are covered under the fund. Mrs. Christensen. Thank you. Several individuals and organizations have called for more people and more expertise to assist in fighting what is increasingly being called a war. General Honore calls it World War III and calls for it to be fought as such. What is not part of the effort that needs to be? What is missing? And do you feel that you need more hands, more people to effectively fight this so-called war and prevent the oil from creating any more damage? Mr. Hayward. We have been fighting a battle on three fronts since the very beginning: to eliminate the leak, to contain the oil on the surface, and to defend the shore. And it is now the task now of the incident commander, the national incident commander, Thad Allen, to determine what further resources are required. It is a conversation that he and I have on a regular basis, to try and ensure that we have the right resources in the right place at the right time to deal with the incident. Mrs. Christensen. So, as of your last conversation with Admiral Allen, the sense was that you had all that you needed and all of the people that you needed? Mr. Hayward. We are continuing to work the issue of defending the shore, to try and mitigate to the maximum extent possible the amount of oil that comes onshore. That is where we can still do more to defend the beaches. Mrs. Christensen. OK. Thank you for your answer. You state in your testimony that the events of 4/20 were not foreseen by you. But in light of the several areas of concern that have been raised, shouldn't someone have foreseen and been able to prevent the explosion? For example, I understand that there is supposed to be a policy where any one person on a rig can shut it down if they perceive a problem. Is this a real policy that is enforced and reinforced in training, or is it something just on paper? Because that didn't seem to happen in this instance, even though some Transocean, some Halliburton, and even BP employees reportedly had serious concerns. Mr. Hayward. It is a policy that is real. And if anyone at any time believes that what they are doing is unsafe, they have both the right and the obligation to stop the task. Mrs. Christensen. And are you surprised that no one, given what we are hearing--and I know the investigation is not complete--that no one made that decision to shut the rig down? Mr. Hayward. I think, in the light of what we now know, it is of course surprising that someone didn't say that they were concerned. And I think that is to the heart of the investigation, to understand exactly what the events were and why there was not a different decision taken with respect to the event, particularly in the last 5 or 6 hours on the day of the incident. Mrs. Christensen. There was a company that was supposed to do the--I think it was Schlumberger, that was on the rig at the time and left. Now, when we were in New Orleans, we were told in the hearing that they left because of concern for safety, but other reports said that they left because they were told they weren't needed. What is, in your analysis, the correct reason? Mr. Hayward. I believe it is clear that they left the rig because they had completed the task, or the task that they had anticipated to do was not required. Mrs. Christensen. OK. So, as far as you know, it was not that they felt unsafe, as we were told in New Orleans? Mr. Hayward. It was nothing to do, I don't believe on the basis of anything that I have seen, that it was anything to do with safety. Mrs. Christensen. OK. My last question: In your testimony, you say, and I am quoting, ``BP is a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act,'' and you distinguish that terminology from any implication of legal liability, which is still being investigated. When you say ``a,'' do you think that you are the sole responsible party? Or might there be others? And, if so, who? Mr. Hayward. The government has named four responsible parties. They are BP, Transocean, Mitsui, and Anadarko. They have all been named as responsible parties in this incident. Mrs. Christensen. The last two were? Mr. Hayward. Mitsui, Anadarko, Transocean, and BP. Mrs. Christensen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mrs. Christensen. Next for questions would be Mr. Welch. He is not here. Next would be Mr. Green for questions, please. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, the day before yesterday, Mr. Tillerson from ExxonMobil testified Tuesday that, in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez accident, ExxonMobil launched a full-scale, top- to-bottom review of their operations and implementing far- reaching actions that today guide every operation decision they make on a daily basis. Have there been any specific reforms that BP has implemented following the Alaska pipeline accident and the Texas City refinery disaster? Mr. Hayward. We have implemented major, major change following the incidents in 2006 and 2007. We have implemented changes to our people, in terms of the skills and capabilities we have. We have implemented changes to the training that they get and the expertise that they develop. And we have implemented significant changes to all of our operating practices, including the implementation of an operating management system that covers all of the company's operations. It has been a root-and-branch review, from top to bottom. Mr. Green. I guess my concern is, having followed both the Alaskan pipeline and the Texas City refinery disaster, those reforms haven't worked. What will be done differently this time? In the last almost 60 days, has there been some discussion on why the reforms from the Texas City and the pipeline, the Alaska pipeline, hasn't worked? And, again, you know the information our committee has. You received a letter 2 days ago on some of the decisions that were made literally on the rig by BP's representatives. What, going forward from here, will we know 5 years from now that we won't have to repeat what we are doing this time? Mr. Hayward. That is why I am so determined to get to the bottom of this incident, such that we can learn from it and make changes to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Mr. Green. What has happened with your drilling procedures internationally? I know there are different standards for different companies. Our committee heard testimony from the executive a few days ago that, typically, Norway and the Scandinavian countries have the toughest offshore drilling. I know BP is active in Norway. Is there a significant difference on what you do in the Gulf of Mexico as compared to what you do off the coast of Norway or even off the coast at Edinburgh or off the coast of Great Britain? Mr. Hayward. We approach with the same standards globally. And the truth is that the rules and regulations, as I understand it, in the Gulf of Mexico are higher than they are, for example, in the North Sea and the U.K. Sector, in terms of the requirements. So we will continue to learn from this incident and make changes to ensure that it cannot happen again. And it will be global. Mr. Green. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Green. Do you yield back? Mr. Green. Yes. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Green yields back. I next turn to Mr. Barton, ranking member, for questions, please. Mr. Barton. I thank you, Chairman Stupak. I appreciate the opportunity to ask some questions. Mr. Hayward, yesterday when we had a hearing in a different subcommittee of this full committee, we had four CEOs of other oil companies. I think to a person--and I could be wrong about this--but I think they all indicated that they either would not have drilled this well or at least would not have drilled it the way BP drilled it. What is your response to that? Mr. Hayward. I want to understand exactly what happened through our investigation, to compare it with other practices, to determine what is the truth. And I can't comment today on that. Mr. Barton. All right. I have had off-camera discussions with a number of experts in the drilling processes for the deep Gulf of Mexico, and they all say that BP has a different culture. For example, in most of the other companies that operate in the deep gulf, there are a number of individuals on site that have what is called stop- order authority. In other words, if they see something that is going on that compromises safety or integrity, they have the ability to stop production. But I am told that BP doesn't give that authority, that it is further up the chain of command. Is that correct? And, if so, is that something that BP may consider changing, given what has happened? Mr. Hayward. On a drilling operation such as this, anyone can stop it--the BP man, the Transocean driller, the Transocean tool pusher, the OIM, or the BP on-site leader. It requires everyone to agree to continue, and if there is one person who does not agree, then they do not. Anyone. Mr. Barton. So when I am told that the BP culture in terms of this authority is different, I have been told incorrectly? Mr. Hayward. I believe that is so, Congressman. Mr. Barton. OK. In terms of the two relief drills that are currently being drilled, are they being drilled using the same procedures as this well, or are they being drilled differently? In other words, some of the things that weren't used on this well--the double casing, things of this sort--are those relief wells going to use these enhanced safety procedures? Mr. Hayward. There are clearly some areas of concern, as we have identified in our investigation--cement casing. And the relief wells are being drilled with all of those issues absolutely foremost in the procedure. Now, clearly, the relief wells are rather different because of what they have to do. But all of the things that we have learnt, to date, from our investigation have absolutely been incorporated into the activity that is taking place with respect to the relief wells. Mr. Barton. OK. Have you either read or been at least given a summary of the letter that Chairman Waxman and Chairman Stupak sent earlier in the week that lists the five or six outstanding--or what they consider, what the staffs consider to be the anomalies in this well and the safety concerns? Are you familiar with that letter? Mr. Hayward. I am familiar with that letter. Mr. Barton. OK. Do you agree in general with the concerns that are raised there about the lack of, for lack of a better term, a safety collar being employed, the number of devices that could have stopped the oil and gas venting and escaping up the well? Somebody recommended, I think, 21 or 22, and BP made a decision to only use six. Now that you know what has happened, do you share some of the concerns that that letter raises? Mr. Hayward. I think I share the concern about the number of contributing factors that may have--that have created this incident. They are focused on the cement, on the casing, on the integrity test, on the well control procedures, and on the complete failure of the blowout preventer. And they are all areas that I believe we really need to understand fully before we draw conclusions about how this accident occurred. Mr. Barton. My final question is, based on what you now know, do you agree with the general conclusion expressed yesterday that this was a preventable accident? Mr. Hayward. I believe that all accidents are preventable, absolutely. Mr. Barton. OK. Finally, Mr. Chairman, if I may take a small point of personal privilege, I want the record to be absolutely clear that I think BP is responsible for this accident, should be held responsible, and should in every way do everything possible to make good on the consequences that have resulted from this accident. And if anything I said this morning has been misconstrued in opposite effect, I want to apologize for that misconstruction. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Barton. Ms. Sutton for questions. Ms. Sutton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, this testimony has been fascinating. We have heard a lot about your desire to come in and improve the safety of operations everywhere in the world, something to that effect. And you listed another top priority: to conduct BP's business in a way that is in tune with the world without damaging the environment. Would you agree that BP did not meet those goals on the Deepwater Horizon rig? Mr. Hayward. I think it is clear that I regret, BP regrets what has happened here deeply. Ms. Sutton. So, obviously, BP did not meet those goals on the Deepwater Horizon rig. But, Mr. Hayward, the concern beyond that is there seems to be little evidence about how hard BP tried to meet that goal. The committee's investigation of the Deepwater Horizon disaster identified five key decisions--we have talked about it over and over again in this hearing--made by BP officials in the days before the explosion. Those decisions had two common denominators: They saved time and cut costs, and they each increased risk. Now, I have heard you say over and over again in the course of today's hearings that there is nothing that I have seen in evidence so far that BP put costs ahead of safety. And I have to tell you how detached that seems. Because we have also talked about some of the documents that the committee has unearthed, and document after document that indicated that BP officials in charge of the Deepwater Horizon were focused on saving time and money--for example, the document that says that the well design was chosen because it would save $7 million to $10 million. You are familiar with that document, correct? Mr. Hayward. I am familiar with that document. Ms. Sutton. OK. And another one says that the reason for not using sufficient centralizers is because it would take 10 hours to install them. You are familiar with that document? Mr. Hayward. Yes, I am familiar with that document. Ms. Sutton. OK. And you indicated that you weren't familiar with any of this happening before the explosion; you only learned about it afterwards, right, as the CEO of this company? Mr. Hayward. I wasn't familiar with any of the decisions or any of the documents surrounding this well prior or during the drilling of the well. Ms. Sutton. OK. And what is fascinating also is that, when you were asked about how these decisions are made within the structure of your organization, you referenced this from a perspective of, ``As I understand it from our investigation, this is how these decisions are made.'' But you are the leader of the company. You couldn't even tell us if they were top-down or bottom-up decisions. You were just referencing them based on an after-the-fact investigation. So when we talk about these documents, the documents I just referenced--the one that says the well design was chosen because it would save $7 million to $10 million and the other one that says that the reason for not using sufficient centralizers is because it would take 10 hours to install them--none of these documents makes a decision to ensure a safe environment on the rig or protect the environment from a catastrophic oil spill. Would you say that that is true, that that doesn't indicate a decision being made based on ensuring a safe environment or protecting the environment? Mr. Hayward. I don't think it is possible to say that, based on the documents, out of context. Ms. Sutton. And, see, that is why I think there is a real detachment here, a real disconnect, as we have heard that word used earlier today. It seems to me there was a disconnect prior to the explosion, and there remains a disconnect when viewing evidence that is very clear and being presented. This was a tragic failure. You have talked about your commitment to safety and the environment, but when push came to shove on the Deepwater Horizon, the company's concern seemed to be the bottom line. And I guess this is my question to you, Mr. Hayward: Who was responsible for the failures on the Deepwater Horizon and the terrible set of decisions that led to the tragedy in the gulf? Mr. Hayward. That is what our investigation will determine, and that is what it is going to do. And if there is, at any point, evidence to suggest that people put costs ahead of safety, then I will take action. Ms. Sutton. So, evidence like those documents? Mr. Hayward. The evidence from the totality of the investigation. Ms. Sutton. OK. Mr. Hayward, as the leader of the company, don't you have to accept the responsibility? You talked about the importance of safety and the environment, but you presided over a corporate culture where safety and risks and risks to the environment were ignored in order to save a few days and a few dollars in drilling costs. If you are the leader of the company, don't you have to take responsibility? Mr. Hayward. I am absolutely responsible for the safety and reliable operations in BP. That is what I have said all along. Ms. Sutton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Ms. Sutton. Mr. Welch for questions, please. Mr. Welch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, is it true that, in 2005, the Texas City operation owned by BP blew up, resulting in the loss of lives of 15 workers? Mr. Hayward. That is true. Mr. Welch. And is it true that, in 2006, a BP oil pipeline in Alaska ruptured and spilled 200,000 gallons of crude oil? Mr. Hayward. That is true. Mr. Welch. And is it true that, in 2007, when you took over as CEO of BP, the corporation settled a series of criminal, not civil, criminal charges and agreed to pay $370 million in fines? Mr. Hayward. That is correct. Mr. Welch. And is it also true that, in 1 year, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, found more than 700 violations at BP's Texas City refinery and fined BP what was then a record fine of $87.4 million? Is that true? Mr. Hayward. That is correct. Mr. Welch. And is it true that, earlier this year, a BP refinery in Toledo, Ohio, was fined $3 million for willful--and I emphasize the term in the finding, ``willful''--safety violations, including the use of valves similar to those that contributed to the Texas City blast? Mr. Hayward. That is correct. Mr. Welch. And is it true, as well, that the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which did investigation into the Texas City refinery, was headed, with the active participation of former Secretary of State James Baker--are you familiar with that report? Mr. Hayward. I am very familiar with that report. Mr. Welch. And in that report--which you, I take it, regard as credible? Mr. Hayward. I believe it is very credible, and it is the basis on which we moved forward in 2007. Mr. Welch. And that report, and I quote, found that ``BP management allowed operators and supervisors to alter, to edit, to add, and to remove procedural steps at the Texas City refinery without assessing risk.'' And the Baker panel examined all of BP's U.S. refineries and found ``a toleration of serious deviations from safe operating practices.'' Is that an accurate statement of the findings of Mr. Baker's report? Mr. Hayward. It is an accurate finding. And based on the findings of that report and the instances of 2005 and 2006---- Mr. Welch. And in the case---- Mr. Hayward. --we implemented a systematic change in how we manage safety and a systematic change in the culture of BP. Mr. Welch. Well, let me ask you---- Mr. Hayward. That is something we have done consistently over the last 3 years. Mr. Welch. Well, did that systematic change that you say you implemented as a result of the Baker report account for the reason that, at Deepwater Horizon, when faced with the choice of a cheaper and quicker casing design or a safer design, BP chose the cheaper and quicker casing design? Did you do that on the basis of the recommendations of the Baker report? Mr. Hayward. As I have said, we need to wait for the results of the investigation to conclude. If there is any evidence whatsoever that people put costs ahead of safety in this incident, then we will take action. Mr. Welch. Well, I am not going to ask you what their reason was. What I am going to ask you--and, in fact, it is not in dispute, that the choice was made to use a cheaper and quicker casing design rather than a more expensive design. And I will ask you again: There were fewer casing centralizers than some folks were recommending. Is that--I will leave out motivation, but there was a choice of more casing centralizers or fewer casing centralizers. More cost more; fewer cost less. Which choice did BP make at Deepwater Horizon? Mr. Hayward. The decision taken by the engineering team at the time, which was a technical judgment, was to use fewer centralizers rather than more. It is not always true that more is better. Mr. Welch. And BP chose at Deepwater Horizon not to circulate drilling mud that would have cleaned out the well. It chose a lighter saltwater base for the cementing procedure. Is that correct? Mr. Hayward. The procedure to displace the mud was a procedure that is not uncommon in the industry. It was a procedure that was approved by the MMS prior to implementing it. Mr. Welch. Are you saying you made the right choice in this case? Mr. Hayward. I am not able to make a judgment as to whether the right choices were made. Mr. Welch. Well, you are the CEO. Mr. Hayward. But I am not, with respect, Congressman, a drilling engineer or a technically qualified engineer in these matters. Mr. Welch. But you are in charge of them. Mr. Hayward. That doesn't mean to say I am an expert. Mr. Welch. Well, I mean, you know, one of the frustrations that I think folks have is, who is in charge? And there was a Baker report that said there was a systematic choice being made consistently by BP that led to the loss of life, that led to pollution, that could be attributed to a decision based on saving money, increasing profits, at the expense of safety and, as it turns out, unfortunately, human lives. You know, I am going to get back to what I asked you earlier. I think all of us live in a world where we would prefer to have fewer regulations rather than more. We would like to rely on trust and faith and our word, rather than regulations and checking over your shoulder and all those things that I think both sides find annoying. But I am going to ask you the question: Does a CEO who has presided over a company that has incurred over $370 million in fines, whose company was subject to this report by Mr. Baker, indicating a choice at the expense of safety, does that person who has presided over almost $100 billion in loss of shareholder value, in the suspension of a $10 billion annual dividend, who has lost the confidence of shareholders and regulators and, most importantly, the families and citizens of the gulf, does that person enjoy the confidence necessary to continue acting as CEO? Or is it time for that CEO to resign? Mr. Hayward. I am focused on the response. I am focused on trying to eliminate the leak, trying to contain the oil on the surface and defend the beaches and to clean up the spill and to restore the lives of the people on the gulf coast. That is what I intend to do. Mr. Welch. OK. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. That concludes questions by members of the subcommittee. As I indicated earlier, members of the full committee will have an opportunity to ask questions if they so choose. So we will alternate, and, as I indicated earlier, it will be based upon committee seniority. So, Mr. Stearns, you would be next, first on the Republican side, for questions for 5 minutes, please. Mr. Stearns. Thank you, Mr. Stupak, and thank you for allowing me to ask these questions. Mr. Hayward, I have watched this hearing, and time and time again you have indicated this--you have responded with this statement: ``I can't give you a legitimate answer to that question.'' You have said it over and over again. They have asked you for details; you didn't know. Did you bring anybody with you who has the detailed information that could help you answer a lot of these questions? Is there anybody else who can help? Mr. Hayward. I have a technical expert with me. Mr. Stearns. Because I don't see you go back to that technical expert, and you just continue to say, ``I just can't answer that question.'' So my question for you today: Is today Thursday, yes or no? Mr. Hayward. It is Thursday. Mr. Stearns. OK. Next question. The people of Florida, when I talk to them and they say there is oil spilling on the coast, would it be appropriate to say that is because of BP's reckless behavior, yes or no? Mr. Hayward. It is a consequence of a big accident. Mr. Stearns. No, yes or no? Reckless behavior or not? Mr. Hayward. There is no evidence of reckless behavior. Mr. Stearns. So you are standing here, you are saying here today that BP had no reckless behavior. That is your position, yes? Mr. Hayward. There is no evidence of reckless behavior. Mr. Stearns. No. Yes or no? You are saying BP has had no reckless behavior, is what you are saying to us. Mr. Hayward. I have seen no evidence of reckless behavior. Mr. Stearns. OK. So you are on record saying there has been no reckless behavior. We had a hearing. Mr. McKay was here. We had the CEOs of Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell. We asked them the question, knowing what we know today about the inconsistent well pressure test readings, would you have proceeded with withdrawing the drilling fluid from the well? Every one of them said no. Then the next question was asked to them about safety measures. Are there safety measures that your company could have taken to prevent this incident? Every one of them said yes. So you are here this morning saying your company had no reckless behavior, yet all your peers, the CEOs of Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell, all pointed out your reckless behavior. Later on, Halliburton warned your company that the well could have a severe gas flow problem. Were you aware of Halliburton's warning, yes or no? Mr. Hayward. I was not involved in any of the decisions around this time. Mr. Stearns. No, I don't want to hear that. I mean, this is the same thing you have been saying all day. What I want to know is, you, in your position--has anyone on your staff briefed you about Halliburton warning your company, we could have a severe gas flow problem? Were you ever notified or briefed on this? Yes or no? Mr. Hayward. No, prior to the incident. Mr. Stearns. So you are up at this top echelon and you didn't hear--did you hear about the e-mails that occurred? Later that day, a BP official involved in the decision, who recognized the risks of proceeding with insufficient centralizers, threw caution to the wind in an e-mail just 4 days--4 days--before the disaster, stating, ``Who cares, it's done, end of story, will probably be fine.'' Did you know about that e-mail? Mr. Hayward. I had no prior knowledge of this well prior to the incident whatsoever. Mr. Stearns. In light of what your four peers have said, dealing with safety, dealing with the precautions with the pressure test reading, and dealing with Halliburton, don't you think there is reckless behavior indication? If what I told you is true, do you think BP has reckless behavior? Mr. Hayward. I believe all accidents are preventable. The investigation will determine how this accident has occurred---- Mr. Stearns. OK. So you are saying, right now, based upon all the information I gave you, you do not think BP had any reckless behavior. That is your position this afternoon. Is that correct, yes or no? Mr. Hayward. That is--I have seen no---- Mr. Stearns. I want you to say that you don't think BP has reckless behavior. Mr. Hayward. I have seen no evidence of reckless behavior. Mr. Stearns. OK. All right. Now, let's say you were on a ship and you ran into New Orleans and you spewed all this oil and you killed 11 people. Do you think the captain of that ship should be fired? Has anyone in BP been fired because of this incident? Anybody? Yes or no? Mr. Hayward. No, so far. Mr. Stearns. No people have been fired. So, you are captain of the ship, runs into New Orleans, spews all this oil. There is all this damage from Alabama to Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana. And no one has been fired? Mr. Hayward. Our investigation is ongoing. Mr. Stearns. So let's say the investigation goes for 3 years. Does that mean you wouldn't fire anybody? Mr. Hayward. As the investigation draws conclusions, we will take the necessary action. Mr. Stearns. OK. So, in light of all the environmental damage, the human damage, and just the information from your peers saying that you were indeed reckless, and these e-mails I have told you, you still are going to stonewall us this morning, this afternoon. And you are saying basically, we did nothing wrong and we are going to wait until the evidence to prove whether we did wrong or right; is that correct? Mr. Hayward. I believe we should await for the conclusions of the various investigations before we make decisions based on those conclusions. Mr. Stearns. Well, Mr. Chairman, he did answer that today is Thursday. Mr. Braley [presiding]. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Engel, for 5 minutes. Mr. Engel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, I am going to attempt to ask some of the questions that my other colleagues have asked but really haven't been answered. Now, on Tuesday, we had the leaders of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and ConocoPhillips. They all insisted at the hearing on Tuesday that they would not have made the mistakes that led to the well explosion. Are they lying to us, or are you lying to us by telling us that you don't know who is responsible and don't know whether or not BP did something wrong? They are all saying BP did something wrong. Mr. Hayward. I believe we need to await the results of the multiple investigations before we draw conclusions. Mr. Engel. Well, it is---- Mr. Hayward. I want to get to the bottom of this more than anyone. I want to learn the lessons, and I want to ensure that we can learn the lessons and that the industry can learn the lessons. Mr. Engel. Well, I don't understand. It is 61 days, it is 2 months. I mean, what kind of an investigation are you going to conduct? Why, in 2 months, with all this oil spilling into the gulf, do we not have at least a preliminary investigation? Mr. Hayward. We are conducting a full and comprehensive investigation. It involves a team of more than 50 people. We have shared the results of that investigation, as they become available, with this committee. And we will continue to do that. Mr. Engel. Well, Mr. Hayward, perhaps your lawyers have told you to be really cautious, but it is really an insult for you to come to this committee and keep repeating the same thing, evade questions, evade answers, and just repeat again and again that you were not responsible and that we have to wait for an investigation. Why didn't you come testify to this committee after the investigation if you are not prepared to tell us anything of knowledge now? Mr. Hayward. With respect, Congressman, I wasn't party to any of the decisionmaking around this well in the time it was being drilled. And, therefore, I am not in a position to make a judgment about whether the decisions taken were the right ones or the wrong ones. Mr. Engel. Well, but we have all made a judgment because it is 60 days and oil is spilling into the gulf. So, obviously, decisions were made that were wrong. Can't you just admit that? Can't you just say, ``I am sorry''? Can't you just admit that decisions were made that were wrong, instead of sitting there and telling us you don't know and you have to wait for an investigation? Mr. Hayward. I am very, very sorry that this accident occurred, very sorry. I deeply regret it. I deeply regret it for very many reasons. And I do believe that it is right to investigate it fully and draw the right conclusions. Mr. Engel. What needs to be investigated? What needs to be investigated that has not been investigated up till now? And how long will it take you? Mr. Hayward. I can't answer how long it will take because we want to make certain it is complete. But there are clearly-- -- Mr. Engel. Well---- Mr. Hayward [continuing]. Many investigations--excuse me, sorry. There are many investigations ongoing. There is our investigation, there is a Marine Board investigation, and a Presidential commission. And they will undoubtedly draw important conclusions for all of them. Mr. Engel. But you are the CEO. Shouldn't you not set the tone for the investigation? Shouldn't you not say, ``I demand that within a month we are going to know what happened''? I mean, you are really insulting our intelligence, with all due respect, by not giving us any answers and telling us that you have to wait for some investigation. I think the rest of the world isn't blind. We know what has happened, and we know that BP obviously didn't do what it was supposed to do. Only you don't know that. Mr. Hayward. I believe I have set the right tone. We launched the investigation within 24 hours. We have made it open and transparent. And we are sharing with everyone the results as they come out. Mr. Engel. Well, let me ask you this: How many other wells has BP in the gulf? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the precise number, but it is a large number. Mr. Engel. Give me a ballpark figure. Mr. Hayward. In the area of hundreds. Mr. Engel. OK. How can we be assured that the same thing won't happen with one of the other wells? How can you give us assurances that what happened with this well won't happen again to several hundred wells? Mr. Hayward. The other wells that I am referring to have all been drilled and completed and are secure. Mr. Engel. So you are saying, then, all the other wells that BP has, that something that happened to this well could never happen again in any of those other wells? Mr. Hayward. All of the other wells that I am referring to are wells that have been completed and are secure. Mr. Engel. So is that the same assurance that you had said that you were going to, with a laser, make safety a priority? Is this the same kind of assurance that you are giving us now? Mr. Hayward. I have, throughout my tenure, been very explicit about the priority of safety in BP. It is the first word I utter every time I talk to any group of people in BP, the fact that safe and reliable operations is our number-one priority. And we have made very significant changes to our processes, to our people, and invested very significantly into the integrity of our plants and equipment over the last 3 or 4 years. Mr. Engel. Mr. Hayward, let me just say with all due respect, I, like everyone else here and everyone else in America, is thoroughly disgusted. I think you're stalling. I think you're insulting our intelligence. And I really resent it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Stupak [presiding]. A member of the full committee Mr. Scalise for questions, please. Five minutes. Mr. Scalise. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you letting me participate in this. Mr. Hayward, this is a picture of an oiled pelican. This is our State bird in Louisiana. I'm going to keep this on my desk as long as we are battling this as a constant reminder of what is at stake. But I want you to keep this in your mind as well to recognize that we are not just talking about the loss of life, which is tragic, we are not just talking about the oil that is still spewing out of that well. We are talking about our way of life not just in Louisiana, but all along the Gulf Coast that is at stake. I would hope you keep this image in your mind as a constant reminder of what is at stake and what we are battling on a daily basis. Our two priorities right now are, number one, doing everything we can to make sure you all cap this well, but also to battle as strongly as we can to keep the oil out of our marsh and our ecosystem. We don't want to sit back and wait until the oil comes in and does possibly irreparable damage. We want to be proactive. But we are having problems on the ground being proactive because of the delays. I still hear--I was on Grand Isle Friday. I hear the biggest complaints from our local officials that they are spending more of their time fighting BP and the Federal Government than they are fighting the oil. This is unacceptable. And I know you talk about all the things that you all are doing, but it is not enough. We need a more urgent sense of response to this disaster. And I want to ask you what you are going to do to help speed that up. When our local officials tell us when they have basic questions they need answers to, it takes at least 5 days. They first go to the Coast Guard, then they are sent to BP to get approval, and then they go around in circles and they are told they are going to get answers, and they never get those answers. This is just not an acceptable way to run this operation. And so when we hear who is in charge--I want to ask you, who is in charge on the ground? Mr. Hayward. The National Incident Commander is the person in charge of this operation. Mr. Scalise. So is the Federal Government telling you what to do? Are you telling the Incident Commander what to do? When our local officials say we need something approved, do they need to get the Incident Commander and your approval? Because they are getting runaround in circles right now. Mr. Hayward. We are trying, sir. We are not being perfect, I acknowledge. We are trying very hard to do better. We are operating under the direction of the Federal Government. Mr. Scalise. Let me give you an example. When our Government came with an idea--and this was over a month ago now. He had an idea, Governor Jindal working with the local leaders, to have this sand barrier plan. They laid it out. They actually made some changes. They worked with scientists and with engineers. And then over 3 weeks went by before any approval. Now, we contacted--our entire delegation signed a letter; we tried to get the President engaged in breaking this logjam. Still to this day, only 25 percent of that plan has been approved. Now, is that you that is not approving the other 75 percent? Is that the Federal Government that is not approving it? Who is not approving the other 75 percent? Because it is not approved to this day. Mr. Hayward. The approval process flows through---- Mr. Scalise. Is it you or the Federal Government? Mr. Hayward. The ultimate approval---- Mr. Scalise. Can you tell them no? Mr. Hayward. The ultimate approval process is with the Government. Mr. Scalise. So the Federal Government is the one who hasn't approved the other 75 percent? Mr. Hayward. I can't speak to the details of the other 75 percent. Mr. Scalise. You don't know about it? We brought this to them. I know they submitted it. Our Governor submitted this to you and the Incident Commander. Mr. Hayward. As you know, we have committed $360 million to build a large part of the barrier island as---- Mr. Scalise. It is not a large part. It is 25 percent of the plan. That may seem like a large part to you. Let me go to another question that we get asked. They don't have any kind of approval of creation of a seafood safety plan. Now, is that something that was submitted to you all? Is that the Federal Government that is not approving it? Is it BP that is not approving it? Because again, our local leaders, they are getting run around in a circle, and nobody is held accountable when things don't happen. What I'm going to present to you is that we don't have time for these games to continue to play. We can't have 5 days go by before an answer is given to anybody because the oil is coming every day. And I will just give you an example about the sand barrier plan. Now, you say you all have approved a lot of it. There is no plan of protection along any part of Grand Isle, and there is an area call Barataria Bay. And I would suggest you go look it up. About a week and a half ago there was no oil in Barataria Bay. That section was scheduled to be covered by the barrier plan that still to this day hasn't been approved. Now, today there is oil, thick oil, coming into the Barataria Bay. So you're not showing the sense of urgency. And whether it is you or the Federal Government, we have got oil in Barataria Bay when we had a plan a month ago to keep the oil out of Barataria Bay. So when people are hearing that everything is being done, I'm going to tell you, on the ground it is not getting done. And I don't know what you need to do differently, but you need to go do something differently. And if it is not you that is blocking it, you need to tell somebody who is blocking it, because it is being blocked. And it is not getting done on the ground, and we don't have the luxury of time. This shouldn't be happening. We put plans in place to stop this from happening, and our plans are not being approved. Now, I would love it if our plans were being rejected because there were better alternatives that were being offered by somebody, that were being approved, but there are no other alternatives. All we are being told is no without any other option being presented. And what we are saying is if you have got a better option, present it. Otherwise approve our plan. But we don't have time to waste. Do you understand that? Mr. Hayward. I understand your concern and your anger. Mr. Scalise. And I hope you make the changes that are needed, because we don't have time. This is something else. We continue to get--and my office gets flooded, I know a lot of others get flooded, with ideas of how to stop the oil from coming into the marsh, how to cap the well and other things. We have seen basic ideas like putting hay in the water, all the way up to the supertankers in Saudi Arabia. None of them are getting done on the ground. I'm going to give you this database. This is a database of ideas with links, with schematics of a number of different ideas that should be done that can stop the oil from coming into our marsh. But it is not getting done. We don't have time to waste. So I'm going to ask you to move swiftly on this, and I am going to give you a resolution passed by our Senate that asks that you engage our local people who have been affected by this. A lot of them aren't even being able to be employed in saving the marsh. They want that done. And also to speed up the efforts on some of these alternatives that are going nowhere. We have got a lot of ocean out there that has got oil. Mr. Stupak. Time---- Mr. Scalise. We want you to use every opportunity to fix that. So I'm going to give this to you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Mrs. Capps for questions, please. Mrs. Capps. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, your $20 billion of compensation fund is a good first step, but it is just the beginning. You're going to have to fully compensate everyone who has been affected by this disaster. This week BP announced the first installment of a $25 million fund within a broader $500 million commitment to the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative. Is BP still committed to putting the full 500 million, not just the 25- installment, but the full 500 million, towards this initiative? Mr. Hayward. We are. It is an initiative that will take place, we believe, over 10 years. Mrs. Capps. When will we see the details of this entire program? Mr. Hayward. It's being worked by the experts currently. We think it is important to have a program that has firm scientific foundation. Mrs. Capps. Are these your experts, sir? Mr. Hayward. No, these are not our experts. These are independent scientists from across the United States from some of the---- Mrs. Capps. I would request that you would submit to the committee the list of experts that you have that are developing this program. I would appreciate that. Mr. Hayward. We would be very happy to do that. Mrs. Capps. Will there be further scientific investments you will make available to the research community, significant further investments of dollars? Mr. Hayward. Well, we have set up a $500 million initial fund, and I think we need to see what the scientists determine. Mrs. Capps. I just mention this because your commitment pales in comparison to the $1 billion Exxon spent on the Valdez spill 20 years ago, which was in quite a bit more remote location, and fewer people apparently were impacted by that one. So you are going to make all the data from this research available to the public? Mr. Hayward. It would be fully open and transparent. It won't be BP's data, it will be the data of the scientists involved. Mrs. Capps. All right. With their names attached? Mr. Hayward. Absolutely. Mrs. Capps. I want to switch topics now. The Federal Government has developed training classes to provide the necessary training for workers and volunteers who are cleaning up the oil from your spill, but we continue to see reports that BP is not following the training guidelines, endangering further the health of these workers now and long into the future. Why are we still hearing these kinds of reports from the people who are out on the water and on the shoreline? Mr. Hayward. We are doing everything we can to train everyone involved in this as well and as clearly and as properly as we can. Mrs. Capps. Are you using the Federal-developed courses? Mr. Hayward. We are using OSHA guidelines to establish what is the appropriate training. Mrs. Capps. Finally, I want to ask you about BP's response plan, which was clearly inadequate. This committee learned this week that the other major oil companies rely on the same response plans that are practically identical to your own. The same contractors seem to have written your plan and their plans. They hired the same contractors, apparently, as you did. And you all appear to have the same technical experts and the very same response commitment. Now, if this bill had happened to a different oil company, do you have any reason to think that they would have responded more effectively than BP has? Mr. Hayward. I can't really comment on that. All I can say is that we have initiated the biggest spill response in the history not only of America, but of the world. It involves thousands of vessels, 35,000 people. It is the largest activity of its kind ever conducted. Mrs. Capps. I appreciate that. The Federal Government has-- this country has also initiated the largest response that we have ever initiated on behalf of any kind of a natural disaster or manmade disaster in the history of this country as well. But finally, back to my original question on that topic. Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, was asked the same question that I just asked you. He said that Exxon, his own company, is not prepared to deal with a large spill if it happens to them. He also said that the response capability to prevent the impacts of a spill doesn't exist. Now, bear in mind, this is the same response--training manual--response manual that your company has. With respect to his own, he says the impacts of a spill, the capability does not exist and probably never will. My question to you, do you agree with Mr. Tillerson about this? Mr. Hayward. I agree that there are many missings in our ability to respond to an incident of this type, and there will be many learnings to be had from this incident and how we can build better response capability in the future. And as I said, we are doing an extraordinary spill response, and I regret that it hasn't been more successful so far than any of us want. Mrs. Capps. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Ms. Capps. Mr. Gonzalez for questions, please. Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, let me ask you, there is a 6-month moratorium on deepwater drilling. Do you think that is reasonable under the circumstances? Mr. Hayward. I think it is important that the lessons from this are learned, and that clearly that is a decision for the authorities to take, not for me. But it is clearly important. Mr. Gonzalez. I'm not asking you to make the decision. I'm just asking your opinion. Based on your expertise and your position, I would assume you would have an opinion on whether that is a prudent thing to be doing. Mr. Hayward. I believe it is prudent for the industry to take stock of what has happened here before it moves forward. Mr. Gonzalez. Well, you know, there are calls to move expeditiously to lift that ban after accomplishing whatever is supposed to be accomplished in order to give people peace of mind that as we drill, we are not going to have recurrence. When do you think would be appropriate to consider lifting the moratorium? Mr. Hayward. I don't think I can make a judgment on that today. I think that is something---- Mr. Gonzalez. What would common sense tell you? Mr. Hayward. I think it is understood clearly what happened and understood clearly what better response is required in the event that something like this ever happened again. Mr. Gonzalez. I'm hoping everybody is going to be on that same page. It is fundamentally sound. Now, we have had other Members that made reference to the hearing we had a couple of days ago, and I'm sure you have already spoken to Mr. McKay and such. But Shell, Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, they all said--I will tell you this, though. When I asked them if they could give me 100 percent assurance that nothing like this would happen when they are drilling in deep water, they wouldn't give me--what they would say is, we do it safely, we do it safely. Human experience is that there are no 100 percent assurances about any activity. And all I was trying to get is that let us be honest with the American people that there is risk, there is risk, there is risk. And it is a calculated risk. And if we can provide enough assurances that it is a risk worth taking, then we will be out there, won't we? Well, they wouldn't do that, believe it or not. And I'm hoping you won't play that same game. What they did say was it never would have happened, because their manner and fashion of drilling is different than what you were doing. And I don't want to start a big war on you guys, but do you really believe that the way they explore and drill in deep water is substantially different than what you were doing out there? Mr. Hayward. Not to my knowledge. Mr. Gonzalez. I tend to agree with you. So let's talk about planning. And I think Ms. Capps pointed out something that is really important as far as Exxon. What he actually said was, we couldn't deal with it if something like that happened, which is an incredible statement to make, isn't it, the fact that you're willing to expose that kind of risk? And if the worst-case scenario did develop, you wouldn't know what to do. So let's go back to 2003. The Society of Petroleum Engineers and the International Association of Drilling Contractors reported, quote, ``no blowout has yet occurred in ultra deep water, water depths of 5,000 feet or greater. But statistics show it is likely to happen. Are we ready to handle it?'' Well, we know the answer is no. But at that time they said it was likely to happen. Have you ever read anything like that in all these years, that it was likely to happen? Mr. Hayward. I haven't read that answer, I'm afraid. Mr. Gonzalez. Did you believe that it was likely to happen? Mr. Hayward. I did not believe it was likely to happen. It was a risk that was identified as the highest risk by BP across the corporation. It was a risk that was identified as the highest risk by our exploration and production unit. And we believed that the risk mitigant was the so-called failsafe mechanism of the blowout preventer. Mr. Gonzalez. This blowout preventer, it is the ultimate failsafe. And I know that you keep using that term, and it comes back somewhat to haunt you. But I'm curious about blowout preventers and the difference--and I was noticing my staff, as they were getting some information, if you have a surface well, you have a 10,000-pound-per-square-inch blowout preventer. Shallow water, 10,000 pounds per square inch; deep water, 15,000 pounds per square inch. Now, I'm not an expert. Why? What is the difference as you go into depth? Why a greater capacity? Mr. Hayward. Because of the pressure of the reservoirs that we are drilling. Mr. Gonzalez. Which then leads me to--what do you think you're dealing with at that depth as far as pounds per square inch? Mr. Hayward. We know that we are dealing with a reservoir with a pressure of around 11--between 11 and 12,000 pounds per square inch. And we have a blowout preventer rated to 15,000 pounds per square inch. I believe that's correct. Mr. Gonzalez. I don't know this. Cameron--I don't know that it is Cameron that builds these blowout preventers. That is a company that someone told me that is--and they are working on a 20,000-pound-per-square-inch preventer. I mean, you're aware of that? Mr. Hayward. I am, yes. Mr. Gonzalez. And they actually said this: While there is much discussion and an ongoing effort to provide guidance for equipment greater than 15,000 pounds per square inch, in the interest of expediency, it was decided within Cameron to apply current design codes and practices. The 20,000-pound-per- square-inch EVO blowout preventer was design-tested and qualified to API--and I'm not sure what all that means--16A 3rd edition, meaning basically, but for the sake of expediency does concern me. Why were you all looking at 20,000 pounds per square inch when you believe what you already have at 15,000 exceeds what really is required? Mr. Hayward. I think that--I'm not certain, but I think that is referring to blowout preventers for reservoirs with even greater pressure. I do believe that one of the most important things to come from this incident is the requirement for the industry to step back and redesign the failsafe mechanism it uses to prevent accidents of this sort. We need a fundamental redesign of the blowout preventer. It is something that BP is going to take a very active role in. We have already begun that process with a number of academic institutions and a number of contractors in the industry. Mr. Gonzalez. And I thank the chairman for his patience. Mr. Hayward, we usually say better late than never, but not this time. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Gonzalez. Before Mr. Inslee, we should for the record--recordkeeping, Mr. Scalise had submitted a CD and a resolution here from the State senate. He will provide copies for the record. So with unanimous consent they will be made part of his questioning and made part of the record within 10 days. Without objection, so ordered. [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.] Mr. Stupak. Mr. Inslee, questions, please. Mr. Inslee. Thank you. Mr. Hayward, something you said earlier was really quite astounding to me. You said that there was no evidence to date that there had been any decision made based on costs, that no decisions had been made in an effort to reduce costs. And I want to go through this because there is something that I think is quite pivotal in this investigation. The facts are clear that you hired Halliburton to give you advice about this. Mr. Gagliano, an expert in the field, did an analysis and concluded you needed 21 centralizers to make sure that this rig was safe. And just to remove any doubt as to why that is important, the American Petroleum Institute recommended practice--65 says, quote, if casing is not centralized, it may lay near or against the bore hole wall. It is difficult, if not impossible, to displace mud effectively from the narrow side of the annulus if casing is poorly centralized. This results in bypassed mud channels and inability to achieve zonal isolation, closed quote. So the experts said you need 21. Then if we can put up the first slide, a BP employee essentially wrote to that expert and said, we have only got six, and we don't have time to deal with this problem. Time to British petroleum was money. This rig was 45 days late. It cost you $500,000 a day. And people's obvious attention were about time, which meant money. So what happened then? Well, another British Petroleum person sent a memo saying, you really need to follow the model here. He kicked it up to Mr. Guide. If we could have the second slide. Mr. Guide came back and said, I don't like the fact this is going to take 10 hours to do, even though another British Petroleum person had said we are going to fly 15 things in, they can be here tomorrow morning. Mr. Guide said, I don't like the 10 hours. And it didn't happen. And then the next response from British Petroleum--next slide, please--was an e-mail from Mr. Cocales sort of reprimanding another BP person, saying, even if the hole is perfectly straight, a straight piece of pipe even in tension will not seek the perfect center of the hole unless it has something to centralize it, meaning you have got to have the right centralizers. But he went on to say this: But who cares? It is done, end of story, we will probably be fine, and we will get a good cement job. What happened then--that is not quite the end of the story. Mr. Gagliano then ran further computer models, and he concluded--the last slide, please--he concluded--and this is hard to read, but I will read it. He concluded that this well is considered to have a severe--and severe is all capitalized in his memo--gas-flow problem. Now, it is very clear to me, reading this clear evidence, that, in fact, decisions were made because of costs, because people didn't want to wait to get the centralizers that was needed to safely do this job. So your statement that there is no evidence that costs led to shortcuts just doesn't ring true with me. Isn't it pretty clear that there were cost decisions made that had suboptimal at best number of centralizers in placement in this well? Mr. Hayward. I don't want to be evasive, but I genuinely believe that until we have understood all of the things that contributed to this accident, it is not easy to say what I would say. If there is evidence that costs were put ahead of safety, I would be both deeply disturbed, and we would take action. Mr. Inslee. Sir, let me ask you about that action. We just read these e-mails. Everybody in this room knows what happened, reading these e-mails. You know what happened in reading these e-mails. Are you going to call the employees involved when you leave this meeting and say--because you're drilling in places all over the world right now; this is an ongoing operation--and tell them they have to change their attitude? Are you going to take action based on these e-mails today? Mr. Hayward. We will take action based on our investigation which puts all of this together, and as--as it unveils clear conclusions, we will take action on them. Mr. Inslee. Let me suggest another action. We asked British Petroleum what it spent on research and development regarding safer offshore drilling technologies. You gave us the number. It was about $10 million a year. That represents 0.0033 percent, 0.0033 percent of British Petroleum revenues. That doesn't sound like an adequate prioritization. How does it compare to your compensation? Mr. Hayward. In what respect? Mr. Inslee. British Petroleum is investing about $10 million a year in safer drilling technology. How does that $10 million a year compare to you compensation last year? Mr. Hayward. My compensation last year was $6 million. Mr. Inslee. Forbes reports it at 33-. There must be some misunderstanding then. Is that appropriate? Stock options don't count? Mr. Hayward. My compensation last year was--is--I think it was recorded at $6 million. Mr. Inslee. Do you think British Petroleum ought to make a larger investment of its significant gross revenues in developing safer drilling technology? And do you think you owe that to the American people at this point? Mr. Hayward. The answer is yes, and we undoubtedly will do that on the back of this accident. Mr. Inslee. We hope that that will be expeditious and successful. Thank you. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Inslee. Mr. Melancon for questions, please. Mr. Melancon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. Mr. Hayward, how many deepwater operations do you have at BP around the world that you're operating? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the precise number, but it is probably in the order of 15 or so. Mr. Melancon. Is there--one of the things I have run into, and Mr. Scalise alluded to it, we have had in my office over 600 requests for submissions for products, ideas, concepts, ways to cap the wells, et cetera, et cetera. Basically--and, of course, because of ethics, we can't and won't go in and make anybody meet with anybody. So we just refer them into them. The best I can tell is that maybe 3 out of the 600-plus have received an e-mail back, thank you for your submission, or, no thank you, if anything else. There seems to be a closed loop of vendors that you're dealing with, which my frustration is that the hole is still wide open. And when this accident first occurred, everyone said, we are going to take whatever ideas and suggestions, whatever--I mean, the cofferdam, the top hat, whatever. But I have seen some people that have called me, and we referred them in, and they have never heard once from your company. Is this just if you're not a vendor with us before this occurred, then we are not dealing with you, or are you going to only the vendors and allowing them to select who they are going to deal with? And my reason for this is because if there are good ideas out there, why isn't somebody looking at them? Mr. Hayward. We are trying very hard to engage with everyone who has a good idea. We have been, quite frankly, inundated with hundreds of thousands. Mr. Melancon. I know there is a tremendous amount. I know that the first one I saw was wrapped--sheets around a cord hanging with milk cartons to catch oil. So I understand that. Those are easy to go through. Let me shift to another gear. Do you believe that this administration's moratorium is a result of the tragedy that occurred on Deepwater Horizon, the fact that they put it in was strictly because of what went wrong in Deepwater? Mr. Hayward. I don't know that, but I believe that is the case, and I think it is probably the right thing to do until such time as we have greater clarity. Mr. Melancon. And I agree with that. I don't agree with the moratorium because--and as I have expressed to my friends, it is really difficult for us in Louisiana to stand in oil and say we will take more oil, but it is because of the economy, it is because of the jobs we have supported--I have supported--the industry. I support the people. But it makes sense that BP bear the responsibility of the economic hardship associated with this moratorium. I think you all put 100 million aside for lost jobs. I'm told that in a given month--and I don't know if this is just Louisiana, offshore Louisiana or offshore--but it is about 350 million a month in wages. Are you and your company going to take responsibility and make sure that these companies that fold up or these companies that have financial hardships, and particularly their employees that they are going to start laying off, are going to be compensated in some way? Mr. Hayward. We made a contribution, having been asked to by the government, up to a fund which will be part of the funding for that issue. Mr. Melancon. Do you think 100 million is adequate? And you have been in the oil business for quite a while. Those are good-paying jobs; that is why we want to keep them. But do you think that contribution is adequate for---- Mr. Hayward. We made a contribution. We set aside $20 billion for claims. Mr. Melancon. Twenty billion is for everybody else, that is businesses and otherwise. I am concerned also with them. Ms. Roshto and Ms. Kemp were in Chalmette the other day. Very brave women, especially so soon after the deaths of their spouses. And at the hearing, Ms. Roshto and Ms. Kemp shared with us questions they had for your company. I would like to hear maybe your response. Ms. Roshto's husband told her about the problems on the rig, that the well was losing a lot of mud. That is the sort of detail that may not have come to your attention, but it is well known among workers on rigs as a sign of a problem. She wants to know, and she asked this question at the hearing, why your company wasn't working harder to fix the problems on the rig in the weeks before the explosion? Why wasn't your company prepared for a blowout? Mr. Hayward. I think, as I have said all along today, we want to understand exactly what happened such that we can take the right actions going forward. I'm not aware of what you just raised, but the investigation will determine whether or not-- the multiple investigations will determine---- Mr. Melancon. Investigations are not going to bring back those 11 men to their kids. Not only were these women concerned about your company's preparedness, they were also concerned about your company's values. They wanted to ensure that rigs were kept safe and told us that BP should be held accountable for not protecting their husbands. Mrs. Kemp asked why money is more important than someone's life. And so I guess on behalf of Ms. Kemp, how do you respond to that? Mr. Hayward. It isn't. It absolutely it is not. As--since I have been in this role, it is something I believed in for a very long time. The priority of everyone involved in these operations is safety. That doesn't come before anything, not anything. It is something that I believe personally very passionately. Mr. Melancon. The women talked about in their testimony-- I'm sorry, I have gone over my time. Mr. Stupak. Finish your question. Mr. Melancon. The women talked about in their testimony that their husbands worked for the drilling rig company, for Transocean, and that they pushed safety, they pushed safety, they pushed safety. But in discussions in weeks prior to the explosion, their husbands talked about BP waiving; saying, keep going, keep doing. And I have heard growing up in south Louisiana about the tool pusher or the drilling foreman and the company guys getting into fistfights. Was there any incidents, to your knowledge, or have you discovered that there was a direct order given by BP that says, keep going, I don't care what is going on? Mr. Hayward. I have not seen any evidence of that whatsoever, and I believe that the operation on the rig in the days leading up to the incident and in that day was carried out because everyone agreed on the rig to move forward. Mr. Melancon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Melancon. Ms. Castor for questions, please. Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, I would like to start out by expressing the anger and frustration of the hardworking people of my home State of Florida at the catastrophe BP has rendered upon our State and all the small businesses, the fishermen, the mom-and- pop hotel owners. We were just coming out of the most severe recession of our lifetime that happened in 2007. Things were getting a lot better. So this is like a sucker punch to the gut to learn that this tragedy is a result of BP elevating profit considerations over safety. For a decade many in Florida have opposed this drumbeat to bring the oil rigs closer to our beaches over time. We haven't industrialized our coastline like other States. We rely on tourism and clean beaches and clean water, and we really fought it off, even in the face of very well-paid lobbying campaigns and ad campaigns and with a lot of representations that this is safe, this is safe technology, whether it is in deep water or in shallow water. So, Mr. Hayward, I'm trying to understand how BP was either so unprepared for the possibility of a blowout or ignored the risks, because according to the Minerals Management Service study conducted in 2007, 126 blowouts have occurred at offshore drilling facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf since 1971. In 1979, a blowout at the Ixtoc oil well in the Gulf of Mexico created a disaster that flowed continuously for 290 days. And, Mr. Hayward, you have said that the chances of a blowout and explosion like the one that sank the Deepwater Horizon rig were one in a million, but over the past 40 years, there have been 126 blowouts in the U.S. waters alone. That is roughly three blowouts per year. How could an average of three blowouts every single year for the past 40 years not have registered as more than a one-in-a-million chance risk for your company? Mr. Hayward. With respect, Congresswoman, I think what I said was that the integrity rating of the blowout preventer was of the order of 10 to the minus 5, 10 to the minus 6. That is to say that it was designed to fail between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in a million times. Ms. Castor. And that is an acceptable risk? Mr. Hayward. It is the risk that BP and the industry more broadly use to assess the failsafe mechanism called the blowout preventer. Ms. Castor. I know you rely on these blowout preventers, and you call them failsafes, but they are not failsafes at all in the face of what we have discovered through our committee's examination and the statistics here. This committee has reviewed BP's regional oil spill response plan for the Gulf of Mexico, and not one time in the 582-page plan does BP lay out a method for controlling a subsea gusher after a blowout has occurred. Your company conducted its planning as if an uncontrolled subsea blowout wasn't even a possibility. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, you admitted, what is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit. My question to you is very simple: Why not? Why weren't you prepared? Why did you elevate profits over safety? Mr. Hayward. I don't believe we did elevate profits over safety. What I was referring to in that article was the very complicated engineering problem we were faced with after the rig sank attached to its riser. So we had a well, a riser and a rig on the floor, and we didn't have the pieces of equipment instantly available to cut the riser, to cut off the top of the riser and find a way to intervene on the wellhead. And that is indeed true. Ms. Castor. Mr. Hayward, for years big oil companies and your allies have claimed that drilling is safe, and you want to come closer to Florida beaches, and you say it is safe, deep or shallow, that there are no problems. But on the other hand, we have heard over and over again over the last couple of months this is complex and this is dangerous, it is dangerous to drill miles below the ocean. And BP officials have said it is like operating in outer space, and given the difficulties and complexities in what we really knew, in what you knew about the risks, I can't understand why you all would assume that nothing could go wrong. So I'm--the doublespeak is rather tiresome. I'm dismayed and disheartened by what has happened and the elevation of profit over safety. And I can only hope that this disaster will motivate us to reassess our priorities and implement a clean energy policy for this country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Well, that concludes questions of everybody on the committee. Now there is a few more questions. There are a couple of Members that have a couple of follow-up questions. So we are going to go a quick second round, if we may. So I will start with Chairman Waxman, if you would like to begin. Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, you said your priority, your top focus, is on safety, and you feel very passionate about it. Except for your statement to that effect, I see, as you have said over and over again today, no evidence of that. You and other senior officials seemed oblivious to what was happening on the Deepwater Horizon rig. You weren't following the progress of the well. You weren't aware of the risks that were being taken. In answers to questions you said that your top officials under you, Mr. Ingles and Mr. Suttles, you would be surprised if they were following the happenings on the rig. You said you couldn't answer for them, but you would be surprised if they had been following the activities on the drilling rig. So who was following the activities on the drilling rig? You said there were people there who were the experts in their field. I just find it shocking that when the potential consequences of a mistake on a deepwater rig are so enormous, and you have such a high, passionate commitment to safety, that you seem so removed. I think operating in a deepwater environment is like operating in outer space, and yet you seem to think that all is going to be taken care of in time. Now, you said there is a team of the best minds in the world working on how to stop the oil spill. When were the best minds in your company paying attention before the spill? You were oblivious, and so were other senior officials. And I think this was a fundamental mistake in management. Let me ask you that: Do you think there was a fundamental mistake in management not to know? Mr. Hayward. I think, as I have said, that we have made it very clear that the focus in the company is on safety. What management can do is ensure that the right people with the right skills are in place, and the right systems and processes are in place, and the right priorities are in place, and the right investment is available to ensure that the plant that we are operating has integrity. Mr. Waxman. So you felt confident that the people who were making these decisions--and we went through five in our letter to you, and many Members asked you about some of these decisions--that the right people were making those decisions? Mr. Hayward. I believe that the right people were making those decisions. Mr. Waxman. And you have no evidence that they didn't make the right decision. That seems to be your position today; is that right? Mr. Hayward. I think at this stage in the investigation, it is premature to draw conclusions as to what was and what was not the right decision. Mr. Waxman. So it is premature. What investigation or investigations are taking place to determine these facts? Mr. Hayward. There is the BP investigation, there is the Marine Board investigation and the Presidential commission. Mr. Waxman. And are you going to be cooperating with all of them? Mr. Hayward. We are, as we have, Mr. Chairman, cooperated with your committee. Mr. Waxman. Well, I question how cooperative you have been with our committee, because I have heard very little answers to the questions from you today to the questions raised by our colleagues. You were asked whether BP made a mistake in well design. You said you haven't reached a conclusion yet. Mr. Dingell asked whether costs were a factor in your decisions, and you said you didn't know because you weren't there. When Mr. Doyle asked you who made the well design decisions, you said you didn't know. Our committee is doing an investigation. Now, the reason we are doing an investigation is we want to know how this happened so that we can make changes in the law and the procedures if we are going to allow further drilling. Don't you think you ought to be more forthcoming with us? Mr. Hayward. We will be as forthcoming as we can be, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Waxman. Give me the time horizon for your investigation. When will you have that completed? You have already had 60 days to do it. Is it going on now? Mr. Hayward. It is ongoing. And we want to have access to all of the evidence before we make final determinations. But as we have made very clear---- Mr. Waxman. Give me your estimate of when that will be concluded. Mr. Hayward. One of the most important elements in this is the blowout preventer. It remains on the seabed, and it needs to be examined. Mr. Waxman. So we will put that aside. How about the other decisions before the explosion about the casing, about the centering of the well, about all of the other things that have been raised, have you reached any tentative conclusions that you can share with us? Mr. Hayward. As we shared with you recently, we have identified 7 areas, areas of focus in our investigation. And we will continue to share our understanding and our thinking with you as that develops. Mr. Waxman. Mr. Inslee asked you if there was any action that appeared--if there was any action to save money, and you said there is no evidence of that. I can't believe you said there is no evidence of that. There is evidence. You want to know more about it, but there is evidence to that effect, isn't there? Mr. Hayward. There were decisions taken by the people at the time, and some of them, sitting here today, appear they may have been to deal with money. But it is not clear. The---- Mr. Waxman. The evidence is not conclusive, but there is evidence. Mr. Hayward. The decision, for example, to run a long string versus a liner was, as it shows in the document that you highlighted to me, a decision to do with the long-term integrity of the well. Mr. Waxman. There is evidence, and evidence may point in a certain direction. There may be evidence that points in another direction. So you take the evidence and reach a conclusion based on the preponderance of the evidence. That is not to say there is not evidence, when we have some of these clear examples. Let me ask you this. You can't give us a time for when this investigation is going to be complete, so we are relying on you to do your own investigation. Why should we rely on you to do your own investigation? I don't think you have a terrific record of reliability that should give us comfort to have us step back and just wait to get answers from you until you have done your own investigation. Why should we rely on that? Mr. Hayward. We are clearly not the only people doing an investigation. There are many people doing investigations. All I have committed is that as our investigation proceeds, we will share with you all of our findings and all of the data and all of the information. Mr. Waxman. Let me just say in conclusion, we delayed this hearing today so you could be prepared to answer our questions. We sent you our questions in advance, yet you have consistently ducked and evaded our questions. There may be some reason you think this approach makes sense, but your evasion will make our job more difficult. It will impede our understanding of what went wrong and will make it harder for us to draft appropriate reforms. I think that is regrettable and an unfortunate approach for you to take to the work of this committee of the United States Congress. And I will look forward to seeing what you come up with, but we are going to get evidence, and I would like you to submit for the record the names of the individuals who made those decisions in each of the areas that were under discussion in the letter we sent you. Would you be willing to do that. Mr. Hayward. We will make that available to you---- Mr. Waxman. Thank you. Mr. Hayward [continuing]. As we have made everything, to my knowledge, available to you. Mr. Waxman. Maybe they will have some answers they can share with us. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Barton for questions. Mr. Barton. Thank you, Chairman Stupak. We are about to finish up this hearing. We do appreciate your patience in listening to all the various members of the subcommittee. What one or two recommendations are you prepared to give about what we could do to prevent a future accident of this type now that you know what you know and you have listened to what the Congress knows here today? Are there one or two things that you would like to suggest for consideration to prevent an accident of this type from happening in the future? Mr. Hayward. I believe the most important one is to take the failsafe mechanism called the blowout preventer and design is such that it is genuinely failsafe. The reality in all industrial accidents is that there are always a combination of equipment failure and human judgment. And the most important thing is to have in place a system that is genuinely failsafe. And it is clear, based on our experience of this accident, that the current design basis of the blowout preventer being used in the deep water, not just in this case, but across the world, is not as failsafe as we believed it to be. And I believe that is a very important lesson that the industry needs to grasp, along with the relevant regulatory agencies. Mr. Barton. Much has been made of the complexity and the risks associated with drilling these deep wells. Would you care to--I have asked some of your subordinates to give us some sort of an assessment of the potential size of this particular field of this particular well. I have asked the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Geological Survey what the largest onshore oil well in Texas in its history of over 100 years has been, and with the exception of the initial discovery at Spindletop in 1901, we can't find a record of any well on shore in Texas, which has been the number one oil-producing State in the country for over 100 years, with the exception of a few years where Alaska at Prudhoe Bay, at its peak that flowed at 50,000 barrels a day. And the latest estimates are that this well in this condition could be flowing as much as 50,000 barrels a day. If you extrapolate that on an annual basis, that is over 100 million barrels of oil a year. So could you give us some assessment of why BP and other companies go to such extraordinary measures to drill in these areas? What is it that you think you found or are hoping to find beneath the Gulf of Mexico? Mr. Hayward. In the instance of this well, we believe that the discovery was of the order of 50 million barrels. Mr. Barton. Fifty million? Mr. Hayward. Fifty million barrels. That is our estimate of the discovery--the size of the discovery that this well made. Mr. Barton. So at the rate it is flowing, it ought to peter out pretty quickly; 50,000 barrels a day is 350,000 barrels a week, which is 3.5 million in 10 weeks, which is 35 million in 100 weeks. So I was told it was on the order of 500 million barrels. Mr. Hayward. That is not correct, Congressman. This is a discovery based on the--clearly on the well and the seismic information we had available to us, which is---- Mr. Barton. So it is just that the extreme pressure--I mean, it couldn't flow at this rate in full production? Mr. Hayward. That's correct. Mr. Barton. Is that a fair statement? Mr. Hayward. That's correct. Mr. Barton. Would you care to tell us what it would flow at, what you expected it to flow at per day? Mr. Hayward. I think at a producing well, properly completed, we would expect it to be between perhaps 15- and 25,000 barrels a day. Mr. Barton. And lastly, with the moratorium that is currently in existence in the Gulf of Mexico for the deep areas, the 6-month moratorium, I know you have to do--we want you to stop this spill and clean it up, but there are other areas that could be explored. What other areas might BP go to instead of in the Gulf of Mexico? Mr. Hayward. Well, we have deepwater drilling exploration and production operations in a large number of locations around the world; in West Africa, Brazil, Egypt, to name the three, as well as the U.K. in the North Sea. Mr. Barton. So you would focus on those areas if this moratorium continues? Mr. Hayward. We are focused today on the relief well. Mr. Barton. I understand that, and you should be. You better be. Mr. Hayward. I haven't thought, frankly, beyond the relief wells in terms of activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Barton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Barton. Mr. Hayward, in the line of questioning throughout the day, you have referred to the blowout preventer. Mr. Gonzalez, when he asked you questions, and Mr. Barton just asked some questions on there. Back on June 4th, you wrote an editorial for the Wall Street Journal. In talking about the blowout preventer, you stated, we in the industry have long had great confidence in the blowout preventer as the ultimate failsafe piece of safety equipment, yet on this occasion it failed with disastrous consequences. Do you still believe the blowout preventer should be considered the ultimate failsafe? Mr. Hayward. I believe so. Either a blowout preventer or some similar mechanism. Mr. Stupak. I'm a little surprised by your comments, because the committee received a document--you have the document binder right there. You may want to refer to it--that evaluated the blowout preventer used on the Deepwater Horizon rig. The document was prepared in 2001. It is tab No. 14 right there, and we have put it up on the screen. In 2001, when Transocean bought the blowout preventer, I want to show the executive summary in which BP participated with it in this review. And it says, engineering and operations personnel identified 260 failure modes. Do you see where it says that towards about top third of it? OK. So BP engineers helped to identify these 260 failure modes. So how can you write or how can you testify--but how can you write in the Wall Street Journal 2 weeks ago that you thought the blowout preventer was the ultimate failsafe when your own engineers examined the blowout preventer 9 years ago and found 260 failure modes in it? How can you ever say it is the ultimate failsafe? Mr. Hayward. I haven't seen this document previously. I apologize for that, but I haven't. Mr. Stupak. Well, now knowing there are 260 failsafe modes in this blowout preventer that was on Deepwater Horizon, it never was the ultimate failsafe, was it? Mr. Hayward. The blowout preventer is designed to be the ultimate failsafe. That is the design basis. It is the basis for which the industry has operated for 30 years in deep water. Mr. Stupak. Let me ask you this: As the CEO, why, then, did your company change the blowout preventer failsafe method or mechanism? For instance, we found other things that showed that this blowout preventer was not failsafe. At our first hearing, May 12th, I asked in review of it that the blowout preventer had been modified in ways which would increase the risk that it would blow out, that it wouldn't work. OK? One modification, for instance, was to remove the important variable bore ram and replaced it with a test ram that made it ineffective in case of an emergency. At our hearing I asked Mr. McKay, who is the president of BP America, about these modifications. He testified under oath, he took the oath, and he said he didn't know anything about modifications. We have since learned that BP approved modifications despite being warned that it would reduce the safety of the blowout preventer. I would like to display it again. It is tab No. 10 right in your book right there. Here is a letter from 2004 from Transocean sent to BP that BP signed and acknowledged. And it says, BP acknowledges that the conversion--the conversion you asked for--the conversion will reduce the built-in redundancy of the BOP, thereby potentially increasing the contractor's risk profile. So what does that mean, BP, that you reduce the built-in redundancy, increase your risk? You asked for modifications which limit the redundancy and increase your risk, right? BP did. Mr. Hayward. Again, I haven't seen this document previously. What I do know, there were modifications made to the blowout preventer. In particular a test bore ram was added. It was not a subtraction. It was an addition to the blowout preventer is my understanding. Mr. Stupak. But here is our problem. Your territory will say this is the ultimate failsafe. We find out it is modified. We ask your representative, Mr. McKay; he says no, no. We get down to the hearing, we get documents showing, in fact, BP asked for it. BP was warned that the ultimate failsafe system, the way BP wanted it modified will increase the risk of a problem. And that is the one we have here in Deepwater Horizon. So how can we write an editorial--you can't have it both ways here. How can we write an editorial saying, ``Oh, this is the ultimate system''--and even your own engineers said there are 260 different ways it can fail. Then you add some more to it. Mr. Hayward. The---- Mr. Stupak. Go ahead. Mr. Hayward. The blowout preventer is designed to be the failsafe mechanism in the drilling industry. Mr. Stupak. Correct. Mr. Hayward. That has been the case since blowout preventers were created. Mr. Stupak. But you are the CEO. You have been head of exploration, drilling, all this. Does it make sense to you that this is the ultimate failsafe system when there are 260 different ways it can go wrong? Plus, you, your company modifies it, which increased the risk of things going wrong? Mr. Hayward. The fact is, it is the ultimate failsafe mechanism. Mr. Stupak. Let me ask you this. OK, this well, you started drilling it last fall, the Macondo well, last fall, using the different rig, the Marianas. It was harmed, it was damaged in the hurricane, so you replaced it with Deepwater Horizon. In November of last year, Transocean pulled out the blowout preventer from the ocean floor because its shear rams weren't working. The lower annular would not close, and the upper annular had been stripped through during a well-control event. We know that BP was aware of this because Transocean--and, again, it is Document No. 12 there in our binder--reflect conference calls with BP about the problems with this blowout preventer. In addition, Transocean records indicate the incidents state that the estimated down time forced by the malfunction is a conservative 10 days at $444,111 per day, or $4.4 million, as it shows. So how can you say blowout preventers are failsafe devices when the blowout preventer you are using on the well in November had to be removed because of malfunctions? Mr. Hayward. Well, of course, the answer is, they are the failsafe mechanism, and when problems are identified with them, they are rectified. And I believe that is what has taken place. Mr. Stupak. You know, you can't have it both ways here. This accident occurs. You have a blowout preventer you know had 260 different errors in it, ways it could go wrong. You modify it. You pull it in November of 2009. You see there are all kinds of problems. This accident happens. So you write this editorial in the Wall Street Journal saying, ``Hey, it ain't our fault. It's mechanical.'' You said earlier, an accident is because of mechanical failure and human judgment--human error. It seems like we have more human error than mechanical, because the mechanical safeguard, the ultimate failsafe, really wasn't an ultimate failsafe. They can fail in many ways, and that is exactly what went wrong here and that is what happened on the 20th.Correct? Mr. Hayward. What is clear is that the ultimate failsafe failed to operate in this case. That is absolutely clear. Mr. Stupak. Why would a company like BP, when you are doing this deepwater drilling, modify the ultimate failsafe if it is supposed to protect the American people and our environment? Why would you modify it, increase the risk of problems? You knowing it, you sign a document. The contractor warns you not to do it, and you still do it. That is the problem we are having. Mr. Hayward. As I said, the blowout preventer is the failsafe mechanism. It is designed to be exactly that. Mr. Stupak. Questions, Mr. Burgess? Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, it has been a long day. You said earlier, if I recall correctly, that everyone in your organization, in the culture of safety, not only had the right to curtail operations but the obligation if they saw something going on that was not safe. Is that correct? Mr. Hayward. That is correct. Mr. Burgess. And in response to a question from the other side of the dais, and I don't remember who asked it, you also made the assertion that the right people were making the decisions on the rig. Did I hear that correctly? Mr. Hayward. I believe that is the case. Mr. Burgess. Who is Donald Vidrine? Mr. Hayward. He is the well site leader on--one of the well site leaders on the Deepwater Horizon. Mr. Burgess. So he was referred to in a Wall Street Journal article as the company man or the BP man on the Deepwater Horizon the day of the blowout. Is that correct? Mr. Hayward. That is correct, yes. Mr. Burgess. I don't know if you are familiar with the article that was in the Wall Street Journal, and this has been several weeks ago, on May 27th, I believe. They talked about a skirmish between some of the Transocean folks, the chief engineer or chief mechanic on the Deepwater Horizon, and the rig's top manager, Jimmy Harrell. Are you familiar with that discussion that apparently was quite a heated discussion? I think Mr. Gonzalez was actually the one that brought it up. Mr. Hayward. It is my understanding, Congressman, that that account has been contradicted under oath in the Marine Board investigation and that there was no debate or skirmish or any other heated discussion. That is what--I can't recall exactly who it was, but, under oath at the Marine Board investigation, I believe it was the Transocean tool pusher, testified that there was no either heated discussion or debate or anything else. Mr. Burgess. Would that would be the tool pusher Miles Ezell? Mr. Hayward. I believe that is the case, sir. Mr. Burgess. It wasn't Dewey Revette, because he died in the accident. And he was one of the other witnesses to the altercation. Well, you know, if this occurred, even if it only partially occurred, it just seems like there was enough discussion that someone should say, ``Wait, let's not go forward with this because at least some of our number feel it is unsafe.'' And, again, you said that the men would have the obligation, not just the right, to say let's halt; he would have the obligation to say, well, let's get everyone on the same page with this. Am I wrong to assume that? Mr. Hayward. You are not wrong. And I think you can only conclude they all believed that it was right to proceed. Mr. Burgess. Are we ever going to get a chance to talk to Mr. Vidrine? Will BP make him available to our committee? Mr. Hayward. If you call him, of course. Mr. Burgess. Let me ask you another question. You said in response to some information that came up that there was no evidence that BP was focusing on the cost of drilling. And, yet, March 2010 strategy presentation, you stated, ``We have added exploration resources efficiently. Our discovery cost was $1.40 per barrel in 2009. This is consistent with our track record over the last 5 years of having the lowest discovery costs in the industry.'' Now, certainly, that would be enviable, except, in a culture of safety, I mean, I might even spend $1.45 or $1.47, instead of just $1.40, if it meant that it was a safe procedure. So was maintaining the lowest-cost discovery in the industry possibly a factor in the decision-making on this well? Mr. Hayward. None whatsoever. But that metric is created by dividing the volume of barrels discovered by the costs. And what it talks to is the success of our exploration program and the scale of the volume that we have discovered, not anything to do with costs. Mr. Burgess. Well, but it does have something to do with cost. Now, it has been reported that completion of the Macondo well was running behind schedule. Is this accurate? Mr. Hayward. I believe it was running behind schedule, that is correct. Mr. Burgess. How far behind schedule? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the precise number. Mr. Burgess. What does it cost today to run a rig like that? Mr. Hayward. That sort of rig, fully built up, the cost is probably a million dollars a day or thereabouts. Mr. Burgess. So, even a couple of days over is a significant cost driver on that $1.40-a-barrel minimal discovery cost in the industry. Mr. Hayward. Well, with respect, Congressman, the most important thing was that actually we had made a discovery, and we wanted to secure it in the proper way. And that was going to be a far bigger driver of any value that the company was going to create than the cost of the operation. Mr. Burgess. I don't disagree with that. But, oh, how I wish that that had been the case, as we are investing hearing after hearing after hearing on this thing case and the darned thing is still bubbling down at the bottom of the gulf. That doesn't seem to be accurate. Is your own investigation looking at the issue of whether or not cost drivers were an issue in the problems that were created? Mr. Hayward. Our investigation is covering everything. Mr. Burgess. So it wasn't on your list, but, nevertheless, it will be included in your---- Mr. Hayward. Well, my list is the early findings of the investigation in terms of the key areas to focus on--areas around cement, casing, the integrity test---- Mr. Burgess. Got it. Mr. Hayward. --well control procedures. Mr. Burgess. I got it. We are running out of time here. But when you said your investigation was proceeding without privilege early on in the hearing today--so it would also cover the issues of whether or not cost drivers were an issue in creating the problems? Mr. Hayward. It will cover everything. Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I would just echo what Mr. Scalise said earlier. We get calls all day or night, faxes come in, people have got ideas on how to fix our problem in the gulf. I really wish you guys would open up an 800 number and take these things and vet them and listen to what people are saying. Americans are terribly--we have a lot of ingenuity in America. And people are watching that thing that Mr. Markey made everyone's computer screen show 24 hours a day. It is driving people crazy to watch that thing bubbling in the gulf. People are coming to us with solutions. There needs to be a central location. I don't care whether it is you, I don't care whether it is Dr. Chu, but somebody needs to be vetting these things and, if there is a reasonable idea out there, put it to work. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Mr. Markey for questions. Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Mr. Hayward, is the most optimistic date for the relief well to be completed still August? Mr. Hayward. That is our current timetable. Mr. Markey. Is August also the earliest date the leak can be stopped? Or will it take more time after the relief well is complete before the flow of oil is permanently halted? Mr. Hayward. The relief well will halt permanently the flow of oil. Mr. Markey. Mr. Hayward, in 2009, an independent firm that BP hired to serve as its ombudsman, headed by former Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin, substantiated that BP was violating its own policies by not having completed engineering documents onboard another BP rig operating in the Gulf of Mexico, the BP Atlantis, when it began operating in 2007. One BP official warned that the absence of these safety documents could lead to catastrophic operator error. Let me read to you from an internal BP e-mail. And this goes from Barry Duff, BP employee, to other engineers at BP. Here is what he said. He said, ``The P&IDs for subsea are not complete and have not been approved, are handed over to operations. The current procedures are out of date. The risk in turning over drawings to the people out on the rig running the Atlantis that are not complete are: number one, the operator, the BP operator, will assume the drawings are accurate and up to date. This could lead to catastrophic operator errors due to their assuming the drawing is correct. Turning over incomplete drawings to the operator, the BP operator, for their use is a fundamental violation of basic document control. Having the project document control person turn over drawings that are not complete places the onus on her that they are the most current version. Currently, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of subsea documents that have never been finalized yet the facilities have been turned over.'' Mr. Hayward, BP's managing attorney stated to the Associated Press on May 15th of this year that BP has reviewed the allegations and found them to be unsubstantiated. Mr. Hayward, were all of the engineering documents and drawings necessary to operate the Atlantis rig safely and fully completed before the Atlantis rig began operating in the Gulf of Mexico? Mr. Hayward. When this issue emerged, we conducted a full investigation and determined that all of the drawings that were necessary to start up the operation were available to the people starting up the operation at the time the operation started up. Mr. Markey. Mr. Hayward, Mr. Duff was relieved of his duties in the middle of August of 2008. A new person was put in charge as a result. His name is Ken Abbott. Ken Abbott has been testifying all day in Washington across the street in the Natural Resources Committee. He is a whistleblower. He got fired 6 months after he replaced Mr. Duff because he raised the very same concerns, that there was not proper documentation on the BP Atlantis. He was fired even though he raised issues that obviously have a lot of resemblance to the kind of attention to the safety protocols that were part of the BP-Horizon rig. Is it part of your policy, Mr. Hayward, to fire employees who raise questions about the safety of your rigs? Mr. Hayward. No, it is not. Mr. Markey. Well, Mr. Hayward, I am afraid that that is what happened to Mr. Abbott. Because not only was he fired, but 2 weeks later they put out--and was told that he was just part of a force reduction, but your company then put out an advertisement to hire someone to replace him on that job. Earlier, you said all of the other BP wells in the Gulf of Mexico that had been completed are secure and are safe to operate. Do you still stand by that? Mr. Hayward. I do. Mr. Markey. Now, do you know that Judge Sporkin said that it is not true that the documents were completed when he substantiated Mr. Abbott's allegations? So how do you account for that, that you hire an ombudsman, he is a former Federal district court judge, he comes in, he does the evaluation, and he substantiates the whistleblower's allegations? How do you in any way justify then firing the person who actually brought these issues to your attention? Mr. Hayward. As I said, the investigation concluded that the drawings necessary for start-up were on the Atlantis facility. Judge Sporkin, our ombudsman, is investigating the issue of unfair dismissal, which is quite appropriate. Mr. Markey. Well, I ask for you to provide a copy of the investigation which you are conducting, Mr. Hayward, for the record. Mr. Hayward. We can do that. Mr. Markey. OK. We will put that in the record. I think, Mr. Hayward, that the only thing worse than one BP rig at the bottom of the ocean in the Gulf of Mexico would be two BP rigs at the bottom of the ocean. I think this is just another example of you running through all of the red lights, all of the warnings. Judge Sporkin is one of the most respected people in this city. He has corroborated the charges that were being made by this now-fired employee who was raising safety concerns. I am afraid, once again, it is a blistering, scalding indictment of the lack of a culture of safety that you had at BP. And I just think that it is something that has to end before we see another disaster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. Thank you. Before I go to Mr. Latta, let me ask unanimous consent that we have the document binder be entered in the record, provided that the committee staff may redact any information that is business propriety, relates to privacy concerns, or is law- enforcement sensitive. Mr. Markey. Mr. Chairman, may I just ask for 30 seconds, one additional question? Mr. Stupak. Let me finish what I am doing here. Mr. Markey. OK. Mr. Stupak. Without objection, the documents will be entered into the record. [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.] Mr. Markey. May I just ask---- Mr. Stupak. It has to be really quick, Ed. You never ask a 30-second question. Mr. Markey. Mr. Hayward, will you shut down the BP Atlantis until these safety questions have been answered? Mr. Hayward. I believe they have been fully resolved, Congressman. Mr. Markey. I do not think that that is the case. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stupak. We will take time for Mr. Latta. Mr. Latta for questions, please? Mr. Latta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I could just follow up with some questioning that Ranking Member Burgess was on, talking about the schedule. My first question is, what is the process that BP executives have developed when it comes to schedules, especially for the offshore wells in the gulf? Is there a schedule? Who makes the schedules? Mr. Hayward. The schedule, the drilling program for the--is that the---- Mr. Latta. Right. Who is in charge of the scheduling for those? Mr. Hayward. The drilling programs are created by the engineering team, overseen by the vice president for drilling and completions and the business unit leader and, in this case, the exploration manager in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Latta. Now, are you consulted in the development and maintenance of those schedules? Mr. Hayward. I am sorry? Mr. Latta. Are you consulted at all in the development or maintenance of those schedules? Mr. Hayward. I am not. Mr. Latta. Is there a committee higher up that is then consulted at BP about those schedules? Mr. Hayward. About the schedules of drilling? Mr. Latta. Correct. Mr. Hayward. There are several groups that would look at the schedules of drilling. Mr. Latta. Now, I guess in a corporate structure, how high up would those committees be or those groups that would be looked at that? Mr. Hayward. It would be within the Gulf of Mexico business unit. Mr. Latta. Let me ask this: Would a well of this type, being as deep as it is, being as tough as it would be, it sounds like, to drill, would that elevate it to a higher standing that folks higher up at BP would be consulted on it? Or is it just still kept in the gulf with that region right there? Mr. Hayward. The design and operating practices would be signed off at the level of the vice president of drilling and completions in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Latta. OK. So you would never be consulted on that then? Mr. Hayward. No. Mr. Latta. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Latta. Mr. Braley for questions, please. Mr. Braley. Mr. Hayward, at the beginning of this hearing, I showed you a couple of short video clips from two of the women who testified last week at our field hearing in Chalmette, Natalie Roshto and Courtney Kemp. And one of the questions they posed during that hearing was what they would tell to their children about why their fathers died on this Deepwater Horizon rig. You began your testimony a very long time ago today with these words: ``The explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened.'' What do you think that those two young mothers should tell their children about why this happened, based on what you know? Mr. Hayward. Based on what I know, that this was a tragic accident involving many failure mechanisms. That is the reality. That is why this happened. Mr. Braley. Is there blame to go around among all of the companies that were working on that well site? Mr. Hayward. I don't believe now is the time to try and apportion blame. I believe now is the time to try and understand what happened. And that is what the investigations are trying to do. Mr. Braley. Well, the reason I am asking that is because, during other congressional hearings, there has been finger- pointing on. And I assume you have been following what has been going on in the hearings and are aware of that. Mr. Hayward. As I said, I don't believe that this is the time to finger-point or apportion blame. I believe this is a time to understand fully what caused this accident such that the industry and BP can learn for the future. Mr. Braley. Well, I am glad you brought that up, because one of the things that BP has been taking responsibility for is the cleanup costs and the payment of all legitimate claims. We have heard that phrase over and over again. And we have also seen press accounts where BP spokespeople have said, as the responsible party, we are required to handle those claims, and then we will wait until some later date to deal with the apportionment of responsibility among the various parties. Are you aware of that? Mr. Hayward. I am. Mr. Braley. Well, let's talk briefly about the claims process and some of the problems that are currently part of that process. One of the things we know is that, under the oil pollution claims process, a claimant can't file suit until a presentment of claim is made. Are you familiar with that process? Mr. Hayward. I am not familiar with the details. But what I can say is we have set up an independent claims facility under Ken Feinberg. He will have the full authority to adjudicate on claims. Within that system, there will be an opportunity for anyone to appeal to three judges. That system does nothing to deny anyone any rights with respect to any other claims process. It is simply a way of expediting the claims process such that it is fair, efficient, and fast. Mr. Braley. I want to talk to you about that, because this is what I have been hearing from people involved in the preliminary claims process with BP. I have been informed that BP's position, under their current claims process, is that a submission of a claim is not a presentment for the purpose of beginning a claims process under the Oil Pollution Act. And the reason BP has taken that position is because they do not consider it to be for a sum certain if there are future losses that have not yet been determined or if there are ongoing economic losses with no date certain. Are you aware of this process? Mr. Hayward. I am aware in general terms of the process. Mr. Braley. Well, do you understand the problem that creates for somebody with an ongoing economic loss, like Ronnie Duplessis, the shrimp boat officer who testified at our hearing last week, who is without work because the fishing beds that are part of what he does for a living are not available to him? Mr. Hayward. We are endeavoring--I believe we have put in place a process whereby we pay money and it means nothing about future liabilities. Mr. Braley. Yes, but my question---- Mr. Hayward. No one has given away the opportunity to claim future liabilities. Mr. Braley. I am not implying that. I am talking about a process that actually puts money in the hands of people who desperately need it because their income source has been destroyed by this oil disaster at your rig. Do you understand their frustration, when they have gotten a check, in the case of Mr. Duplessis, for $5,000, which represents a very small amount of the monthly gross income he gets from his business, to feed his family? Mr. Hayward. I understand fully. I have spoken to many people on the gulf coast, to fishermen, to shrimpers, to small hotel owners, and I---- Mr. Braley. Can you understand, then, sir, why they are frustrated? If BP is taking the position in this claims presentment process that every time they cannot define their future economic loss they have to submit another claim as soon as that loss becomes defined for a fixed period of time and then another claim and another--do you understand how that could be frustrating? Mr. Hayward. I do, Congressman. And---- Mr. Braley. So---- Mr. Hayward [continuing]. In terms of the last weekend--if you would just let me finish, please--we have put in place a process for small businesses where they can project forward for the next month what it is they expect to lose by way of cash flow, and we will pay it now. I am very conscious of the issue of small businesses who have ongoing cash-flow demands. So we are trying very hard to ensure that money is paid in advance for commitments for people have already taken, rather than in arrears. And that is what we will continue to do. Mr. Braley. And will that be part of the fund that Judge Feinberg is administering? Mr. Hayward. That process will be transferred into Ken Feinberg's process, and that is the basis on which we will move forward. Mr. Braley. Thank you. Mr. Hayward. And in the course of the last week, we have paid out over $15 million to small businesses on that basis. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Braley. Mr. Welch for questions. Mr. Welch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, can you point to any single bad decision that was made in connection with Deepwater Horizon? Mr. Hayward. As I have said often today, I am not prepared to point today, with a half-complete investigation, as to what was and was not a bad decision. There are many components to this accident, to do with, as I have said, the casing, how it was run; the cement job, how it was conducted; integrity tests that may or may not have been well-interpreted. At all stages, everyone on the rig decided that the right thing to do was to continue. We need to understand how that came about. Mr. Welch. I understand that. But, with the benefit of hindsight and whatever investigatory work has been done, both by you and by others, at this moment, 57 days after this event, is there anything you can identify that was done wrong? Mr. Hayward. I am not able to draw that conclusion at this time. Mr. Welch. OK. Well, yesterday, Mr. Hayward, I think BP took a very constructive step in agreeing to deposit $20 billion in an independently administered fund to compensate victims and to pay for the cleanup. It was a first step in establishing confidence in BP, confidence that BP's words would be matched by their deeds. But today, regrettably, your appearance here has done a good deal, at least for me, to erode that confidence. We know you are not an engineer, and we know that you were not on the Deepwater Horizon. But your answer 65 times that you don't know to questions that were reasonably posed to you on both sides of the aisle erodes confidence; it doesn't inspire confidence. You know, the question that any company has to ask itself is whether it has strict procedures in place to make disciplined decisions that give it confidence that, at a critical moment, where the lives of its workers and the investment of its shareholders is at stake, critical judgment will be exercised. And that is the obligation of the CEO. However it is you accomplish that ability to hold your workers accountable and support them, that is the job of the CEO, whether it is a small company or a large company. And at that very critical moment when that well was going to be capped and decisions had to be made about the ceiling of the well, whether to use a cheaper and quicker casing design, whether to use more or fewer casing centralizers, whether to run a critical cementing test, whether or not to circulate drilling mud, it does not appear that anybody was in charge. And that is the erosion of confidence, because the lack of procedures, the lack of people being in charge, and resorting to the least-cost alternative clearly played a major role in this catastrophe. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Welch. Mr. Scalise for questions, please. Mr. Scalise. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, going back for a few more of the questions that we continue to have, why was a cement bond log not performed? Mr. Hayward. I don't know why a cement bond log wasn't performed. I wasn't there. I didn't take the decision. What I understand---- Mr. Scalise. I know you have to---- Mr. Hayward. What I understand from discussion with the investigation team is that the conclusion reached on the rig by BP, Transocean, was that they had a good cement job, that they had got returns at the surface, that the right volume had been pumped, and they had pressure integrity. Mr. Scalise. And they based that on readings of some other test that they performed, or---- Mr. Hayward. On the basis of those three things, they determined that they had a good cement job. And it was on that basis---- Mr. Scalise. So there is no BP procedure to perform that test. You leave it up to the discretion of the company man on the rig or somebody else on the rig? Mr. Hayward. There is no requirement to perform a cement bond log. Mr. Scalise. Are you going to change that policy and make it a requirement? Mr. Hayward. It is one of the things we need to look at in the light of this accident. Mr. Scalise. When we talk about, you know, all these different ideas--and, like I said, I just gave you some. We get lots of them. I tried to filter some out. I don't know if you have seen the presentation of people putting hay in the water, and the oil comes on to the hay and the water doesn't, and then it rolls up and you can clear that away--all kinds of ideas like that. What is your process for all of these people that are submitting ideas, many of which have tremendous merit and then none of which we see being used in the water? Mr. Hayward. Well, I think, with respect, we have used many of the ideas that have been submitted, Congressman. We do have a process, and there are thousands, hundreds of thousands, actually, of ideas that have been submitted. And we have a process to work through them and to utilize them. And we have used very many that have been submitted from individuals across the United States. Mr. Scalise. Well, hopefully we will be able to get some more of those implemented. Because, as I said earlier, there is not enough that you can do. If you have more ideas, try them all, because there is a lot of oil in the gulf. And if something works, do more of it. If it doesn't work, you can go on to something else. Is that structure just BP's structure? Is there some unified command---- Mr. Hayward. It is part of the unified command structure. Mr. Scalise. So are there any Federal agencies involved in that? Mr. Hayward. There is a team of people. So as e-mails and suggestions come in, they are forwarded to a team of people, and they are evaluated and implemented based on that team of people that sits within the unified command structure. Mr. Scalise. Well, local people that are affected by this, we are still hearing from lots of local people--fishermen that can no longer fish; people that have oyster-processing companies and now some of those oyster beds are closed so they have no oysters to process; boat captains. These are all people that don't want to just get some unemployment check. They want to work, but they can't work. Many of them are frustrated that they are not being engaged to work on the cleanup. And they are the ones most vested; they are the ones on the ground who want this cleaned up with the most urgency. And it seems like many of them are frustrated that they are being shut out, and then they are seeing people bused in from out of State that come in in the day and then they are bused out again at night that just don't have the same kind of passion. And it is kind of confusing. Why are they not being employed, if they want to work, if they are there on the ground? Mr. Hayward. We made every effort to use everyone locally who wants to participate. We have almost 10,000 Vessels of Opportunity--the local fishermen employed in the Vessels of Opportunity program. And we have---- Mr. Scalise. I was notoriously told--and this was reported in many media accounts, but I have actually spoken to the parish official on the ground who actually did this. Just a few weeks ago, there were 50 of those boats, Vessels of Opportunity, that were contracted by you that were supposed to be putting out boom. Those boats were sitting idle at the dock, not putting out boom, as oil was coming into our marsh. And this parish official actually went out and they commandeered a number of those boats and just went and put it out themselves. There is no excuse for that. What kind of method do you all have in place? If you are just giving people a check and telling them to sit the boat at the dock--we don't need the boat at the dock. We need the boat out putting the boom so that the oil doesn't get into the marsh. And, again, it gets into this sense of urgency. It is not just about writing checks. I mean, that is important, but it is even more important that the work gets done in a quick time frame. And that is not what is happening. There is no quick turnaround. And then things like that continue to happen. Are you going to change something on the ground to emphasize that it is not just about running a PR campaign? We have things that have to happen quickly because there just isn't the time for days to go by with these kinds of delays. Mr. Hayward. Our focus is to continue to improve the quality of the response and the engagement of the people in the initial area. It has been the biggest challenge, and we continue to work it very hard with the incident commander Thad Allen and the Coast Guard. Mr. Scalise. Let me ask you, is the casing cracked or damaged below the sea floor? Mr. Hayward. We don't know that, of course, because we haven't been able to get into the well. Mr. Scalise. There is nothing that you have seen that would show that? Mr. Hayward. We have no way of knowing that. Mr. Scalise. OK. And I know---- Mr. Stupak. Time, Steve. Mr. Scalise. And I apologize. Mr. Stupak. Go ahead, one more. Go ahead. Mr. Scalise. Mr. McKay was here, testifying at the same table you are at, on Tuesday. He said, quote, ``The spill response has been pretty effective.'' And I strongly disagreed with him in that hearing on Tuesday. I would like to know if you agree or disagree with his statement that the still response has been pretty effective. Mr. Hayward. I think if any oil gets to the shore to impact the environment, that it is not possible to declare a spill response effective. In many dimensions, we have launched, implemented a very, very significant effort. It has been recognized, as I said, by the Coast Guard as beyond anything anyone has ever achieved in the past. But---- Mr. Scalise. And this disaster is beyond anything ever achieved--I just hope to give you that sense of urgency. We need the sense of urgency. We can't have days---- Mr. Stupak. Time has expired. Mr. Scalise. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Stupak. There is nothing to yield. Ms. DeGette for questions, please. Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hayward, you told both Mr. Dingell and Mr. Scalise that the conclusion BP reached was that there was a good cement job, there was no requirement to perform the cement bond log test, and you would look at whether that needed to be changed in the future. So my question to you is, are you aware that Halliburton's chief safety officer, Tim Probert, told a Senate committee last month that a cement bond log test is, quote, ``the only test that can really determine the actual effectiveness of the bond between the cement sheets, the formation, and the casing itself''? Do you agree with that statement? Mr. Hayward. I am aware of his testimony, and I---- Ms. DeGette. And do you agree with that testimony? Mr. Hayward. I am not qualified to agree or disagree with that statement. Ms. DeGette. Well, is your technical expert, Mr. Zanghi, who is here with you today, qualified to answer that question? Mr. Hayward. I can ask him. Ms. DeGette. Please. Yes? Mr. Hayward. Mr. Zanghi is not a cement bond expert. Ms. DeGette. I am sorry, I can't hear you. Can you move the---- Mr. Hayward. Mr. Zanghi is not a cementing expert, but he is a drilling engineer. And he---- Ms. DeGette. He is a drilling engineer. And has he had experience with cementing as a drilling engineer? Mr. Hayward. I am sure he has. Ms. DeGette. OK. But yet he doesn't know whether this test is the only test that can determine the actual effectiveness? Mr. Hayward. The fact is that the team on the rig concluded that they had three other mechanisms to determine that they had---- Ms. DeGette. What were those mechanisms? Mr. Hayward. It was the volume that had been pumped---- Ms. DeGette. I am sorry? Mr. Hayward. The volume of cement that had been pumped, which told they essentially where in the world the cement had gone; the returns to the surface--that is to say, the cement had return to the surface; and a pressure test that confirmed that there was ceiling. Ms. DeGette. But also, as I mentioned in my first round of questioning, Mr. Hayward, the internal document, tab 6, page 9, which I had you refer to, said that, because of the long string approach, that you didn't do the other type of approach, ``Cementing simulations indicate that it's unlikely to be a successful cement job.'' So was that taken into account, when it was determined that the cement was likely to succeed? Mr. Hayward. I clearly can't know that because I wasn't there, but one would---- Ms. DeGette. Yes. OK. I---- Mr. Hayward [continuing]. Assume that the team on the rig-- -- Ms. DeGette. I am sorry? Mr. Hayward. I would assume that the team on the rig looked at the data and determined that they had achieved a successful cement job. Ms. DeGette. But, now, the team on the scene sent the test crew away before the pressure testing was done. So how would they have known that the cement was going to hold before they even did the pressure testing? Mr. Hayward. I can't answer that question. Ms. DeGette. Would you mind supplementing your testimony to let us now how they would have known that? Mr. Hayward. I can't interpret what the people on the rig were thinking at the time the decision was made. Ms. DeGette. But you could ask them and have them tell us. Would you do that, Mr. Hayward? Mr. Hayward. We can, certainly, as part of the investigation, do that. Ms. DeGette. Thank you very much. Now, I want to ask you, because previously I asked you how many deepwater wells that BP had--or I asked you if you had knowledge of this well, and you said no. How many deepwater wells has BP drilled since you were CEO of the company, in the last 3 or so years? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the precise number. It is probably on the order of 25 or 30 a year. Ms. DeGette. You might be surprised to know, of the deepwater wells, that it is a far fewer number than that. But you don't know the exact number, correct? Mr. Hayward. I don't know the exact number. Ms. DeGette. OK. I want to just ask you one last question. We have been hearing a lot from people, from health care workers and from public health folks, about the potential health consequences. We have been talking a lot today about the economic losses and this fund to reimburse people for economic losses. I want to ask you, will BP also commit to paying for the long-term health care costs incurred by workers and residents of the gulf as a result of this spill? Mr. Hayward. We have created a fund of $20 billion to cover the claims resulting from---- Ms. DeGette. Let me ask you again. Let me just ask you again. I know there is the fund, and we commend you, and we are glad you did that. But as part of the reimbursement, is BP committed to reimbursing the workers and the residents of the gulf for their long-term health care costs incurred as a result of this spill? Yes or no? Mr. Hayward. If the independent adjudicator determines that those are valid claims, they will be paid. Ms. DeGette. So the only way you intend to pay those claims is if it comes through this fund. Is that your testimony today? Mr. Hayward. Twenty billion dollars is a very large sum of money to pay claims from. Ms. DeGette. I am sorry? Mr. Hayward. Twenty billion dollars is a very large fund to pay claims from. Ms. DeGette. It is a large fund. And is it your view that part of what that fund will be used for is to pay people for their long-term health care costs incurred as a result of this spill? Mr. Hayward. That will be a decision for the independent adjudicator. Ms. DeGette. Well, if they asked you what you thought, would you say, yes, the health care costs should be paid for from this? Mr. Hayward. I think that is something that I will leave him to decide. That is why we have appointed an independent adjudicator. Ms. DeGette. So--see, this--if I may, Mr. Chairman? Mr. Stupak. Just another minute. Ms. DeGette. Yes. If I may, Mr. Chairman, this is what is concerning members of this committee and others about BP's response here. Because you had executives who have sat here and said that we will pay for all reasonable costs incurred. But then when we ask direct questions, for example, about health care costs, you evade the questions. And all I want to know is, as part of the reimbursement of all reasonable costs, health care costs that are incurred by workers and residents of the gulf? It is not a difficult question, sir. Mr. Hayward. I believe that if they are a direct consequence of the oil spill, then the independent adjudicator will find them to be claims that are legitimate under the fund. Ms. DeGette. And would you support that, sir? Mr. Hayward. I clearly would. But it is---- Ms. DeGette. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your coming here. Mr. Hayward [continuing]. It is for the independent adjudicator to make the decisions. That is what we are trying to create. Ms. DeGette. Well, just---- Mr. Stupak. OK, oK, oK. Members are going to have 10 minutes--excuse me--10 days to submit additional questions if they want, oK? Because, I mean, we could go here all night, and I am sure people would like to, but that concludes all of our-- -- Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chairman, I do want to ask one last question on the letter that you and Mr. Waxman---- Mr. Stupak. The June 14th letter, yes. Mr. Burgess [continuing]. The June 14th letter that, Mr. Hayward, you indicated that you were briefed on this letter from Mr. Waxman and Mr. Stupak; is that correct? Mr. Hayward. That is correct. Mr. Burgess. Is there any part of this letter that you actually dispute? I know you wouldn't really answer Mr. Waxman's questions, but are there parts of this letter that you actually do not agree with? Mr. Hayward. I think it is a statement of your conclusions at this time. Mr. Burgess. But do you dispute the facts as stated in the letter? Mr. Hayward. I don't dispute any of the facts, not any of the facts. And as I have said all along, I would like to await drawing conclusions---- Mr. Burgess. Yes, I understand. Mr. Hayward [continuing]. Until all of the investigations are complete. Mr. Burgess. If there are facts that you dispute, you would provide those to us within this---- Mr. Hayward. I certainly will. Mr. Stupak. I am sorry, but I have to call this to an end, because then down on this side they are going to want more questions and I will want more questions, and we will be here until at least midnight, and we are not going to do that. Mr. Burgess. That is why we are the most important committee in Congress. Mr. Stupak. I agree we are the most important committee in Congress, but even important things must come to an end. And right now it is coming to an end. Mr. Hayward, I want to thank you for being here today. You did come voluntarily, and we appreciate that. However, I think it is fair to say that Members are frustrated because the answers we have heard time and time again are phrases like ``I wasn't involved in that decision,'' ``I don't know,'' ``I can't recall,'' ``we need to wait for the results of the investigation.'' And we had really hoped, by giving you information and the June 14th letter, you would be better prepared to answer our questions. I think the evasiveness of your answers only serve to increase the frustration, not decrease the frustration, not just of Members of Congress but of that of the American people. So, I will thank you for being here. This is going to conclude our hearing. I want to thank all Members for participating. The document binder is made part of the record. And that concludes our hearing. This meeting of the subcommittee is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 5:30 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.031 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.032 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.033 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.034 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.035 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.036 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.037 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.038 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.039 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.040 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.041 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.042 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.043 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.044 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.045 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.046 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.047 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.048 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.049 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.050 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.051 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.052 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.053 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.054 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.055 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.056 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.057 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.058 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.059 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.060 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.061 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.062 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.063 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.064 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.065 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.066 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.067 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.068 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.069 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.070 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.071 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.072 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.073 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.074 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.075 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.076 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.077 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.078 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.079 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.080 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.081 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.082 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.083 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.084 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.085 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.086 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.087 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.088 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.089 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.090 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.091 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.092 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.093 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.094 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.095 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.096 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.097 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.098 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.099 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.100 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.101 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.102 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.103 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.104 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.105 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.106 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.107 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.108 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.109 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.110 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.111 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.112 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.113 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.114 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.115 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.116 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.117 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.118 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.119 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.120 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.121 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.122 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.123 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.124 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.125 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.126 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.127 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.128 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.129 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.130 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.131 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.132 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.133 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.134 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.135 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.136 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.137 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.138 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.139 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.140 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.141 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.142 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 77914A.143\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The project spans the full scope of the adult justice system—from arrest and diversion through prosecution, incarceration, release, and community supervision—with a particular focus on trauma-informed and gender-responsive prevention and intervention strategies.\nChaired by former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the Commission includes 15 other high-profile, ideologically diverse leaders representing law enforcement, courts, corrections, medicine, research, and advocacy. Oklahoma First Lady Sarah Stitt is Senior Adviser, and the Commission also consults with a team of experts with decades of experience in women’s justice issues. This report is a preliminary assessment to inform the Commission’s work, which will further examine the challenges facing justice-involved women and develop proposed solutions for policy and practice.\nThe Council on Criminal Justice is an invitational membership organization and think tank. Independent and nonpartisan, the Council advances understanding of the criminal justice policy choices facing the nation and builds consensus for solutions that enhance safety and justice for all.\nThe Council does not take policy positions. As part of its array of activities, the Council conducts research and convenes task forces composed of Council members who produce reports with findings and policy recommendations on matters of concern. The findings and conclusions in this report were not subject to the approval of the Council’s Board of Directors, its Board of Trustees, or funders.

Most system-involved women have experienced some form of childhood abuse or trauma. Many are at high risk for experiencing violent victimization by an intimate partner, and women in jails and prisons consistently report higher rates of mental health and substance use disorders than their male counterparts.\n- While racial disparity in imprisonment persists, the gap between Black and White women shrunk considerably between 2000 and 2020, largely due to increased admissions for White women for drug offenses.\n- Women are four times more likely than men to self-report sexual victimization by other incarcerated people in prisons and more than twice as likely in jails.\n- Lesbian, gay, and bisexual women are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and are far more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report sexual victimization during confinement.\n- Women in prison are disciplined at higher rates than men, often for small infractions such as disrespect, disobedience, and being disruptive.\n- More than half of women in prisons are parents to minor children, and estimates suggest that at least three out of four women in jails are mothers. Prior to their incarceration, mothers were more than twice as likely as fathers to be the sole or primary caretaker of their children.\n- Women have specific health-related needs that prisons and jails struggle to address, ranging from the provision of menstruation supplies to pregnancy and menopausal care and the treatment of women’s higher reported rates of mental health and substance use disorders.\n- Gender-responsive programs, services, and diversion strategies exist, but more research is needed to establish their effectiveness.\n- During the reentry process, women face distinct parenting, health, and financial challenges that affect their success after release.\nTable of Contents\nRead more about key trends related to women in the criminal justice system in a companion publication, Women’s Justice: By the Numbers.\nIntroduction\nThe incarceration rate for women in U.S. prisons and jails increased dramatically from 1982 through 2007, growing 431%, and then flattened as the number of incarcerated men began to fall.1 In 2020, the size of the total incarcerated population experienced an historic drop due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, but growth resumed in 2021. In 2021 and 2022, the increase of the female population in jails and federal prisons outpaced that of males. In 2022, there were about 181,000 incarcerated women in local jails and state and federal prisons across the U.S.2\nGiven the far greater size of the male incarcerated population, criminal justice processes and facilities in this country have been predominantly designed around the needs of men. This exacerbates a unique set of obstacles faced by women in the criminal justice system. Most have experienced poverty and trauma, and they are more likely than justice-involved men to be victims of intimate partner violence and sexual abuse, be diagnosed with mental health and substance use disorders, and to have experienced homelessness in the year prior to incarceration.3 Many incarcerated women are also entangled in other systems—from child welfare to immigration and housing court—and these processes can compound and complicate their interactions with the criminal justice system. Because women are typically the primary caretakers of their children, their incarceration is more likely than men’s incarceration to destabilize families and create ripple effects throughout communities. These factors also intersect with broader social inequities, often resulting in disproportionately negative impacts on women of color and those who identify as LGBTQ+.\nThis assessment is a review of existing research about the factors that drive women’s justice system involvement and the unique needs they experience upon making contact with the system. It pays special attention to women’s risk factors for criminal offending and their distinct challenges throughout all stages of the system, from arrest to sentencing, confinement, and reentry. Each section of the report describes additional considerations by demographic characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation) where data are available, and identifies gaps in current knowledge.\nTable of Contents\nWomen's Risk Factors\nResearch conducted over the past two decades has explored women’s risk factors and identified common pathways that bring women into the criminal justice system. Taken together, the research suggests that many women and girls engage in crime due to factors that are uncommon for men (including sex work and retaliation against abusive family members or partners), factors that are more prevalent among women than men (such as child sexual abuse and other forms of sexual victimization), or factors that occur during women’s intimate relationships (including emotional, physical, and financial coercion).4 Although the relationships correlated with their offending are typically with men, women may also experience financial coercion or coercion to engage in substance use or criminal behavior from family members and other close connections. While men also experience childhood abuse and other forms of interpersonal victimization,5 these risk factors function differently in the lives of women and increase their risk for mental health challenges, substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence, all of which can contribute to their involvement in the criminal justice system.\nWomen often engage in crime differently than men, committing offenses in different proportions and for different reasons than their male counterparts. Women face distinct parenting, health, and economic challenges that affect their experience of incarceration and influence their success during reentry after release.6 Women also differ from men in how they use drugs and alcohol to cope with experiences of violence and trauma, and in the prevalence and scope of the mental health symptoms they experience.7\nChild Abuse and Adversity\nChildhood abuse plays a significant role in women’s pathways to prison. More than 90% of women with criminal justice system involvement have experienced some form of childhood trauma, such as physical or sexual violence, bullying, gang attacks, dating violence, or witnessing extreme violence, including murder.8 Available evidence is mixed on whether incarcerated men experience childhood physical abuse at rates similar to or greater than rates for incarcerated women, but women consistently report higher rates of childhood sexual abuse.9 Although national data do not exist, in samples of incarcerated women, between half and three-quarters report experiences of sexual violence.10 In addition, while incarcerated men indicate that their experiences of violent victimization by peers and caretakers decrease throughout adolescence and into adulthood, many women suggest that their abuse increases as they enter intimate partner relationships later in life.11\n90%\nof women with criminal justice system involvement have experienced some form of childhood trauma.\nStudies of people with no history of incarceration show that exposure to multiple forms of childhood abuse and adversity are strongly associated with a range of negative adult outcomes, from chronic disease to overdose fatality.12 These associations are amplified among justice-involved women. Justice-involved women report higher numbers of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), which include childhood abuse and neglect, family instability factors, and witnessing violence in the home,13 compared to justice-involved men and women in the community. Increased ACEs are associated with higher rates of arrest, especially for women with mental health conditions.14 For example, in a study of 500 women in California prisons and roughly 4,700 women enrolled in a Health Maintenance Organization in the community, 84% of the incarcerated women reported a history of ACEs compared to 69% of women in the community.15 The incarcerated women were 1.7 times more likely than women in the community to have experienced four or more ACEs (32% compared to 19%).\nChildhood abuse and adversity are also strongly associated with women’s use of violence in their relationships.16 In a study of roughly 1,100 women incarcerated in California, each additional type of childhood abuse a woman had experienced was associated with a 17% increase in her use of threats and intimidation and a 13% increase in her perpetration of severe physical violence (physically restraining, kicking, punching, or stabbing) in her intimate relationships.17\nIntimate Partner Violence\nWomen in the criminal justice system are at high risk for experiencing violent victimization by an intimate partner, and their romantic relationships often function as a key pathway into crime and substance use.18 More than 70% of women incarcerated in prisons and jails report prior experiences of intimate partner violence victimization, ranging from threats and intimidation to physical or sexual assault.19 For example, in a study of 115 women in jail, 77% had experienced intimate partner violence; 93% of women who reported intimate partner violence reported physical abuse, 32% reported partner rape, and 63% reported that the incident involved use of a weapon.20 Research suggests that these estimates may be an undercount, given that prolonged experiences of violence across multiple relationships (from parents and caregivers to intimate partners) may result in some women not recognizing behaviors such as threats and other fear tactics, hitting, kicking, or coercive sex as intimate partner violence.21\nMore than\n70%\nof women incarcerated in prisons and jails report experiences of intimate partner violence victimization.\nResearch indicates that law enforcement officers, judges, and other stakeholders who interact with justice-involved women and have authority over the outcomes of their cases rarely understand the impact of violence and abuse on women’s criminal behavior. For example, some women report being coerced or threatened into engaging in or covering up criminal activity, while others say they claimed a larger role in a crime during their arrest and sentencing to protect an abusive intimate partner or to keep the partner from receiving a harsher prison term.22 For many, such tactics were deployed in an attempt to prevent future abuse. Other women may resort to violence in self-defense. These behaviors are typically not well understood by system stakeholders, resulting in stigmatization, especially for women with mental health or substance use disorders.23\nCriminal justice system proceedings seldom address intimate partner violence as a pathway into the system or explore how these experiences contribute to women’s use of violence in self-defense or to protect their children or other loved ones.24 One analysis based on more than 600 survey responses of women in prisons found that at least 30% of those serving time for murder or manslaughter—including many serving life sentences—were protecting themselves or a loved one during the crime that led to their conviction (see “Women Serving Life Sentences” below).25\nResearch suggests that for many justice system-involved women, troubling interpersonal relationships often precede a range of negative outcomes, including re-victimization, criminal behavior, engaging in sex work, and homelessness.26 The transformation of “victims” into “offenders” can be attributed to several factors, including the coercive actions of abusers and a lack of understanding about the dynamics of interpersonal violence from system stakeholders.27 For many women experiencing intimate partner violence, these forces exacerbate or result in poverty and housing instability, both of which increase risk for substance use and crimes related to survival for both women and their children. For example, in 2016, the most recent year for which data were available, 1 in 5 women in state and federal prisons reported that they were homeless at some point in the year prior to their arrest compared to 13% of men.28\nTraumatic Brain Injury\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is defined as an injury to the brain, such as blunt object impact or other kinds of trauma from pressure or injury, that alters brain function.29 The effects of TBI on brain function vary widely depending on the severity of the injury, and symptoms may include changes in consciousness and behavior, headache, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, and seizures, as well as motor, sensory, and cognitive deficits. TBI often results in psychiatric changes, such as mood disorders and reduced anger regulation.30 Individuals also may experience increased irritability and difficulties with emotional control. These changes can strain relationships and affect daily functioning. Interpersonal violence causes roughly a quarter of all TBIs, many of which have mild symptoms.31\nWhile much is known about TBI and its impacts, existing research is heavily focused on men.32 In community and military samples, men have higher rates of TBI than women;33 in samples of incarcerated people, however, women have slightly higher rates of TBI than men.34 For example, a meta-analysis of 33 studies published in 2010 identified four that explored TBI among incarcerated women.35 Comparative gender analysis suggested that women had a higher overall prevalence of history of TBI than men (70% of incarcerated women compared to 64% of men). Additionally, a study of about 400 people in jails, detention centers, or on probation—a third of whom were female—found that women were twice as likely as men to have sustained multiple TBIs and six times as likely to have sustained multiple violence-related TBIs.36\nResearch on TBIs caused by intimate partner violence has increased dramatically over the past decade.37 Estimates suggest that the number of TBIs due to intimate partner violence sustained by women is 11 to 12 times higher than the number of TBIs experienced by military personnel and athletes combined.38 Estimates of the prevalence of TBI among women who experience intimate partner violence vary widely (from 50% to 92%) due to challenges in measurement and sampling.39 Most research focuses on women who seek treatment at emergency departments or enter emergency shelters, which may under- or overcount the problem’s scope.40\nTBIs related to intimate partner violence can be caused by aggressive shaking, strangulation, a blow to the head (with a fist or heavy object), and being pushed or thrown to the floor.41 In a study of 900 Black women aged 18 to 55 in Maryland and the U.S. Virgin Islands, half of the 540 women who self-reported intimate partner violence had sustained a TBI.42 More than a third (36%) had experienced strangulation and half had sustained significant injuries to their face, including 4% of women who had their jaw broken or dislocated. Findings from a narrative review of existing research conducted in 2017 indicated that TBI and intimate partner violence often function as risk factors for each other, perpetuating a dangerous cycle. Without treatment, those who sustain a TBI from abuse can experience cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, and mood irregularities, which increase their risk for repeated abuse and additional head injuries.43\nMental Health and Substance Use Disorders\nIn samples of incarcerated people, women consistently report higher rates of mental health disorders than men, regardless of whether this is measured as a generic condition or a specific diagnostic category. For example, in 2011-2012, the most recent year for which national data were available, 66% of women in prison and 68% of women in jail were diagnosed with a mental health disorder, compared to 35% of men in prison and 41% of men in jail.44 Women were also more likely to meet the threshold for serious psychological distress (20% of women in prison and 32% of women in jail, compared to 14% of men in prison and 26% of men in jail),45 and women in prison report much higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 21% of women versus 6% of men) than their male counterparts.46\n66%\nof women in prison diagnosed with a mental health disorder\n68%\nof women in jail diagnosed with a mental health disorder\n35%\nof men in prison diagnosed with a mental health disorder\n41%\nof men in jail diagnosed with a mental health disorder\nJustice-involved women are also more likely than men to be diagnosed with a substance use disorder and to have been intoxicated at the time of their offense. For example, 69% to 72% of women meet criteria for a substance use disorder, compared to 57% of men.47 Nearly half (46% to 49%) of women in prison were using drugs at the time of their offense, compared to 36% to 41% of men,48 and women were much more likely to have used methamphetamines in the month before incarceration (15% to 17%) than men (10%).49\n69%–72%\nof justice-involved women meet the criteria for a substanceuse disorder\n57%\nof justice-involved men meet the criteria for a substance\nuse disorder\nWhile the prevalence of co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders hovers around 3% in the general population, the prevalence among people incarcerated in jails is estimated to be as high as 10% for men and 22% for women.50 Experiences of childhood abuse and intimate partner violence increase risk for substance misuse and substance use disorders, as many women suggest that they use substances, in some measure, to manage the aftereffects of trauma and the symptoms of untreated mental health conditions.51\nFew studies explore mental health and substance use disorders among special populations of justice-involved women, including female veterans.52 Meta-analyses and other research syntheses conducted on veterans in correctional settings note that samples are majority or exclusively male. In one comparative study of roughly 31,000 incarcerated veterans, however, female veterans were 89% more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder than male veterans, although incarcerated female and male veterans had equivalent rates of PTSD that was directly tied to combat exposure.53\nFailure-to-Protect Laws\nAlthough many women make contact with the criminal justice system for their direct engagement in criminal offending, others are prosecuted for witnessing the abuse of their children and “failing to protect” them, despite not being the perpetrator of that abuse. Forty-seven states have failure-to-protect laws that impose criminal penalties on those who fail to report child abuse.54\nWhile such laws are commonplace across the U.S., the potential consequences imposed by these laws vary.55 In some states, children identified as victims in such cases can be removed from the home and brought into the child welfare system, while in others, the non-offending parent—more often, a woman—can be criminally charged.56 Seven states—Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Texas—allow life sentences or sentences of 99 years for the parent who did not commit the offense, but either witnessed it or was suspected to have known about it.57 A recent examination of roughly 320 failure-to-protect cases prosecuted in Oklahoma found that 90% of the cases with a female defendant resulted in her imprisonment, although the average length of the prison sentence imposed was not specified.58 National data on the number of people who are convicted and incarcerated due to failure-to-protect laws were not identified.\nWhile intended to protect children from abuse, failure-to-protect laws disproportionately impact women who also are experiencing abuse in the home.59 Under these laws, any person who knows about or suspects that a child is being abused and fails to report this abuse can be prosecuted, regardless of whether or not they are victims of abuse themselves and do not report due to coercion, fear of retaliation, or other factors stemming from their experience of intimate partner violence or domestic abuse.60 In many states, failure-to-protect charges can also be introduced for allowing children to witness one parent abusing the other.61 Findings from many research studies indicate a strong relationship between child maltreatment and intimate partner violence, with co-occurrence estimated in 30% to 60% of cases.62 In a meta-analysis of 38 studies representing about 100,000 families, families who reported intimate partner violence were nearly four times more likely to have child abuse or neglect reported at a later stage.63\nNote: Failure-to-Protect laws, which are enforced in the criminal justice system, can also interact with civil cases managed by family courts. For example, failure to protect may be added to charges of parental alienation, defined as allegations by one parent that the other parent has manipulated or caused fear in a child that causes the child to reject or distance from the parent making the allegations.64 Parental alienation has been deemed a “pseudo-concept” by the United Nations, but it is still introduced in family court by parents (most often, fathers) as a response to allegations of intimate partner violence.65 An analysis of 2,000 court opinions found that one in four women who alleged they were being abused or that their child or children were abused by the father lost their custody case, often due to charges of parental alienation, and custody was granted to the father.66 Roughly 19% of family court cases where allegations of child abuse were substantiated resulted in the father being awarded custody. Courts were nearly four times as likely to disbelieve the mother’s claim of child abuse when the allegedly abusive father made a cross-claim of parental alienation. Some women who are undergoing abuse by their partner, or whose children are being abused by that partner, may choose not to report for fear of losing custody, which would prevent them from intervening or distracting the abuser away from the children.\nSex Work\nThe criminalization of sex work disproportionately impacts young women and transgender people. Young women are the primary targets of sex trafficking, and even when men are involved as clients or traffickers, women and transgender people are often the main focus for arrests.67 In 2019, the most recent year for which data were available, females comprised 63% of the roughly 20,000 arrests made for prostitution.68 A focus on sex work, however, underestimates the prevalence of women exchanging sex for money or drugs. Recent studies of women in prisons and jails suggest that roughly half (45% to 54%) of incarcerated women have engaged in sex exchange.69\nNote: The interaction of sex trafficking and sex work is complex, and a clear understanding of the scope of sex trafficking is limited by a lack of comprehensive national and international data.70 Data on how many victims of sex trafficking become involved with the criminal justice system were not identified.\nTwo primary perspectives are used to explain women’s engagement in sex work. The oppression paradigm highlights how childhood abuse, family instability, poverty, homelessness, and drug use push some women into sex work; the empowerment paradigm suggests that some women choose sex work to meet immediate economic needs in the context of limited employment opportunities.71 Research indicates that these perspectives have substantial overlap. For example, a study of more than 200 sex workers found that both immediate circumstances and negative experiences from early life were related to current sex work.72\nJuvenile Justice System Involvement\nWhile the focus of the Commission is on women entering the adult criminal justice system, an understanding of trends among girls involved in the juvenile justice system is essential. There are no official data on number or rates of girls involved in the juvenile justice system who later move into or have further contact with the adult criminal justice system. But data from the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates show that nearly half (45%) of incarcerated women self-reported that they were arrested at least once before age 18.73 Scholars suggest that many of the risk factors underlying women’s involvement with the system also overlap with girls’ involvement in the juvenile justice system; these include experiences of abuse and domestic violence, housing and economic instability, and struggles with mental and physical health.74\nJuvenile Arrests and Sentencing\nThe overall juvenile arrest rate has trended sharply downward since the mid-1990s.75 For boys, the arrest rate rose from 1980 to its peak in 1996 at 5,704 per 100,000 male youth residents, before beginning a general downward trend.76 From 1996 to 2019, the arrest rate dropped 78%; from 2019 to 2020, the rate fell 37% due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the most recent year for which data were available, the boys arrest rate was 809, reflecting a drop of 86% from the peak. The arrest rate for girls peaked in 1997 at 1,802 per 100,000 female youth residents. From there, the rate decreased slowly until 2012 before falling more rapidly. From 1997 to 2019, the girls arrest rate dropped 68%. From 2019 to 2020, girls’ arrest rates dropped 41% due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting an 81% drop from peak to 2020. Girls’ share of all juvenile arrests has grown steadily and incrementally over time. Girls accounted for 15% of all juvenile arrests in 1980 and 23% in 2020.\nJuvenile Arrest Rates by Sex, 1980-2020\nThe types of offenses for which girls were arrested has also changed over time. For example, the proportion of girls arrested for violent crimes nearly doubled from 1980 to 2020, rising from 10% to 19% of total arrests.77 Similarly, girls’ share of arrests for property crimes increased from 18% in 1980 to a peak of 38% in 2010 before decreasing to 29% in 2020. The share of girls’ drug offense arrests has had more variability than their arrests for violent and property crimes. In the early 1980s, girls accounted for about 15% of all arrests for drug offenses. This share fell to a low of 11% in the mid-1990s before slowly rising again. In 2020, girls made up a quarter of all drug offense arrests.\nIn 2022, there were roughly 366,000 juvenile arrests for serious violent and property crimes78 reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) that included information about the race and ethnicity of the person arrested.79 Just under a third (32%) of these arrests—about 115,000—were of juvenile girls. Nearly half (45%) of the girls who were arrested were White, 34% were Black, 17% were Hispanic, 3% were American Indian/Alaska Native, 1% were Asian, and less than one percent were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Information was not provided on how many girls identified as multiracial or for whom race and ethnicity were unknown.\nThe raw number of arrests within a race or ethnic group may obscure important information about racial disproportionality, as larger numbers of arrests are expected among larger race and ethnic groups (and vice versa). Arrest rates cannot be extracted from available NIBRS data. Juvenile arrest rate data were identified for 2020 for all juvenile arrests, although these data were not broken down by sex. Black (2,481 per 100,000) and American Indian/Alaska Native (1,815 per 100,000) youth had significantly higher rates than their White peers (1,080 per 100,000).80\nWhile the number of girls who are prosecuted as adults is small compared to boys (194 girls compared to 2,537 boys in 2020),81 research suggests that Black girls are more than twice as likely as White girls to be charged as adults and be transferred to the adult criminal justice system.82\nGirls in Residential Custody\nThe number of girls in residential custody fell from about 14,500 in 1999 to roughly 3,500 in 2021, a drop of 75%.83 The number of boys fell 76% over the same time period, from roughly 93,000 to 21,000. Girls consistently accounted for about 14% of all youth in custody.\nIn 2021, 44% of the roughly 3,550 girls in residential custody were convicted of violent crimes, 18% with property crimes, 6% with drug offenses, and 9% with public order offenses.84 About 16% were being held for a technical violation of their supervision and 8% were being held for status offenses. Girls made up 13% of all youth held for violent offenses, 14% of youth held for property crimes, and 22% of youth held for drug offenses. Girls accounted for 37% of all youth being held for status offenses, including 57% of those who were running away, 30% of those who were truant, and 39% held for “incorrigibility.”\nBlack and Native American girls are much more likely to be in residential custody than Asian, Hispanic, and White girls. While the overall placement rate in 2020 was 35 per 100,000 girls aged 10 to 17, Native American girls (112 per 100,000) were four times as likely and Black girls (77 per 100,000) were more than three times as likely to be in custody as their White peers (24 per 100,000).85 The rate of residential placements for Hispanic girls (27 per 100,000) was roughly equivalent to the rate for White girls; the rate for Asian girls (4 per 100,000) was 83% lower.86\nGirls in Residential Custody by Race, 2020\nGirls who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are also disproportionately represented in juvenile residential custody (40%) compared to youth in the general public (7% to 9%).87 Risk for making contact with the juvenile justice system is amplified among LGBTQ+ youth due to their increased risk for bullying and abuse from peers or family members, family rejection, and homelessness.88\nIn a sample of juvenile justice system-involved youth, 45% of girls reported five or more ACEs, nearly twice the rate reported by boys (27%). Nearly a third (31%) of girls reported sexual abuse, compared to 7% of boys.89 Compared to boys, girls account for a higher proportion of youth incarcerated for low-level offenses. In 2019, 34% of all youth held for status offenses (e.g., truancy and curfew violations) were girls. More than half of youth in residential placements for running away were girls. Early abuse has been identified as a key driver of girls’ school-based discipline and subsequent juvenile justice system involvement.90\nAlthough much is known about how girls interact with the juvenile justice system, effective prevention and intervention measures to interrupt their engagement with the adult criminal justice system remain elusive. In addition, little is known about how increasing social media use and pandemic-related school and social interruptions have affected youths’ interactions with the criminal justice system. More research is needed to explore how these factors affect girls’ mental and physical health, relationships with family and peers, and school success—and to identify how these factors relate to substance misuse, intimate partner violence, criminal behavior, arrest, and incarceration. Enhancing understanding of girls’ trajectories can support the development and testing of targeted programs to address girls’ evolving risks and needs and prevent their contact with the criminal justice system as adults.\nNon-Citizens in the Criminal Justice System\nIn 2016, 7% of all people in state and federal prisons were non-citizens—3% of women and 7% of men.91 Non-citizens often face language barriers when engaging with law enforcement and other criminal justice system stakeholders. Research suggests that undocumented women and other female non-citizens seldom seek help from law enforcement when they are victims of intimate partner violence or other domestic abuse, citing lack of knowledge about community resources and fears of deportation.92 As a result, they may be further victimized and exploited, heightening their risk for experiencing serious injury or death, developing mental health and substance use disorders, living in poverty, or engaging in criminal behavior.\nFront End: Arrest Through Sentencing\nContact with Law Enforcement\nIn 2020, more than 20% of all women in the U.S. had encounters with the police.93 This proportion has held consistent in recent years; 23% of women had contact with police in 2018, and 20% had contact in 2015.94 Overall, encounters with police are evenly split between women and men. But unlike men, whose interactions with the police are often initiated by law enforcement, women’s encounters are significantly more likely than men’s to be self-initiated.\nAlthough the reasons behind women’s calls for service from police are unclear due to data limitations, some proportion stems from situations of abuse or violence within intimate relationships. Policies on how law enforcement officers handle these calls vary across states, and in some cases, inadvertently exacerbate the risks faced by victims—primarily women—in abusive relationships.95 For example, some states have implemented mandatory arrest policies for domestic violence incidents, while others grant officers discretion or mandate the arrest of all parties involved, including the alleged victim.96 The mandatory arrest of alleged abusers—intended to ensure accountability and deter further violence—may trigger retaliatory violence against victims, placing them in even greater jeopardy.97 The fear of arrest may dissuade victims from seeking police intervention in the future, thereby perpetuating cycles of abuse and endangerment.\nA 2021 community survey of roughly 1,500 victims and survivors of domestic violence (93% female, 4% male, 3% transgender, non-binary, or other) found that 82% had called law enforcement for assistance. Of those who contacted the police, 20% reported feeling safer after calling, 39% felt less safe, and 40% reported that calling had not made a difference in how they perceived their own safety.98 Most of these respondents (71%) would have preferred to report their domestic violence incident through avenues other than law enforcement. More than half of the victims and survivors who had contacted the police (55%) reported negative interactions with law enforcement, including feeling discrimination for having experienced domestic violence; 25% of respondents were threatened with arrest, and 12% were arrested. Most (92%) of the people who did not call the police reported that they had been concerned about how law enforcement would react to them.\nIn some instances, people may also be physically or sexually abused by law enforcement officers, although official statistics are not publicly available, little research empirically examines these experiences, and what is known focuses on women without providing context about abuse that men or transgender people experience.99 In a study of roughly 900 women in four major cities in the eastern U.S., roughly 40 women (4%), half of whom were Black, reported having experienced physical assault from a police officer.100 About 30 women (3%), roughly a quarter of whom were Black, experienced sexual violence from an officer. Additionally, in a study of about 550 cases where police officers were arrested for engaging in sexual crimes, more than half involved sexual misconduct while the officer was on duty.101\nArrests and Convictions\nThe arrest rate for men increased from 1980 to its peak in 1989 at 11,426 per 100,000 adult male residents. It then began a general downward trend.102 From 1989 to 2019, the arrest rate dropped 52%; from 2019 to 2020, the rate fell 23% due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the most recent year for which data were available, men’s arrest rate was 4,244 per 100,000, reflecting a drop of 63% from the peak. Over the same time period, the arrest rate for women gradually increased. From 1980 to its peak in 2009, it rose 74% (from 1,386 per 100,000 adult female residents to 2,404 per 100,000). Beginning in 2010, women’s arrest rate gradually declined, falling 17% from 2009 to 2019. From 2019 to 2020, women’s arrest rates dropped 26% due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting a 40% drop from peak to 2020. Women’s share of all adult arrests has grown steadily and incrementally over time. Women accounted for 13% of all adult arrests in 1980 and 21% in 2020.\nAdult Arrest Rates by Sex, 1980-2020\nThere has also been a shift in the types of offenses for which women were arrested. For example, from 1980 to 2020, the proportion of women arrested for violent crimes more than doubled, reaching 21% by 2020.103\nWomen’s disproportionate experiences of childhood abuse and adversity, intimate partner violence, and higher reported rates of mental health and substance use disorders may contribute to their offending behavior. For example, fewer women than men are convicted of violent crimes but a higher proportion of women are convicted of property crimes and drug offenses. In 2022, the most recent year for which data were available, far fewer women were convicted of violent crimes (46%) than men (64%).104 More women, however, were convicted of property crimes (19% of women compared to 13% of men) and more than twice as many women were convicted of drug offenses (25% of women compared to 12% of men).105\nWomen’s Share of Arrests by Offense Type, 1980-2020\nIn 2022, there were about five million adult arrests reported to the FBI through NIBRS that included information about the race and ethnicity of the person who was arrested.106 Just over a quarter (27%) of these arrests–about 1.3 million–were of adult women. Most of the women who were arrested (60%) were White, 24% were Black, 11% were Hispanic, 3% were American Indian/Alaska Native, 1% were Asian, and less than one percent were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Information was not provided on how many women identified as multiracial or for whom race and ethnicity were unknown.\nAs noted in the discussion of girls’ arrests, the raw number of arrests within a race or ethnic group may obscure important information about racial disproportionality, as larger numbers of arrests are expected among larger race and ethnic groups (and vice versa). Arrest rates cannot be extracted from available NIBRS data. Arrest rate data from 1980 to 2020 were identified for all females (juvenile and adult); these data were not broken down by race.\nPre-Trial Detention and Bail\nIn 1982, there were roughly 13,700 females in jail.107 Over the next several decades this number increased, peaking in 2018 at more than 115,000 women, an increase of 635%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number dropped, decreasing by 37% from 2019 to 2020. The number then rose 33% from 2020 to 2022. In 2022, there were about 93,000 women in jail on a given day and the average stay for women was 19 days, compared to 36 days for men.108\nAlmost two-thirds (60%) of women in local jails are held pre-trial, meaning they have not been convicted of a crime and are in jail pending their trial.109 A small number of people are held pre-trial without the ability to await their trial in the community due to the nature or severity of their offense; the overwhelming majority, however, are offered the opportunity to pay cash bail (or have a third party post bond on their behalf) in order to secure their release prior to trial.110 Bail is intended to increase the likelihood that a defendant will appear at trial. Early research indicated that Black females were 85% more likely than White females to be held on bail; significant differences were not identified between Hispanic and White females.111 More recent research that breaks down outcomes by sex and race was not available.112\nThe relationship between sex and the ability to pay bail—therefore avoiding pretrial detention—is complex, as men are more likely to commit serious crimes that result in higher bonds, but also more likely to be able to pay. A 2006 study found that women were likely to be offered significantly lower bail amounts than men, on average, by about $3,600. However, these results were not significant after controlling for the seriousness of the crime and criminal history.113\nJustice-involved women have, on average, lower incomes than system-involved men, which increases their likelihood of remaining in jail pre-trial. For example, in 2015, median annual income for men held in jail was about $11,000 for women and $15,600 for men.114 Women in jail who were unable to post bail also reported annual incomes roughly half those of non-incarcerated women of the same age.115 While income disparity was higher for men in jail who were unable to post bail compared to their non-incarcerated peers (roughly 60% lower), men had higher incomes overall and across all races than women.\nDeflection and Diversion\nDeflection and diversion are two strategies used as “off-ramps” to help individuals avoid further criminal justice system involvement. Typically, these programs target people who have little to no criminal history and have been charged with nonviolent crimes.116 Deflection programs that occur prior to arrest are led by police, while diversion programs implemented after arrest but before incarceration are managed by prosecutors or judges.117 Diversion programs may shift people away from incarceration before they are formally charged (pre-charge), after they are formally charged but before they enter a plea (pre-plea), or after they have entered a guilty plea (post-plea).118 These programs are designed to address underlying needs and behaviors of participants that were key factors in their criminal offense, often connecting people with community-based treatment and services (e.g., mental health and substance use disorder treatment, employment services, and case management).\nSeveral states and judicial districts have implemented programs for women. These often target women with nonviolent offenses and substance use disorders to address the root causes of their involvement in the justice system and pursue pathways to financial security, rehabilitation, and community stability.119 While gender-responsive diversion programs do exist, however, the majority of deflection and diversion efforts use generalized approaches regardless of sex or have tailored their programming to address the needs and behaviors of justice-involved men.\nSentencing and Courts\nMen and women have different arrest rates and are charged and convicted of crimes in different proportions, which makes exploring gender disparities in plea deals challenging.120 Although research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s found no associations between gender and the use of plea bargaining, more recent analyses indicate that women may be more likely to receive a plea deal or other more lenient treatment than men. For example, among cases adjudicated in Wisconsin from 2000 to 2006, female defendants were 20% more likely than men to have their most serious criminal charges reduced or dismissed, particularly in cases involving misdemeanor or low-level felony convictions.121 Likewise, female defendants with no prior convictions had their charges reduced more often than similarly situated males. For cases involving more serious felonies and when both female and male defendants had previous convictions, no gender disparities were identified.\nResearch in the 1980s on sentencing disparities between men and women suggested that women tended to receive more lenient sentencing outcomes, even after controlling for legal, extralegal, and contextual factors, including criminal history.122 But evidence from research conducted in the past decade indicates that these differences have diminished over time. Specifically, findings suggest that women are less likely than their male counterparts to be sentenced to prison, but equally likely to be sentenced to jail or probation, holding criminological factors like crime type and criminal history constant.123\nRecent analyses on the impact of race on women’s sentencing are mixed, with some data suggesting that White women were less likely to be sentenced to prison and more likely to receive shorter sentences when they were sentenced than their Black and Hispanic counterparts,124 and other data indicating that White women were more likely to be incarcerated than Black and Hispanic women and to receive longer sentences than Hispanic women.125\nIt is also unclear whether sentencing disparities between men and women are indicative of judicial discretion or reflect differences in women’s involvement with crime.126 In many cases, mitigating factors—such as a woman’s role in the offense—are undervalued while aggravating factors—such as the quantity of drugs involved—are overvalued in women’s sentencing determinations.127 This disparity can result in women receiving harsher sentencing outcomes than warranted by the circumstances.128\nWhen leniency is extended to women in the form of suspended or community-based sentences, many justice-involved women, like their male counterparts, lack the stable housing, employment, and strong social supports in the community necessary for success.129 This shortfall in resources and support undermines the effectiveness of alternatives to incarceration, and often results in women engaging in a cycle of incarceration, release, and reincarceration.\nSome women face additional complications because of their entanglement with civil courts, especially child dependency and family courts.130 Although data on the scope of this problem were not identified, such overlapping demands add complexity to all cases, and lack of communication and shared documentation between courts likely limits the identification of key contextual factors and potential resources for women and their children.\nProblem-Solving, Treatment, and Specialty Courts\nProblem-solving, treatment, and specialty courts refer to courts designed to provide an alternative to typical adjudication through the court system; such courts often divert participants away from incarceration and connecting them to community-based treatment and services. Treatment courts have been implemented for both adults and juveniles and target specific types of charges (Drug Court, DWI/DUI Court, Opioid Court, Domestic Violence Court), issues (Mental Health Court, Family Court, Reentry Court), or populations (Veterans Treatment Court).131 Other specialty courts include Community Courts that work within neighborhoods or tribal governments.132 As of 2022, there were more than 4,000 treatment courts in the U.S., nearly half of which were Drug Courts.133\nA third of adults and 30% of juveniles who participated in treatment courts nationally in 2019 were female, totaling nearly 30,000 active female participants that year.134 Successful program completion rates were similar for women (59%) and men (62%). Data on participation by race was not broken down by sex. The share of adult female participants was highest in Family Courts (75%), Mental Health Courts (37%), and Drug Courts (34%) and lowest in DWI/DUI Courts (25%) and Veterans Treatment Courts (7%). A meta-analysis of 142 treatment courts found that females were overrepresented as participants of treatment courts (by 9%) compared to the general probation population.135 The analysis found no meaningful differences in successful completion rates by sex. While not broken down by sex, the review also suggested that Black participants had lower completion rates than Hispanic/Latino and White participants. Completion rates for White participants were about 55%, compared to 49% for Hispanic/Latino participants, and 38% for Black participants.\nQualitative interviews with women who completed a Drug Court program suggest that while there was a general sense of gratitude among the women for avoiding prison, cultural and gender-responsiveness could be improved.136 Women described the court as highly invasive and described feeling intensely surveilled, noting how legal control over their lives superseded their other relationships. Women also discussed feelings of shame and marginalization as female participants, describing how they felt perceived as bad mothers and women due to their substance use.\nOne evaluation of a Drug Court designed specifically for women found significantly reduced recidivism for high-risk women compared to matched probation cases, although this finding was not replicated for low- to moderate-risk women.137 Among the population of high-risk participants who successfully completed the program, recidivism was reduced by 45% compared to those on traditional probation. However, outcomes were not compared to traditional Drug Courts (which service both men and women) to determine the importance of the gender-specific design.\nProbation\nAt the end of 2022, the most recent year for which data were available, roughly 720,000 women were on probation, making up the majority (74%) of women under correctional control.138\nCorrectional Control by Sex, 2022\nProbation\nProbation refers to a court-ordered period of community supervision, often used instead of incarceration; some people may serve probation sentences after their release from jail or prison. People typically remain under probation supervision for one to three years; some jurisdictions may allow up to five years. The conditions of probation vary. Common requirements are to abstain from drugs and alcohol and submit for regular drug testing, obtain employment, complete community service hours, attend court dates and regular meetings with a probation officer, and refrain from criminal activity. Failing to meet the terms of probation often results in incarceration.\nParole\nParole is a release mechanism available to people in state prisons in 34 states. Granted by a board often appointed by a governor or legislature, parole enables an individual to reenter the community prior to the end of the maximum judicial sentence. Individuals who are granted parole serve out the rest of their sentence in the community under the supervision of a parole officer. Common parole requirements are to remain in a certain geographic area, avoid people and places related to the criminal conviction, abstain from drugs and alcohol and submit for regular drug and alcohol testing, secure and maintain employment, attend regular meetings with a parole officer, and refrain from engaging in criminal activity. Failure to meet the terms of parole results in a return to prison for the remainder of the maximum judicial sentence; conviction for new criminal activity during parole results in a new prison sentence. More information on parole can be found in the Release section of this report.\nIn 2016, a third of women in state prisons were on probation immediately prior to their arrests, underscoring how an alternative to incarceration often serves as a pathway to prison.139 The costs and logistics associated with probation, which often require people to meet regularly with probation officers, attend court, engage in mental health or substance use disorder treatment, and secure out-of-home employment, often disproportionately burden women. Justice-involved women are more likely to be the primary caretakers of children or other adults and have lower rates of employment compared to system-involved men. In an analysis of data from 2015 to 2019, women on probation were twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with a mental health disorder—31% compared to 16%.140\n31%\nof women on probation were diagnosed with a mentalhealth disorder.\n16%\nof men on probation were diagnosed with a mentalhealth disorder.\nWomen’s higher rates of caretaking, lower employment prospects, and high rates of mental health disorder reduce their financial security and may result in their engagement in non-criminal behavior that conflicts with terms of supervision.141 For example, failure to pay the fees associated with probation may result in a technical violation and subsequent incarceration. Caring for children and other family members can also lead to scheduling commitments that conflict with probation-related appointments or other supervision requirements. Leaving an unsafe home or location, or experiencing homelessness, may be grounds for revocation. A study of a graduated sanctions model for probation (which involves short, incremental periods of incarceration for noncompliance) implemented in Kansas in 2013 analyzed outcomes by gender through 2018.142 Results indicate that the roughly 11,000 women on probation in Kansas had less serious offenses and less extensive criminal histories than the 34,000 men; after a technical violation, women were less likely to be sentenced to incarceration than men (36% of women compared to 43% of men). However, after the passage of the graduated sanction model, women were more likely to be sentenced to incarceration for a technical violation than they had been before, a finding not replicated for men.\nSupervising officers also face challenges when working with women on probation. In a survey of more than 200 probation officers (51% female), respondents indicated that women on probation had different needs than men and required different supervision strategies.143 Officers reported that the women on their caseloads were more likely than the men to have multiple, complex problems; seven out of ten officers said their female supervisees were “more emotional” than males, placing greater demands on the officers’ time, energy, and skills. For these reasons, many of the probation officers surveyed–especially female probation officers–believed that supervising women was more difficult than supervising men.\nStigma and Stereotypes\nGender-based stigma and stereotypes significantly affect women’s experiences within the criminal justice system at every point of contact.144 Many of these biases can lead to differential treatment and outcomes for women. For example, women may be perceived as less culpable or threatening due to societal perceptions of femininity, leading to more lenient sentencing in certain cases.145 However, the intersection of race and gender may complicate these dynamics, with non-White women often experiencing less favorable treatment.146\nSentencing disparities for women have been attributed to multiple factors, from the prioritization of a defendant’s blameworthiness to public safety issues and the pragmatic consequences of sentencing.147 For example, a female defendant convicted of a non-violent drug offense may receive a more lenient sentence than a male defendant if she is perceived as less blameworthy and less of a threat to public safety. Additionally, judges may act as protectors, especially toward women, which can result in both lenient or punitive sentencing outcomes.148 To avoid disrupting the family unit, for example, a judge may opt for a lenient sentence, like probation or a community-based program, for a woman with young children. Alternatively, a judge concerned that a woman is a risk to herself or her children due to substance use or domestic violence may impose a harsher sentence as a form of intervention or family protection. Gender-based leniency tends to be extended to women charged with non-violent crimes who conform to traditional gender roles; that may explain racial disparities in sentencing, as women of color who deviate from these norms may face harsher sentences than their White counterparts.149\nCorrections\nThis section describes the distinct needs and experiences of women during their incarceration in jails and prisons. Women report higher rates of abuse and assault during custody, and targeted programs tailored to their needs are seldom available. These factors can exacerbate preexisting mental health symptoms and chronic health conditions and create new challenges for women as they adjust to confinement.\nThe number of women held in prisons and jails increased 617% from 1982 to its peak in 2018, before falling slightly in 2019 and dropping more significantly in 2020 due to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 and 2022, the number of incarcerated women began climbing again. In 1982, there were roughly 31,500 incarcerated women. The majority of these women were being held in state prison (51%), 44% were in local jails, and 5% were in federal prison.150 In 2022, the most recent year for which data were available, there were about 181,000 incarcerated women. More than half (51%) were held in local jails, and of those, roughly 60% were being held pre-trial.151 The remainder of those incarcerated were held in state prisons (43%) and federal prisons (6%).\nIncarcerated Women, 1982-2022\nTo address the dramatic increase of women in confinement, several assessments have been developed to better understand their needs and guide policy and practice to create better outcomes. The Women’s Correctional Safety Scales toolkit measures women’s perceptions of safety in prisons and jails and explores their likelihood of reporting abuse given those perceptions.152 This information can help correctional facilities address safety concerns and ensure that when violence or abuse occurs, these behaviors are reported and responded to quickly and appropriately. Another tool, the Gender Informed Practices Assessment, was designed to help prison administrators understand what gender-responsive principles are, whether and how facility policy and practice adhere to these principles, and how to move toward the development and implementation of gender-responsive policy and practice.153\nIn 2010, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders (or the “Bangkok Rules”), to fill a gap in international standards and address gender-specific needs in confinement settings.154 The 70 rules set a global model for policymakers and corrections agencies to shift women to non-custodial setting when possible and improve practices related to security procedures and searches of women’s bodies, visitation from children and families, and gender-specific healthcare. Implementation of the Bangkok Rules–in the U.S. and internationally–has been limited.155\nRacial Disparities\nFrom 1990 to 2000, the population of incarcerated women more than doubled.156 By 2000, Black women were six times more likely to be incarcerated than White women, and three times more likely than Hispanic women (data on women who identified with other racial groups were not collected).157 From 2000 to 2020, imprisonment disparity between Black and White women fell 71%, decreasing from 6.3-to-1 to 1.8-to-1.158 This reduction in disparity was larger than that observed among men; for men, Black-White imprisonment rate disparity decreased 36% during the time period, from 8.3-to-1 to 5.3-to-1.159 Since 2010, imprisonment disparity between Hispanic and White women has been at or below parity (1-to-1), dropping 63% from 1.6 in 2000 to 0.6 in 2020, meaning that White women were more likely to be imprisoned than Hispanic women.160\nFemale Imprisonment Rate Disparity, 2000-2020\nChanges in admissions over time have driven these reductions in disparity. For example, from 2000 to 2020, admissions dropped 47% for Black females, increased 15% for Hispanic females, and rose 200% for White females.161 Women who identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, however, remain significantly over-represented in the prison population. In 2022, American Indian and Alaska Native women were incarcerated at a rate 4.3 times higher than White women.162\nAn analysis of trends in women’s offenses suggests that increasing numbers of White women in state prisons for drug crimes has fueled the decreasing disparity.163 From 2000 to 2020, imprisonment rate disparity for drug offenses between Black and White women fell steadily, reaching parity in 2016. In 2020, the ratio had dropped to 0.6, meaning that White women were more likely to be imprisoned for drug offenses than Black women. From 2000 to 2019, the Black female drug offense imprisonment rate decreased by 86%, while the White female rate increased by 68%.\nTo read more about trends in racial disparities among the incarcerated women’s population, read CCJ’s report, Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Female Imprisonment in the U.S.\nComprehensive, national trend data on race and ethnicity for women incarcerated in local jails are not available, although a review of localized studies suggests disproportionate representation relative to the resident population.164 For example, in Cook County, IL (Chicago)—in which the largest racial demographic among residents is White—81% of female jail admissions in 2011 were Black or Hispanic. Similar overrepresentation of women of color in jails was identified in Miami-Dade County, across New Jersey, and in Baltimore.165\nRisk and Needs Assessment\nRisk and Needs Assessments are tools used to determine an individual’s risk for engaging in criminal behavior and identify any programs or services needed to promote reentry success. During early contact with the justice system, risk and needs assessment tools function as navigational aids, guiding decisions regarding pretrial detention or sentencing severity.166 During confinement, risk and needs assessments may be used to determine custody levels and prioritize prison-based programs and services.\nThe vast majority of risk and needs assessments were developed using the principles of the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model.167 This model, developed in the 1990s, emphasizes the identification of a person’s risk level and specific criminogenic needs, as well as the appropriate responsive interventions. Recent research, however, has critiqued the RNR model’s applicability to justice-involved women.168 Although women’s distinct pathways into the criminal justice system and unique needs during arrest and confinement have been well documented, the conventional RNR model does not accommodate these distinctions.169 Therefore, the relationship between level of risk and recidivism is weaker for females than males, which in turn suggests that the criminogenic needs of women may differ from men and imply different prison-based programming strategies to reduce risk.170 The application of RNR may result in women’s over-classification to higher security levels, resulting in their exclusion from educational and vocational programming and some types of pretrial release and reentry programs.171\nTo address this gap, alternative assessment models have been developed and tailored to address women’s gender-specific risks and socioeconomic needs. Notable examples include the Women’s Risk Needs Assessment, a full assessment of both gender-neutral and gender-responsive factors,172 and the Gender Informed Needs Assessment,173 which was designed for use pre-trial and incorporates considerations such as childcare responsibilities and trauma exposure into the evaluative framework. Despite the availability of these alternative models, however, the integration of gender-responsive assessments into mainstream criminal justice practices has been limited.174 A 2021 evaluation indicated that roughly a third (37%) of states used gender-responsive risk and needs assessments, despite evidence suggesting that existing tools may not be universally applicable or effective.175\nSexual Assault in Prisons and Jails\nIn 2003, the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) was signed into law, intended to eradicate rape and sexual abuse in all federal, state, and local correctional facilities.176 PREA provides funding for data collection, the development of recommendations to ensure safety for all incarcerated people, and to ensure that local or annual budgets do not impede sexual assault prevention measures. Still, sexual abuse and sexual assault occur in prisons and jails177—sometimes perpetrated by other incarcerated people and sometimes by correctional staff—and this abuse disproportionately affects women.\nReported Sexual Victimization in State and Federal Prisons by Sex, 2011-2012\nIn 2011 and 2012, women were four times more likely than men178 to self-report sexual victimization by other incarcerated people during incarceration in prisons—6.9% compared to 1.7%—and more than twice as likely in jails—3.6% compared to 1.4%.179 A three-year analysis ending in 2018 of state and federal prisons and representative jail samples identified nearly 5,400 victims of sexual violence perpetrated by staff (46%) or other incarcerated people (54%).180 Nearly 30% of the victims of substantiated incidents of sexual misconduct perpetrated by staff were female; 25% of victims of substantiated sexual victimization by other incarcerated people were female.181 These figures represent significant disproportionality, given that women comprise just 10% of the total incarcerated population.182\nA study using data from roughly 800 women who experienced sexual misconduct from male staff in Michigan did not find significant differences by race when comparing the type of victimization, reporting behaviors, and retaliation by staff.183 However, prison staff were more likely to investigate abuse reported by White women; 66% of the White women included in the study had at least one of their reports investigated, compared to 42% of Black women. Additionally, reports by Black women were almost twice as likely to be found “unsubstantiated” by prison staff than reports from White women (60% vs. 31%).\nA senate subcommittee report published in 2022 found that correctional employees had sexually abused incarcerated women in at least two-thirds of federal facilities—19 out of 29—within the previous 10 years.184 The report noted that the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) had not successfully implemented PREA mandates, a shortcoming that perpetuated abuse and culminated in a backlog of hundreds of sexual abuse-related internal affairs cases. In at least four federal facilities, staff were found to have sexually abused numerous incarcerated women over months or years.\nFCI Dublin\nIn one federal women’s facility, California’s FCI Dublin, eight employees—including the warden and chaplain—were charged with sexual abuse of multiple women in custody, and at least 15 additional staff members were under investigation as of 2022.185 The report concluded that the BOP failed to systemically analyze complaint data to address problematic employees and institutions.186 In April 2024, BOP officials announced the closure of FCI Dublin in response to the pattern of abuse and misconduct. But the closure was widely criticized—including by the judge overseeing the case—as “ill-conceived,” in part because roughly 600 women were quickly transferred to other federal women’s facilities across the nation, moving them farther from their families.187\nPhysical Assault in Prisons and Jails\nWhile women experience disproportionate risk for sexual abuse and assault during confinement compared to men, they have a similar risk for experiencing physical abuse and assault. Although national data about physical victimization that occurs in state or federal prisons were not identified, a 2009 study examining physical violence in one state prison system found that 21% of incarcerated women and men had experienced physical violence from another incarcerated person during the previous six months.188 Incarcerated women were less likely than men to experience physical violence from staff (8% compared to 25%). Data on the prevalence of physical assault for women in jails were not identified.\nLGBTQ+ People\nData on LGBTQ+ people involved in the justice system are scarce, largely because most correctional systems have only recently begun to track sexual orientation and gender identity. Existing data are limited by variation in how these identities are defined and measured across location and likely exclude some LGBTQ+ people who may not self-identify due to fear of discrimination or retaliation in custodial settings. Data do suggest, however, that lesbian and bisexual women are significantly overrepresented in the female incarcerated population. An analysis of data drawn from the National Inmate Survey, conducted in 2011 and 2012, found that one third of women in prison and a quarter (26%) of women in jail identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.189 These figures were much higher than those reported among men; 6% of men in prisons and 3% in jails identified as gay or bisexual. Of the women who identified as lesbian or bisexual, 39% were White, 24% were Black, 20% were Hispanic, and 17% identified with another racial identity.\nWomen who identify as LGBTQ+ often have unique experiences prior to confinement and take different pathways to prison than their heterosexual counterparts. As noted above, girls who identify lesbian, gay, or bisexual are more than four times as likely to be involved in the juvenile justice system than heterosexual girls,190 due to higher rates of bullying and abuse from peers or family members, family rejection, and homelessness.191\nAdult women who identify as LGBTQ+ face similar stigmatization in their families, schools, and workplaces. This increases risk for abuse and the development of mental health and substance use disorders, all of which increase their risk for criminal justice system involvement.192 For example, from 2017 to 2020, the rate of violent victimization was twice as high for lesbian and gay people, and more than eight times as high for bisexual females compared to their heterosexual counterparts.193 In 2019, lesbian and bisexual women were four times more likely to be arrested than heterosexual women.194\nThe culture of prison environments and biases from staff and other incarcerated people can lead to stigmatization, rejection, and trauma for women who identify as LGBTQ+.195 Prison-based programs often do not address the distinctive needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual women. Even gender-responsive programs typically target heterosexual women and their intimate relationships with men; a focus on male-perpetuated violence may not resonate with lesbian, gay, and bisexual women, resulting in their alienation from programming.196\nWomen who do not identify as heterosexual are also two to three times more likely to report sexual victimization during confinement. Data from the 2011-2012 National Inmate Survey indicate that 9% of non-heterosexual women reported sexual victimization from other incarcerated women and 3% reported sexual victimization from staff.197 In comparison, 4% of heterosexual women reported sexual victimization from other incarcerated women and 1% of heterosexual women reported sexual victimization from staff during the same time period.\nTransgender people have distinct interactions with and mistrust in law enforcement, different pathways to criminal justice involvement, and differing needs during confinement than their cisgender counterparts. In 2016, roughly 4,000 (0.3%) people in state prisons self-identified as transgender.198 In 2024, 2,000 transgender people were estimated to be in federal prisons (approximately 1,400 transgender women, and 700 transgender men).199\nMore than half of transgender people (58%) report some kind of mistreatment from interactions with law enforcement, and 57% say they would feel uncomfortable asking the police for help.200 In 2011, 16% of transgender people reported being imprisoned at some point in their lives, compared to 3% of the general public.201 Rates were highest among Black (47%) and Native American transgender respondents (30%), and higher for male-to-female transgender people (21%) than for female-to-male transgender people (10%).\nThough policies vary by state, most states incarcerate transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth. There are some exceptions. In California, for example, transgender, non-binary, and intersex people can request to be housed based on their gender identity, a policy that took effect in 2021.202 In Colorado, housing units for transgender people are planned for 2024–one within a men’s prison and the other within a women’s.203 Some other state prison systems and county jails permit for housing by gender identity on a case-by-case basis.\nTransgender incarcerated people face unique challenges during confinement, and they are more likely to spend time in restrictive housing, often cited by correctional staff as a way to protect them from abuse. Almost half (42%) of transgender people who have been incarcerated reported being held in solitary confinement.204 More than a third of transgender people who had experienced incarceration reported harassment from other incarcerated people (35%) and correctional staff (37%).205 Approximately 16% reported physical assault and 15% reported sexual assault from other incarcerated people or correctional staff. Rates were highest for Black transgender women; 38% reported being sexually assaulted by other incarcerated people or staff.\nTransgender incarcerated people often do not receive comprehensive, targeted healthcare while incarcerated.206 In 2015, more than a third (37%) of transgender incarcerated people were denied the hormone therapy they had been taking prior to incarceration.207 In recent years, many transgender women, backed by advocacy groups, have sued their state departments of corrections for not providing transgender-responsive healthcare.208\nDisciplinary Infractions\nIncarcerated women’s behavior is often interpreted by staff through a negative gendered lens, in which they are seen as “needy,” “overly emotional,” or “defiant.”209 Despite the fact that women’s prisons have lower levels of violence than men’s prisons, women are disciplined at higher rates than incarcerated men; citations are often issued for small infractions tied to these gender-based perceptions, such as disrespect, disobedience, and being disruptive. An analysis of 15 state correctional systems found that women were two to three times more likely to be disciplined for small infractions than men.210 For example, in Iowa, women were nearly three times more likely than men to receive violations for being “disruptive.” In Vermont, women were more than three times as likely to be disciplined for making “derogatory comments” about other incarcerated women or prison staff than men.\nWomen were 40% more likely to receive “defiance infractions”—defined as minor violations for disrespect or disobedience, or even for one’s appearance or hygiene—compared to men.\nAnother study, which analyzed records of approximately 23,000 men and women released between 2010 and 2013 from prisons in a large western state, found that women were 40% more likely to receive “defiance infractions”—defined as minor violations for disrespect or disobedience, or even for one’s appearance or hygiene—compared to men.211 In Illinois in 2018, rates of disciplinary tickets were 155% higher for women than for men.212\nMinor disciplinary infractions can result in substantial consequences, including restricted movement throughout the facility, the withdrawal of privileges like visitation or commissary purchases, the loss of good conduct credits that would otherwise reduce time served, and in some cases, solitary confinement.213 From 2016 to 2018, women in California prisons lost the equivalent of 1,483 years of good time credits due to disciplinary infractions, exceeding rates of credit losses for men during the same period.\nIn 2020, the U.S. Commission on Human Rights issued a report highlighting disparities in disciplinary actions by gender in prisons, a surprising finding given that rates of violence within women’s facilities are lower than in men’s.214 The authors indicated that disparities in disciplinary actions were often fueled by the emotion and annoyance of staff rather than policy, as women in custody are more likely than men to talk to staff, ask questions, and verbally challenge staff decision-making.215 For example, one formerly incarcerated woman recounted having received a disciplinary infraction for “reckless eye-balling,” and a Gender-Informed Practices Assessment of Illinois’ largest women’s prison showed that women were five times more likely than men to receive infractions for an offense titled “minor insolence.”216 The former warden of the Illinois prison explained that with women, “we discipline based on emotion rather than on safety and security.”217\nThe use of solitary confinement—arguably the most severe disciplinary action taken against incarcerated people—is disproportionately used on people of color, people with mental illness, and LGBTQ+ people in prison.218 Most research, however, focuses on the experiences of men in solitary confinement or segregation, as they make up more of the incarcerated population and are more likely to be placed in solitary confinement.219 National statistics on solitary confinement broken down by both sex and race were not identified, creating a gap in understanding. However, a report from the U.S. Commission on Human Rights on the general population of incarcerated people found that 21% of Black people and 20% of both Native American and multiracial people had spent time in restrictive housing, compared to 16% of White people.220 People who identified as transgender were also significantly more likely to be placed in restrictive housing compared to their cisgender peers, although the use of solitary confinement is sometimes considered a protective measure to ensure these individuals are not victimized during confinement.221 An analysis of federal data from the BOP found that transgender people were two to three times more likely to be in solitary confinement in any given month from 2017 to 2022 than cisgender people.222\nAs for women with mental health disorders, there is existing research showing that they are more likely to spend time in solitary confinement than women who do not have mental health disorders. A review of Illinois from a 25-month period between 2013 and 2015 found that the state’s largest women’s prison had issued more than 127,000 days of segregation to about 1,100 women. Of the 38 women with the most days (ranging from about 500 to 5,300 days), 74% had been identified as “seriously mentally ill.”223 Another study found that incarcerated women in Pennsylvania with mental health disorders received more than two and a half times the misconduct charges than women without such disorders, and had a 48% increase in likelihood of receiving time in solitary confinement.224\nParenting During Confinement and the Impact on Children and Families\nMore than half (58%) of women in prisons are parents to minor children, compared to 47% of men.225 Estimates suggest that at least three out of four of women in jails are mothers, although a comparable figure for men could not be identified.226 More than half of mothers (55%) in state and federal prison, compared to 36% of fathers, lived with their children prior to incarceration. Mothers were more than twice as likely as fathers to be the sole or primary caretaker of their children before entering jail or prison.227\nGiven that mothers are more likely than fathers to have had custody of their children when they were incarcerated, mothers are also more often subject to the termination of parental rights, which can push their children into the child welfare system. For example, a felony conviction that results in long-term incarceration and requires a child to enter foster care due to a lack of alternatives results in the termination of parental rights in 27 states.228 Rights are terminated when incarcerated mothers do not have alternative kinship placements identified for their existing children or for any baby born during their incarceration.\nWhile the children of incarcerated fathers are likely to stay in the community with their mothers, the termination of parental rights and reduced kinship support often push the children of incarcerated mothers into foster care. Nearly nine in 10 incarcerated fathers (88%) reported that their children were living with their other parent during their incarceration, compared to 37% of incarcerated mothers.229 The primary caretaker of incarcerated mothers’ children was a grandparent (45%), followed by other relatives (23%). Mothers in prison are five times more likely to have a child placed in foster care than fathers (10% versus 2%).230 Because there are fewer women’s prisons than men’s (only one or two in many states),231 women tend to be incarcerated farther away than men from their homes. On average, women are incarcerated 160 miles from home, which means that most incarcerated mothers never receive a visit from their children.232\nAs a result, the incarceration of mothers has powerful ripple effects on children and families. Children of incarcerated parents are at high risk for experiencing a range of social, economic, educational, criminal justice, and behavioral health challenges.233 Although most research focuses on the children of incarcerated fathers, key differences between the children of incarcerated mothers and fathers have been identified. For example, children of incarcerated mothers are 12 times more likely to be in foster care as other children; by contrast, children of incarcerated fathers are about twice as likely to be in foster care as other children.234\nRecent analyses suggest, however, that children’s behavioral problems are more strongly linked to paternal incarceration, indicating that poor outcomes may be driven by factors preceding maternal incarceration rather than being caused by maternal incarceration.235\nChildren of incarcerated mothers are 12 times more likely to be in foster care.\nA study of Black families found that children of incarcerated mothers are also more likely to be arrested at some point in their lives (53% compared to 42% of those with an incarcerated father and 46% of those with both parents incarcerated), have a younger age of first arrest, and experience significantly more lifetime arrests.236 For example, children with an incarcerated mother had an average of 5.6 arrests as juveniles, compared to three for those with an incarcerated father, 5.1 for those with both parents incarcerated, and 2.4 for those with neither parent incarcerated.\nSome prison systems have identified the importance of connecting incarcerated mothers with their children; they have developed targeted programs to enhance in-person visitation and foster connection between mothers and their children from afar. For example, the Mothers and Their Children program in one North Carolina prison provides a home-like setting for visitation, parenting, and education on healthy family relationships for mothers.237 Kids-A-Part, operated in Vermont’s women’s correctional facility, provides support to pregnant women and parents and facilitates visits and communication between mothers and their children.238\nOther programs are more widely implemented. For example, in at least 23 states, Girl Scouts Beyond Bars arranges for twice-monthly prison visits and delivers organized programming between daughters age 5 to 17 and their incarcerated mothers.239 One evaluation of the program found that participation resulted in positive outcomes for the children, including improved relationships with their mothers, better behavior and school performance, and more involvement in community activities and helping others.240 Other programs help create connection between incarcerated parents and their children through reading and recording children’s books. The Storybook Project—which has chapters in multiple states, such as Texas, Illinois, Alabama, and Arkansas—sends recordings from incarcerated mothers along with books to their children to maintain their connection.241\nWomen Serving Life Sentences\nWomen represent a small but growing share of all people serving life sentences. The number of women serving a life sentence (either with or without the possibility of parole) increased 19% from 2008 to 2020, and the growth of this population has outpaced the growth among men serving life sentences.242 By 2020, about 6,600—or one in 15—incarcerated women were serving a term of life imprisonment.243 The increase was even higher for women serving life without the possibility of parole (LWOP); from 2008 to 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of women serving LWOP, compared to a 29% increase among men.244 The number of women sentenced to death peaked in 1990 and has declined since that time. Currently, roughly 50 women are awaiting execution nationally.245\n1 in 15 incarcerated women were serving a term of life imprisonment in 2020.\nWomen serving long prison sentences—including life sentences—are at high risk for developing depression and attempting suicide, especially upon prison admission and after serving extended periods of time. Research suggests that risk for suicide is heightened among women serving long sentences who experienced severe abuse prior to incarceration.246\nWomen of color are disproportionately represented among women serving life sentences, although it is unclear how crime type and criminal history influence the numbers. Nationally, one in 39 Black incarcerated women was serving life without parole in 2020, compared to one in 59 White incarcerated women.247\nFew studies focus exclusively on the population of women serving life sentences, partly because of the small size of this population. The most recent comprehensive examination of data on women serving life sentences relied on the Survey of Prison Inmates in 2004 (the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates did not include these variables).248 The study indicated that 78% of women serving life sentences had experienced prior physical abuse and 60% had experienced sexual abuse.\nWomen serving life sentences were more likely to have experienced childhood abuse and adult intimate partner violence compared to men serving life sentences and women serving sentences shorter than life. Specifically, compared to women serving less than life, women serving life sentences were more likely to have experienced sexual (23% vs. 15%) and physical intimate partner violence (55% vs. 42%) in adulthood. When compared to men serving life sentences, women were over seven times more likely to report sexual assault (60% vs. 8%) and nearly 14 times more likely to have been physically assaulted in their adult intimate relationships (55% vs. 4%).249\nEven less is known about the population of women who have been sentenced to death in the U.S. A study of the trial transcripts of 48 women on death row suggests that nearly all (96%) of these women experienced severe and prolonged physical, sexual, and psychological abuse throughout their lives.250 Roughly 80% experienced severe abuse prior to age 18, typically inflicted by known individuals, including family members or caregivers (79%) and intimate partners (74%). These rates were higher among the subsample of women of color on death row; nine of the 10 Black women and every one of the nine Latina, American Indian/Native Alaskan, and Asian women in the sample survived multiple incidents of violence. The analysis indicated that defense attorneys often failed to effectively present evidence of interpersonal violence in women’s capital trials, while prosecutors use gendered tropes to discredit these experiences, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the women’s extensive trauma and its relevance to their culpability among criminal justice system stakeholders.\nHealth and Healthcare\nThe Constitution’s Eighth Amendment ensures the right to health care for incarcerated people.251 However, women have specific health and healthcare needs that prison- and jail-based healthcare systems struggle to address. Along with limited access to menstrual supplies during confinement and the distinct healthcare needs of pregnant and postpartum women behind bars, incarcerated women face a range of other physical health challenges during confinement, including inadequate nutrition and higher rates of cervical cancer and many chronic illnesses.\nChronic Medical Conditions\nResearch suggests that there is a disproportionate prevalence of many physical health issues among incarcerated women compared to incarcerated men and to women in the general population.252 In a study of about 7,000 people incarcerated in jails, 57% of the women had a chronic medical condition compared to 40% of the men.253 Chronic conditions that were higher among incarcerated women included cancer (8% of women compared to 1% of men), hypertension (22% compared to 17%), diabetes (7% compared to 3%), arthritis (20% compared to 13%), asthma (24% compared to 14%), and hepatitis (10% compared to 5%).254\nChronic conditions that were higher among incarcerated women included cancer hypertension diabetes arthritis asthma hepatitis .\nMany chronic medical conditions may be exacerbated by inadequate nutrition; incarcerated people often do not have access to nutritious or balanced diets during custody.255 Research indicates that meals provided in most prisons and jails are high in cholesterol, low in necessary vitamins and minerals, and include large amounts of sugar. A study found that one state’s prison facilities were serving food with double the department’s intended target for sugar content for men, and more than triple the target for women.256 Common chronic medical conditions among incarcerated populations, including hypertension and diabetes, can be exacerbated by a diet high in fat, sugar, and sodium.257\nChronic Medical Conditions by Sex\nCancer Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nRates of cervical and breast cancer are significantly higher among women who have experienced incarceration compared to women who have never been incarcerated, which may be attributed to lower rates of preventive screening among this population both prior to and during custody.258 Lower rates of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screenings have been associated with experiences of sexual assault in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, as screenings are invasive and may be triggering to some survivors. In a sample of roughly 11,000 adults in Kansas, experiences of sexual assault were associated with 31% lower odds of receiving a Papanicolaou (Pap) test to screen for cervical cancer and 30% lower odds of receiving a mammogram to screen for breast cancer; sexual assault was not associated with the likelihood of colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer.259\nWomen under correctional supervision are four to five times more likely to develop cervical cancer than women who are not in custody or under correctional supervision.260 Specifically, among women aged 34 to 49 (the highest risk years for cervical cancer to develop), roughly 6% of those in prison and jail were diagnosed with cervical cancer, compared to 1% of women in the community.261 In all correctional settings, preventive cancer screenings are available by patient or provider request, although few people access them. Some people are released prior to obtaining services, others decline services, and most are never seen by a provider for the services to be ordered.262\nWomen under correctional control are four to five times more likely to develop cervical cancer than women not in custody or under supervision.\nCancer Screening\nIn a qualitative study of 45 women incarcerated in jail, respondents possessed varying levels of cervical health literacy. Many expressed difficulties navigating the stigma of criminal justice system involvement when accessing healthcare more generally, but specifically when accessing cancer prevention services.263 In a survey conducted among roughly 80 women in jail, however, screening rates for Pap tests and mammograms were relatively high. For example, 90% of women reported having had a Pap test within the past three years, and 94% were willing to be screened in jail. Among a subsample of 32 women eligible for a mammogram (aged 40 years and older), 41% reported having had a mammogram within two years, and 88% were willing to have one. Among respondents, knowledge about cancer screening was significantly associated with being White and having had insurance prior to incarceration.264\nChallenges accessing screening and treatment—both in the community and during custody—can have dire consequences. One study found that for both men and women, incarceration and recent release from prison were associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer-related mortality compared to the risk among peers who were never incarcerated.265 The risk for cancer-related death five years after diagnosis was 39% higher among those diagnosed while incarcerated and 82% higher among those recently released from prison compared to their never-incarcerated peers, after controlling for demographics, type of cancer, and stage of cancer at diagnosis. Nearly 40% of the women diagnosed with breast cancer during incarceration died within five years, compared to 18% of those diagnosed the year following release and 10% of those who had never been incarcerated. Correctional healthcare facilities are not equipped to ensure incarcerated people have routine access to preventive care, and financial and logistical barriers decrease access to effective treatments.\nMental Health and Substance Use Disorders\nAs noted in “Pathways,” incarcerated women consistently report higher rates of mental health disorders than men, regardless of whether they are measured as a generic “mental health condition” or using specific diagnostic categories.266\nFor example, in 2011-2012, the most recent year for which national data were available, two-thirds of women in prison and 68% of women in jail were diagnosed with a mental health disorder, compared to just over a third (35%) of men in prison and 41% of men in jail.267 Women are twice as likely as men to be identified as experiencing serious psychological distress,268 and are three times as likely to be diagnosed with PTSD.269 Women are also more likely than their male counterparts to be identified as having “serious mental illness.” In a study of 8,500 people in Iowa state prisons (9% female), women were more likely to be diagnosed with a mental health disorder than men (60% compared to 47%) and a greater share of women were identified as having “serious mental illness” than men (41% compared to 27%).270\nJustice-involved women are also more likely than men to be diagnosed with a substance use disorder and to have been intoxicated at the time of their offense. For example, nearly three-quarters of women in prison (69% to 72%) meet criteria for a substance use disorder, compared to 57% of men,271 and half of women in prison were using drugs at the time of their offense, compared to roughly 40% of men.272\nAlthough mental health and substance use disorders increase risk for criminal behavior and making contact with the justice system, these disorders also create obstacles for many affected women as they adjust to their lives in confinement.273 For example, women with mental health and substance use disorders are often less able than other incarcerated women to follow facility procedures and navigate social interactions.274 These women are also more likely to be disciplined or placed in isolation, to self-injure, and to be physically or sexually assaulted while in custody.275 In a study of about 7500 incarcerated people (7% female), women with a mental health disorder were three times more likely to report sexual victimization than men with a mental health disorder (23% of women compared to 8% of men) and they were 1.7 times more likely to report being physically victimized by another incarcerated person than incarcerated women with no mental health disorder.276\nMany justice-involved women with mental health and substance use disorders struggle to access treatment in prisons and jails and their perceptions of that treatment are not well explored. For example, a meta-analysis of women’s perceptions of prison-based mental health treatment only identified one study conducted in the U.S.277\nMental health treatment in confinement settings often focuses on medication management, rather than the provision of psychotherapy. Interviews with 50 women who accessed prison-based mental health services indicated that many women felt that service providers were not interested in listening to them about their symptoms, adverse effects of the medication, and other struggles related to their mental health.278 Some women noted how mental health staff and correctional staff shared information about those who accessed treatment, resulting in women experiencing stigma from correctional staff and often withdrawing from treatment services. Wait lists for mental health, and especially substance use disorder, treatment in prisons and jails are common.\nAdditionally, as the majority of incarcerated people are male, existing services were designed in response to their needs. Few gender-responsive and trauma-informed programs have been developed to meet the needs of incarcerated women with mental health and substance use disorders, and existing programs are not widely implemented. Learn more in “Gender-Responsive and Trauma-Informed Programming.”\nReproductive Health\nA committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published in 2021 stated:\nThere has been limited attention to addressing incarcerated women’s gender-specific health care needs, which may be in part due to the smaller proportion of the incarcerated population that they represent, facilitating their neglect. However, it also relates to the inherently male focus of the system that has allowed women’s needs to be eclipsed or conflated with those of males who are incarcerated.279\nThis limited focus on gender-specific health needs is reflected in the lack of data and policy related to menstruation, pregnancy, prenatal care, and birth outcomes for incarcerated women.\nMenstruation\nAs of 2023, half of state correctional systems and the federal prison system required the provision of free menstrual supplies upon request to incarcerated women, although interpretation and enforcement of these policies varies widely.280 The lack of access to menstrual supplies and uneven enforcement of policies create difficulties for incarcerated women, in part because evidence suggests they have higher rates of abnormal menstrual bleeding than women in the general population—a condition believed to be associated with increased levels of stress among this population.281 One study found that one in three of incarcerated women experienced abnormal bleeding during menstruation, compared to about 13% of the general population and roughly 16% of women who were not incarcerated but were living under the federal poverty level or had not completed high school.282\nEven in the states with policies mandating access to menstrual supplies, women typically must request products from staff, which may result in uneven enforcement, intrusive medical examinations, or other humiliating or abusive practices.283 For example, a 2014 Department of Justice report found that some women in an Alabama prison were coerced into sexual contact with staff to obtain necessities, including menstrual supplies.284 While some states provide women with a set number of pads or tampons per month, women may have to remove pads and tampons during strip searches, further depleting this supply.285 Purchasing additional supplies also can be prohibitively expensive; a box of tampons often costs twice as much in prisons as in community settings.286 In Missouri, before a policy was passed to mandate free access to menstrual supplies, one box of brand-name tampons was estimated to cost 70% to 80% of an incarcerated woman’s monthly wages.287\nWithout adequate access to menstrual supplies, women are left to generate alternative solutions, which have resulted in unsanitary and unsafe outcomes.288 A 2018 study surveyed incarcerated women in a state where free menstrual supplies were not supplied and found that eight out of ten of respondents had resorted to homemade tampons, and 23% reported having had a vaginal infection within the previous six months.289 There were no infections reported by those who had not used homemade tampons.\nPregnancy Behind Bars\nMost women in custody are of childbearing age, and some are pregnant when they enter prison or jail. Comprehensive statistics estimating the number of pregnant individuals in prisons and jails, however, are lacking.\nData on the number of pregnant women admitted to state prisons or jails, and the outcomes of their pregnancies, are not routinely collected by the government. Data from the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates indicate that 4% of women in state prisons and 3% of women in federal prisons self-reported being pregnant when they were admitted to prison.290 In 2023, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a feasibility study to explore the potential for collecting these data from all state prison systems, and concluded that it was possible.291 Data collection is scheduled to begin in 2024.\n4% of women in state prisons and\n3% of women in federal prisons self-reported being pregnant when admitted to prison.\nIn 2018, the First Step Act mandated that federal prisons collect data on pregnancy and birth outcomes among women in their custody (roughly 6% of all incarcerated women in 2022 were in federal custody).292 According to the data, in 2022, 96 of the just over 10,000 women incarcerated in federal prisons (0.9%) were pregnant at their time of admission. A majority (55%) of these pregnancies resulted in a live birth during confinement, 8% ended in miscarriage, 6% resulted in abortion, and 1% resulted in stillbirth.293 Outcomes for the remaining 29% were unknown as the mother was released from federal prison prior to the end of her pregnancy.\nWhile full national statistics are not collected, the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project gathered data on pregnancy outcomes from all federal prisons and a sample of state prisons and jails across the U.S. in 2016 and 2017.294 Data collected for the project represented 57% of women in state and federal prisons and 5% of women in local jails. Among the facilities surveyed, roughly 4% of women in state and federal prisons and 3% of women in jails were pregnant upon admission, leading to a rough estimate of 3,000 admissions of pregnant women to prison and 55,000 to jail annually.295 These values account for the higher number of annual jail admissions (in 2022, there were 7.3 million jail admissions296 compared to 470,000 state and federal prison admissions297) and the shorter average length of stay in local jails.\nPregnancy outcomes differed slightly for pregnant women in prisons and jails.298 Just under half (42%) of pregnant women admitted to prison and 86% of women admitted to jail were released prior to the end of their pregnancy. Just over half of pregnancies in prison (54%) resulted in live birth, 3% resulted in miscarriage, less than 1% resulted in abortion, and less than 1% resulted in stillbirth. Due to the shorter stays of women in jails, only 9% of pregnancies resulted in a live birth during confinement. Just under 3% of pregnancies in jail resulted in miscarriage, 2% resulted in abortion, and less than 1% resulted in stillbirth.\nSome prisons and jails restrict access to abortions during custody or do not have written policies detailing access to abortion. Others permit the procedure, but financial and logistical barriers may prevent access. National data on abortion policies in prisons and jails were not identified.\nThe Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project also collected data about incarcerated women’s access to abortion in 2016 and 2017. Results from a sample of 22 state prison systems and six jail systems indicated that 19 of the sampled prisons permitted women to obtain an abortion and three did not. Four of the six jails permitted abortions and two did not. The availability of abortion access and any time limitations imposed on the procedure were roughly conversant with state-level policy.299 The authors noted that abortion rates in the four jails that allowed the procedure were higher (33%) than for those observed among the general U.S. population (18%). Two-thirds of the state prisons and one of the jails that permitted women to obtain an abortion required women to pay for it themselves. More research is needed to understand whether and how incarcerated women can access abortion services in line with state policy.\nMany prisons and jails lack established policies about women’s access to contraception during incarceration, leading to subjective provision of contraceptive medication and variability of access. In addition to gathering information about pregnancy outcomes and abortion access, the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project in collected data on women’s access to contraception from a sample of 22 state prison systems, six jail systems, and three juvenile facilities in 2016. Overall, 65% of sample sites had formal written policies about contraception.300 The authors noted that some sites provided contraception without a formal policy. Nearly all (94%) sample sites allowed incarcerated people to initiate contraception during custody (all jails and juvenile detention systems as well as 19 of the 22 prisons in the sample). One prison provided prescriptions for contraception if women requested them prior to their release.\nAll sites allowed women to continue at least one form of contraception they were already taking upon admission (exclusions by type of contraceptive method and medical necessity–whether the medication was treating a medical condition and not being used solely to prevent pregnancy–were common). The contraceptive patch and ring methods were the least available methods for adult women. Two of the three juvenile detention systems allowed incarcerated girls to continue all forms contraception for either birth control or medical purposes. The shorter average stays for women in jails and girls in detention underscore the necessity of allowing continuation of these medications during confinement to prevent disruption and reduce unintended pregnancies after release. More research is needed to understand whether the policies of sample sites are representative of prisons, jails, and juvenile detention systems nationally and how these policies relate to pregnancy and medical outcomes for incarcerated women and girls. Additionally, given that 45% of facilities made continuation of contraception available only when it was deemed “medically necessary,” research is needed to evaluate how those determinations are made.\nPrenatal Care\nPrisons and jails are required by the Eighth Amendment to provide prenatal care to incarcerated pregnant women. But few standards detailing the required level of care exist and it is unclear whether prenatal care policies are uniformly enforced in prisons and jails. For example, 12 states have no official policy about the provision of prenatal care, and 31 states make no dietary adjustments for pregnant women.301 Self-reported data drawn from the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates indicate that roughly nine out of every 10 pregnant women in state or federal prisons report having received at least one obstetric exam during custody (91% of women in state prisons and 87% of women in federal prisons),302 a drop from the 2004 estimate of 94%.303 In 2016, about half of pregnant women in state (50%) and federal (46%) prison reported receiving some other form of prenatal care, including education, exercises, a special diet, medication, or special testing from a medical professional.\nThe inconsistent attention given to prenatal care can result in negative birth outcomes. While the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project estimated an average miscarriage rate of 6% in prisons in 2016 and 2017, lower than a national average of 10%,304 the miscarriage rate was between 17% and 22% in five of the 22 states that provided data, indicating critical state-level differences in pregnancy screening and prenatal care.305\nIncarcerated women often have preexisting risk factors, including chronic illness and substance use disorders, that result in their pregnancies being identified as high-risk.306 However, the federal prison system and 22 of the 48 states (46%) had no policy to identify or manage high-risk pregnancies.307 In a cohort of about 175,000 women who gave birth in Massachusetts between 2012 and 2014, women who had been incarcerated during pregnancy or the postpartum period were 21% more likely to be diagnosed with an opioid use disorder than other women in the sample.308 Data collected in 2016 and 2017 indicated that more than a quarter (26%) of pregnant women admitted to state prisons and 14% admitted to local jails had an opioid use disorder.309 Opioid exposure during pregnancy is associated with premature birth, and babies born to opioid-using mothers are twice as likely to require intensive care.310 Although medications for opioid use disorder are the standard of care, especially during pregnancy, not all correctional settings provide them.311 In a survey of 836 jail medical facilities conducted in 2019, 60% initiated or continued medications for opioid use disorder and 23% put opioid-using pregnant women through a withdrawal protocol.312 The Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project found that while more than 80% of prisons continued medications for opioid use disorder during a woman’s pregnancy, fewer than one in five would initiate medication.313\nMany pregnant women who become justice-involved lack consistent access to food, shelter, and healthcare in the community.314 For example, a meta-analysis of 28 studies representing nearly 2,000 women in prison found that while incarcerated women were more likely to deliver prematurely or have a low-birth-weight baby compared to women in the community generally, they had better outcomes when compared to similarly disadvantaged women in the community.315\nShackling During Pregnancy and Birth\nMany medical professional societies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, strongly oppose the use of restraints on pregnant women prior to birth, during labor, and during the postpartum period.316 Shackling prevents comprehensive medical examinations and is associated with an increased risk of falling—sometimes resulting in miscarriage—and birth complications.317\nWhile over time corrections officials have cited security protocols to explain the shackling of pregnant women, lawmakers around the country have gradually taken action to ban the practice. As of early 2024, 41 states and the federal prison system have laws that prohibit the shackling of women during labor and delivery; some states also prohibit the shackling of women at other points during pregnancy and the postpartum period,318 although anecdotal evidence suggests that these practices still occur.319 The Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project found that despite near universal correctional facility policies prohibiting shackling, half of the 22 prisons and four of the six jails in the sample (which included the five largest jails in the U.S.) used restraints during pregnancy, birth, or the postpartum period in 2016 and 2017.320 Specifically, three prisons and two jails across four states that had anti-shackling statutes and a mandate to not restrain women in transport to the hospital for delivery, still reported restraining pregnant women under these circumstances. Data on the number of women who are shackled during their pregnancies were not available.\nInconsistencies in compliance persist due to correctional decision-making about security as well as some hospital policies.321 For example, a 2017 survey of healthcare providers found that 83% of providers who had cared for incarcerated pregnant and postpartum women reported that their patients were shackled some or all of the time.322\nPostpartum Care\nAlthough some incarcerated mothers can remain with their newborns in specialized prison nursery programs, most are separated from their babies 24 to 72 hours after giving birth. Many incarcerated women struggle during the postpartum period to recover physically and emotionally from the birth experience. In a longitudinal study of 58 women who were pregnant and gave birth during custody, more than a third met the criteria for moderate to severe postpartum depression, with higher rates seen among women with longer sentences and women separated from their newborns.323 About 14% of women in the community develop postpartum depression.324 While separation from one’s newborn is associated with increased mental health challenges, it also disrupts or fully prevents breastfeeding. Many prisons and jails do not have policies about breastfeeding or pumping breast milk, or enforce them, despite a large body of research on the health and developmental benefits of breastfeeding for infant development.325\nAmong women diagnosed with an opioid disorder, those with a history of incarceration were 4x more likely to overdose in the year following the birth of a child.\nThe management of opioid use disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period poses unique challenges for women in prisons and jails. Pregnant women with opioid use disorders are disproportionately represented in correctional facilities, and while some pregnant women are allowed to start or continue medications for treatment during incarceration, few standards exist to continue their access after birth. During the postpartum period, medications for opioid use disorder are discontinued for most women, despite their continued benefits to reduce the risk of overdose for mothers.326 For example, half of prisons and more than three-quarters of jails discontinued medications for opioid use disorder immediately after birth, forcing women into a withdrawal protocol.327 Scholars note that discontinuation of these medications upon birth suggests that the fetus, rather than the mother, was the treatment target.328 This is especially problematic given that medication is standard practice for the chronic disease management of opioid use disorder and that postpartum discontinuation increases the risk of fatal and nonfatal overdose. For example, among women diagnosed with an opioid use disorder, those with a history of incarceration were four times more likely to overdose in the year following the birth of a child.329\nPrison Nursery Programs\nAlthough separating mothers from their newborns is associated with increased health risks for both women and infants, just eight states—Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia—allow for newborns to stay with their incarcerated mothers after birth.330 Two additional prison nursery programs are under development; Missouri plans to open a program in July 2025331 and Utah has approval to open a program but has faced funding challenges.332\nPrison nursery programs typically permit mothers and babies to remain together for a period of 12 to 30 months and provide education on child development and structured parenting classes, as well as employment and educational supports to help mothers after release. These programs are associated with positive outcomes for babies, including the development of resiliency and secure attachment observed by preschool age, compared to a group of similarly high-risk babies of incarcerated mothers who did not participate in prison nursery programs.333 Anecdotally, mothers who participate in prison nursery programs report feeling more connected to their young children during critical stages of bonding and development.334\nPrison nursery programs are also associated with reduced recidivism for mothers after release. An evaluation of all women who participated in the Mother Offspring Development Program, housed at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women, from 1994 to 2012 found that program participants had a 28% reduction in the three-year return to custody rate than other women incarcerated and released during the same time period.335 These recidivism reductions were estimated to have saved the state $6 million over the study period in both reduced recidivism and foster care utilization.336 Other studies of prison nursery programs have produced similar findings. In a study of 139 mothers who participated in the Bedford Hills or Taconic Prison Nursery Programs in New York, 14% of participants were re-incarcerated, compared to 29% of women residing in the prisons in the general population during the same years.337\nPrison nursery programs have strict eligibility criteria that make many women ineligible. As recidivism and other outcomes are based on comparing women in prison nursery programs to women in the general population of the facility, analyses may overstate the effects of these programs.338 Put another way, women who are admitted to prison during their pregnancy and who choose or are selected to participate in a prison nursery program likely differ from other women in prison in ways that influence their post-release behaviors. Program participants also receive individualized attention and reentry preparation not provided other incarcerated women. All of these factors could result in reduced recidivism among program participants.\nAging and Menopause\nOlder adults represent the fastest-growing demographic in prison settings. In 2011, the incarcerated population aged 55 and older was 14 times larger than it was 30 years earlier. Estimates suggest that by 2030, incarcerated older adults will make up more than a third of the nation’s prison population.339 While the aging process poses significant challenges to all incarcerated people, women’s aging has unique facets; many of the impacts are not well understood, given that incarcerated women are underrepresented in research on aging in prison. One meta-analysis of studies published from 2007 to 2017 that explored the health of the aging prison population identified 21 studies in all, only two of which had a female sample.340 One of these studies examined obesity among older incarcerated women;341 while the other examined the relationship between physical and mental health issues and death anxiety.342 Therefore, little is known about women’s experience of aging behind bars, and whether and how their health needs are met. Still, some authors use existing research conducted on younger incarcerated women and older women in the community to estimate the health needs of this population.343\nThe physical and emotional symptoms of menopause are seldom addressed or effectively managed in correctional facilities. Qualitative interviews with women who experienced menopause in prison or jail suggest that women were unable to access common remedies used to manage menopause symptoms in the community (e.g., showers, air conditioning, homeopathic remedies, and hormonal medication) which increased their physical and emotional distress.344 During interviews, women said they struggled to access adequate menstrual supplies, clothing, and bedding to manage heavy bleeding; many also said they were unable to pay for medical visits to address their symptoms or pursue pain relief. Some described the discomfort of experiencing hot flashes during the summer in facilities without air conditioning. Overall, women reported that their menopause symptoms were largely dismissed by staff, and noted that it was difficult for them to access information about menopause, their symptoms, and potential interventions during confinement.345\nPrograms and Services in Women's Prisons and Jails\nA range of programs are provided in women’s and men’s prisons, with typical offerings addressing needs related to education, employment and vocation, parenting, violence and crime prevention, and religion and spirituality.346 These so-called “gender-neutral” programs were designed based on the known risks and needs of incarcerated men, and few existing programs have been designed specifically for incarcerated women.347\nSome prisons—about 35%—also offer college courses, though they serve a small part of the total prison population.348 A recent report found that while 15% of those enrolled in college courses under the Second Chance Pell program in the 2020-2021 financial aid year were female, men earned 93% of all degrees and other credentials.349 This suggests that although women are enrolling in higher education programs at nearly twice the rate as their presence in the prison population, they are less likely than men to complete the program and earn the degrees or credential.350 It is unclear how the length of women’s sentences and other factors influence their completion rates.\nProgram implementation and access are not distributed equally between women’s and men’s prisons. For example, women in Texas prisons can pursue an Associate’s degree or certification in just two occupations—office administration and culinary arts/hospitality—while men have access to Bachelor’s and Master’s programs and certifications in 21 occupations.351 Many prison systems provide similarly gendered offerings; women have access to more traditionally “feminine” and domestic-focused programs, such as cooking, cosmetology, and hospitality, while men have access to a wider range of programs, from HVAC repair to computer science.352\nThe fact that there are more men in prison and that, on average, women serve shorter sentences than men has been used to explain these differences in program access. However, in 2020, the U.S. Commission on Human Rights highlighted a national trend of prison systems consistently providing lower-level and highly gendered programs to women.353 Research suggests that prison programs prepare men for work and economic mobility while focusing on women as caretakers and in roles deemed more domestic and feminine, such as administration, hospitality, and beauty work.354 These program offerings do little to address the higher rates of mental health and substance use disorders in the female prison population and have been criticized for failing to prepare women for high-paying jobs upon release.355\nThe observed disparities in incarcerated women’s completion of higher education during confinement affects their likelihood for success during reentry. Completion of prison-based programing is associated with lower rates of recidivism after release, although results are seldom broken down by the sex of program participants.356 However, in a meta-analysis of 37 studies examining the relationship between prison-based program completion and recidivism, women had equivalent reductions in recidivism when compared to similar analyses of men (women who completed programs were 22% to 35% less likely to recidivate than those who did not).357 The effects were strongest for the studies that examined the impact of participation in gender-responsive programming, rather than all prison-based programming that might be available.358\nGender-Responsive and Trauma-Informed Programming\nSeveral gender-responsive and trauma-informed programs have been developed and implemented to address women’s risk factors and needs during confinement.359 These prison-based programs often focus on experiences of trauma and PTSD, co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, and the challenges of parenting during incarceration.360 One identified program also explores how trauma and substance use influence women’s use of violence in the community and during confinement.361\nGender-responsive and trauma-informed programs are typically conducted in small or large groups, and program content is designed to help women identify problematic behaviors, whether in themselves or within their relationships, and make changes using strengths-based and empowerment approaches.362 The majority of these programs are grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Theory techniques and enhanced with additional modalities. Most also focus content on what is happening currently rather than asking women to recount previous traumatic events and specifically address the link between PTSD and substance misuse.363\nEvaluations show that completion of gender-responsive and trauma-informed programs is associated with statistically significant pre- to post-intervention decreases in mental health symptoms and in-prison behavioral infractions, as well as increases in self-reported coping and wellness.364 Programs that follow these designs have been associated with significantly lower rates of depression, strong reductions in PTSD symptoms, improved emotional regulation and coping, and decreases in anger.365 For example, among 42 women in a state prison assigned to receive one of two gender-responsive and trauma-informed programs, raw scores on standardized measures of mental health dropped significantly from pre-to-post intervention.366 Specifically, women had a 15-point average decline in PSTD scores (from 43 to 28), dropping the average score below the clinical threshold of 31 to 33 for diagnosis. Participants also had a 9-point average drop in depression symptoms (from 29 to 20), which brought average scores closer to the clinical threshold of 16 for a depression diagnosis. Additionally, in a pilot study of 19 incarcerated women convicted of violent offenses and randomly assigned to receive a gender-responsive and trauma-informed anger reduction program or a gender-neutral program, anxiety scores dropped significantly for women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed group, but not for women in the gender-neutral group.367 Average scores for women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed group fell from 5.3 (mild anxiety disorder) to 2.2 (no anxiety disorder). Women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed group also had significant drops on an anger scale.\nLong-term recidivism analyses also indicate statistically significant decreases in recidivism for those who complete these programs, especially when analyses were limited to studies that used rigorous methods such as randomization to create groups.368 For example, women who participated in a residential gender-responsive and trauma-informed program were significantly less likely to return to prison in the year after release compared to women in a gender-neutral therapeutic community (an intensive prison-based residential substance use disorder treatment program).369 Significantly fewer women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed program group returned to prison compared to women in the gender-neutral program group (31% compared to 45%). Specifically, the odds of returning to prison were 67% lower for women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed group, representing a small to medium effect size (d = 0.28). Women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed program also took longer to return to prison than women in the gender-neutral program–eight months, on average, compared to six months, representing a medium to large effect size (d = 0.61).\nAdditionally, women who were randomly assigned to receive a gender-responsive and trauma-informed anger reduction program had significant reductions in 12-month recidivism compared to women assigned to a gender-neutral program.370 Eleven percent of women in the gender-responsive and trauma-informed group had any arrest and 16% had any jail time in the year post-release, compared to 38% and 50% of women in the gender-neutral group, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that women who participate in gender-responsive and trauma-informed program are more successful in the community after their release.\nDespite such evidence, gender-based and trauma-informed programs are not widely implemented in correctional settings, which means that few high-quality evaluations of such programs have been conducted. The majority of programs are implemented by academic researchers; program evaluations are also limited by the use of small, predominantly White samples, short follow-up periods during which symptoms and behaviors are assessed, and a limited number of studies that explore recidivism or other community stability outcomes after release.371\nThe “gender-responsive” approach has been critiqued as stereotyping women as less capable and culpable for their actions, conceptualizing women’s criminal offending as a consequence of abuse or trauma.372 An additional critique of this approach is that it positions the criminal justice system (arrest and incarceration) as the primary source of women’s access to services and treatment, which, scholars suggest, may fuel women’s incarceration in lieu of alternatives to incarceration.373 An additional criticism of many gender-responsive and trauma-informed programs is that they may not address the unique traumatic experiences and needs of women of color and those who identify as LGBTQ+.374 As most evaluations have been conducted on White samples that lack information about participants’ sexual orientation, cultural adaptation is likely needed to better meet the needs of women of color and LGBTQ+ people in prison.375\nRelease and Reentry\nRelease\nAn analysis conducted in 2014 suggested that about 22% of people in state prisons serve the entirety of their judicial sentence prior to release, although results were not broken down by sex.376 There are several ways people can leave prison prior to the end of their maximum court-ordered sentence. Parole is a common release mechanism available to people incarcerated in state prisons in 34 states. Good time and earned time sentence credits allow people in some states and the federal prison system to advance their release date.377 These credits typically accrue when people engage in educational and therapeutic programming and remain free from disciplinary infractions, but they can be revoked by the prison warden based on behavior (see section on “Disciplinary Infractions”).\nNo national analyses appear to examine the accrual or revocation of sentence credits by sex. A review of Illinois’ women’s prison population found that in 2015, women lost a combined 93 years of good time sentence credits due to disciplinary infractions.378 Additionally, although most women (85%) in state prisons in Illinois were eligible to participate in prison-based programming to receive sentence credits in 2018, fewer than a quarter (24%) participated in programs; that proportion was down from 45% in 2011, reflecting reduced availability and accessibility of programs in women’s facilities.\nOther release mechanisms, including prosecutor-initiated resentencing and Second Look policies, allow for prosecutors to adjust the original imposed sentence on a case-by-case basis. No analyses were identified that examined these policies by sex.\nParole\nAt the end of 2022, the most recent year for which data were available, about 77,000 women were on parole.379 Little is known about women’s experiences with the parole process; the majority of studies conducted in this area examine a single state (which obscures state variation in parole processes), focus on the experiences of men, or do not include the perspectives of women on parole.380\nOne review of nearly 100 transcripts from parole board hearings for women with murder convictions in California found that more than 90% of women had a history of trauma and roughly a quarter explicitly linked their crime to experiences of violent victimization involving an intimate partner.381 Language used by some of the women indicated that a history of assault or strangulation may have resulted in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the months or years preceding their crime.382 Parole board members often based their release decisions on nebulous factors about a woman’s history and character. For example, whether a woman had an “unstable social history,” a concept that was not defined, guided some release decisions. In another example, one commissioner described how one woman’s history of dysfunctional relationships might result in her committing future violence.\nNot all parole board members are provided with specialized education or training about trauma, intimate partner violence, behavioral health, or other common experiences of incarcerated populations. Board members bring their own biases about how the person in front of them should dress, behave, speak, and especially, express remorse.383\nFor example, in a national survey of parole board members conducted in 45 states in 2015, only 44% of releasing authorities used parole guidelines or sequential models to guide release decisions.384 Respondents identified the five most important factors in the decision-making process as input from the prosecutor, judge, and the incarcerated person’s family; testimony from the person up for parole; and a person’s demeanor at the hearing. A synthesis of literature mostly published in the 1980s and 1990s highlighted four additional factors as the primary influences on parole decisions: a person’s behavior during incarceration; their crime severity, sentence length and criminal history; whether the person has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder; and input from the victim.385\nQualitative interviews with women up for parole underscore the importance of testimony and demeanor to release decisions.386 Many women noted that they felt the need to change their appearance for hearings to look how they thought members of the parole board would want them to look, and some—especially Black women—felt the need to speak differently, “code switch,” or adopt “prep girl [White girl] talk” to make themselves seem more worthy of parole.\nReentry\nThe reentry period—typically defined as the six months prior to prison release through the first year post-release—can be a challenging and stressful time for those whose sentences are coming to an end. Typically, people must find housing and employment while reconnecting with their loved ones, meeting the terms of post-release supervision, managing any pending child welfare cases, and paying fines, fees, or restitution. Many people face barriers to accomplishing these goals. They range from physical or mental illness to lack of transportation, difficulty accessing public benefits and navigating government systems, housing instability, and financial insecurity. For some, living in rural areas presents additional challenges, as employment opportunities, social services, and transportation are generally more limited than they are in urban areas.387 The collateral consequences of a criminal record—which can restrict people with criminal convictions from accessing public housing, obtaining federal or state benefits, voting, accessing higher education, qualifying for financial aid, volunteering at a child’s school, or serving as a chaperone—affect all formerly incarcerated people.388 In addition to these common barriers to successful reentry, women experience several specific challenges during this transitional time.389\nParenting\nBecause women are more likely to have been the primary or sole caretaker for their children prior to their incarceration,390 many common reentry challenges are exacerbated by caretaking responsibilities and financial need. Women must often navigate childcare in addition to finding employment, securing housing for themselves and their children, and juggling the demands of any post-release supervision.391 Some mothers must navigate the child welfare system to attempt to regain custody. Others must navigate relationships with those who cared for their children during incarceration—often their own mothers or female relatives. This can create stress for all involved, especially when the relationship between an incarcerated mother and her children’s caretaker(s) was emotionally tumultuous prior to her incarceration.392 For some women, family commitments and reuniting with children may also conflict with the terms of supervision, which typically require women to obtain out-of-home employment, attend mental health or substance use disorder treatment in the community, and avoid contact with people with criminal convictions—even when those people are immediate family.393\nHousing and Homelessness\nWomen who experienced abusive or unstable housing prior to incarceration often struggle to find stable housing in the community upon their release. A lack of reliable housing may lead some women to return to abusive relationships or to unhealthy environments with friends or family members in order to find shelter.394 These women are at high-risk of becoming homeless. While little data exists on rates of homelessness among formerly incarcerated people, the 2008 National Former Prisoner Survey indicated that formerly incarcerated people were ten times more likely to experience homelessness than those who had never been incarcerated.395 The findings show clear racial and gender disparities in who became homeless after prison. The rate of homelessness (both sheltered and unsheltered) among formerly incarcerated women (264 per 10,000 population) was 35% higher than the rate for formerly incarcerated men (195 per 10,000 population). Rates among unsheltered women were not broken down by sex and race, but the rate of sheltered homeless Black women (203 per 10,000 population) was 60% higher than the rate for White women (127 per 10,000 population).396\nFinancial Instability\nFinancial instability, coupled with the need to obtain stable housing for oneself and one’s children, may also result in some women engaging in criminal behavior.397 A nine-year longitudinal study of more than 300 women with felony convictions who were on probation or parole found that recidivism was significantly related to poverty, with higher rates of recidivism associated with changes in financial stability.398 The authors note that new crimes were often directly tied to poverty (e.g., theft, selling drugs, or writing bad checks) and sometimes indirectly related through measures taken to manage financial stress (e.g., drug use or use of violence).\nEmployment\nFormerly incarcerated women often struggle to find employment during reentry due to prohibitive daycare costs and their tendency to have less extensive work histories than formerly incarcerated men. Criminal convictions may also pose barriers to obtaining licenses and certifications in fast-growing and in-demand industries that tend to be female-dominated, such as health care, home support, and personal care.399\nWomen consistently made, on average, $3,200 to $7,200 less per year than men.\nContemporary national data on post-release employment outcomes, however, are lacking, and results from analyses using older data show mixed findings. For example, analyses using data from the 2008 National Former Prisoner Survey found that 38% to 51% of formerly incarcerated women were unemployed, compared to 27% to 41% of formerly incarcerated men.400 In contrast, a four-year longitudinal study of 51,500 people released from federal prison in 2010 (12% female) found that women were more likely to be employed than men at all post-release periods.401 The study showed that nearly half (41% to 46%) of women were employed, compared to just over a third (34-37%) of men. However, despite higher levels of employment, women had lower incomes. Women consistently made, on average, $3,200 to $7,200 less per year than men.402 This suggests that the gender pay gap may contribute to disproportionate economic disadvantage for women with justice system involvement.403\nFood Insecurity\nFormerly incarcerated women are more likely to be the primary caretakers for children and other adults, which means they are more likely to rely on government benefits like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).404 Most people with felony convictions are banned from enrolling in these emergency programs, although recent law changes have extended eligibility to people convicted of some drug offenses.405 Therefore, while restrictions placed on access to food stamps and other emergency services, subsidized housing, education, and school engagement affect both men and women, they disproportionately impact women and their families, often fueling poverty and increasing risk for homelessness, food insecurity, and criminal behavior.\nAnalyses of long-term effects from imposed bans on SNAP and TANF for those with some felony convictions detail long-term negative effects on children, including higher rates of cognitive difficulty and stress, and lower rates of high school completion. For example, an economic analysis of two major national datasets found lower rates of employment among adults who became ineligible for SNAP benefits due to their conviction history.406 This implies that for some, losing access to benefits does not result in workforce participation, but rather results in making their financial situation more precarious. Outcomes for the children of those who lost access to SNAP benefits were similarly concerning. Analyses of American Community Survey data from 2008 to 2019 showed that children who lost benefits had higher rates of cognitive difficulty and stress, which resulted in lower rates of high school completion.407 These effects were amplified for children who were younger when their family lost access to benefits.\nHealth and Healthcare\nMany women enter prison with significant untreated physical and mental health conditions, yet few receive relevant treatment options during or after incarceration.408 The untreated symptoms of chronic illness, infectious disease, traumatic brain injury, and mental health and substance use disorders often present additional challenges for women during reentry.409 While much is known about the impact of health on men’s reentry experiences,410 little is known about how health and healthcare needs affect the reentry experiences of women and their likelihood for success after incarceration.\nIn a comparative study of nearly 12,000 older adults (8% of whom were formerly incarcerated), poorer mental and physical health were noted among those with a history of incarceration, regardless of sex or race and ethnicity.411 These results persisted when childhood abuse and adversity and other early-life factors were controlled for in the models. Specifically, formerly incarcerated women had worse mental and physical health compared to both formerly incarcerated men and people who had never been in prison, regardless of gender. These results were amplified among formerly incarcerated women of color, who reported the highest levels of depression and physical limitations. These women reported more symptoms of depression than formerly incarcerated White women (3.4 symptoms, on average, compared to 2.5), nearly twice as many symptoms of depression compared to never-incarcerated women (1.9 symptoms, on average), and more than twice as many symptoms as never-incarcerated White women (1.3 symptoms, on average). These same patterns were replicated in analyses examining physical limitations.\nDuring interviews, women suggested that incarceration compounded issues related to accessing healthcare in the community, resulting in poor outcomes and limited options during reentry.412 Interviews with formerly incarcerated Black women suggest that during incarceration, medical care was hampered by long wait times and lack of follow-up from providers, misdiagnoses and issues with health claims not being taken seriously, and inaccessible and expensive healthcare options.413 After release, women were unsure where to begin or what type of provider they needed to see. Many lacked trust in the medical system. Given the trend of women’s rising incarceration in prison and jail settings over the past several decades, a growing number of older women in the community are likely to face health challenges linked to their time in prison.\nFormerly incarcerated women were\n5.5x\nmore likely to die by overdose in the two years after their release compared to women who had never been incarcerated.\nFormerly incarcerated men were\n3.3x\nmore likely to die by overdose in the two years after their release than men who had never been incarcerated.\nAs women leave prison and return home during reentry, they are also at significant risk for overdose fatality.414 Research suggests that the first two weeks following release are critical; specifically, incarcerated men and women are estimated to be 12 times more likely to die by overdose immediately after release than their never-incarcerated peers.415 Over time, however, women are at greater risk of overdose fatality compared to women in the community. Formerly incarcerated women were 5.5 times more likely to die by overdose in the two years after their release compared to their never-incarcerated female peers.416 This risk outpaced that observed among men; formerly incarcerated men were 3.3 times more likely to die by overdose in the two years after their release than men who had never been incarcerated.417\nIncarcerated men and women are estimated to be 12x more likely to die by overdose immediately after release than their never-incarcerated peers.\nRecidivism\nWhether recidivism is defined as rearrest, reconviction, or reincarceration, rates are consistently lower for women than for men. For example, in the most recent national analysis examining long-term outcomes of people released from state prisons between 2012 and 2017, 63% of women were rearrested or reincarcerated within five years of release compared to 72% of men.418 Women were less likely to return to prison for violent crimes than men (16% women, 30% men), drug crimes (29% women, 33% men), and public order offenses (45% women, 55% men), and equally as likely to return for property crimes (36%).419\nFactors influencing women’s recidivism are linked to mental health and substance use disorders, low educational attainment, unemployment prior to incarceration, and returning to disadvantaged communities with few resources to support the reentry transition. Research also suggests, however, that race and ethnicity influence post-release success for women. In an analysis of more than 500 women on parole, recidivism was significantly associated with substance use disorders for all women, but the relationship between substance use disorders and recidivism was stronger for women of color.420 White women with substance use disorders were more than twice as likely to recidivate than White women without substance use disorders; women of color with substance use disorders were six times more likely to recidivate. Additionally, substance use disorders were more common among women of color, with 28% of women of color diagnosed as substance dependent compared to 17% of White women. Women of color in the sample were less likely to be diagnosed with a mental health disorder (7%) than White women (13%) and more likely to return to a disadvantaged community. A third (33%) of the women of color in the sample returned to disadvantaged communities, compared to 5% of White women.\nMost research on post-incarceration outcomes focuses on whether people return to prison following release. It is important to note that there are significant markers for successful community reintegration for women other than whether or not they are re-arrested or return to prison. These can include positive health outcomes and well-being, high levels of connection with and support from friends and family, ability to access crucial resources like stable housing and employment, and community involvement.421\nRecidivism by Sex and Offense Type\nConclusion and Next Steps\nAlthough all people experience significant challenges before, during, and after their involvement with the criminal justice system, women encounter distinct barriers that remain unaddressed by a system designed to manage the needs of men. Women who make contact with the criminal justice system are more likely than their male counterparts to have experienced trauma and abuse, have mental health and substance use disorders, be living in poverty, have custody of minor children, and have engaged in crime in the context of their relationships with intimate male partners. Women’s roles as caretakers add special complexity to how they navigate the system, and many of the negative effects of system involvement reverberate for their children, families, and communities.\nWhile in prison or jail, women’s specific healthcare needs—especially needs related to reproductive health—are often neglected, leading to a range of negative physical and mental health outcomes. Women’s access to educational and vocational programs responsive to their needs and experiences is limited, potentially affecting their ability to succeed during reentry. Finally, when women return home from incarceration, their preexisting challenges are exacerbated by stressors associated with family reunification and childcare, difficulty finding safe and affordable housing, barriers to accessing benefits, and economic marginalization.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the numerous collaborators who made this preliminary assessment possible, including lead authors Liza Bayless, Stephanie Kennedy, and Cameryn Farrow of the CCJ staff; Commission members Dr. Emily Salisbury, Brenda V.

Nearly three-quarters (70%) of victims of sexual violence perpetrated by other incarcerated people were White, 17% were Black, 11% were Hispanic, and 3% identified with another race.

{"custom_id": "1_extracted-3637.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world (behind) Saudi Arabia.\n        Subject(s): energy,foreign-policy\n        Speaker: donald-trump\n        Speaker's Job Title: President-Elect\n        State Info: New York\n        Party Affiliation: republican\n        Barely-True: 63\n        False: 114\n        Half-True: 51\n        Mostly-True: 37\n        Pants-Fire: 61\n        Context: an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        | Crude oil and other petroleum liquids | Natural gas | Coal | Nuclear | Hydro | Other renewables | Total | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Primary energy consumption (quads) 2023a | 2.2 | 0.7 | -- | -- | < 0.1 | 2.9 | |\n| Primary energy consumption (percentage) | 74.8% | 24.6% | -- | -- | 0.6% | 100.0% | |\n| Primary energy production (quads) 2023a | 9.4 | 0.4 | -- | -- | < 0.1 | 9.8 | |\n| Primary energy production (percentage) | 96.0% | 4.0% | -- | -- | 0.1% | 100.0% | |\n| Electricity generation (terawatthours)b | 61.1 | 87.4 | -- | -- | 1.4 | 0.4 | 150.3 |\n| Electricity generation (percentage) | 40.7% | 58.2% | -- | -- | 0.9% | 0.3% | 100.0% |\n|\nData source: U.S. Energy Information Administration Note: Independent rounding may cause some shares to not equal 100%.

But as U.S. and Iraqi officials begin to draw the outlines of the country’s post-Saddam oil industry, the treasure has lost some of its luster. Ongoing guerilla attacks, shipping bottlenecks and damage to the underground oil reservoirs themselves have created major headaches for anyone hoping for a piece of a once-hoped-for Iraqi oil boom.\nUnlike its OPEC neighbors, Iraq is in no position to raise oil production at will based on market forces. Before they can begin to think about expanding output, Iraqi officials face a huge repair job on aging facilities that are running on empty. And there are growing concerns that the underground fields themselves have been damaged by years of mismanaged production.\n“They were sucking river water from the Euphrates and just injecting it in the fields,” said Marshall Adkins, an oil analyst with brokerage Raymond James. “That just completely screws up the reservoir when you do that.”\nFrom a pre-war peak of about 3 million barrels a day, Iraq’s crude oil production was badly crippled by post-invasion looting and sabotage to already badly decayed facilities. As of last month, production hit close to 2 million barrels a day, and the White House estimates production will reach 2.5 million barrels per day by April.\nExpanding Iraqi oil production – and exports – can’t come too soon. The proceeds would help accelerate the rebuilding of the country’s haggard economy. And with world supplies at five-year lows, oil-consuming countries could use the added supply.\nBut that won’t happen until the shooting stops. Even as production facilities are slowly being rebuilt, near-daily attacks on pipelines have pinched off the flow of oil out of the country. Shipments from the northern oil fields in Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have been halted since April. All of which has made it difficult to even think about drilling for more oil.\n“If you’re bottlenecked at the pipeline side and the export side what do you need more drilling for?” said Adkins.\nThough pipeline attacks continue, the White House has budgeted more than $500 million for a variety of emergency repair projects – to fix pipelines, power plants, water pumping stations and for new technology to correct badly managed underground oil fields.\nWhile crude production is slowly being restored, Iraq’s refineries are still crippled by intermittent power failures. The problem is so bad that another $400 million in U.S. aid is being set aside to import gasoline and other refined products to keep basic services running.\n“Its sort of a situation where there’s so much to be done it almost would be foolhardy to suggest where to begin,” Greg Haas, an oil analyst at Sanders Morris Harris.\nBut U.S. and Iraqi officials are beginning to lay the groundwork for the long-term development of Iraq’s huge untapped reserves and a complete overhaul of the industry’s 1970s-era technology. Major oil companies are scheduled to meet with Iraqi officials in March to begin discussions on developing new capacity, an undertaking that Iraqi oil minister Ibrahim Bahr al-Ulum has estimated could cost upwards of $50 billion.\nIraq’s vast oil reserves remain a powerful prize for global oil companies; it is sitting on an estimated 112 billion barrels of crude, a pool of oil second in size only to Saudi Arabia’s 264 billion barrels. (By way of comparison, proven U.S. reserves total about 22 billion barrels; the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds about 700 million barrels.)\n“You’re not going into an area with a lot of wildcat exploration and a lot of uncertainty,” said Peter Zipf, editor in chief of Platt's Oilgram News. “If you’re going in, there’s definitely oil there.”\nSome major deals were already in place before the war began in March. In 1997, Russia’s LUKOIL signed contracts to develop Iraq’s West Qurna oil field. The same year, the China National Petroleum Corporation bought a 50 percent stake in the al-Ahdab oil field. (Both were barred from developing those reserves by U.N. sanctions.) And France’s TotalFinaElf negotiated agreements to develop the much larger Majnoon field, but no firm contracts were signed.\nThough the Bush administration has said it will bar France and Russia from bidding on U.S.-funded reconstruction contracts, Iraq’s Governing Council has said it will include them in the bidding even though they did business with Saddam Hussein and opposed the war to overthrow him.\nIt remains to be seen just who will be signing any new contracts. U.S. and Iraqi officials are reportedly leaning toward setting up a single, state-run oil company as opposed to turning over the industry to private investment. Establishment of a state-run company would go a long way to blunting criticism that U.S. invaded Iraq with the ultimate goal of seizing its oil. But the decision will have far reaching effects on global oil markets – at a time when non-OPEC producers like Russia have begun to loosen the cartel’s grip on oil prices.\n“Creation of a large, state-run oil company virtually guarantees (that Iraq) will remain a member of OPEC,” said O’Grady.\nIt could also subject the industry to the kind political infighting that has slowed the formation of an Iraqi government. Iraq’s oil reserves are roughly split between Kurdish-controlled areas in the north and Shiite-controlled southern fields, creating the potential for internal divisions that could slow development of any new oil fields.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        James A. Paul\nGlobal Policy ForumDecember, 2002\nOil is at the heart of the crisis that leads towards a US war against Iraq. For more than a hundred years, major powers have battled to control this enormous source of wealth and strategic power. The major international oil companies, headquartered in the United States and the United Kingdom, are keen to regain control over Iraq's oil, lost with the nationalization in 1972. Few outside the industry understand just how high the stakes in Iraq really are and how much the history of the world oil industry is a history of power, national rivalry and military force.\nWhy Iraq's Oil is so coveted by the big companies\nOil in Iraq is especially attractive to the big international oil companies because of three factors:\n(1)high quality/high value product\nIraq's oil is generally of high quality because it has attractive chemical properties, notably high carbon content, lightness and low sulfur content, that make it especially suitable for refining into the high-value products. For these reasons, Iraqi oil commands a premium on the world market.\n(2)huge supplies\nIraq's oil is very plentiful. The country's proven reserves in 2002 were listed at 112.5 billion barrels, about 11% of the world total. With little exploration since the nationalization of the industry in 1972, many promising areas remain unexplored. Experts believe that Iraq has potential reserves substantially above 200 billion barrels. The Energy Information Administration of the US Department of Energy has estimated that Iraqi reserves could possibly total over 400 billion barrels. If new exploration fulfills such high-end predictions, Iraq's reserves could prove close to those of Saudi Arabia, now listed at 260 billion barrels but likely also to go considerably higher as well. The Department of Energy assessment says that:\n\"Iraq contains 112 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the second largest in the world (behind Saudi Arabia) along with roughly 220 billion barrels of probable and possible resources. Iraq's true potential may be far greater than this, however, as the country is relatively unexplored due to years of war and sanctions. Deep oil-bearing formations located mainly in the vast Western Desert region, for instance, could yield large additional oil resources (possibly another 100 billion barrels), but have not been explored.\" (http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html)\nOn May 22, 2002, Iraqi Senior Deputy Oil Minister gave an interview to Platts, a leading industry information source. Discussing Iraq's estimates of its potential reserves, he told Platts that \"The figure we reached and which is widely known, is that we could discover 214 billion barrels of oil in addition to the present proven reserve [of 112 billion]. We are sure of this figure as all available indications and scientific standards say. This means that we will exceed the 300 billion barrels when all Iraq's regions are explored.\"\nHamud indicated that more reserves were probably to be found. \"We have also said on many occasions that we have indications of oil structures--these are only primary indications--estimated to be more than 560 reservoirs that could be oil fields that need digging, appraisal and which we believe have a high potential oil presence. We believe that when we prove all this, Iraq will be the number one holder of oil reserves in the world. We are highly confident of this.\"\nAccording to Iraq oil expert Mohammad Al-Gallani at British-based GeoDesign Ltd, Iraq has 526 prospective drilling sites, of which only 125 have been drilled. Of those, 90 have proven potential as oil fields, but only 30 have been partially developed and just 12 are on stream. \"You can imagine the huge potential that lies there for the future,\" Al-Gallani told Canadian Press in a story datelined December 14, 2002.\nAs world demand for oil increases and as oil reserves in other areas decline at a fast rate, oil in Iraq will represent a steadily-larger proportion of the world's total. If Iraq's fields meet high-end estimates in the 3-400 billon barrel range, Iraq's reserves could reach over 30% of total global reserves by mid-century or even before.\n(3)exceptionally low production costs, yielding a high per barrel profit\nThe US Department of Energy states that \"Iraq's oil production costs are amongst the lowest in the world, making it a highly attractive oil prospect.\" This is because Iraq's oil comes in enormous fields that can be tapped by relatively shallow wells, producing a high \"flow rate.\" Iraq's oil rises rapidly to the surface, because of high pressure on the oil reservoir from water and from associated natural gas deposits.\nMore than a third of Iraq's current reserves lie just 600 meters (1800 feet) below the earth's surface and some of Iraq's fields are among the world's largest. The fabulous Majnoun Field, not yet in production, is said to hold at least 25 billion barrels. According to Oil and Gas Journal, Western oil companies estimate that they can produce a barrel of Iraqi oil for less than $1.50 and possibly as little as $1, including all exploration, oilfield development and production costs and including a 15% return. This is similar to production costs in Saudi Arabia and lower than virtually any other country.\nBy way of comparison, a barrel of oil costs $5 to produce in other relatively low-cost areas like Malaysia and Oman. Production costs in Mexico and Russia might potentially be as low as $6-8 per barrel (higher under current production arrangements by local companies).\nOffshore production areas like the North Sea, with expensive platforms, can run to $12-16 a barrel. In Texas and other US and Canadian fields, where deep wells and small reservoirs make production especially expensive, costs can run above $20 a barrel. When world market prices dip below $20 a barrel, the North American fields yield no profit at all, and many are capped, while production in an area like Iraq proves extremely profitable in all market conditions.\nOil companies' future profits (and share prices) depend on their control of reserves. In recent years, as older fields have begun to run out, the companies have faced rising \"replacement\" costs. According to a 2002 report by energy consultants John S. Herold, finding costs for new reserves rose 60% in 2001, pushing replacement costs to $5.31 a barrel. ExxonMobil, BP and Shell are facing this difficulty. Imagine the lure of the vast Iraqi fields, with little prospecting required, offering nearly free acquisition. As Fadel Gheit of Fahnstock & Co. in New York commented in an article in Dawn, Iraq \"would be a logical place in the future for oil companies to replace their reserves.\" http://www.dawn.com/2002/12/15/ebr12.htm Another expert called Iraq an \"El Dorado\" for the oil industry.\nEstimating Profits in Iraq\nOil prices fluctuate widely, so any discussion of financial yield must be based on a long term average price estimate. For this discussion, we will use an average prices of $25 a barrel in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. This average is higher than the average price in recent years, but as oil becomes scarcer, the price should rise steadily and might well reach a far high level than $25. (During 2002, by way of reference, the price of oil has fluctuated between $20 and $30).\nWe will assume the level of Iraqi reserves at 250 billion barrels (a very conservative estimate) and recovery rates at 50% (also a very conservative estimate). Under those conditions, recoverable Iraqi oil would be worth altogether about $3.125 trillion. Assuming production costs of $1.50 a barrel (a high-end figure), total costs would be $188 billion, leaving a balance of $2.937 trillion as the difference between costs and sales revenues. Assuming a 50/50 split with the government and further assuming a production period of 50 years, the company profits per year would run to $29 billion. That huge sum is two-thirds of the $44 billion total profits earned by the world's five major oil companies combined in 2001. If higher assumptions are used, annual profits might soar to as much as $50 billion per year.\nThough such numbers are highly speculative, the oil companies themselves engage in similar exercises, as they develop their global strategies and plan for a flow of profits many years into the future. For instance, two Russian companies, Zarubeshneft and Rosneft, told journalists in 2002 that that they were preparing to develop Iraq's Nahr Umr field that they estimated was worth about $570 billion. This estimate appears too high, based on our assumptions, but they suggest the order of magnitude. Reliable estimates for the value of the fabulous Majnoun field go up to $400 billion and beyond.\nIf diminishing supplies drive future prices steadily higher or if Iraq's oil reserves prove to be much larger than 250 billion barrels, the profit yield might be considerably greater. On the other hand, a nationalist government in Baghdad that would demand a higher percentage split would reduce the profit potential, as would the development of major alternative energy sources and taxes on carbon-based fuels in response to global warming. Whatever the exact results, and assuming a U.S.-friendly government, it is clear that Iraq is a goldmine that is literally \"worth fighting for\" in the view of the big companies.\nIraqi Gas Reserves and Pipeline Routes\nThe same multinational companies that rule the oil industry are also in the natural gas business. Gas is increasingly popular because it burns with less particulate and has a lower carbon content per unit of energy output. Large gas reserves have been discovered in fields in northern Iraq and other gas fields may be found elsewhere in the country. Though Iraq's gas may not prove to be as lucrative as its oil, this resource is also coveted by the companies and could be a source of additional multi-billion dollar profits. In December, 1996, Gaz de France and ENI of Italy formed a consortium to build a pipeline from the Iraqi fields to Turkey, a project that could eventually link up with the European gas grid. But because of the UN sanctions against Iraq, this project could not proceed. In post-war Iraq, the big US-UK companies will seek gas production and transport deals along with oil deals, in hopes of snatching these lucrative prospects away from continental European competitors. Other pipeline projects, to bring gas from Qatar and other Gulf states through Iraq to the European market, are also under study and offer huge profits to whichever companies get permission to build them.\nNew Oil Company Strategy Aims to Regain Dominance in Production\nAfter the nationalizations that swept the oil producing countries, beginning with Iraq's nationalization in 1972, the oil multinationals lost much of their role in production, known in the oil business as \"upstream.\" Forced to abandon the cornucopia of profits in the Middle East (and to buy Middle East oil on the world market), they developed alternative production in such areas as the North Sea and the West Coast of Africa where production costs were higher and profits lower. They had to shift much of their profit-making to \"downstream\" activities such as transportation (tankers and pipelines), refining, petrochemicals and retailing. Major national oil companies (such as Kuwait and Venezuela) pursued downstream strategies as well, however, leading to overcapacity and falling rates of return.\nBy the mid-1990s, the companies began to revise their strategy towards a return to upstream, crude-oil production, pressing oil producing governments to offer production-related arrangements that could give the multinationals a direct share in crude reserves. Such ideas proved controversial and contrary to nationalist public sentiment in the producing countries.\nBy the end of the 1990s, however, oil-producing governments were mired in political crises, due to corruption, wars, and civil unrest. In Venezuela, Iraq, Algeria, Iran, and other producer countries, the US government appeared to be involved in destabilization measures, deepening existing social instability and what some scholars call \"the crisis of the rentier state.\" Facing domestic unrest and oil production problems, the nationalized companies confront the need for large new investments to preserve production in older fields and to prospect for new reserves. But corrupt and instable governments want to take all the oil revenue stream, leaving little left over for investments. The multinationals argue that their enormous finances, greater technical competence and lower production costs could benefit producer governments, but behind these technocratic arguments lies the threat of further foreign destabilization and even direct military intervention. Clearly, the companies hope to roll the clock back to the \"good old days\" when they ruled the oil business and gave producer governments only a very small share.\nEffects of US-Dominated Iraq on Other Oil Producer Governments\nA U.S. client government in Baghdad – or a U.S. military occupation government – would doubtless hand out upstream production concessions to US-UK companies that would set an important precedent in the world oil industry, tipping the balance of power in favor of the companies and away from the producer states. In this way, the war against Iraq would have an effect on the oil industry that would go far beyond the borders of Iraq.\nOil analysts believe that a US-controlled Iraqi government would quickly make deals with the companies for privatized production. Such deals, though possibly agreed-to in advance of the war, would be justified by the new government on the basis that only the companies would be able to quickly resume post-war production, in order to resume exports and buy critical food, medicines, and other humanitarian goods. Further, Iraq's huge needs to rebuild its post-war infrastructure would lead towards high production.\nEven before Iraq had reached its full production potential of 8 million barrels or more per day, the companies would gain huge leverage over the international oil system. OPEC would be weakened by the withdrawal of one of its key producers from the OPEC quota system. Indeed, OPEC might face the paradox that a US military government of occupation in Iraq would be an OPEC member! Alternatively, such a government might pull out of the producers' cartel.\nThis would put pressure on all major oil producers like Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to de-nationalize their oil companies and offer US-UK companies new concessions or production-sharing agreements that could lead to far higher company profits in these areas. Iran has already made some deals based on a 50/50 split and Saudi Arabia has returned to production sharing in its emerging gas business. US military presence in the Gulf and US clandestine operations to overthrow nationalist governments such as Chavez in Venzuela would increase the pressure. Privatization, even if incomplete, could yield additional tens of billions of profits to the oil companies and would weaken and even destabilize the major oil-producing states. Oil prices might be lowered temporarily to achieve this purpose, then raised later on when a new company-friendly order had been established.\nCompetition among the Multinational Oil Companies\nFive companies dominate the international oil industry, four of them based in the US and the UK. The largest, US-based Exxon Mobil, was the world's most profitable company in 2001 ($15 billion in profits) and the largest industrial company in terms of revenue. The three other companies in order of size are: BP Amoco (UK), Royal Dutch Shell (UK), and Chevron Texaco (US). France's TotalElfFina ranks in fifth place. Predecessors of these firms controlled nearly all of the Iraq Petroleum Company from the discovery of oil in the late 1920s until nationalization in 1972. The British firms held half of the company, reflecting the dominant colonial position of the UK at that time in the region.\nAfter nationalization, the Iraqis sought to gain greater control of their oil resources. They shunned the UK and US companies, while developing working relationships with French companies and the (Soviet) Russian government.. Just before the Gulf War (1990-91), Japanese companies negotiated for production-sharing contracts in Iraq and were said to have concluded a deal for the Majnoun field, but that deal collapsed due to the US-led war and the subsequent sanctions. During the 1990s, various firms negotiated with the Iraqis in hopes of gaining access to Iraqi oil once the sanctions were lifted. Shell, and possibly other US-UK companies held secret talks that did not succeed. In 1997 TotalFinaElf, China National Oil Company, and Lukoil of Russia signed agreements with the Iraqis for deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Lukoil's deal concerned development of the West Qurna field, while TotalFinaElf obtained rights to Majnoun and China Nations to North Rumailah (the latter is the huge field that lies astride the border with Kuwait). A number of smaller companies, mostly Russian but also from Malaysia and other countries, got contracts at about this time.\nThe US-UK companies, keen to regain their former dominance in Iraq, fear that they would lose their leading role in the world oil industry if these contracts with their competitors come to fruition. France and Russia pose the biggest threat, but serious competitors from China, Germany, Italy and Japan also are players in this sweepstakes. China is especially keen to gain a stake in the region's oil reserves because its rapid economic growth is pushing up its oil consumption. Chinese economists estimate that China may have to import as much as 5.5 million barrels a day from the Gulf by 2020.\nThe US-UK companies strongly favored the sanctions, as a means to hold their competitors at bay (and hold down excess production on the world market), but weakening sanctions in the late 1990s threatened their future prosperity. The companies are nervous but enthusiastic about Washington's war option, for it seems to be the only means left to oust their rivals and establish a dominant presence in the fabulously profitable future of Iraq oil production.\nIt appears that the Washington has used its post-war control over Iraqi oil to win over opposition in the UN Security Council. Discussions over access to future oil production in Iraq have apparently been going on between Washington, London, Moscow, Paris and Beijing and also between the companies directly. Many news stories have suggested that these parleys have taken place and statements by government leaders have underscored the importance of the oil issue.\n\"We will review all these agreements, definitely,\" said Faisal Qaragholi to a Washington Post reporter in September. Quaragholi is a petroleum engineer who directs the London office of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella organization of opposition groups that is backed by the United States. \"Our oil policies should be decided by a government in Iraq elected by the people.\"\nAhmed Chalabi, the INC leader, went even further, saying he favored the creation of a U.S.-led consortium to develop Iraq's oil fields, which have deteriorated under more than a decade of sanctions. \"American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil,\" Chalabi said. Such statements have deepened the fears of the non-US-UK companies and pressured them to go along with the US war plans in order to get a share of the post-war concessions.\nBusiness news agency Reuters, in a story datelined December 15, 2002, put the matter bluntly when it wrote \"Iraq's crude reserves, the world's second largest after Saudi Arabia, are at the center of a tug-of-war between countries hoping to grab a share of Baghdad's oil wealth once United Nations sanctions are lifted.\"\nFree Market Forces vs. Government Intervention and Military Might\nThe specially high rate of profit (or \"rent\" as it is sometimes called by economists who study the oil sector) results from the unusual monopolistic structure of the oil industry and its unusual pricing system. From the earliest days in the 1870s, when John D. Rockeller built the Standard Oil Trust, a relatively small number of major companies have controlled world production and prices. These companies have tried to keep prices and production at a controlled level – to maximize their profits. The industry has always relied on close ties to governments. Governments have helped to maintain favorable market conditions, to promote managed pricing and to help the companies gain new sources of supply in foreign lands.\nIn the early decades, the Standard Oil Trust completely dominated the international oil markets, and US production represented a very large share of the world's total. During World War I, US oil supplied an estimated 80% of the Allies' needs. But by the end of the war, the British had built alternative companies – the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, which together controlled more than half of the world's oil reserves. US companies feared that the British, through exclusionary policies in their empire, were going to dominate the world's oil industry. British government purchase of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now BP) in 1914 confirmed these fears. And British firms' leading role in Venezuela brought the competition right into the backyard of the American companies.\nThroughout the inter-war period and up to the present the US and the UK have dominated the international oil industry, always in rivalry but also in collusion. The companies in these two countries have towered above those of all other nations. Bids by Japan, Germany, Italy, Russia and France to gain a major stake in the industry have largely failed, though a single large French company remains the sole challenger today to Anglo-American domination.\nThe Anglo-American companies have always sought to manage global oil output, though collusive agreements. In 1928, they reached the famous \"Red Line Agreement\" on joint action in the Middle East and the \"Achanarry Agreement\" to divide up (and avoid competition in) international markets. These agreements have maintained the extraordinary \"rent\" of Middle East producers, while supporting continued high-cost production in the United States and Canada. If oil markets functioned \"normally,\" production would increase in the low-cost areas like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq, driving out of business the low-cost producers in North America, but this has not been the case.\nBecause of the enormous value of oil concessions and the high \"rent\" that results from low-cost fields, oil concessions are rarely allocated on a purely \"market\" basis. The companies typically win the most lucrative concessions through their host governments' political and military power.\nImperial Control and Local Opposition: Will the US Iraq Plan Succeed?\nThe long, bitter experience of oil producing countries with the US-UK companies has left behind an anger and militancy in local politics that hinders the companies' efforts to re-organize the \"upstream\" system. Such feelings run deep in Iraqi politics, going back to British seizure of Iraq after World War I and the bloody repression (including the use of poison gas) that crushed the nationalist revolt of 1920. British leaders fulminated against \"Turkish misrule\" in Iraq, but their own rule proved equally odious to Iraqis seeking independence and democracy.\nIraqis also remember the way the companies treated the country after it gained its independence and how the companies held Iraqi production down, to manage international supply and price levels. Iraqi's also remember the fierce company resistance to Iraqi proposals for new exploration contracts in the 1960s. Such sentiments would doubtless not change after the ouster of Saddam Hussein.\nThese feelings are magnified by US support for Israel and by the long, punishing US-UK-UN sanctions. The US-UK would thus find it very politically difficult to create an indigenous post-Saddam government that would agree to a sweetheart deal for the US-UK companies. For this reason, the US-UK have announced that they are planning a military government that will \"purge\" Iraqi politics of its Baathist and nationalist elements and remain in power more than a year or as long as necessary. Though the US-UK official announcements speak about \"human rights\" and \"democracy,\" it would appear that the main goal of the war and \"regime change\" is to carry out the oil deals and re-fashion Iraqi politics on a new and more conciliatory and pro-US basis. Scenarios circulating in Washington talk about rapid military seizure of the oil fields, rebuilding oil infrastructure and protecting the oil production system from the negative effects of local politics.\nOil Companies in Iraq: A Century of Rivalry and War (November 2003)\nIraq: the Struggle for Oil (August, 2002)\nThe Iraq Oil Bonanza: Estimating Future Profits (January 28, 2004)\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

The requirement is codified at 16 C.F.R. part 1250, and 16 C.F.R. § 1250.2 identifies the latest Commission-accepted version of ASTM F963 that is mandatory. See the “Previous Versions of the Standard” section below for effective dates.\nPer 16 C.F.R. § 1250.2(b), sections of ASTM F963 that restate or incorporate an existing mandatory standard, ban, statute, or regulation already enforced by the CPSC (such as section 4.2 – Flammability) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (such as section 4.3.4 – Cosmetics) are not part of the mandatory requirement for children’s toys under 16 C.F.R. part 1250.\nA “toy” is defined as any object designed, manufactured, or marketed as a plaything for children under 14 years of age but does not include:\n- Bicycles\n- Tricycles\n- Non-powered scooters as defined in ASTM F2264\n- Recreational powered scooters and pocket bikes as defined in ASTM F2641\n- Sling shots and sharp-pointed darts\n- Playground equipment\n- Non-powder guns\n- Kites\n- Hobby and craft items in which the finished item if not primarily of play value\n- Model kits in which the finished item is not primarily of play value\n- Crayons, paints, chalks, and other similar art materials in which the material itself or the finished item is not primarily of play value\n- Sporting goods, camping goods, athletic equipment, musical instruments, juvenile products, and furniture (except toy counterparts of such products)\n- Powered models of aircraft, rockets, boats, and land vehicles (except toy counterparts of such products)\n- Constant air inflatables\nWhile ASTM F963 includes products intended for children under 14 years of age within its scope, the testing and certification requirements from the CPSC only apply to products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger. This means that any toys intended for a 13+ year old audience might be subject to the requirements found in ASTM F963, but those products would not need to be third party tested at CPSC-accepted laboratory, nor would the manufacturers and importers of those toys need to certify compliance in a Children’s Product Certificate (CPC).\nRead-only copies of ASTM standards that are incorporated by reference can be viewed at ASTM’s electronic Reading Room. Other ASTM standards that are referenced in ASTM F963 may need to be purchased from ASTM.\nGuidance on Individual Sections\nASTM F963 is intended to cover a wide variety of safety requirements for all sorts of toys. As a result, not all sections of ASTM F963 are applicable to all products. Firms must identify which sections are applicable for their specific product. To assist with this identification, check out this guidance page that breaks down the different sections of ASTM F963 into generally-applicable and toy-specific requirements. The following also provides some brief information about the individual sections.\nDISCLAIMER: The following information is summarized and may not capture nuances of certain requirements, nor should it be relied upon exclusively for the purposes of compliance. Responsible firms are highly recommended to review the actual text of ASTM F963 for more detailed information. Additionally, a read-only copy of ASTM F963 is available at ASTM’s electronic Reading Room.\n4.1 – Material Quality\nThis requirement is to ensure that the product is clean and free from infestation. Since it is a visual assessment that can be conducted by the naked eye, it is NOT subject to third-party testing.\n4.2 – Flammability\nThis section is not mandatory per 16 C.F.R. § 1250.2(b), nor does this section require third party testing or certification in a CPC. Note that under 16 C.F.R. § 1500.3(b)(15)(i)(A) children’s toys that contain a flammable solid are banned hazardous substances.\n4.3 – Toxicology\nThere are several requirements here, some of which are under CPSC's jurisdiction and others that fall under the purview of other government agencies. The following provisions are enforced by CPSC:\n- 4.3.1 – Hazardous Substances\nA mandatory requirement which prohibits the presence of hazardous substances in children’s products already exists at 16 C.F.R. § 1500.3(b)(15)(i)(A), with some exemptions as listed at 16 C.F.R. §§ 1500.85 and 1500.86. See our hazardous substances business guidance page for more information. - 4.3.5.1 – Paint and Similar Surface-coating Materials\nA mandatory requirement which prohibits excessive levels of lead in paints and similar surface coatings in children’s products already exists at 16 C.F.R. part 1303. Certificates for toys bearing paint and similar surface coatings must include “16 C.F.R. part 1303” in addition to this section. See our lead in paint business guidance page for more information. The other heavy metals (antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and selenium) have individual limits for solubility. - 4.3.5.2 – Toy Substrate Materials\nA mandatory requirement which prohibits excessive levels of lead in accessible substrates of children’s products already exists at 15 U.S.C. § 1278a. Certificates must include “15 U.S.C. § 1278a” in addition to this section. See our total lead content business guidance page for more information. The other heavy metals (antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and selenium) have individual limits for solubility; metallic components which are small parts have a lower cadmium limit. Materials that are subject to a total lead content exemption (16 C.F.R. § 1500.88) or testing determination (16 C.F.R. parts 1251, 1252, 1253, or 1500.91) are excluded from this requirement. Please note that toys that cannot be sucked, mouthed, or ingested are generally considered outside the scope of these requirements. Please see Note 5 and Note 6 in the standard for further discussion. - 4.3.6 – Cosmetics, Liquids, Pastes, Putties, Gels, Powders, and Items of Avian Feather Origin\nAll of the listed materials must comply with certain bacteriological requirements.\n4.4 – Electrical/Thermal Energy\nA mandatory requirement already exists for electrically operated toys at 16 C.F.R. part 1505. Certificates for electrically operated toys must list “16 C.F.R. part 1505” instead of this section.\n4.5 – Sound-producing Toys\nThese requirements are intended to minimize the possibility of hearing damage that might be caused by toys that are designed to produce sound. Manufacturers and importers of sound-producing toys should review this section of ASTM F963 carefully to ensure that their products are safe and compliant with the various sound and volume measuring requirements. Please note there are also several products that are excepted from these requirements. Please review section 4.5 directly for a full list.\n4.6 – Small Objects\nA mandatory requirement which bans small parts in certain children’s products already exists at 16 C.F.R. part 1501. Certificates for such products must list \"16 C.F.R. part 1501” either instead of or in addition to this section depending on other applicable requirements under this section. For example, mouth-actuated toys for children under 3 must not release any loose components when subjected to the appropriate test under this section, and they must also not release a small part per 16 C.F.R. part 1501; certificates for such products would list both this section and 16 C.F.R. part 1501.\nThe section also mentions labeling requirements, but a mandatory requirement for labeling of toys with small parts already exists at 16 C.F.R. § 1500.19(b)(1); certificates do not need to include a citation for this labeling requirement.\n4.7 – Accessible Edges\nToys for children under the age of 8 must not have hazardous edges, as defined in 16 C.F.R. § 1500.49, before and after use-and-abuse testing. Accessible edges (includes threading on bolts/rods) must be free of burrs and feathering.\nToys with functional hazardous edges may be allowed if they are appropriately labeled as detailed in section 5.8.\n4.8 – Projections\nToys for children under the age of 8 must not pose a puncture hazard before and after use-and-abuse testing.\n4.9 – Accessible Points\nToys for children under the age of 8 must not have hazardous points, as defined in 16 C.F.R. § 1500.48, before and after use-and-abuse testing.\nToys with functional hazardous points may be allowed if they are appropriately labeled as detailed in section 5.8.\n4.10 – Wires and Rods\nAll wires and rods, regardless of material, must have finished ends to avoid hazardous points/burrs. This can also be achieved by turning the ends back or covering the ends.\nMetal wires may not facture and produce a hazardous point/edge when subjected to the applicable test.\n4.11 – Nails and Fasteners\nNails and fasteners points must not present a projection hazard, nor can they protrude so as to be accessible to a child during play. See section 4.17 for additional requirements related to axels.\n4.12 – Plastic Film\nCertain plastic film (includes packaging) must have an average thickness greater than 0.00150 in. (0.03175 mm) or be perforated such that 1% of the surface is removed.\n4.13 – Folding Mechanisms and Hinges\nThese requirements are intended to eliminate possible crushing, laceration, or pinching hazards that might occur in folding mechanisms and hinges. Such mechanisms must meet applicable performance requirements as detailed in this section.\n4.14 – Cords, Straps, and Elastics\nAccessible cords, straps, and elastics found in toys intended for children under 18 months of age in some circumstances and intended for children under 36 months of age in other instances, must meet certain length and/or performance requirements. Examples of such products range from pull toys to kites.\n4.15 – Stability and Over-load Requirements\nRide-on toys, regardless of whether they are intended to stand on their own or are assisted by the rider, must meet certain stability requirements. Such toys also must not collapse when subjected to the overload test.\nCertain “ride-on toys” may meet the statutory definition of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Such products would be subject to 16 C.F.R. part 1420 instead of ASTM F963. For more information on ATV requirements, as well as CPSC guidance for categorizing youth ATVs, visit our ATV business guidance page.\n4.16 – Confined Spaces\nToys with doors/lids or create other enclosed spaces that can surround the head must allow for adequate ventilation, and the closure may not have automatic locking devices.\n4.17 – Wheels, Tires and Axles\nToys with wheels, tires, and axels must not pose a laceration, puncture, or ingestion hazard before and after use-and-abuse testing.\n4.18 – Holes, Clearance, and Accessibility of Mechanisms\nToys with holes, clearances, and accessibility to moving parts must not pose a laceration hazard before and after use-and-abuse testing. There are specific performance requirements for certain situations, such as chains/belts in power transmissions requiring them to be shielded.\n4.19 – Simulated Protective Devices\nToy versions of simulated protective devices (such as toy goggles or helmets) must meet certain performance requirements and not pose a hazard before and after use-and-abuse testing. Such toys must also be labeled to clearly indicate they are not safety protective devices.\n4.20 – Pacifiers\nA mandatory requirement for pacifiers already exists at 16 C.F.R. part 1511. Toy pacifiers also must not have excessive levels of nitrosamine as specified in ASTM F1313 (available for purchase at IHS Standards Store). Certificates for toy pacifiers must include “16 C.F.R. part 1511” as well as this section.\n4.21 – Projectile toys\nCertain toys that can fire projectiles must meet certain performance requirements, such as ensuring the projectiles are not small parts or that they cannot exert excessive force when impacting a surface. Projectile toys that used stored energy to release the projectile must also prevent the use of improvised projectiles.\n4.22 – Teethers and Teething Toys\nCertain teethers and teething toys must comply with 16 C.F.R. part 1510. Such toys with domed ends must meet additional performance requirements.\n4.23 – Rattles\nA mandatory requirement for rattles already exists at 16 C.F.R. part 1510. Toy rattles with domed ends must meet additional performance requirements. Certificates for toy rattles must include “16 C.F.R. part 1510” as well as this section.\n4.24 – Squeeze Toys\nCertain squeeze toys intended for children under the age of 18 months must meet the dimensional requirements referenced in 16 C.F.R. part 1510. Squeeze toys with domed ends must meet additional performance requirements.\n4.25 – Battery-operated Toys\nToys that are operated by any kind of battery must meet certain requirements depending on the specifics of the actual battery itself. Requirements include preventing children from accessing the battery during play time, labeling, and ensuring the battery does not overheat. There are also requirements for chargers that may be supplied with such toys.\n4.26 – Toys intended to be Attached to a Crib or Playpen\nSuch toys must not pose a hazard before and after use-and-abuse testing. There are also labeling requirements for crib mobiles and crib gyms.\n4.27 – Stuffed and Beanbag-type Toys\nSeams for such toys must not rip during testing. This test is required in addition to other applicable use and abuse testing required in this standard for stuffed and beanbag-type toys.\n4.28 – Stroller and Carriage Toys\nToys for strollers and carriages must meet labeling requirements.\n4.29 – Art Materials\nA mandatory requirement for art materials already exists at 16 C.F.R. § 1500.14(b)(8), also known as the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA). The requirements of LHAMA are not a testing and certification requirement; therefore, there is no citation to include on a certificate. See our art materials business guidance page for more information.\n4.30 – Toy Gun Marking\nToy, look-alike, and imitation firearms, as defined in this section, must be permanently marked or manufactured with certain bright colorations to minimize the potential for a toy gun to be mistaken for a real firearm. The toy gun markings mandated by this section must be permanent and must remain in place after undergoing use and abuse testing.\nThe section 4.30 requirements are similar to those found in 16 C.F.R. part 1272, except that the toy standard requires toy guns to undergo use and abuse testing, whereas 16 C.F.R. part 1272 does not. See our toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms business guidance page if you are making or importing an imitation firearm that is not considered a children’s toy.\n4.31 – Balloons\nA mandatory labeling requirement for latex balloons already exists at 16 C.F.R. § 1500.19(b)(2). Neither the C.F.R. reference nor this section need to be included on a certificate.\n4.32 – Certain Toys with nearly Spherical Ends\nThese performance requirements are intended to address a potential impaction hazard associated toys containing nearly spherical ends, such as large fasteners/screws with a domed head or mallets with spherical ends that come with toy percussion instructions.\n4.33 – Marbles\nA mandatory labeling requirement for marbles already exists at 16 C.F.R. § 1500.19(b)(4). Neither the C.F.R. reference nor this section need to be included on a certificate.\n4.34 – Balls\nA mandatory labeling requirement for small balls already exists at 16 C.F.R. § 1500.19(b)(3). Neither the C.F.R. reference nor this section need to be included on a certificate.\n4.35 – Pompoms\nAny pompoms that detach from toys during abuse testing must not fit through a 1.75-in diameter hole under its own weight.\n4.36 – Hemispheric-shaped Objects\nCertain toys shaped like cups, bowls, etc. must have openings that meet specified requirements to prevent the toy from posing a suffocation hazard.\n4.37 – Yo Yo Elastic Tether Toys\nCertain toys with elastic cords and that have an end mass greater than 0.02kg (0.044 lb) must have a tether length less than 50 cm (20 in.) when tested.\n4.38 – Magnets\nLoose magnets and magnetic components that come as-received or are liberated as a result of use-and-abuse testing and that fit within the small part cylinder at 16 C.F.R. part 1501 must have a flux index less than 50.\nEducational toys intended for children aged 8 and older may contain such magnets if they are appropriately labeled.\nThe CPSC also regulates certain other magnetic products not covered by section 4.38 of ASTM F963 in 16 C.F.R. part 1262. See our magnet business guidance page for more information on those products.\n4.39 – Jaw Entrapment in Handles and Steering Wheels\nToys with handles and steering wheels with openings that allow a 0.75 in. by 0.75 in. by 1 in. block must also allow a 1.5 in. by 2.5 in. by 1 in. block. Both blocks must be oriented such that the 0.75 in. by 0.75 in. plane and 2.5 in. by 1.5 in. plane is parallel with the opening.\n4.40 – Expanding Materials\nExpanding materials in toys (such as those that absorb water and get bigger) and that fit within the small part cylinder at 16 C.F.R. part 1501 must completely pass through a 2 mm (0.08 in.) hole when 20 N (4.5 lbf) of force is applied.\n4.41 – Toy Chests\nToy chests must meet certain performance requirements to prevent pinching, crushing, laceration, and suffocation hazards.\n5 – Labeling Requirements\nCertain toys have specific labeling requirements that need to be met. These toys are:\n- Toys containing hazardous substances (some children’s products are exempt from being a banned hazardous substance per 16 C.F.R. § 1500.86)\n- Aquatic toys\n- Crib and playpen toys\n- Mobiles\n- Stroller and carriage toys\n- Toys intended to be assembled by an adult\n- Simulated protective devices (e.g., toy helmets or toy safety goggles)\n- Toys with functional sharp edges or points\n- Battery-operated toys\n- Magnets\nThere are additional labeling requirements, such as age grading and statements on promotional materials. Note that labeling requirements do not require compliance assessment by a CPSC-accepted, third-party laboratory.\n6 – Instructional Literature\nCertain toys must have instructions that bear specified language. These include crib and playpen toys, mobiles, toys that are assembled by either the child or an adult, battery-operated toys, certain ride-on toys, food-contact toys, and toy chests.\n7 – Producer’s Markings\nSection 7.1 requires that either the product or the packaging of a toy must be marked with the name and address of the producer or distributor of the product. In this section “address” can also include a digital address such as a website address. Sections 7.2. and 7.3 have marking requirements for certain ride-on toys and toy chests respectively.\nIn addition to the above, children’s products must also comply with the CPSC tracking label requirement (referenced in section 5.1.2 of ASTM F963) found at 15 U.S.C. § 2063(a)(5). The tracking label requirement differs from the requirements in this section in that the permanent markings must be on the product AND its packaging. For more information, visit our tracking label business guidance page.\n8 – Test Methods\nThis section outlines the test methods used to determine compliance with the applicable performance requirements primarily found in section 4. Subsections here typically do not contain the actual requirement. Firms should list the individual subsections under section 4 instead of any subsection under section 8 for the purposes of certification.\nCertification\nSection 14(a)(2) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) requires manufacturers and importers of children’s products subject to a regulation, standard, or ban enforced by the CPSC to certify that those products meet the requirements of the standard by issuing a CPC. For children’s toys, the citation to use in section 2 of the CPC is “16 C.F.R. part 1250 – Children’s toys” followed by a list of the applicable ASTM F963 sections. Check out this guidance page for help on determining which sections need certification. For more information on creating a CPC, visit our CPC business guidance page.\nPrevious Versions of the Standard\nSince 16 C.F.R. part 1250 is a consumer product safety standard under the CPSA, the effective date of any successor standard is tied to the date of manufacture (regardless of whether the product was manufactured outside of the US). See 15 U.S.C. § 2058(g)(1). This means that children’s toys certified to an older version of ASTM F963 may still be compliant depending on its date of manufacture:\n| Manufactured after... | Must meet... |\n|---|---|\n| April 20, 2024 | ASTM F963-23 |\n| February 28, 2018 | ASTM F963-17 |\n| April 30, 2017 | ASTM F963-16 |\n| June 12, 2012 | ASTM F963-11 |\n| August 16, 2009 | ASTM F963-08 |\n| February 10, 2009 | ASTM F963-07 |\nAdditional Information\n- Children's toy FAQs\n- How to use CPSC’s Regulatory Robot for children’s toy (toy train example): Toy Train Video (youtube.com)\n- ASTM F963 Chart\n- Injury Statistics and Technical Reports | Toys & Children Products\nContact\nFor more information, please contact the Small Business Ombudsman (SBO) team:\n- SBO contact form\n- Toll-free: (888) 531-9070\n- Email: SBO@cpsc.gov\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Administration and Finance\nCommissioner's Office\nDistrict Support\nEducational Options\nInstructional Support\nKaleidoscope Collective\nLegal\nPlanning and Research\nStrategic Initiatives\nStudent Assessment\nWhat is the MCAS? The Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) is a set of statewide standardized tests. Students in grades 3–8 and 10 take MCAS tests in English language arts and mathematics; students in grades 5, 8, and one high school grade (usually grade 9 or 10) take a science MCAS test. Students in grade 8 take a civics MCAS test.\nWhy does Massachusetts give MCAS tests? Statewide testing gives families an objective measure of their child's and school's progress and is one way for taxpayers to see the results of their investment in schools. State test scores are just one piece of a student's academic picture, but they provide important information. In addition, federal and state laws require statewide testing.\nDoes MCAS determine whether students progress to the next grade level? No.\nWho creates the MCAS questions? Test contractors, DESE staff, and more than 250 educators annually all help create and review test questions.\nDESE has Assessment Development Committees (ADCs) and a Bias and Sensitivity Committee (BSC) composed of classroom teachers and administrators, academic support specialists, and university faculty who edit and revise the questions. Committee members represent schools and districts from across the state, including rural, suburban, and urban communities. In addition, members are selected to represent different types of school districts, including charter schools and vocational schools.\nCan I see test questions? Yes, DESE makes many previous test questions available online.\nHow are the MCAS tests scored? MCAS assessments are based on the state's learning standards. Students score in one of four categories: Exceeding Expectations, Meeting Expectations, Partially Meeting Expectations, and Not Meeting Expectations. Educators from each grade level helped determine the scoring range for each category. A student's score indicates the extent to which they are meeting expectations for their grade level. MCAS tests are not graded on a curve.\nIs MCAS a multiple-choice test? MCAS tests are given on a computer and have a variety of question formats, including multiple choice, short answers, and essays.\nAre MCAS tests timed? No. Students have as much time as they need within a regular school day.\nAre there accommodations for students with disabilities? Yes, a variety of accessibility features and accommodations are available as needed for all students and for students with disabilities. These can include a text-to-speech reader, paper-based tests, a different testing environment, or other options.\nWhat about multilingual learners who are still learning English? Accommodations such as bilingual word-to-word dictionaries and glossaries are available for multilingual learners as needed.\nThe math, science, and civics MCAS tests are available in Spanish.\nEnglish learners must participate in all MCAS testing scheduled for their grade, with the exception of English learners who are in their first year of enrollment in U.S. schools. For those students, ELA testing is optional. (Note: MCAS results for first-year English learners are not included in the accountability calculations for their school or district.)\nMCAS results for all schools and districts in the state are publicly available using the following resources:\nSchool and District Profiles — Search school and district results by year, including achievement levels, average scaled scores, and average Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs).\nMCAS Data Trends — Use interactive charts to view trends in achievement over time and compare results among student groups, grades, subjects, and schools.\nMCAS Achievement Results dataset — (Most appropriate for data analysts and researchers) Access results of tests administered since 2017 in a single multi-year dataset ready for export and analysis.\nStudents' individual MCAS results are not published publicly. They are reported to students' schools, and reports are sent by districts to families and caregivers.\nLast Updated: August 4, 2025\nStudent Assessment Updates\nOffice of Student Assessment Services\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Thats more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year.\n        Subject(s): taxes\n        Speaker: jeanne-shaheen\n        Speaker's Job Title: Senator\n        State Info: New Hampshire\n        Party Affiliation: democrat\n        Barely-True: 3\n        False: 0\n        Half-True: 4\n        Mostly-True: 2\n        Pants-Fire: 0\n        Context: an interview with the editorial board of 'The Telegraph.'\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Debt in the United States is already the size of our entire economy and is projected to grow much higher. Fortunately, there are many ways to stabilize our fiscal outlook. Recently, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released 76 policy options — spanning both revenues and spending — that could help bring the country’s rising debt under control. Below are some of the policy options that would have the largest effects.\nOptions for Raising Federal Revenues\nCBO presents 32 options that would affect revenues. Some provisions are likely to be part of the debate in 2025 as legislators revisit expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; others would modify unrelated provisions or create new types of taxes.\nEliminate or Limit Itemized Deductions: The largest option to reduce the deficit would be to eliminate all itemized deductions, which benefit taxpayers when the value of their deductions exceeds the amount of the standard deduction. That would reduce deficits by $3.4 trillion over the 10-year period from 2025 to 2034. Subsets of such reform include eliminating just the state and local tax deduction or limiting the tax benefit of itemized deductions to a certain percentage of their value.\nImpose a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax: A value-added tax (VAT) is a consumption tax imposed on the incremental increase in the value of a good or service that occurs at each stage of a supply chain until the item is sold. Applying a 5 percent VAT would decrease the deficit by between $2.2 trillion and $3.4 trillion over 10 years, depending on the size of the base to which it is applied.\nImpose a New Payroll Tax: The current payroll tax is levied on the earnings of people who work for an employer and on the net earnings of people who are self-employed and used to support programs such as Social Security and Medicare. CBO estimated the amount that could be raised by a new payroll tax that would be part of general revenues of either 1 percent ($1.3 trillion raised over the 2025-2034 period) or 2 percent ($2.5 trillion raised).\nImpose a Surtax on Individuals' Adjusted Gross Income: Most individual income is taxed on an amount that is reduced by certain deductions or exemptions. CBO estimated an option that would impose a surtax on a broader measure of income (adjusted gross income). Depending on the parameters of such a surtax (as defined in CBO’s option), it could garner between $1.1 trillion and $1.4 trillion in revenues over the 10-year period.\nOptions for Decreasing Mandatory Spending\nCBO also presents 27 options that affect mandatory spending, which includes programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. As those three programs are the largest categories of mandatory spending in the U.S. budget, reforming them has the potential to create the most savings.\nModify Payments to Medicare Advantage Plans for Health Risk: Medicare Advantage plans cover more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries. CBO offers three options to save money in Medicare Advantage by reducing payments to the program across-the-board or by making changes to its risk-adjustment policy. Savings from those policy measures range from $124 billion to $1 trillion over 10 years.\nEstablish Caps on Federal Spending for Medicaid: Currently, the federal government provides the majority of Medicaid’s funding and that funding has no ceiling — larger federal payments are generated automatically if enrollment or cost per enrollee increases. CBO estimates that if caps were established for total funding provided for each state, the government could save $459 billion over the projection period; establishing caps for the cost per enrollee, as specified by CBO, could generate savings of $893 billion over 10 years.\nEstablish a Uniform Social Security Benefit: Social Security benefits are calculated based on an individual’s average lifetime earnings, so individuals with higher earnings receive more retirement benefits than beneficiaries with lower earnings. CBO estimates that providing every beneficiary the same amount — either 150 percent or 125 percent of the federal poverty level — could save $283 billion or $607 billion, respectively, over the 10-year period.\nOptions for Decreasing Discretionary Spending\nCBO provides 17 options that would affect discretionary spending. As nearly half of all discretionary spending is for defense, the option reforming that budget category has the greatest potential for deficit reduction.\nReduce the Department of Defense's Annual Budget: According to CBO, addressing the Department of Defense’s annual budget could save $959 billion over the next 10 years. Reducing the number of active-component military personnel, reducing ground combat and air combat units, or relying on allies to provide their own defenses rather than using a U.S. combat force are possible methods of achieving the reform.\nAlthough the United States carries significant debt due to a structural mismatch between spending and revenues, the new Administration and Congress have many possible options to address that gap.\nImage by: Tom Brenner/Getty Images\nFurther Reading\nQuarterly Treasury Refunding Statement: Borrowing Up Year Over Year\nKey highlights from the most recent Quarterly Refunding include an increase in anticipated borrowing of $158 billion compared to the same period in the previous year.\nExperts Identify Lessons from History for America Today\nA distinguished group of experts to evaluate America’s current fiscal landscape with an historical perspective.\nShould We Eliminate the Social Security Tax Cap?\nThere have been a number of proposals to increase, eliminate, or otherwise adjust the payroll tax cap as a way to shore up Social Security’s finances.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Request unsuccessful.

Bush and extended during the presidency of Barack Obama, through:\n- Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA)\n- Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA)\n- Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010\n- American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (partial extension)\nWhile each act has its own legislative history and effect on the tax code, the JGTRRA amplified and accelerated aspects of the EGTRRA. Since 2003, the two acts have often been spoken of together, especially in terms of analyzing their effect on the U.S. economy and population and in discussing their political ramifications. Both laws were passed using controversial congressional reconciliation procedures.[1]\nThe Bush tax cuts had sunset provisions that made them expire at the end of 2010, since otherwise they would fall under the Byrd Rule. Whether to renew the lowered rates, and how, became the subject of extended political debate, which was resolved during the presidency of Barack Obama by a two-year extension that was part of a larger tax and economic package, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. In 2012, during the fiscal cliff, Obama overcame the sunset provisions and made the tax cuts permanent for single people earning less than $400,000 per year and couples making less than $450,000 per year, but did not stop the sunset provisions from applying to higher incomes, under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\nBefore the tax cuts, the highest marginal income tax rate was 39.6 percent. After the cuts, the highest rate was 35 percent. Once the cuts sunset for high income levels (single people making $400,000+ per year and couples making $450,000+ per year), the top income tax rate returned to 39.6 percent.\nImplications for the Alternative Minimum Tax\n[edit]The 2001 act and the 2003 act significantly lowered the marginal tax rates for nearly all U.S. taxpayers. One byproduct of this tax rate reduction was that it brought to prominence a previously lesser known provision of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT was originally designed as a way of making sure that wealthy taxpayers could not take advantage of \"too many\" tax incentives and reduce their tax obligation by too much. It is a parallel system of calculating a taxpayer's tax liability that eliminates many deductions. However the applicable AMT rates were not adjusted to match the lowered rates of the 2001 and 2003 acts, causing many more people to face higher taxes. This reduced the benefit of the two acts for many upper-middle income earners, particularly those with deductions for state and local income taxes, dependents, and property taxes.\nThe AMT exemption level aspects of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, as well as the sunsetting year of capital gains and dividends, were among the tweaks made to the tax code in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005.\nCBO Scoring\n[edit]The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that the Bush tax cuts did not pay for themselves and represented a sizable decline in revenue for the Treasury:\n- The CBO estimated in June 2012 that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 (EGTRRA) and 2003 (JGTRRA) added approximately $1.5 trillion total to the debt over the 2002–2011 decade, excluding interest.[2]\n- The CBO estimated in January 2009 that the Bush tax cuts would add approximately $3.0 trillion to the debt over the 2010–2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels, including interest.[3]\n- The CBO estimated in January 2009 that extending the Bush tax cuts at all income levels over the 2011–2019 period would increase the annual deficit by an average of 1.7% GDP, reaching 2.0% GDP in 2018 and 2019.[3]\nDebate over effect of cuts\n[edit]There was and is considerable controversy over who benefited from the tax cuts and whether or not they have been effective in spurring sufficient growth. Supporters of the proposal and proponents of lower taxes say that the tax cuts increased the pace of economic recovery and job creation. Further, proponents of the cuts asserted that lowering taxes on all citizens, including the rich, would benefit all and would actually increase receipts from the wealthiest Americans as their tax rates would decline without resort to tax shelters. Opponents argued the tax cuts on the wealthy were simply of the trickle down variety.[4] The Wall Street Journal editorial page states that taxes paid by millionaire households more than doubled from $136 billion in 2003 to $274 billion in 2006 because of the JGTRRA.[5]\nA report published by staff at conservative public policy think tank The Heritage Foundation claimed that the 2001 cuts alone would result in the complete elimination of the U.S. national debt by fiscal year 2010.[6]\nThe Heritage Foundation concluded in 2007 that the Bush tax cuts led to the rich shouldering more of the income tax burden and the poor shouldering less;[7] while the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) has concluded that the tax cuts have conferred the \"largest benefits, by far on the highest income households.\" CBPP cites data from the Tax Policy Center, stating that 24.2% of tax savings went to households in the top one percent of income compared to the share of 8.9% that went to the middle 20 percent.[8] The underlying policy has been criticized by Democratic Party congressional opponents for giving tax cuts to the rich with capital gains tax breaks.[9]\nStatements by President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist that these tax cuts effectively \"paid for themselves\" have been disputed by the CBPP,[10] the U.S. Treasury Department and the CBO.[11][12][13][14] Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2007: \"Supply side doctrine, which claimed without evidence that tax cuts would pay for themselves, never got any traction in the world of professional economic research, even among conservatives.\"[15] Since 2001, federal income tax revenues have remained below the 30-year average of 8.4% of GDP with the exception of 2007, and did not regain their year 2000 dollar peak until 2006, though reasons for regaining previous levels are not given (see chart at right).[16]\nSome policy analysts and non-profit groups such as OMBWatch,[17] Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,[18] and the Tax Policy Center[19] have attributed much of the rise in income inequality to the Bush administration's tax policy. In February 2007, President Bush addressed the rise of inequality for the first time, saying \"The reason is clear: We have an economy that increasingly rewards education and skills because of that education.\"[20]\nCritics state that the tax cuts, including those given to middle and lower income households, failed to spur growth. Critics have further stated that the cuts also increased the budget deficit, shifted the tax burden from the rich to the middle and working classes, and further increased already high levels of income inequality.[21][22][23][24][25] Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, \"[shifting] the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the wage-earning households of the lower and middle classes.\"[26] Supporters argued that the tax brackets were still more progressive than the brackets from 1986 until 1992, with higher marginal rates on the upper class, and lower marginal rates on the middle class than established by either the Tax Reform Act of 1986 or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.[27]\nEconomist Simon Johnson wrote in 2010: \"The U.S. government doesn’t take in much tax revenue—at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies—and it also doesn’t spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare. Other parts of government spending can be frozen or even slashed, but it just won’t make that much difference. That means older Americans are going to get squeezed, while our ability to defend ourselves goes into decline. Just because there’s a bipartisan consensus on an idea, such as tax cuts, doesn’t mean it makes sense. Today’s tax cutters have set us up for tomorrow’s fiscal crisis and real damage to U.S. national security.\"[28]\nA The Washington Post article takes a different view, saying that data showed the biggest contributor to the disappearance of projected surpluses was increased spending, which accounted for 36.5 percent of the decline in the nation's fiscal position, followed by incorrect CBO estimates, which accounted for 28 percent. The Bush tax cuts (along with some Obama tax cuts) were responsible for just 24 percent.[29]\nThe New York Times stated in an editorial that the full Bush-era tax cuts were the single biggest contributor to the deficit over the past decade, reducing revenues by about $1.8 trillion between 2002 and 2009.[30] However, a 2006 article asserted that there was a \"surprising jump\" in tax revenue that was \"curbing\" the deficit.[31]\nCBO estimated in June 2012 that the Bush tax cuts (EGTRRA and JGTRRA) added about $1.6 trillion to the debt between 2001 and 2011, excluding interest.[32] A 2006 Treasury Department study estimated that the Bush tax cuts reduced revenue by approximately 1.5% GDP on average for each of the first four years of their implementation, an approximately 6% annual reduction in revenue relative to a baseline without those tax cuts. The study did not extend the analysis beyond the first four years of implementation.[33]\nDebate over continuation of cuts\n[edit]Most of the tax cuts were scheduled to expire December 31, 2010. Debate over what to do regarding the expiration became a regular issue in the 2004 and 2008 U.S. presidential elections, with Republican candidates generally wanting the cut rates made permanent and Democratic candidates generally advocating for a retention of the lower rates for middle-class incomes but a return to Clinton-era rates for high incomes.[citation needed] During his presidential election campaign, then candidate Obama stated that couples with incomes less than $250,000 would not be subjected to tax increases. This income level later became a focal point for debate over what defined the middle class.[34]\nIn August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that extending the tax cuts for the 2011–2020 time period would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, comprising $2.65 trillion in foregone tax revenue plus another $0.66 trillion for interest and debt service costs.[35]\nThe non-partisan Pew Charitable Trusts estimated in May 2010 that extending some or all of the tax cuts would have the following impact under these scenarios:\n- Making the tax cuts permanent for all taxpayers, regardless of income, would increase the national debt $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years.\n- Limiting the extension to individuals making less than $200,000 and married couples earning less than $250,000 would increase the debt about $2.2 trillion in the next decade.\n- Extending the tax cuts for all taxpayers for only two years would cost $561 billion over the next 10 years.[36]\nThe non-partisan Congressional Research Service has estimated the 10-year revenue loss from extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts beyond 2010 at $2.9 trillion, with an additional $606 billion in debt service costs (interest), for a combined total of $3.5 trillion.[37]\nIn late July 2010, analysts at Deutsche Bank said letting the Bush tax cuts expire for those earning more than $250,000 would greatly slow economic recovery. However, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said allowing the expiration would not cause such a slowing. The Obama administration proposed keeping tax cuts for couples making less than $250,000 per year.[38] Economist Mark Zandi predicted that making the Bush tax cuts permanent would be the second least stimulative of several policies considered. Making the tax cuts permanent would have a multiplier effect of 0.29 (compared to the highest multiplier of 1.73 for food stamps).[39]\nExtension of Bush tax cuts\n[edit]The issue came to a head in late 2010, during a lame-duck session of the 111th Congress. The Slurpee Summit was a White House meeting between U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Congressional leaders[40] that occurred on November 30, 2010.[41] The name \"Slurpee Summit\" is a reference to an analogy Obama used while campaigning for the 2010 midterm elections. It was the first such meeting in the wake of the November midterm election in which Republicans took control of the House and gained six seats in the Democratic-controlled Senate.[42] Obama apologized during the meeting for not making a greater effort to reach out to Republican lawmakers during his first two years in office,[43] and appointed Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Office of Management and Budget chief Jack Lew to help Republicans and Democrats hammer out an agreement on extending the Bush tax cuts.[44] In return, all 42 Republican senators pledged to block all legislation until the tax matter was settled.[45][46]\nCongressional Democrats offered two attempts to extend the sunsetting Bush-era rates for \"middle income\" families but allow their expiration for \"high income\" people. The first proposal had a cutoff at $250,000, while the second raised the dividing line to $1 million. Both proposals were able to pass in the House, but on December 4, 2010, both fell short of the 60 votes required to avoid a filibuster.[47]\nOn December 6, 2010, President Barack Obama announced a compromise tax package proposal had been reached, centered around a temporary, two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts.[48] In particular, the framework included key points such as:\n- Extending the 2001/2003 income tax rates for two years. Also, reforming the AMT to ensure an additional 21 million households will not face a tax increase. These measures are intended to provide relief to more than 100 million middle-class families and prevent an annual tax increase of over $2,000 for the typical family.[49]\n- Additional provisions designed to promote economic growth. $56 billion in unemployment insurance, an approximate $120 billion payroll tax cut for working families, about $40 billion in tax cuts for the hardest hit families and students, and 100 percent expensing for businesses during 2011.[49][50]\n- Estate tax adjustment. Rates would be 35 percent after a $5 million exemption.[50][51]\nObama said, \"I'm not willing to let working families across this country become collateral damage for political warfare here in Washington. And I'm not willing to let our economy slip backwards just as we're pulling ourselves out of this devastating recession. ... So, sympathetic as I am to those who prefer a fight over compromise, as much as the political wisdom may dictate fighting over solving problems, it would be the wrong thing to do. ... As for now, I believe this bipartisan plan is the right thing to do. It’s the right thing to do for jobs. It’s the right thing to do for the middle class. It is the right thing to do for business. And it’s the right thing to do for our economy. It offers us an opportunity that we need to seize.\"[52] According to Kori Schulman (2010), Director of Online Engagement for the Whitehouse media team, the agreement has three accomplishments: “working families will not lose their tax cut, focused on high impact job creation measures, and does not worsen the medium-and-long-term deficit.”[53]\nAdministration officials like Vice President Joe Biden then worked to convince wary Democratic members of Congress to accept the plan, notwithstanding a continuation of lower rates for the highest-income taxpayers.[54] The compromise proved popular in public opinion polls, and allowed Obama to portray himself as a consensus-builder not beholden to the liberal wing of his party.[55] The bill was opposed by some of the most conservative members of the Republican Party as well as by talk radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and some groups in the Tea Party movement.[55][56] It was also opposed by several leading potential candidates for the Republican nomination in the 2012 presidential election, including Mitt Romney,[55] typically on the grounds that it did not make the Bush tax cuts permanent and that it would overall increase the national deficit.[57]\nIn an interview during these debates, former President Bush said, \"I wish they would have called it something other than the 'Bush tax cuts'. There'd probably be less angst amongst some to pass it.\"[58] He argued strongly for maintaining the rates: \"I do believe it's very important to send the signal to our entrepreneurs and our families that the government trusts them to spend their own money. And I happen to believe lower taxes is what stimulates economic growth and what we need now in our country is economic growth.\"[58]\nOn December 15, 2010, the Senate passed the compromise package with an 81–19 vote, with large majorities of both Democrats and Republicans supporting it.[59] Near midnight on December 16, the House passed the measure on a vote of 277–148, with only a modest majority of Democrats but a large majority of Republicans voting for the package.[60][61] Before that, an amendment put forward by Democratic Representative Earl Pomeroy and the progressives among the Democratic caucus to raise the estate tax, which was the ultimate sticking point of the deal for them and the cause of a minor revolt among those against it, failed on a 194–233 vote.[55][60][62] The Washington Post called the approved deal \"the most significant tax bill in nearly a decade.\"[61] President Barack Obama signed the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, on December 17, 2010.\nFiscal cliff\n[edit]This section needs to be updated.(January 2013) |\nThe \"fiscal cliff\" refers to December 31, 2012, the date of the expected implementation of government spending reductions and expiration of a large number of tax cuts, many of which were the tax cuts enacted under George W. Bush and extended by President Obama. In a report released in May 2012, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) In addition to the government spending reductions and tax cuts, increases in costs from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were slated to take effect, as well.[63] The CBO predicted that these policy changes could lead to reduced economic growth, significant enough to be considered a recession, although the 2013 deficit would be cut roughly in half and the debt trajectory over the next decade would be significantly improved.[64][65]\nThe increase in tax rates that was due to occur had been described by Republicans including House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell as the largest in U.S. history, although the U.S. would be returning to Clinton-era tax rates. According to the Associated Press, the increase would be the second largest after the tax increase of 1942, if population growth, increased pay and the size of the economy are taken into account.[64]\nBased on figures from the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation, federal taxes would have increased by a total of $423 billion in 2013, if the tax cuts had been allowed to expire.[64] The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimated that for 83% of households in the U.S., there would be an average tax increase of $3,701[66] and The Heritage Foundation stated that those impacted by the tax cut expiry are primarily in the middle- and low-income groups, with its research finding that families would experience an average tax increase of $4,138.[67]\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the expiration of the Bush income tax rates (i.e., returning to Clinton-era rates) would have affected higher income families more than lower income families. The Bush tax cuts reduced income taxes for those earning over $1 million by $110,000 per year on average during the 2004–2012 period. The tax cuts made the tax system less progressive. From 2004 through 2012, the tax cuts increased the after-tax income of the highest-income taxpayers by a far larger percentage than they did for middle- and low-income taxpayers. During 2010 for example, the tax cuts increased the after-tax income of people making over $1 million by more than 7.3%, but increased the after-tax income of the middle 20% of households by just 2.8%[68]\nA report from the CBO[69] concluded that extending the tax cuts and spending policies would lead to federal debt increasing from 73% in 2012 to over 90% of U.S. gross domestic product by 2022, but that the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to 61% in 2022 if the tax cuts expired and scheduled spending cuts took place. The CBO concluded that\nThe explosive path of federal debt under the alternative fiscal scenario underscores the need for large and timely policy changes to put the federal government on a sustainable fiscal course. Policymakers will need to increase revenues substantially above historical levels as a percentage of GDP, decrease spending significantly from projected levels, or adopt some combination of those two approaches. In fact, the current laws that underlie CBO's baseline projections provide for significant changes of those kinds in coming years; many other approaches to constraining future deficits are possible as well.\nCBO's term \"alternative scenario\" refers to extending the tax cuts and preventing scheduled automatic spending cuts, while \"baseline scenario\" refers to allowing the tax cuts to expire and the spending cuts to take place, as provided for by laws in effect in June 2012.\nThe expiration of the tax rate cuts was opposed by Republicans including those on the House Ways and Means Committee, which attempted to produce a bill providing for a one-year extension that would ensure that federal tax rates for all income levels, capital gains, dividends and estate taxes would remain the same. The bill would have also retained tax credits including the child tax credit but would propose ending the current payroll-tax cut.[70] The Democratic-majority Senate was in favor of extending the tax cuts only on that portion of household income below $250,000 per year.[71][72]\nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012\n[edit]On January 1, 2013, the Bush Tax Cuts expired. However, on January 2, 2013, President Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which reinstated many of the tax cuts, effective retroactively to January 1. The 2012 Act did not repeal the increase in the highest marginal income tax rate (from 35% to 39.6%) which had been imposed on January 1 as a result of the expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts.\nSee also\n[edit]- Economic policy of Barack Obama\n- Economic policy of the George W.

In 2001, America was experiencing the unprecedented triple shock of a recession following the dot-com bust, economic disruption due to the terrorist attacks of September 11, and corporate accounting scandals. Fortunately, the country was able to overcome these challenges, in part because President Bush's tax relief put more money in families' pockets and encouraged businesses to grow and invest. Following the President's 2003 tax relief, the United States had 52 months of uninterrupted job growth, the longest run on record.\nPresident Bush Signed The Largest Tax Relief In A Generation\nPresident Bush's tax cuts provided $1.7 trillion in relief through 2008. President Bush worked with Congress to reduce the tax burden on American families and small businesses to spur savings, investment, and job creation.\nIn 2001, President Bush proposed and signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. This legislation:\nIn 2003, President Bush proposed and signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. This legislation:\nPresident Bush's Tax Relief Allowed Americans To Keep Trillions Of Dollars Of Their Own Money\nResults of the President's tax relief were swift. The economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2001 and continued to grow for 24 consecutive quarters. The economy grew at a rapid pace of 7.5 percent above inflation during the third quarter of 2003 – the highest since 1984. The President's tax relief reduced the marginal effective tax rate on new investment, which encourages additional investment and, in the long-term, higher wages for workers.\nThe President's tax relief was followed by increases in tax revenue. From 2005 to 2007, tax revenues grew faster than the economy. The ratio of receipts to GDP rose to 18.8 percent in 2007, above the 40-year average. Between 2004 and 2006, capital gains realizations grew by approximately 60 percent. Growth in corporate income tax receipts was especially strong in the President's second term, nearly doubling between 2004 and 2007 and contributing a full percentage point to the increase in the total federal receipts-to-GDP share.\nThe President's tax relief has shifted a larger share of the individual income taxes paid to higher-income taxpayers. With nearly all of the tax relief provisions fully in effect, the President's tax relief reduced the share of taxes paid by the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers from 3.9 percent in 2000 to 3.1 percent in 2005, the latest year of available data, while increasing the share paid by the top 10 percent from 46.0 to 46.4 percent.\nPresident Bush Led The Response To The Financial Crisis Of 2008\nThis unprecedented economic growth was ended by the turbulence in the housing and credit markets, to which the President responded with bold action. President Bushaddressed the weakness in the economy early in 2008 by leading the bipartisan passage of an economic growth package that boosted consumer spending and encouraged businesses to expand, returning more than $96 billion to Americans. When the financial crisis intensified, President Bush led the passage and implementation of a rescue plan that helped address the root of the financial crisis, protected the deposits of individuals and small businesses, and helped enable credit to remain available to individuals and families. Moreover, he convened a summit with the leaders of the G-20 nations to discuss efforts to strengthen economic growth, deal with the financial crisis, reaffirm a commitment to free market principles, and lay the foundation for reform to help ensure that a similar crisis does not happen again.\n# # #\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Fifteen years ago, today, President George W. Bush signed the Economic Growth and TaxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law – perhaps the single most consequential piece of tax legislation enacted in the last quarter-century. A decade and a half later, it is worthwhile to review the legacy of this bill, which is often referred to as the first of two “Bush tax cuts.”\nThe Bush tax cuts stemmed from a campaign promise\nIn the late 1990s, an unusual circumstance presented itself to federal lawmakers: for several years in a row, the federal government ran a budget surplus. The Brookings Institution called the surplus of the late 1990s “one of the supreme budgetary accomplishments in American history,” but policymakers were already debating whether to let the surplus continue, whether to use it to fund new spending programs, or whether to use it to fund tax cuts.\nThe Republican nominee for President, George W. Bush, took a clear stance on the issue: the surplus was to be returned to American households in the form of tax relief. In his acceptance speech for the Republican nomination, he said:\n“The last time taxes were this high as a percentage of our economy, there was a good reason … We were fighting World War II. Today, our high taxes fund a surplus. Some say that growing federal surplus means Washington has more money to spend. But they’ve got it backwards. The surplus is not the government’s money. The surplus is the people’s money.”\nLegislative histories of the 2001 tax bill argue that the cuts stemmed directly from Bush’s promises on the campaign trail. Alex Brill writes, “From a political perspective, the Bush tax cut proposals began on the campaign trail in 2000.” Mona Lewandowski notes that many of the components of the 2001 tax bill were promoted during the Bush campaign.\nIt is worth keeping in mind that, like George W. Bush, presidential candidates often follow through on the tax proposals they make on the campaign trail. This is why the Tax Foundation has been keeping close track of the tax proposals of major presidential candidates; there’s a good chance that some components of these proposals will find their way into law.\nThe bill set the terms for the tax debate between 2001 and 2012\nThe 2001 tax bill consisted of several large tax cuts for individuals and households. Overall, the bill significantly reduced the total level of federal revenue collections. In order to make such a large tax cut politically palatable, and in order to conform to procedural rules in the Senate, Congress designed the bill such that most of the provisions were set to expire on December 31st, 2010.\nThe impending expiration of the Bush tax cuts became a major focus of the tax debate during the first decade of the century. The future of the Bush tax cuts was a central issue in the 2008 presidential campaign, in which John McCain advocated making almost all of the cuts permanent, and Barack Obama called for extending the cuts only for families earning less than $250,000.\nHowever, when the cuts were finally due to expire in 2010, President Obama extended the cuts for yet another two years, seeking to avert a sudden and dramatic tax increase on American families in the middle of an economic recovery. As a result, the future of the Bush tax cuts became a major campaign issue in 2012 as well.\nUltimately, the fate of the Bush tax cuts was settled in the 2012 “fiscal cliff” deal, where Congress decided once and for all which of the cuts would be made permanent, and which would expire. While the Bush tax cuts are no longer a hot political issue, it is worth remembering that the future of the cuts occupied the attention of the tax policy community for over a decade.\nMuch of the bill has now been made into permanent law\nThe “fiscal cliff” deal cemented the vast majority of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts into permanent law. According to one estimate, 82 percent of the Bush tax cuts were made permanent in 2012, while only 18 percent were allowed to expire.\nThe deal was passed with large bipartisan majorities in both chambers, despite the fact that many Democrats initially opposed the tax cuts in 2001. This is, in large part, because Democrats simply did not want to raise taxes on low- and middle-class Americans. Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire in full would have significantly increased the tax burden of households making under $250,000, a step that most legislators were unwilling to take.\nThe persistence of the Bush tax cuts for low- and middle- income Americans should be viewed as a major policy legacy of the Bush administration. In essence, George W. Bush argued that the middle class should pay a lower level of federal taxes, and basically no American politician has challenged this vision since. Perhaps the sole exception is Bernie Sanders, who has proposed across-the-board tax increases on Americans in every income group.\nThe bill focused on tax relief, rather than structural reform\nThe main focus of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was lowering taxes on all Americans. The bill cut the rates of the top four tax brackets by 3-4 points, added a new 10 percent bracket for low-income households, increased the standard deduction for married couples, and doubled the child tax credit.\n|\nIndividual income tax rates in 2000 (before EGTRRA) for married couples filing jointly |\nIndividual income tax rates in 2003 (after full phase-in of EGTRRA cuts) for married couples filing jointly |\n||\n|\n10% |\n$0 to $14,000 |\n||\n|\n15% |\n$0 to $43,850 |\n15% |\n$14,000 to $56,800 |\n|\n28% |\n$43,850 to $105,950 |\n25% |\n$56,800 to $114,650 |\n|\n31% |\n$105,950 to $161,450 |\n28% |\n$114,650 to $174,700 |\n|\n36% |\n$161,450 to $288,350 |\n33% |\n$174,700 to $311,950 |\n|\n39.6% |\n$288,350 and over |\n35% |\n$311,950 and over |\n|\nNote: bracket thresholds are expressed in nominal dollars of taxable income. |\nNotably, the 2001 tax bill did not contain many provisions that altered the structure of the U.S. tax code. The bill did not address the overabundance of credits, deductions, and exclusions in the individual tax code, nor did it significantly change the treatment of business investment. In other words, if the traditional template for tax reform is “broaden the base and lower the rate,” the 2001 Bush tax cuts only focused on the second half of this template.\nThe Republican Party has largely shifted away from the model of the 2001 tax bill\nTo a large extent, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have moved away from the approach of the 2001 tax bill: the model of large tax cuts for individuals and households without any offsetting base-broadeners or structural changes to the code. Congressmen such as Devin Nunes have focused their attention on the business tax code, rather than the individual income taxAn individual income tax (or personal income tax) is levied on the wages, salaries, investments, or other forms of income an individual or household earns. The U.S. imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income. The Federal Income Tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. Though barely 100 years old, individual income taxes are the largest source. Meanwhile, many of this year’s Republican presidential candidates have prioritized cutting back on itemized deductions and reimagining the business tax base.\nThe one exception is Donald Trump. Trump’s tax plan more or less follows the template of the 2001 tax bill, with large rate cuts for households of all income groups and with few proposals that would alter the structure of the U.S. tax code.\nStay informed on the tax policies impacting you.\nSubscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox.\nSubscribe\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

That often means having to make decisions about what bills she can pay this month, and what bills she can put off till the next.\nHer reality is one of millions of Black people and women of color experience in the workplace across the country.\n\"At some point, something has got to give,\" Franceis told Insider. \"The cost of living has got to equal out. You cannot expect people to pay $1,100 and $1,200 and $3,000 dollars in rent … Plus pay electric bills, gas bills, water bills, whatever bills they may have. And by making what? Making $10 an hour? $11? $7.25? $8? How is anybody supposed to live?\"\nLast month, an Oxfam study revealed that 32% of workers across the US earn less than $15 an hour — which, given a 40 hour work week, is not a livable wage in any major city in the US.\nWithin that, 47% of Black workers in the US earn less than $15 an hour, the highest of any racial group. And 50% of women of color earn less than $15 an hour, the highest of any demographic.\n\"One of the things that we are really advocating for with this report is that, not only do we need to lift wages in this country, but what we really need to do is have a universal minimum wage,\" said Kaitlyn Henderson, a senior researcher at Oxfam America and the author of the Oxfam report.\n\"Right now we have minimum wage laws. And then we have a subminimum wage, which is largely for tipped workers. And then there are some workers, including still to this day, certain farm workers that are completely excluded from the minimum wage law. And so the racist history of this, and sexist history of this legislation sort of echoes even today.\"\nThe legacy of Jim Crow is the foundation of the modern US labor market, experts say.\nProfessor Joel Suarez, a labor studies professor at the City University of New York, said the data in this study is not surprising given the US's history of economy and labor. The historical exclusion of people of color within labor protections, going all the way back to Jim Crow laws for African Americans, is reflected in the low wages today.\n\"Jim Crow was utterly shaped by the institution of slavery. A lot of the New Deal labor legislation, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Wagner Act of 1935. It excluded domestic workers and agricultural workers, which is overwhelmingly where African Americans worked and that is a product of having Americans being concentrated in the South,\" Suarez said.\nAfrican American workers in the farming and domestic sectors were left out of the first minimum wage created in 1938.\nSuarez said that African Americans who moved from the South to the North in the early and mid-20th century were afforded some of those labor protections immediately. In most cases, they saw their wages double overnight and had access to social services not present in many Southern states.\nIt was easier to grant industrial factory workers protections primarily because of the centralized aspect of the work and many became unionized. But he said that doesn't mean there wasn't a concerted effort by racist politicians in Washington to exclude African Americans from labor protections.\nThis was made worse during the 1980s as Federal Reserve Chair, Paul Volcker dramatically raised interest rates to fend off inflation, but what it actually did was worsen the recession for workers.\nAnd Black workers who were just receiving gains from the Civil Rights Movement were hit particularly hard, Suarez said.\n\"Instead of being focused on sort of high consumption, high wages, wage compression, it instead focused on what an economist called labor market flexibility.\" In other words, workers' fears of losing their jobs prevented them from speaking up for a higher salary, keeping wage inflation low. Economist Alan Greenspan called it \"heightened job insecurity.\"\nSuarez points to the fact that Black unemployment is currently almost twice what white unemployment rates are, which is a byproduct of this phenomenon. It ensures — and relies upon the fact — that at any given time, there will be a segment of unemployed workers.\n\"You create monetary and macroeconomic conditions [that] were allowing a certain percentage of unemployment, all for the sake of what they call price stability, or making sure that inflation doesn't get out of hand,\" Suarez said. \"Economists came up with this term called the natural rate of unemployment.\"\nLow wage workers say they will continue to organize for higher wages, benefits, and unions.\nDeborah Linette McAllister, is a home healthcare aid for her 80 year-old mother who has dementia, Alzheimer's and hematoma. She is hindered by a fixed monthly income of $822 in Burgaw, North Carolina, and her rent has gone up twice since the start of the pandemic.\n\"To live off that, we struggle every single month,\" McAllister said. McAllister worked in local government for over 20 years, but because she retired early to take care of her mother, she didn't receive her full pension.\nMcAllister's situation highlights a hidden segment of the report encompassing caregivers, farm workers, student workers, tipped wage workers, and workers with disabilities who all make, in most cases, less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25.\nEvery day, McAllister calls her US Senators Thom Tillis and Richard Burr and frequently sends letters expressing to them the need to raise the minimum wage and the urgency to pass the Build Back Better Act, which would allow McAllister to hire a home healthcare aid for her mother so that she could go back to work.\nMcAllister and Franceis are both a part of unionization efforts at their places of work and fighting on a national level for $15 an hour. They said $15 an hour is a start, but they are also working toward other basic benefits, like healthcare.\n\"All we want, basically, is a basis of equality where everybody's on the same page and there's not this class, that class or the other class.

Floridians pay a “hidden tax” of $1.4 billion due to uncompensated care. When this cost trickles down from hospitals and insurance companies to insured Floridians, it equates to between $1,700 to $2,200 for every insured admission.\nAs Florida’s business community is well aware, healthcare costs continue to have a significant impact on the bottom line. As costs continue to increase, Florida businesses struggle to prosper and the overall competitiveness of the business community diminishes. This week’s Scorecard Did You Know highlights the real cost of rising healthcare expenses to Florida businesses, more commonly known as the healthcare cost shift.\n“Hospitals need to manage care delivery differently, moving toward focusing more exclusively on outcomes and efficiency of treatment,” said Rich Morrison with Florida Hospital. “This is an issue and challenge for those of us in the care industry as well as the business community as a whole. Taking into account uncompensated care to the uninsured, unpaid deductibles and copayments, and unreimbursed costs from Medicare/Medicaid, Florida Hospital alone spent more than $400 million last year on treatment and care that was never paid for. When this number is added up across the industry, the results are a massive cost shift and represent a hidden tax that ends up being paid for by consumers, the insured, and the businesses that pay the majority of insurance coverage. In a state with such a sizable number of retirees, this is a pressing challenge for Florida over the next 20-plus years.”\nFlorida’s demand for healthcare services is typically much higher than other states due to a significantly higher population of retirees. Between now and 2030, the Florida Chamber Foundation estimates Florida’s population is expected to increase by six million residents. Of these, the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research estimates as many as 55.4 percent will be aged 60 and older.\nCalculating this cost shift is complex, but a range can be estimated. The first step is comparing total costs of service to the total charges, which then is allocated among the 2.4 million yearly hospital admissions in the state. The analysis leads to a range of cost-shift of about $2,000 for each uninsured to insured admission and this estimate does not include the additional cost shifts present in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe cost shift occurs when the costs for medical care for the uninsured are “passed” onto insured patients. When a doctor or hospital provides care to an uninsured party, the costs of those services have to come from somewhere. Insurance companies are ultimately forced to incorporate them into higher premiums, which are paid (the majority of the time) by companies providing benefits for their employees. To make Florida more attractive for business startups and relocations, healthcare costs must be slowed and show real decline, especially with respect to the cost shift.\nLearn More\nRead the Florida Chamber’s Smarter Healthcare Coverage in Florida plan here.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Key Facts about the Uninsured Population\nIssue Brief\nThe pandemic-era coverage policies, including the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision and the enhanced Marketplace subsidies, continued to impact health coverage in the U.S. in 2023. During the pandemic, the coverage expansions put in place by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including Medicaid expansion and subsidized Marketplace coverage, served as a safety net for people who experienced economic and coverage disruptions. Gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage contributed to significant declines in the uninsured rate through 2022. Although states began the process of unwinding continuous enrollment in Medicaid in April 2023 and resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, the full effect of Medicaid disenrollments were not felt in 2023. In addition, the enhanced Marketplace subsidies, which were extended through 2025, remained in place. Both these factors contributed to maintaining most of the coverage gains experienced during the pandemic period in 2023.\nThis issue brief describes trends in health coverage in 2023, examines the characteristics of the uninsured population ages 0-64, and summarizes the access and financial implications of not having coverage. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), this analysis examines changes in health coverage from 2022 to 2023 and compares data for 2023 to data for 2019 to report on coverage trends during the pandemic and through the start of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision. Because of disruptions in data collection during the pandemic, the Census Bureau did not release 1-year ACS estimates in 2020. The analysis focuses on coverage among people ages 0-64 since Medicare offers near universal coverage for people ages 65 and older, with just 457,000, or less than 1%, of people over age 65 uninsured.\nKey Takeaways\n- How many people are uninsured: Despite the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision that began in April 2023, the number of people ages 0-64 who were uninsured held steady at 25.3 million in 2023. However, the number of uninsured children increased from 3.8 million in 2022 to 4.0 million in 2023. Compared to 2019, the number of people who were uninsured declined by 3.6 million.\n- Who is uninsured: Most uninsured people are in low-income families and have at least one worker in the family. Reflecting the more limited availability of public coverage in some states, adults ages 19-64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. Despite gains across groups over time, racial and ethnic disparities in coverage persist.\n- Why are people uninsured: Many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage. In 2023, 63% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said that they were uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high. Many uninsured people do not have access to coverage through a job, and some people, particularly poor adults in states that have not expanded Medicaid, remain ineligible for financial assistance for coverage. Although over half of people who are uninsured may be eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the Marketplaces, they may not be aware of these coverage options or may face barriers to enrolling. In some cases, even with subsidies, Marketplace coverage may not be affordable.\n- How does not having coverage affect health care access: People without insurance coverage are less likely to access care and more likely to delay or forgo care because of costs. Although difficult to establish direct causality, research has linked Medicaid expansion to improved health outcomes, including lower mortality rates from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.\n- What are the financial implications of being uninsured: Uninsured people often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults say they have difficulty affording health care costs, more than double the share of those with private insurance (21%). These costs can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults.\nAlthough coverage rates for the overall population ages 0-64 held steady in 2023, future changes to Medicaid and Marketplace coverage could have a significant impact on health coverage. Proposals that would alter how Medicaid is financed or that would impose work requirements on certain adults enrolled in the program would likely lead to a loss of Medicaid coverage. Moreover, the temporary enhanced Marketplace subsidies will expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Without a permanent extension, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured people will increase by 3.8 million, on average, in each year from 2026 to 2034. The combined Medicaid and Marketplace coverage losses could lead to a sizable increase in the number of people who are uninsured. In turn, the loss of coverage could have implications for access to care and financial stability associated with having health coverage and could lead to a worsening of disparities in health outcomes.\nHow many people are uninsured?\nAmong the population ages 0-64, both the number of uninsured (25.3 million) and the uninsured rate (9.5%) remained at historic lows in 2023. A continued decline in the number of uninsured adults ages 19-64 was offset by an increase in the number of uninsured children. Compared to 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic, the number of uninsured and the uninsured rate for the population ages 0-64 were both significantly lower in 2023. Nearly all groups experienced coverage gains, but American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and Hispanic people had larger gains than their White counterparts and low-income individuals and those in working families had bigger gains than those at higher incomes and those without a worker in the family.\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, 25.3 million people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured, and the uninsured rate for this population was 9.5%, both statistically unchanged from 2022. While the uninsured rate held steady from 2022, it was lower than in 2019 (10.9%) prior to the start of the coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1).\n- From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate declined by 1.4%, driven primarily by gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage because of pandemic-era coverage protections. The Medicaid continuous enrollment provision required states to keep people enrolled in Medicaid during the pandemic in exchange for enhanced federal funding and enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies, first enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and renewed through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Although the enhanced Marketplace subsidies remained in effect in 2023, Medicaid continuous enrollment ended on March 31, 2023, and states resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, though the full effects of the disenrollments were not felt in 2023. During this time period, employer coverage declined by 0.5% (Figure 2).\n- While there was no change in the uninsured rate for the overall population ages 0 to 64 in 2023, the share of children 18 and younger without insurance increased from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2023. At the same time, the uninsured rate for adults ages 19 to 64 decreased to 11.1% in 2023 from 11.3% the previous year (Figure 2). An increase in Medicaid coverage for adults 19-64 from 16.3% to 16.5% in 2023 drove the decline in the uninsured rate for this group. Despite the uptick in the uninsured rate for children in 2023, the share of children without health insurance coverage was still lower in 2023 compared to 2019.\n- Although nearly all groups experienced coverage gains during the pandemic-period, they were largest for AIAN and Hispanic people and individuals in low-income families. From 2019 to 2023, the uninsured rate for AIAN people fell 3.0 percentage points (from 21.7% to 18.7%) and the uninsured rate for Hispanic people decreased by 2.1 percentage points (from 20.0% to 17.9%), although these groups remain more likely to be uninsured than their White counterparts. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) people did not experience a significant decline in the uninsured rate during this period, which may, in part, reflect the smaller sample size for NHPI people, which limits the power to detect statistically significant differences. While the uninsured rate dropped for people at all income levels, individuals in low-income families1 experienced the largest declines. From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate for poor individuals dropped 2.2 percentage points (18.0% to 15.8%) and 2.7 percentage points for individuals with income 100-199% FPL (18.2% to 15.5%, Figure 3).\n- From 2022 to 2023, the uninsured rate for the population ages 0 to 64 fell in six states (Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, North Dakota, and Oregon) but increased in two states, Iowa and Idaho (Appendix Table A). At the same time, the uninsured rate for children increased in six states (Alabama, Idaho, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington). While these changes occurred in both expansion and non-expansion states, the uninsured rate was lower in expansion states (7.6%) compared to non-expansion states (14.1%) in 2023 (Figure 6).\nWho is uninsured?\nMost of the 25.3 million people ages 0-64 who are uninsured are adults, in working low-income families, and are people of color. Reflecting geographic variation in income and the availability of public coverage, most uninsured people live in the South or West. In addition, most who are uninsured have been without coverage for long periods of time. (See Appendix Table B for detailed data on characteristics of the uninsured population.)\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, of the total uninsured population ages 0 to 64, nearly three in four (73.7%) had at least one full-time worker in their family, and 11.2% had a part-time worker in their family (Figure 4). More than eight in ten (80.9%) uninsured people were in families with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level, and nearly half (46.6%) had incomes below 200% FPL. White people made up 37.1% of the uninsured, and the remaining 62.9% included Hispanic (41.1%), Black (12.5%), and Asian (3.7%) people and people of other racial or ethnic backgrounds (Figure 4). Most uninsured individuals (74.2%) were U.S. citizens, while 25.8% were noncitizens. Almost three-quarters (73.9%) of uninsured people lived in the South or West.\n- Adults ages 19 to 64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. In 2023, the uninsured rate for children was 5.3%, less than half the rate for adults at 11.1%.\n- Uninsured rates in the U.S. still show clear racial and ethnic disparities. In 2023, 17.9% of Hispanic people and 18.7% of AIAN people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured—more than two and a half times the rate for White people (6.5%). Asian individuals had the lowest uninsured rate at 5.8%.\n- Noncitizens are more likely than citizens to be uninsured. Nearly one-third of noncitizen immigrants were uninsured in 2023, while the uninsured rate for U.S.-born citizens was 7.5% and 8.9% for naturalized citizens. (Appendix Table B).\n- Uninsured rates vary by state and by region; individuals living in non-expansion states are more likely to be uninsured (Figure 6). Six of the ten states with the highest uninsured rates in 2023 were non-expansion states (Figure 5 and Appendix Table A).\n- Nearly two-thirds (64%) of people who were uninsured in 2023 have been without coverage for more than a year.2 People who have been without coverage for long periods may be particularly hard to reach through outreach and enrollment efforts.\nWhy are people uninsured?\nLack of access to affordable health coverage is the main reason many people say they are uninsured. A majority of working age adults in the U.S. obtain health insurance through an employer; however, not all workers are offered employer-sponsored coverage or, if offered, can afford their share of the premiums. Medicaid covers many low-income individuals, especially children, but Medicaid eligibility for adults remains limited in most states that have not adopted the ACA expansion. Marketplace subsidies make coverage more affordable for many, but even subsidized Marketplace coverage can be unaffordable for some, and few people can afford to purchase private coverage without financial assistance.\nKey Details:\n- Cost is the most commonly cited reason for being uninsured. In 2023, 63.2% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said they were uninsured because coverage is not affordable (Figure 7). Other reasons included not being eligible for coverage (27.0%), not needing or wanting coverage (26.6%), and signing up being too difficult (23.9%).\n- Not all workers have access to coverage through their job. In 2023, 64.7% of uninsured workers worked for an employer that did not offer them health benefits.3 Among uninsured workers who are offered coverage by their employers, cost is often a barrier to taking up the offer. From 2014 to 2024, total premiums for family coverage increased by 52%, outpacing wage growth, and the worker’s share increased by 31%.4 Low-income families with employer-based coverage spend a significantly higher share of their income toward premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses compared to those with income above 200% FPL.5 Particularly among people working for small employers , premium contributions for dependents can be unaffordable.\n- Medicaid eligibility varies across states and eligibility for adults is limited in states that have not expanded Medicaid. As of December 2024, 41 states including DC had adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion. Two states implemented the expansion in 2023—South Dakota in July and North Carolina in December. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, the median eligibility level for parents is just 34% FPL and adults without dependent children are ineligible in most cases. Additionally, in non-expansion states, millions of poor uninsured adults fall into a “coverage gap” because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits.\n- Many lawfully present immigrants must meet a five-year waiting period after receiving qualified immigration status before they can qualify for Medicaid. States have the option to cover eligible children and pregnant people without a waiting period, and as of May 2024, 37 states have elected the option for children and 31 states have taken up the option for pregnant individuals. Lawfully present immigrants, including those who are not eligible for Medicaid because they have not met the five-year waiting period, are eligible for Marketplace tax credits. However, Some states have taken steps to provide fully state-funded coverage to some or all immigrants who are not eligible for federal coverage.\n- Though financial assistance is available under the ACA to many of the remaining uninsured, not everyone who is uninsured is eligible for free or subsidized coverage. Nearly six in ten (14.5 million) uninsured individuals in 2023 were eligible for financial assistance either through Medicaid or through subsidized Marketplace coverage (Figure 8). However, over four in ten uninsured (10.9 million) are outside the reach of the ACA because their state did not expand Medicaid, they have an ineligible immigration status, or they were deemed to have access to an affordable Marketplace plan or offer of employer coverage.\nHow does not having coverage affect health care access?\nHealth insurance makes a difference in whether and when people get necessary medical care, where they get their care, and ultimately, how healthy they are. Uninsured adults are far more likely than those with insurance to postpone health care or forgo it altogether because of concerns over costs. The consequences can be severe, particularly when preventable conditions or chronic diseases go undetected.\nKey Details:\n- Uninsured adults are more likely to forgo needed care than their insured counterparts. In 2023, nearly half (46.6%) of uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 reported not seeing a doctor or health care professional in the past 12 months compared to 15.6% with private insurance and 14.2% with public coverage. Part of the reason for not accessing care among uninsured individuals is that many (42.8%) do not have a regular place to go when they are sick or need medical advice (Figure 9). But cost also plays a role. Over one in five (22.6%) adults without coverage said that they went without needed care in the past year because of cost compared to 5.1% of adults with private coverage and 7.7% of adults with public coverage. A KFF survey that asks about cost barriers for individuals and their family members reports higher percentages of both uninsured and insured people delaying or forgoing needed care due to cost.\n- Uninsured children were also more likely than those with private insurance or public insurance to go without needed care due to cost in 2023 (9.5% compared to 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively). Furthermore, over a quarter (27.4%) of uninsured children had not seen a doctor in the past year, compared to 4.8% of children with public coverage and 3.7% of those with private coverage (Figure 9).\n- Studies repeatedly demonstrate that uninsured individuals are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and services for major health conditions and chronic diseases.6 ,7 ,8 ,9 Because people without health coverage are less likely than those with insurance to have regular outpatient care, they are more likely to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems and to experience declines in their overall health. When they are hospitalized, uninsured people receive fewer diagnostic and therapeutic services and also have higher mortality rates than those with insurance.10 ,11 ,12 ,13 ,14\n- Research demonstrates that gaining health insurance improves access to health care considerably and diminishes the adverse effects of having been uninsured. A review of research on the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansion finds that expansion led to positive effects on access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population.\n- More recent research generally shows Medicaid expansion is associated with improved health outcomes, although establishing direct causality between health insurance and health outcomes is complex. For example, Medicaid expansion is associated with increased early-stage diagnosis rates for cancer, lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, and increased odds of tobacco cessation.15 ,16 Medicaid expansion has also been linked to lower mortality rates, including those from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.17 ,18 Evidence suggests it also aids long-term recovery for substance use disorders and improves treatment management for conditions such as diabetes and HIV.\n- Public hospitals, community clinics and health centers, and local providers that serve underserved communities provide an important health care safety net for uninsured people. However, safety net providers have limited resources and service capacity, and not all uninsured people have geographic access to a safety net provider.19 ,20 ,21 High uninsured rates contribute to rural hospital closures and greater financial challenges for rural hospitals, leaving individuals living in rural areas at an even greater disadvantage to accessing care.22 ,23 Research indicates that Medicaid expansion is associated with reductions in uncompensated care costs and improved financial performance for rural hospitals and other providers.\nWhat are the financial implications of being uninsured?\nUninsured individuals often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. These bills can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.\nKey Details:\n- Those without insurance for an entire calendar year pay for almost 40% of their care out-of-pocket.24 In addition, hospitals frequently charge uninsured patients higher rates than those paid by private health insurers and public programs.25 ,26 ,27 ,28\n- Uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 are much more likely than their insured counterparts to lack confidence in their ability to afford usual medical costs. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults said they or a family member had problems paying for health care compared to 21% of insured adults, and over eight in ten (84%) uninsured adults said they worried that health care costs would put them in debt or increase their existing debt, compared to 71% of adults with insurance (Figure 10).\n- Unaffordable medical bills can lead to medical debt, particularly for uninsured adults. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults. Uninsured adults are more likely to face negative consequences due to health care debt, such as using up savings, having difficulty paying other living expenses, or borrowing money.29 ,30 ,31\n- While federal and state laws require certain hospitals to provide some level of charity care, not all eligible patients benefit from these programs. Consequently, charity care costs represent a small share of operating expenses at many hospitals.\n- Research suggests that gaining health coverage improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population. Multiple studies of the ACA found declines in trouble paying medical bills and reductions in medical debt in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. More recent research found that Medicaid expansion decreased catastrophic health expenditures and was associated with greater increases in income among low-income individuals.\nAppendix\nSupplemental Tables\nEndnotes\n- The Federal Poverty Level was $ 24,526 for a family of three in 2023. ↩︎\n- Cohen RA and Sohi IS. “Demographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage: United States, 2023”, National Center for Health Statistics.

While the number of people who fall into the coverage gap has declined as more states implemented the expansion, 1.4 million uninsured individuals remain in the coverage gap in the ten states that have not expanded Medicaid.\nLimited Medicaid eligibility in non-expansion states leaves many adults without children, people of color, and those with disabilities without coverage. Most adults in the coverage gap are in working families, though about one in six have a disability that requires ongoing health care and may limit their ability to work. Using data from 2023, this brief estimates the number and characteristics of uninsured individuals in these ten non-expansion states who could gain coverage if Medicaid expansion were adopted.\nThe future of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion is uncertain as Congress considers significant changes to Medicaid financing. Some proposals under consideration would eliminate the enhanced 90 percent federal matching rate for the expansion population or make other changes to federal payments to states for this group. Any cuts in federal funding for expansion enrollees would likely lead a number of states to rollback coverage for this population and would increase the number of people who fall into the coverage gap and become uninsured.\nHow many people are in the coverage gap?\nThe coverage gap exists in states that have not adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Under the ACA, Medicaid was expanded to cover adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138% FPL (or $21,597 for an individual in 2025). This income threshold applied to parents and to adults without dependent children who were previously not eligible for Medicaid. While the ACA intended to require all states to implement the Medicaid expansion, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made expansion optional for states. As of February 2025, 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted Medicaid expansion (Figure 1).\nIn the ten states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, an estimated 1.4 million individuals remain in the coverage gap. These adults have incomes above their state’s Medicaid eligibility threshold but below the poverty level, making them ineligible for ACA Marketplace subsidies (Figure 2). Because the Medicaid expansion was expected to be mandatory for states, the ACA did not provide eligibility for subsidies in the Marketplaces for people below poverty.\nMedicaid eligibility remains limited in states that have not expanded their programs. All non-expansion states, except Wisconsin (which provides coverage through a waiver), do not offer Medicaid to adults without children, regardless of their income (Figure 3). As a result, 80% of the individuals in the coverage group are adults without dependent children.\nUninsured rates in states without Medicaid expansion are nearly twice as high as those in expansion states (14.1% vs. 7.6%). People without insurance have more difficulty accessing care, with almost one in four uninsured adults in 2023 not receiving needed medical treatment due to cost. Uninsured individuals are also less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and treatment for major health conditions and chronic diseases.\nWhat are the characteristics of people in the coverage gap?\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the coverage gap live in just three Southern states. Texas accounts for 42% of individuals in the coverage gap, the highest share of any state, while Florida and Georgia account for an additional 19% and 14%, respectively (Figure 4). Overall, 97% of those in the coverage gap live in the South. Of the 16 states in the region, seven have not adopted Medicaid expansion.\nNearly six in ten people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker and over four in ten are working themselves. (Figure 5). However, these individuals work in low-wage jobs that leave them below the poverty level and often work for employers that do not offer affordable job-based insurance. Over half (53%) of workers in the coverage gap are in the service, retail, and construction industries, with common jobs including cashiers, cooks, servers, construction laborers, housekeepers, retail salespeople, and janitors. In non-expansion states, even part-time work can make parents ineligible for Medicaid.\nAbout one in six (16%) people in the coverage gap have a functional disability. The share of people in the coverage gap with disabilities increases with age (Figure 6). Over a quarter (26%) of adults ages 55 to 64 in the coverage gap have a disability compared to one in ten adults under age 25. Adults ages 55 to 64, who often face increased health care needs, account for 17% of all people in the coverage gap. Despite these challenges, many of these individuals do not qualify for Medicaid through a disability pathway, leaving them uninsured. Research shows that uninsured people in this age group may delay necessary care until they become eligible for Medicare at 65.\nPeople of color make up a disproportionate share of individuals in the coverage gap. Six in ten people in the coverage gap are people of color, a higher share than among adults in non-expansion states (49%) and nationwide (44%) (Figure 7). These differences in part explain persisting disparities in health insurance coverage across racial and ethnic groups.\nHow many uninsured could gain coverage if all states adopted the Medicaid expansion?\nApproximately 2.7 million uninsured adults would gain coverage if all states adopted Medicaid expansion. This includes 1.4 million people in the coverage gap and 1.3 million uninsured adults with incomes between 100% and 138% of the FPL, most of whom are eligible for Marketplace coverage but not enrolled (Figure 7 and Table 1). While many of these adults above poverty qualify for zero-premium Marketplace plans, Medicaid generally provides more comprehensive benefits with lower out-of-pocket costs. The potential number of people who could gain coverage through expansion varies by state.\nSammy Cervantes, Clea Bell, and Jennifer Tolbert are with KFF. Anthony Damico is an independent consultant.\nAppendix Tables\nData And Methods\nThis analysis uses data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS provides socioeconomic and demographic information for the United States population and specific subpopulations. Importantly, the ACS provides detailed data on families and households, which we use to determine income and household composition for ACA eligibility purposes.\nMedicaid and Marketplaces have different rules about household composition and income for eligibility. The ACS questionnaire captures the relationship between each household resident and one household reference person, but not necessarily each individual to all others. Therefore, prior to estimating eligibility, we implement a series of logical rules based on each person’s relationship to that household reference person in order to estimate the person-to-person relationships of all individuals within a respondent household to one another. We then assess income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies by grouping individuals into household insurance units (HIUs) and calculate HIU income using the rules for each program. For more detail on how we construct person-to-person relationships, aggregate Medicaid and Marketplace households, and then count income, see the detailed Technical Appendix A.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally-funded Medicaid and Marketplace coverage. Since ACS data do not directly indicate whether an immigrant is lawfully present, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. Al.1 ,2 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample. We apply the model to ACS, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. For more detail on the immigration imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix B.\nIndividuals in tax-filing units with access to an affordable offer of Employer-Sponsored Insurance (ESI) are still potentially MAGI-eligible for Medicaid coverage, but they are ineligible for advance premium tax credits in the Health Insurance Exchanges. Since ACS data do not designate policyholders of employment-based coverage nor indicate whether workers hold an offer of ESI, we developed a model that predicts both the policyholder and the offer of ESI based on the Current Population Survey (CPS). Additionally, for families with a Marketplace eligibility level below 250% FPL, we assume any reported worker offer does not meet affordability requirements and therefore does not disqualify the family from Tax Credit eligibility on the Exchanges. For more detail on the offer imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix C.\nAs of January 2014, Medicaid financial eligibility for most adults ages 19-64 is based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). To determine whether each individual is eligible for Medicaid, we use each state’s reported eligibility levels as of May 2024, updated to reflect 2025 Federal Poverty Levels. Some adults ages 19-64 with incomes above MAGI levels may be eligible for Medicaid through other pathways; however, we only assess eligibility through the MAGI pathway.3\nAn individual’s income is likely to fluctuate throughout the year, impacting his or her eligibility for Medicaid. Our estimates are based on annual income and thus represent a snapshot of the number of people in the coverage gap at a given point in time. Over the course of the year, a larger number of people are likely to move in and out of the coverage gap as their income fluctuates.\nStarting with our estimates of ACA eligibility in 2017, we transferred our core modeling approach from relying on the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the American Community Survey (ACS). ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates as well as longer trend analyses. Since our methodology excludes a small number of individuals whose poverty status could not be determined, our ACS-based population totals appear slightly below CPS-based totals and some ACS population totals published by the Census Bureau. This difference is in large part attributable to students who reside in college dormitories. Comparing the two survey designs, CPS counts more of these individuals in the household of their parent(s) than ACS does.\nTechnical Appendix A: Household Construction\nIn KFF’s estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies is assessed by grouping people into “health insurance units” (HIUs) and calculating HIU income according to Medicaid and Marketplace program rules. HIUs group people according to how they are counted for eligibility for health insurance, versus grouping people according to who they live with (e.g., “households”) or are related to (e.g., “families”). HIU construction is an important step in assessing income as a share of the federal poverty line (FPL) because it impacts whose income is counted (and thus the total income for the unit) and how many people share that income (and thus the corresponding FPL to use for comparison, since FPL varies by family size). Our HIUs are designed to match ACA eligibility rules for both Medicaid and Marketplaces. Below we describe how we construct HIUs for this analysis. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nPerson to Person Relationships\nWe construct spousal and parent-to-child person-to-person linkage variables within each household of the microdata. The American Community Survey (ACS) includes only the relationship of each person in a household to one central reference person. Using the household reference person’s known relationships to all other individuals within each household, we iterate through every pair of individuals present in each household to determine probable person to person links for possible mother, father, and spousal pairs. Our approach to determining probable family interrelationship linkages closely follows the construction documented by IPUMS-USA with the notable exception of unmarried partner relationships.4 We intentionally diverge from IPUMS-USA because the presence of an unmarried partner relationship does not impact federal program eligibility. Among individuals designated as married with a spouse present in the household, our constructed spousal pointer matches the IPUMS SPLOC variable 99% of the time in the 2013 microdata. Our construction of mother and father pointers match the IPUMS MOMLOC, POPLOC, MOMLOC2, and POPLOC2 variables for more than 99% of all person-records.\nFamily Aggregation\nSeparate from person-to-person linkage variables, we assemble individual records into family units reproducing the Census Bureau’s Family Poverty Ratio (POVPIP) variable. Although the Census Bureau does not include a unique family identifier on the ACS microdata, we approximate the groupings used to generate the ACS income-to-poverty ratio variable with the following steps:\n- Both non-relatives of the household reference person (RELP of 11-17) and all individuals in non-family households (HHT of 4-7) are categorized as single-person families.\n- Married couples and other family households without subfamilies (PSF of 0) are categorized into single-family households.\n- Married couples and other family households with subfamilies (PSF of 1) are categorized based on their subfamily number (SFN).\nThis family identifier is used in estimating family-wide statistics, such as the percent of the uninsured Americans in a family below poverty or the count of Medicaid-enrollees with one or more workers in their family. This family aggregation matches the groupings used to determine the income-to-poverty ratio variable, and estimates of health insurance presented by family poverty categories align with Census Bureau publications based on the ACS.5 Since many family members obtain health coverage separately from one another (for example, an elderly parent cohabiting with their working-age child might hold Medicare coverage and Employer Sponsored Insurance, respectively), descriptive statistics focused on family attributes rely on this family identifier but Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility determinations do not.\nOverview of KFF-HIUS\nWe construct two different HIUs for everyone in the sample: a Medicaid HIU and a Marketplace HIU. We use two HIUs because the rules for counting families and income differ between the two programs. For example, in Medicaid, children with unmarried parents have both parents’ income counted toward their income, whereas under Marketplace rules, only the income of the parent who claims the child on his/her taxes counts. In another example, certain tax dependents (e.g., a parent) are treated differently for Medicaid eligibility than they are for Marketplace eligibility. To account for these rules, we developed an algorithm for sorting people into HIUs. We construct HIUs and HIU incomes separately for each person in a household and take into account the family relationships and income of the other people in the person’s household. People in the same household or in the same family may not have the same HIU composition or income for determining either Medicaid eligibility or eligibility for tax credits.\nIn simplest terms, the HIU algorithm sorts people into tax filing units. For all people in the data set, the algorithm assesses whether they are likely to be a tax filer themselves and, if so, who they are likely to claim or, if not, who is likely to claim them. It also captures whether someone is neither a tax filer nor claimed as a dependent by someone else. Importantly, the HIU construction considers all relationships for each person within the household. This step is particularly important in correctly classifying people in non-nuclear families (e.g., households with more than one generation, with unmarried partners, or with relatives outside the nuclear family such as an aunt or uncle), which may contain either one or multiple tax filing units.\nIn counting income for both Medicaid and Marketplace HIUs, we use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), corresponding to the ACA rules. MAGI differs from total income in that some sources of income (e.g., cash assistance payments from TANF or SSI) do not count toward MAGI. We calculate HIU income as a share of poverty using the Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.6\nFor a small number of people, Medicaid HIU income as a share of poverty does not match Marketplace HIU income as a share of poverty due to the different rules between the programs. This analysis first calculates Medicaid HIU and classifies anyone who meets Medicaid eligibility into that category (including most individuals below 138% FPL in the Medicaid expansion states). We then calculate Marketplace HIU; anyone meeting subsidy eligibility is grouped into that category (above Medicaid and also above 100% FPL up to 400% FPL for most individuals). This approach follows the eligibility rules in the ACA, which specify that people are eligible for tax credits only if they are ineligible for Medicaid.\nSteps in Calculating KFF-HIUS\nBefore we group people into HIUs, we first calculate annual MAGI for each respondent. We compare each person’s income to IRS filing requirements for being a tax filer7 and for being a qualifying relative claimed by someone else.8\nWe then group people into HIUs. We begin this process by grouping everyone within a household who is related into “cohabitating families.” Cohabitating families include all family relations; they also include unmarried cohabitating partners and relatives of each cohabitating partner.\nWithin each cohabitating family, we assess whether any individual is eligible to claim any other individual as a tax dependent. People are eligible to claim others as tax dependents if their income is above the IRS filing threshold for a head of household or, if married, for a married couple. People are eligible to be claimed by others if (a) they are a child (under age 19 or, for tax credits, 23 if a full-time student), and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income, or (b) they are below the limit to be a tax filer, have income below the qualifying relative limit, and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income. Within each cohabitating family, we assess who is likely to claim whom, using the assumptions that:\n- People who are claimed by others are more likely to be claimed by close relatives (e.g., a parent) than by others (e.g., a grandparent).\n- Married couples (who file) file jointly\n- If more than one person in a cohabitating family is eligible to claim others within that cohabitating family, the wealthiest person claims the eligible dependents.\nOnce we determine who within the cohabitating family is likely to claim each other, we know the HIU size and are able to apply income rules for the HIU. We apply Medicaid and Marketplace rules for whose income counts in calculating Medicaid HIUs and Marketplace HIUs, respectively.9 People who are filers but are not eligible to claim someone else or to be claimed by someone else are an HIU of 1. People who are not filers and are not claimed by filers have their HIU size and income counted according to Medicaid non-filer rules.10\nInflation Factors\nIn order to determine ACA eligibility during calendar year 2023, we compared tax filing unit income against the most current premiums available, for open enrollment 2025.11 We relied on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI), Private Wages and Salaries to inflate the income of each HIU by approximately 8.0% to align 2023 incomes to 2025 premiums.12 Since most state Medicaid eligibility determinations through the MAGI pathway are calculated as a percent of HHS Poverty Guidelines for that year and not a fixed dollar amount, inflation was not necessary to assess the Medicaid eligibility of individuals.\nAfter inflating 2023 tax filing unit incomes to match 2025 premiums, we similarly inflated 2023 IRS thresholds for both filing requirements13 and for qualifying relative tests14 by the same factor so that these thresholds aligned with the inflated income amounts.\nLimitations\nAs with any analysis, there are some limitations to our approach due to the level of detail that we can obtain from available survey data. Key limitations to bear in mind include:\n- We currently are not able to appropriately group anyone who lives outside the household with a household that claims them as a tax dependent. For example, we are not able to connect students living away from home or children with a non-custodial parent with the people who may be claiming them (and whose income should count to their HIU). We are also not able to determine married people who file separately.\n- To group people into tax filing units, we have to make assumptions about how people are likely to file their taxes. We assume that tax filers claim qualifying relatives they are able to claim. We make this assumption based on the fact that Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility rules are determined not by who is actually claimed on the tax return but by who is allowed to be claimed. However, people may sort themselves into different tax filing units than we estimate.\nTechnical Appendix B: Immigration Status Imputation\nTo impute documentation status, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. al..15 ,16 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample.17 We apply the model to a second data source, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center.18 Below we describe how we developed the regression model and applied it to the American Community Survey (ACS). We also describe how the model may be applied to other data sets. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nData Sources\nWe used the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants l data to build the regression model. The 2023 Survey of Immigrants dataset contains questions on citizenship and legal status at the person level. The KFF/LA Time Survey of Immigrants19 is a probability-based survey exploring the immigrant experience in the U.S. and draws on three different sampling frames including an address-based sample (ABS), a random digit dial (RDD) sample of pre-paid cell phone numbers, and callbacks to an RDD sample in which the individual did not speak English or Spanish. The survey includes interviews with 3,358 immigrant adults and was offered in ten different languages.\nThe regression model is designed to be applied to other datasets in order to impute legal immigration status in surveys that do not ask about migration status. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to either the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Core files, ACS, or the Current Population Survey (CPS). Because the SIPP Core file contains different survey questions and variable specifications from the ACS and CPS, we create unique regression models to apply the model to each dataset. For the analysis underlying this brief and other KFF estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, we apply the regression model to the 2013 ACS and then each subsequent year of the ACS.\nDue to underreporting of legal immigration status in survey datasets, in imputing immigration status we control to state and national-level estimates of the total undocumented population and also the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. Pew reports these estimates for all states and the District of Columbia.20\nConstruction of Regression Model\nWe use the 2023 Survey of Immigrants to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a potential unauthorized immigrant. The dependent variable is constructed based on the following factors:\n- Respondent was not a United States (US) citizen,\n- Respondent did not have permanent resident status or a valid work or student visa, , and\n- Respondent does not have other indicators that imply legal status.21\nWe use the following independent variables to predict unauthorized immigrant status:\n- Year of US entry,\n- Job industry classification,\n- State of residence,\n- Household Income,\n- Ownership or rental of residence,\n- Number of occupants in the household (< or >= six occupants),\n- Whether all household occupants are related,\n- Health insurance coverage status,\n- Sex, and\n- Ethnicity.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents who could not be considered unauthorized. People who could not be considered unauthorized include people who are US citizens or have other indicators that imply legal status.\nImputing Unauthorized Immigrants in Other Datasets\nWe use the Pew estimates as targets for the total number of unauthorized immigrants that the imputation generates. We first apply this strategy to the 2013 ACS, which contains health insurance information prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions. We stratify the targets by state and the District of Columbia and by participation in the labor force. We impute immigration status within each of these 102 strata.22\nTo generate the imputed immigration status variable, we first calculated the probability that each person in the dataset was unauthorized based on the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model. Next, we isolated the dataset to each individual stratum described above. Within each stratum, we sampled the data using the probability of being unauthorized for each person. After sampling, we summed the person weights until reaching the Pew population estimate for each stratum. The records that fell within the Pew population estimate were considered to be unauthorized immigrants. We repeated the process of sampling using the probability of being unauthorized and subsequently summing the person weights to reach Pew targets five times, creating five different unauthorized variables per record. These five imputed authorization status variables were then incorporated into a standard multiple imputation algorithm, closely matching the imputed variable analysis techniques used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the National Health Interview Survey.23\nWe used this first pass on the ACS 2013 to inform our sampling targets for the latest available microdata (ACS 2023). Looking at the results of our undocumented imputation on the ACS 2013, we calculated the share of undocumented immigrants lacking health insurance within each of those 102 strata prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions and transferred that information into a new dimension of sampling strata for the ACS 2023. We split each of the 102 sampling strata used on the pre-ACA ACS 2013 into uninsured versus insured categories, resulting in 204 sampling strata for subsequent years. We then repeated our imputation on the ACS 2023 with the newly-divided strata, allowing for a small decline in the undocumented uninsured rate based off of the percent drop in the uninsured rate among citizens.24\nTo easily apply the regression model to other data sets, we created a function that applies this approach to a chosen data set. The function first loads the dataset of choice, then standardizes the data to match the independent variables from the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model, and finally applies the multiple imputation to generate a variable for legal immigration status.\nTechnical Appendix C: Imputation Of Offer Of Employer-sponsored Insurance\nAn integral part of determining ACA eligibility is assessing whether workers without employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) hold an offer through their workplace that they decline to take up. In most cases, an affordable offer of ESI disqualifies members of the tax filing unit of the worker from receiving subsidized coverage on the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace. The American Community Survey (ACS) does not ask about employer offers of ESI; however, the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) includes questions about whether each worker received an offer of ESI from his or her employer at the time of interview. We use the CPS-ASEC offer of ESI variable to inform a regression-based multiple imputation of whether each tax filing unit constructed in the ACS had at least one offer at work, and also assess affordability for the employee and, separately, for any potential dependents within the unit. Since the health insurance coverage variables available in the CPS-ASEC 2024 capture sources of coverage at any point during calendar year 2023 (versus at the time of survey, as with the offer rate variable), a subset of sampled individuals had a change in their employer-based coverage status across the two distinct time periods.25 Therefore, among workers who potentially experienced a shift in offer status across the two time periods, we recoded or imputed offer rates in 2023 using the offer status in 2024. After constructing this revised offer variable for workers in CPS, we aggregated the results at the tax filing unit level to create a prediction model to apply to the ACS. Below we describe these recodes and imputation. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nRecoding and Imputing Offer Rate Data in the CPS\nAs a first step in our analysis, we divided CPS-ASEC survey respondents into five distinct groups:\n- All individuals who did not work during 2023 and also did not hold an offer of ESI in 2024 were assumed not to have an offer in 2023.\n- All individuals who reported being an ESI policyholder (that is, anyone reporting having taken-up their offer of ESI) during 2023 and also reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were assumed to have an offer in 2023.\n- All workers in 2023 who held their own ESI policies during 2023 but then reported not holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- All non-workers during 2023 who reported holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as not holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- Some workers during 2023 who did not report being ESI policyholders but did report holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were imputed to not have an offer of ESI during 2023.\nFor many groups, including those in groups (1) and (2) listed above, the offer status did not change across the two time periods. In contrast, we recoded offer status for people in groups (3) and (4): every non-offered worker in group (3), which includes people who held ESI policies in their own name in 2023, were considered to have an offer of ESI in 2023, and offered workers in group (4), which includes people who did not work themselves in 2023, were considered to not have their offer of ESI in 2023. Last, we implemented a probability-based random sample imputation of offers of ESI for people in group (5), described in more detail below. Only a subset of the group was re-coded from holding an offer in 2024 to not holding an offer in 2023.The number of workers selected from this population was equal to the population size of (3) subtracted by the population size of (4), thereby assuming an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the period.\nImputing Offer Rates for CPS Respondents with Ambiguous Offer Rate Status\nThe CPS-ASEC worker-level regression model was designed to be applied to a single dataset where ESI offer status is known at one point in time but not another. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC) (for years 2014 on). For the analysis underlying KFF’s current estimates of ACA eligibility, we apply the regression model to workers in the 2024 CPS-ASEC.\nWe use the 2024 point-in-time worker offer variable provided by the US Census Bureau26 to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a recipient of an offer of employer-sponsored insurance at his or her workplace in early 2024. The dependent variable was constructed at the worker-level based on individuals not holding their own ESI policy at time of interview and also reporting an ESI offer or eligibility to be covered that was then voluntarily declined.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status in 2023 among workers not covered by their own ESI during both 2023 and early 2024 but potentially holding an offer of ESI in 2023:\n- Any public coverage,\n- Any nongroup coverage,\n- Worker earnings among all jobs,\n- Full-time versus part-time status,\n- Age of worker,\n- Work within the construction industry.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents already covered by their own ESI and also to remove non-workers. Since this imputation does not account for the affordability of the offer or whether it meets the minimum value test, we included an assumption that workers in tax filing units with a MAGI below 250% FPL do not hold affordable offers of ESI and therefore might be eligible to purchase subsidized coverage on the Exchanges.27\nAs mentioned above, we assume an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the two time periods. We determined the needed size of the population to impute by subtracting the population of (4) from the population of (3) to ensure an equivalent number of offers were gained and lost. This left only workers who reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024, since (3) represented a larger count of workers than (4). We then calculated the probability that each worker in the dataset was offered ESI during calendar year 2023 based on our 2024 CPS-ASEC regression model. Next, we selected workers within the potential population (5) using the sampling probabilities resultant from our model.\nConstruction and Application of ACS Regression Model\nFor the analysis underlying KFF estimates of ACA eligibility, we construct a prediction model of having an offer of ESI using the 2024 CPS-ASEC and then apply this regression to tax filing units in the 2023 ACS to estimate who has an ESI offer in ACS.\nWe aggregate the worker offer variables constructed the 2024 CPS-ASEC as described above to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies each tax filing unit as either holding or not holding an affordable offer of employer-sponsored insurance.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status among tax filing units:\n- Any senior citizen in the household,\n- Oldest member of the tax-filing unit,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has employer-sponsored insurance coverage,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has nongroup coverage,\n- Any uninsured individuals in the tax filing unit,\n- Share of adults working full-time and part-time, and\n- Highest worker earnings.\nSince the imputation of documentation status (discussed in Technical Appendix B) required a multiply-imputed approach, this secondary imputation and subsequent worker sampling was only conducted once per implicate, keeping the number of ACS implicates to five.\nEndnotes\n- State Health Access Data Assistance Center. 2013. “State Estimates of the Low-income Uninsured Not Eligible for the ACA Medicaid Expansion.” Issue Brief #35.

We are unable to assess disability status in the ACS sufficiently to model eligibility under these pathways. However, previous research indicates high current participation rates among individuals with disabilities (largely due to the automatic link between SSI and Medicaid in most states, see Kenney GM, V Lynch, J Haley, and M Huntress. “Variation in Medicaid Eligibility and Participation among Adults: Implications for the Affordable Care Act.” Inquiry. 49:231-53 (Fall 2012)), indicating that there may be a small number of eligible uninsured individuals in this group. Further, many of these pathways (with the exception of SSI, which automatically links an individual to Medicaid in most states) are optional for states, and eligibility in states not implementing the ACA expansion is limited. ↩︎\n- Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas, and Matthew Sobek.

We allow the undocumented rate to drop slightly after 2013. We base the percent drop in the uninsured rate among the undocumented on the drop for citizens (half the scale of the drop for citizens) each year until 2023, resulting in the final undocumented uninsured rate of 51% in calendar year 2023. Prior to implementing this new sampling dimension, we found unrealistic drops in the uninsured rate of the undocumented population that we largely attributed to our prediction model’s inability to discern this group from legally-present non-citizens, many of whom are eligible for assistance under the ACA’s coverage expansions. Although a few states have implemented programs that allow for coverage of the undocumented population, these programs are state-funded and relatively small in scale compared to the nationwide coverage expansions accompanying the ACA. ↩︎\n- For example, anyone who did not work during 2023 who then held an offer of ESI in early 2024 would appear incongruous in our CPS-based eligibility model. In the other direction, workers covered by health insurance through their own employer in 2023 who lost their offer of ESI during the early months of 2024 (perhaps due to a job change) would also appear incongruous due to the discrepancy across the two time periods. ↩︎\n- Available at: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/health-insurance/cps-asec-research-files.html.

Taxes were high, unemployment was high, interest rates were high, and the national spirit was low.\n\"A Healthy, Vigorous, Growing Economy\"\nTo reverse the economic climate of the time, President Reagan put forth an economic policy which aimed to reduce government regulation, lower taxes, and promote free-market capitalism as a means to stimulate economic growth and increase individual wealth.\nBringing America back was the new President’s top priority and he shared his vision in his Inaugural Address. Watch President Reagan's Inaugural Address below.\nPresident Reagan's Inaugural Address\nThe Foundation For A Path Forward\nPresident Reagan earned a degree in Economics at Eureka college, and even though he would sometimes joke about “two economists having three opinions,” he knew what needed to be done and how to do it.\nHe consistently advocated for a straightforward and simple, yet detailed plan during his campaign: cut taxes, get control of government spending, and get the government out of the way so that the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people could be unleashed.\nDespite skeptics labeling his plan as \"Reaganomics,\" President Reagan remained resolute, recognizing that empowering individuals with financial resources and investment incentives would lead to job creation, inflation control, and reduced interest rates.\nPassing Legislation and Putting The Economy Back On Track\nAlmost as soon as the Inaugural ceremony was over, President Reagan set his sights on Capitol Hill. From day one, he and his team worked tirelessly to get Congress to pass legislation to put the economy back on track.\nEven a near-fatal assassination attempt did not slow him down. While still recovering, he summoned Congressional leaders to the White House to twist their arms. Ronald Reagan may have been the first President to wear pajamas to a meeting with the bipartisan Congressional leadership. He wanted them to know he meant business.\nHis efforts paid off. In August 1981, President Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which brought reductions in individual income tax rates, the expensing of depreciable property, incentives for small businesses, and incentives for savings.\nSo began the Reagan Recovery and a few years later, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 brought the lowest individual and corporate income tax rates of any major industrialized country in the world.\nThe Numbers Tell the Story\nOver eight years the Reagan Administration achieved the following:\n20 million new jobs were created\nThe combination of tax cuts and deregulation was a catalyst for economic growth and job creation. Several industries experienced expansion, including finance, technology, and manufacturing. During this expansion, business had more capital and flexibility, which led to job creation.\nInflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 4.1% by 1988\nThrough fiscal restraint, reduced government spending, tax reforms, deregulation, and economic growth, the decline in inflation helped create a more stable economy, boosting business confidence and investment.\nUnemployment fell from 7.6% to 5.5%\nAs President Reagan's policies were implemented, economic growth began to take off. This favorable economic environment allowed businesses to thrive and expand, thus creating more jobs and lowering unemployment.\nNet worth of families earning between $20,000 and $50,000 annually grew by 27%\nEconomic expansion, tax cuts, and job growth were primarily drivers of increasing the net worth of families earning between $20,000 and $50,000. Also contributing to this growth was asset appreciation and inflation moderation.\nReal gross national product rose 26%\nAs Reagan's economic policies began taking off this ultimately led to a substantial rise in Gross National Product (GNP), reflecting increased productivity, business expansion, and investment.\nThe prime interest rate was reduced to 10% by August, 1988\nThe Reagan administration slashed the prime interest rate by more than half, from an unprecedented 21.5% in January 1981 to 10% in August 1988. This achievement stemmed from the administration’s shift in monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth.\nBy The Numbers\nThe First Hand Results of the Reagan Recovery\n$9,000 Reagan tax cuts saved the median-income two-earner American family of four close to $9,000 in taxes\n25%Employment of African-Americans rose by more than 25% between 1982 and 1988\n50%More than half of the new jobs created went to women\n1%Government spending growth dropped from 10% in 1982 to just over 1% in 1987\n10+ YearsAfter adjusting for inflation, federal spending actually decreased for the first time in over a decade\nThe American Miracle\nSo impressive was the Reagan Recovery that at the G7 Economic Summit in 1983, when it was obvious the President’s plan was working, the West German Chancellor asked him to “tell us about the American miracle.\" That was quite a turnaround from two years earlier, when President Reagan outlined his economic recovery plan to an unconvinced group of world leaders.\nNow, however, they all wanted to know how he did it, so he told them: reducing tax rates restored the incentive to produce and create jobs, and getting government out of the way allowed people to be entrepreneurs. From there, the free marketplace operated as it was supposed to.\nThe American Dream Restored\nAs President Reagan observed with a wry smile, “I could tell our economic program was working when they stopped calling it Reaganomics.” But what really pleased him most about the Reagan Recovery was not the vindication or all the impressive statistics. To him, the success of Reaganomics was what it brought to the American people.\nMillions had good jobs and were able to keep more of the money for which they worked so hard. Families could reliably plan a budget and pay their bills. The seemingly insatiable Federal government was on a much-needed diet. And businesses and individual entrepreneurs were no longer hassled by their government, or paralyzed by burdensome and unnecessary regulations every time they wanted to expand.\nIn a phrase, the American dream had been restored.\n“This Administration’s objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy...”\nJanuary 20, 1981\nThis Administration’s objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this ’new beginning,’ and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.\n— Excerpted from Inaugural Address\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Jobs created during U.S. presidential terms\nPoliticians and pundits frequently refer to the ability of the president of the United States to \"create jobs\" in the U.S. during his term in office.[1] The numbers are most often seen during the election season or in regard to a president's economic legacy. The numbers typically used and most frequently cited by economists are total nonfarm payroll employment numbers as collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a monthly and annual basis. The BLS also provides numbers for private-sector non-farm employment and other subsets of the aggregate.\nAmong the presidents from Jimmy Carter to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton created the most jobs at 22.9 million, while Ronald Reagan had the largest cumulative percentage increase in jobs at 15.6%. This computation treats the base month as the December before the month of inauguration and last month as December of the final full year in office.[2] Using the month after inauguration as the base month as shown in the accompanying diagram, the top four (out of these seven) presidents in terms of cumulative job creation percentage are Clinton (D), Reagan (R), Carter (D), and Obama (D).[3]\nMethodology\n[edit]The jobs numbers are reported as part of the \"Monthly Employment Situation Report\" from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The widely publicized \"job creation\" number is a net figure, computed as jobs created less jobs lost during the survey month. Estimates are generated via the \"Establishment Survey\", also known as the payroll survey or Current Employment Statistics (CES) program. The Establishment Survey as of May 2020 included \"approximately 145,000 businesses and government agencies representing approximately 697,000 worksites.\" The Establishment Survey publishes jobs, hours, and earnings estimates at varying levels of detail (nation, state, metro area) and for different industries.[4]\nThe sample establishments are drawn from private non-farm businesses such as factories, offices, and stores, as well as federal, state, and local government entities. Employees on non-farm payrolls are those who received pay for any part of the reference pay period (which includes the 12th of the month), including persons on paid leave. Further, BLS explains that: \"The CES employment series are estimates of nonfarm wage and salary jobs, not an estimate of employed persons; an individual with two jobs is counted twice by the payroll survey. The CES employment series excludes employees in agriculture, private households, and the self-employed.\" These monthly job counts are revised (sometimes by 20% or more) within 90 days to reflect additional data, seasonal adjustment models, and annual adjustments resulting from unemployment insurance filings. Figures are seasonally adjusted, which removes from the series the effects of normal variation from recurring events within a year, such as holidays and weather changes, and helps reveal underlying economic trends.[4]\nJournalist Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post explained in 2020 that economists debate which month to use as the base for counting job creation, between either January of the first term (the month of inauguration) or February. Survey data is typically from around the twelfth of the month, so January numbers are counted before the new president takes office. For that reason, The Washington Post uses the February jobs level as the starting point. For example, for President Obama, the computation takes the 145.815 million jobs of February 2017 and subtracts the 133.312 million jobs of February 2009 to arrive at the 12.503 million figure. Four of the top five presidents in terms of total jobs added were Democrats. For these 13 presidents beginning with Truman, total job creation was 2.4 times faster under Democrats, 70.5 million for the seven Democratic presidents and 29.1 million for the six Republican presidents. The Democratic presidents were in office for a total of 429 months, with 164,000 jobs per month added on average, while the Republicans were in office for 475 months, with a 61,000 jobs added per month average. The table below summarizes the results for the past seven presidents, with data through January 2021 for President Trump:[5]\n| Job creation by president | Carter | Reagan | G.H.W.

Well, thank you all, and it's good to see Jim and Delcie Ann Supica here. And it's a pleasure to welcome all of you here today, especially since we see so many familiar faces. Before I get into my remarks, however, I have something in the nature of a bulletin that I would like to impose on you.\nEarlier today our Navy made a measured response to Iran's latest use of military force against U.S. ships in international waters, as well as its continued military and terrorist attacks against a number of nonbelligerents. Following the destruction of the two Iranian military platforms, whose personnel evacuated after our warning, several Iran naval vessels and small boats attempted to engage our ships and aircraft. Three Iranian naval vessels and at least two small boats were sunk or very severely damaged.\nWe've taken this action to make certain the Iranians have no illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior. We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke it. They must know that we will protect our ships, and if they threaten us, they'll pay a price. A more normal relationship with Iran is desirable, and we're prepared for it. But such a relationship is not possible so long as Iran attacks neutral ships, threatens its neighbors, supports terrorism, and refuses to end the bloody war with Iraq.\nNow I'll get on with the business of the day. I was looking over my notes from our last meeting, back in 1986, and I noticed that I told you about one of my first jobs as a young man, working for a contractor who was remodeling old homes. I was just 14 years old -- by the way, it's not true that the homes that we were remodeling were log cabins. [Laughter] As I say, I was just 14 years old; and as I told you, by the time the summer was over, I'd dug out foundations, laid hardwood floors, shingled roofs, and learned a respect for good, honest labor that has stayed with me all my life. But my notes show that I never did tell you just how it was that I left that construction work.\nWell, it was on that summer job -- this time digging trenches for foundations. And one hot morning I was swinging my pickax, working away, swinging and digging. It so happened that I had the pick up over my head, ready to bring it down in another blow, when the noon whistle blew. And I just stepped out from under the pickax and didn't finish the blow -- it was after 12 o'clock -- and walked out from under it. And right behind me, I heard some words that my mother had told me never to use. [Laughter] I turned around, and there was my boss, standing there, with the point of the pick stuck in the ground right between his feet -- I missed him by about a half an inch. And although I can't say for certain, looking back, but I have the feeling that it may have been at that moment, looking into his face, that I first entertained the thoughts of going into show business. [Laughter]\nBut it is indeed a pleasure to have you here, and I wanted to speak to you today in large measure to give you my thanks. You're the ones, after all, who build our roads and put up our buildings, who do so much to help keep America growing. And as President, I extend to you the respect and gratitude of the Nation. But more than that, I owe you, as well, a personal debt of gratitude, for you've done much to make this administration a success.\nI referred a moment ago to our meeting in '86. But there was an earlier meeting as well, all the way back in 1981. I asked you then to support our economic recovery program. You did so, even though in the short term many of your firms went through some tough times. But you knew that in the end it was free enterprise, not government regulation, not high taxes or big government spending, but free enterprise, that had led to the building of a great America. And I like to point out that the Federal Register, which lists all new regulations, is just a little more than half the size it was when we came here. The estimate is that we eliminated for our citizens and small businesses some 600 million man-hours a year of work just filling out government forms in answer to the regulations. You knew that what America needed as she entered the 1980's was a new birth of economic freedom.\nAs I said, it was tough at first for some of you, very tough. But today the American economy is in the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history. Indeed, this month, April, marks the 65th straight month of economic growth. We've created nearly 16 million new jobs -- jobs that on balance are better and higher paying. Altogether, the United States has created close to twice as many new jobs as the other leading industrialized nations combined. During this expansion, a greater percentage of our population is employed than at any other time in our history: 62.3 percent of our total potential employment pool is currently at work. Now, maybe you might be like me; I didn't know at first how they figured what was the potential employment pool. And a little over 60 percent of that doesn't sound so well if you're thinking of the entire population. Well, I found out that that potential pool is everyone, male and female, from 16 years of age up, including all the retirees and the people on Social Security, all the kids that are still going to school and not looking for jobs and so forth. And so, that is 62.3 percent -- the highest percentage ever in the history of the United States -- have jobs.\nAnd the real income of the average American has been rising steadily for the last 6 years. Even areas of our economy that were long thought to be in special trouble have begun to show signs of new creativity and prosperity. As Business Week magazine reported recently: ``Basic manufacturers, once considered a dying breed, are selling products many thought wouldn't even be made in the United States any longer -- escalators to Taiwan, machine tools to West Germany, lumber to Japan, and shoes to Italy.'' Since the third quarter of 1986, the volume of American goods exported has been growing some four times as fast as the value [volume] of imported goods. And since 1980 U.S. manufacturing has increased productivity roughly 3\\1/2\\ times as fast as in the previous 7 years. The result is that, as one German manufacturing expert put it recently, the United States is \"the best country in the world in terms of manufacturing costs.''\nAnd of course your own industry, too, has grown with the new prosperity. Between 1980 and 1987, total new construction grew 24 percent, for an average annual rate of 3.1 percent. The nonresidential sector grew by 4 percent annually, with an overall growth rate of 32 percent. That's not bad, not bad at all.\nThe American construction industry is not only prospering here in the United States, it also faces new opportunities abroad because the Japanese Government has announced a large-scale public works program. And Japan, in particular, offers vast potential for American construction firms. Just last month we reached an agreement with Japan that will permit American companies to bid, for the first time, on major Japanese construction projects, giving them a much-needed foothold in this important market. Since American construction firms are the most experienced and competitive in the world, I challenge you to take full advantage of this opportunity. Government can create opportunities by knocking down unfair barriers, but businesses themselves must follow through with the proposals, creativity, and workmanship that made America the leader in this field.\nAnd because we've opened up the economy, lowered tax rates, and restored the ideal of limited government and free enterprise -- for all these reasons, America today stands poised for even greater economic growth in the year ahead. But even as we celebrate all that we have accomplished, we must acknowledge that hanging over the future are some enormous ifs. If we keep tax rates down, economic incentives will remain strong. If we get government spending under control, the private sector can continue to grow without fear that it will become crowded out by the public sector. If we continue to combat needless regulations, we can keep the economy from suffocating beneath redtape. If -- and I know this is an issue that especially concerns you -- if we prevent government from mandating additional costs on business. And so, the ifs continue -- on and on and on.\nNow, I'm not about to launch into a campaign speech; there will be enough for that in the days to come. I could mention, however, that some of the campaign speeches I've been hearing must have been living in another country for the last few years, not this one. [Laughter] In any event, my main purpose in speaking to you today has been, as I said, to offer you my thanks. But more than we owe each other thanks, we owe gratitude to this great land of opportunity and freedom, thanks that we must never cease to repay by remaining active in the political life of the nation. For to be sure, America will face choices this fall that will determine perhaps the entire economic course of the coming decade. Will it be economic growth or the growth of big government? Will it be free enterprise or the steady erosion of free enterprise by an ever-expanding Federal bureaucracy?\nAnd so, I ask each of you to direct some of your talent, energy, and leadership in the coming months to the choices that lie before us. And I know somewhere in your minds there's probably a voice saying, but I'm a contractor, not a politician. Well, there was a time -- it's getting to be quite a while ago, now -- but there was a time when I wondered just how involved I should become in public affairs. I'll never forget the reaction of my old boss at Warner Brothers, Jack Warner, when he first heard that I was running for Governor of California. He said, ``Oh, no, no. Jimmy Stewart for Governor, Reagan for best friend.'' [Laughter] And then there was the time back in the early days of the picture business when Jack Warner's brother Harry was first told about the development of motion picture sound -- talking pictures. Harry's reaction was one that I was often reminded of during my early days in public life. He said simply, ``Who the heck wants to hear actors talk?'' [Laughter]\nBut of course I'm not asking you to become professional politicians, merely to remain engaged in the life of the Nation -- as engaged as you've been so successfully during these past 7\\1/2\\ years. The choice is simple: Is big government going to grow, or is your economy going to grow? And so, I thank you one last time for all you've done. And I say to you as well, we can't afford to rest. We must keep America strong -- strong and growing.\nNow I'm going to do something here to finish that I hadn't really planned on doing. But talking about the difference between government and the private sector -- the greatest example we have of that, of course, is the Soviet Union. And I have a new hobby. I collect stories, jokes that I can prove are told between the Russian people, that they tell. They reveal that if we ever got to know them we'd find they have a great sense of humor. Also, they have a pretty cynical attitude about their government.\nNow, one example is a story they tell -- you know, you have to wait 10 years there for delivery after you order an automobile. And so, a fellow had finally gotten the money together and was going to buy an automobile -- only about one out of seven families have them in that country -- and he went through all the paperwork and everything and finally signed the last paper, laid down his money. And then the man behind the counter said, \"Come back in 10 years and get your automobile.'' And the man said, \"Morning or afternoon?'' [Laughter] And -- wait, wait. The fellow behind the counter says, \"Well, what difference does it make 10 years from now?'' And he said, ``Well, the plumber is coming in the morning.'' [Laughter] I've thought about, but haven't gotten around to, telling that to Gorbachev in our next meeting. [Laughter]\nWell, thank you all, and God bless you all.\nMr. Supica. Mr. President, the construction industry loves you and salutes you because you have restored and expanded the faith, the hope that was so badly needed to keep this nation great. You know America to its deep heart's core. You have stayed closely in touch with the hearts and the minds and the souls of Americans. In 1981 AGC named you our man of the year. You have always been our man of the hour, sir. Today, Mr. President, you honor us again.\nNow, Mr. President, in our own special way, we want to honor you. Like the great American eagles that soar over this great nation, well, you have aspired to a better and stronger America and a safer world. And you, sir, have led the way. As a small gesture of the construction industry's regards for you, our nation's number one builder, I have the privilege of presenting you the Associated General Contractors of America's Eagle Award. May God bless you, Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, and God bless America. Thank you very much.\nThe President. Thank you very much. I am honored, greatly honored. I thank you all very much. I'm going to impose on you for just a second. I am going to tell you one of those Russian stories that I did tell to Gorbachev. [Laughter] In view of your remarks -- Russian and American, they have a lot of stories of that kind -- arguing about our two countries. The American said, ``Look, I can walk into the Oval Office. I can pound the President's desk, and I can say, `Mr. President, I don't like the way you are running our country.''' And the Russian said, \"I can do that.'' The American said, ``You can?'' He said, ``Yes, I can go into the Kremlin to the General Secretary's office, pound his desk, and say, `Mr. General Secretary, I don't like the way President Reagan's running his country.''[Laughter]\nNote: The President spoke at 1:52 p.m. in Room 450 of the Old Executive Office Building. In his opening remarks, he referred to Mr. and Mrs. James W. Supica. Mr. Supica was president of the Associated General Contractors of America.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It is owned and operated by the Chickasaw Nation. The casino opened as the WinStar Casinos in 2004, and was expanded (with a 395-room hotel tower) and renamed WinStar World Casino in 2009; its 370,000 square feet (34,000 m2) of casino floor made it the world's largest casino.[1] In August 2013, WinStar Resorts completed a major expansion project, which added a new 1000-room second hotel tower that was divided into two phases; this also added a new casino that is attached to the tower. As a result of the completion of this expansion, the casino overtook Foxwoods Resort Casino to become the largest casino in the United States and one of the largest in the world based on gaming floor space. WinStar has over 10,000 electronic games, a 55-table poker room, 100 total table games including craps and roulette, Racer's off-track betting,[2] and multiple high limit rooms.[3]\nLocation and history\n[edit]WinStar World Casino and Resort is located about 120 miles south from the Oklahoma City metropolitan area and one hour north of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and attracts many people from the North Texas region as well as Oklahoma residents. The casino's 6,500[4] seat Global Event Center has been home to some popular entertainment attractions including Jay Leno, Vince Gill, Adam Lambert, Weezer, Lil Wayne, ZZ Top, Maroon 5, Kid Rock, Tony Bennett, and Davy Jones, who gave his final concert at WinStar on February 19, 2012.[5][6][7][8][9][10][excessive citations]\nWinStar World Casino and Resort is the biggest casino in the United States, in terms of the total number of table games and gaming machines, according to many gambling blogs and casino directories.[11][12][13]\nThe casino closed temporarily between March 16 to March 31, 2020, due to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic as announced by Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby.[14] The casino was closed throughout the remainder of April 2020.[15] The casino reopened in May 2020, with restrictive guidelines.[16]\nDesign\n[edit]WinStar was conceived by noted designer Larry E. Seitz whose work includes Sands Casinos, Trump Taj Mahal, Grand Casinos in Mississippi, Barona Casino, Buffalo Run, Chisholm Trail, Grand Princess, SS Norway, Casino Panama, Costa Rica Casino, Stellaris Casino Aruba, and the Paradise Island Casino among others.[citation needed] Additionally Hotels created for the brands Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton, Marriott, Crowne Plaza, Melina, Loews Hotels, Holiday, Ramada, InterContinental, and independents worldwide.[citation needed] Restaurants and Clubs have been produced internationally. [citation needed] Special effects, commissioned art, and sculptures were constructed and implemented by Dallas-based ValueWorks and produced by their suppliers in the U.S. and around the world. [citation needed] The exterior of the building was detailed by Lyndon Stromberg, who also worked on The Venetian and the MGM Grand in Las Vegas as well as the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas and Planet Hollywood in New York City. [citation needed] The long façade exterior of WinStar World Casino features replicas of London's Parliament Building, Rome's Coliseum and the Arc de Triomphe from Paris.[17]\nHotel information\n[edit]WinStar World Casino Hotel includes three hotel towers and 1,399 rooms. On August 6, 2009, the original 395-room hotel tower held a grand opening celebration that featured performances by American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson and American rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. Meeting rooms that have varied capacities of 10-200 people, a resort-style pool with a custom-built waterfall grotto, the Spa at WinStar, ONYX Boutique and the Isle at WinStar gift shop. WinStar World Casino and Resort offers a variety of restaurants, many of which are open until late night hours, including Dallas Cowboys Bar & Grill. The second hotel tower, the Pool Tower North, opened in August 2013, while the third hotel tower, the Pool Tower South, opened in early 2014. Both towers have a capacity of 500 rooms each and are adjacent to each other. The Inn at WinStar has 101 rooms, and is accessed from the casino and the RV park by a 24-hour shuttle service.\nThe playing of casino games and slots is restricted to those 18 years old and above.[18]\nOffsite areas\n[edit]WinStar Golf Club\n[edit]The WinStar Golf Club features two 18-hole championship golf courses designed by former PGA Tour Pro, D.A. Weibring. In addition, the WinStar Golf Academy, a 4,850-square-foot (451 m2) facility, offers private golf lessons.[19]\nWinStar RV Park\n[edit]The FunTown RV park at WinStar is a 200-space RV Park that is available to people visiting the casino. A shuttle service to the casino is available to guests in the RV Park.\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Lassek, P.J., \"What were the odds?\", Oklahoma Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities & Other Offbeat Stuff, p 30\n- ^ \"Casino City: WinStar World Casino\".

Whether you’re on the Texas-Oklahoma border, where everything bigger is better, or visiting the opulent tribal casinos in Connecticut, the biggest casinos in the US are more than just a place to gamble; they are a place to make all your dreams come true.\nFrom huge opulent poker rooms to thousands of slots, these supersized casinos are mini gambling towns in their own right.\nJoin us as we take a look at the top 10 largest real money casinos in America.\n1. Winstar: Thackerville, Oklahoma (600,000 Square feet)\nWords like stupendously large just don’t convey the immenseness that is the Winstar Casino. Located just minutes from the Texas border, Winstar isn’t just the largest casino in America, it’s the largest casino in the world.\nWith 600,000 square feet of gaming space, almost 9,000 slot machines, and over 150 table games, the Chickasaw Nation has built a phenomenal mousetrap for the 7.5 million people in the Dallas Fort Worth metro area.\nLike all of the mega-casinos on our list, they’ve made gambling the star attraction, but you shouldn’t overlook the world-class golf, spa, top-of-the-line concerts, and luxury dining and hotel experiences. If you can’t make it, however, check out our review of the Winstar Online Casino.\n2. Mohegan Sun: Uncasville, Connecticut (364,000 square feet)\nHuge casinos need a constant stream of players to continue to thrive. When the tribes began negotiating gaming compacts in Connecticut 30 years ago, it was obvious from the outset that, with more than twenty million people within a two-hour drive, these casinos would need to be big.\nWith 364,000 square feet of gaming, Mohegan Sun did not disappoint.\nMohegan Sun boasts 6,400 slots, over 350 table games, a state-of-the-art sportsbook, and stadium betting on baccarat and roulette.\nThe tribe didn’t scrimp on amenities, with hiking trails, golf, tennis, pickleball, and lots of other fun outdoor activities on offer. There are also countless restaurants and more than 1,500 hotel rooms to meet your needs.\n3. Foxwoods Casino Resort: Ledyard, Connecticut (340,000 square feet)\nFoxwoods is sort of the bookend to the Mohegan Sun property in that they are similar in their massive gaming square footage but only 13 miles apart.\nThe Mashantucket Pequot tribe has about 340,000 square feet of gaming space spread across six casinos within a casino. These are comprised of about 5,500 slots and 260 table games.\nFoxwoods is also known for its state-of-the-art shopping experience, with almost 100 high-end luxury shops on the property.\nIn addition to the 2,500 hotel rooms and the usual amenities like golf, the resort offers premier zip-lining and go-carting experiences that draw risk-takers of all ages.\n4. Yaamava Resort and Casino: Highland, California (290,000 square feet)\nRun by the San Manual band of Indians, the Yaamava casino story is one of almost constant growth and rebirth in the 40 years since it opened.\nThe casino currently boasts 290,000 square feet of gaming space, with more than 4,400 slot machines and 150 table games. While it only has 400 hotel rooms on the property, the nearby towns of San Bernadino or even Riverside have many overnight stay options.\nOther recent additions include a world-class 3,000-seat concert venue, which draws many LA-based bands when they are not on tour, along with a half dozen restaurants and some high-end retailers.\nWhile this resort doesn’t yet offer the amenities that many other properties with similar-sized gaming spaces on our list of the largest casinos in America do, it is in the heart of the Los Angeles metro area and a whole lot closer than the 4-hour trip to Vegas.\n5. Thunder Valley Casino: Lincoln, California (250,000 square feet)\nThis large American casino is operated in Northern California in a joint effort between the Miwuk and Maidu Indian tribes. It is located near Sacramento, California. The 250,000 square feet of gaming space is jampacked with 3,500 slots and 150 table games.\nThe hotel only has 400 rooms, and though there is a spa and entertainment venue that holds over 4,000 guests, the spotlight here is more on local play than driving tourist visits.\nThat being said, it is a beautiful property with plenty of dining options, and just about any game or slot you might wish to play.\n6. Hard Rock Tampa: Tampa, Florida (240,000 square feet)\nThe Hard Rock Tampa, on the other hand, is a true destination resort in the sun. Three pool areas total over 200,000 gallons of water, and one pool area alone has 60,000 square feet of swimming space. 700 lounge chairs, almost two dozen cabanas, and two DJ booth setups round out the poolside attractions.\nYou can choose from almost 900 hotel rooms and more than a dozen dining options, as well as hit their award-winning spa or top-tier concert tours. That’s before you try your luck at one of their 6,000 slots and 200 table games spread across a well-thought-out casino space of 240,000 square feet.\nThe Seminole Tribe bought out Hard Rock International at a bargain basement price in 2007, and now have cafes in more than 70 countries, an exclusive brand name to build on, and casino resorts in almost another dozen locations.\nThis means that your Unity tier card not only works in Tampa, but Atlantic City, and all the other Hard Rock locations, as well as the Mirage. That’s a big deal to people who like to use their tier points and comp credits at more than just one location, and gives the Seminoles the ability to cross-sell to various locations.\n7. River Wind Casino: Norman, Oklahoma (219,000 square feet)\nThe metro area of Norman, Oklahoma, is home to a surprising 1.4 million people, and the Chickasaw-owned River Winds Casino is there to meet all their gaming needs.\nIt has 2,700 slots, over 20 table games, and a 17-table poker room. Unlike some of the Tribal Casinos located a bit closer to the Dallas—Fort Worth area, the RiverWinds, despite its still very impressive 219,00 square feet of gaming space, is not a mega-resort. In fact, it only has 100 hotel rooms.\nThey do have partnerships with Panda Express, Burger King, and perennial favorite IHOP for a quick bite, or a buffet and a British Fish and Chips place for something a bit more upscale. Other amenities include a 1500-seat theater, and a gift shop located conveniently near the exit.\n8. Choctaw Casino: Durant, Oklahoma (219,000 square feet)\nIn its 219,000 square feet of gaming space, Choctaw Casino currently has over 7,000 slots, 120 tables, and a large poker room.\nBeing several hours from the Dallas-Fort Worth area and less than 30 minutes from the largest casino in the US (Winstar), this resort has taken a different look at amenities, creating not one but two huge nightclub/live concert venues, including a Gilley’s Road House.\nYou can also find over 20 restaurants, ranging from fine dining at Salt and Stone to Texas barbeque, which you’ll need to eat with your fingers.\nYou will find more than 1,700 hotel rooms, including Vegas-style suites, as well as amenities seldom seen at big US casinos like horse riding, fishing, bowling, hiking, and, of course, a world-class spa to relax in.\n9. River Spirit Casino: Tulsa, Oklahoma (212,000 square feet)\nSituated in the northeast corner of Oklahoma, the River Spirit Casino is near Tulsa, which boasts about 1 million people in its metro area. It can also draw people in from Kansas and Missouri who are looking for some casino excitement.\nThe Muskogee Tribe has 3,100 slots and about 70 table games in their 212,000 square feet of gaming space.\nThe tribe has added 483 luxury hotel rooms so far and is making plans for more. Their concert venue can host 2,500 guests and their restaurant choices number over a dozen. The amenity list includes a pool, and convention center.\n10. Encore Casino: Boston, Massachusetts (210,000 square feet)\nStrictly speaking, this casino, owned by the Wynn group, is located in Everett, MA, and is the only non-tribal casino to make our list of the 10 biggest casinos in America\nAt approximately 210,00 square feet of gaming space, it is still a massive space filled with 3,400 slots and over 160 table games. This integrated mega resort cost 2.6 billion to build in 2019.\nDeveloped on just 34 acres, this casino doesn’t feature many outdoor amenities due to space constraints, but it makes up for that in 5-star luxury that one would expect from any Wynn property.\nThe 671 hotel rooms are all lavishly appointed and designed to meet the needs of very discerning clients. There are thirteen restaurants and the entire property is almost a museum space as it is filled with millions in paintings and sculptures.\nA Round Up Of The Largest Casinos In America:\n- Winstar: Thackerville, Oklahoma (600,000 Square feet)\n- Mohegan Sun: Uncasville, Connecticut (364,000 square feet)\n- Foxwoods Casino Resort: Ledyard, Connecticut (340,000 square feet)\n- Yaamava Resort and Casino: Highland, California (290,000 square feet)\n- Thunder Valley Casino: Lincoln, California (250,000 square feet)\n- Hard Rock Tampa: Tampa, Florida (240,000 square feet)\n- River Wind Casino: Norman, Oklahoma (219,000 square feet)\n- Choctaw Casino: Durant, Oklahoma (219,000 square feet)\n- River Spirit Casino: Tulsa, Oklahoma (212,000 square feet)\n- Encore Casino: Boston, Massachusetts (210,000 square feet)\nThere are more than 1,000 casinos in the US, so it takes a true behemoth to make the biggest casinos in America shortlist.\nWith all of the casinos constantly expanding, this list may look very different in a few years, especially as new gaming legislation is passed in states like New York, where the population within a few hours’ drive is easily in the tens of millions.\nPerhaps, despite the intense competition in Las Vegas, someone will finally build a mega-resort that puts Sin City back on the top ten biggest list again. Combining the Wynn and Encore properties in Las Vegas only gets us to 195,000 square feet of gaming, so still a little room for improvement.\nWhile bigger isn’t always better, these casinos show the true diversity of gambling in America. From slot halls to five-star luxury, they cover the gamut of the American gambling experience and showcase the reach of gaming growth over the past several decades.\nFrom Norman Oklahoma to Boston, from Riverdale California to Tampa, casinos continue to thrive.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It was still very early into the U.S. occupation of Iraq, but the as-yet-unacknowledged (by Rummy, that is) insurgency was already out of control. Alone among his fellow GOP senators, McCain blasted Rumsfeld for not putting enough U.S. troops on the ground, and for resorting too soon to 'Iraqification' -- that is, transferring security to ill-prepared Iraqi forces. In an extraordinarily blunt speech at the Council on Foreign Relations that grim autumn, McCain warned that ultimately Iraq could become another Vietnam 'if we lose popular support in the United States.' The next day, the secretary of Defense asked McCain to breakfast. 'I read y our speech,' harrumphed Rumsfeld (that 'must have been an enjoyable experience for him,' McCain later joked to me). Then Rummy patiently explained to his fellow Republican why he and his top civilian brass (Paul Wolfowitz, Doug Feith and the usual crowd of incompetents) would continue to do things the same way. They 'believed there was no need for additional troops,' McCain later related. McCain had already realized that Rumsfeld was a lost cause. The real question, the senator suggested to me back then, was whether George W. Bush himself would push Rummy to make changes. 'I'd like to see the president fully engaged,' McCain said. Bush needed to be on top of 'more details of what's going on.' As we now know nearly four years later, McCain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in Iraq. Right down to the need for Bush to get engaged and fire Rumsfeld. McCain was so right that, among military experts today, the emerging conventional wisdom about Bush's current 'surg e' is that if it had occurred back then -- when McCain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years -- it might well have succeeded.\" (Michael Hirsh, \"Why McCain's Collapse Matters,\" Newsweek, 7/26/07)\nJohn McCain Voted Against The 2005 Bush-Cheney Energy Bill.

Even when women and men favor the same candidate, they may do so by different margins, resulting in a gender gap. In every presidential election since 1980, a gender gap has been apparent, with a greater proportion of women than men preferring the Democrat in each case. The magnitude of the gender gap has ranged in size from four to twelve points since 1980. The “women’s vote” is the percentage point advantage that one candidate has over the other among women voters- that is, the difference in support for the major party candidates among women voters only.\nIn every presidential election since 1996, a majority of women have preferred the Democratic candidate. Moreover, women and men have favored different candidates in presidential elections since 2000, with the exception of 2008 when men were almost equally divided in their preferences for Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. In 2024, a majority of women favored the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris while a majority of men voted for the Republican victor, Donald Trump.\nData illustrate that women are not a monolithic voting bloc. Across white, Black, Latinx, and Asian American voters, women are more likely than men to report voting for the Democratic candidate. However, a majority of white women have voted for the Republican candidate since the 2000 presidential election when white women were almost equally split between Democrat Al Gore and Republican victor, George W. Bush. In contrast, a large majority of Black, Latinx, and Asian women have supported the Democratic candidate for the entirety of the time period in which data disaggregated by gender and race has been available.\nMethodology and Sources:\nAll Edison and Voter News Service (previously known as Voter Research and Surveys) national exit poll data presented here for the years 1992-2024 is archived at Cornell University’s Roper Center. Edison/Voter News Service did not conduct national exit polls prior to 1992. All CBS/New York Times exit poll data from 1980, 1984, and 1988 is archived at Cornell University’s Roper Center. From 1980 to 1988 major media outlets conducted separate exit polls. While not presented here, exit polls conducted by ABC News/Washington Post and NBC News showed gender gaps of similar magnitude to those evident in the CBS/New York Times polls. In 2020, for the first time in nearly two decades, major media outlets relied on more than one election survey to analyze voter behavior in the presidential election: Edison Research’s national exit poll and the Associated Press’ VoteCast (conducted by NORC). In light of differences between these surveys and their sampling limitations, CAWP’s analyses of gender and voting behavior since 2020 consider trends across these surveys and findings from BSP Research (formerly Latino Decisions), recognized for its more sophisticated and robust sampling of racial minority voters and a methodology that includes greater respondent access to multi-lingual surveys than the Edison exit poll, and the Cooperative Election Study (CES).\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Together with amendments made to it by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[1][2][3][4] Most of the act remains in effect.\nThe ACA's major provisions came into force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured share of the population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered.[5][6] The law also enacted delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After it came into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.[7] The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and changes to individual insurance markets. Both received new spending, funded by a combination of new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports stated that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, that repealing ACA would increase the deficit,[8][9] and that the law reduced income inequality.[10]\nThe act largely retained the existing structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market, but individual markets were radically overhauled.[1][11] Insurers were made to accept all applicants without charging based on pre-existing conditions or demographic status (except age). To combat the resultant adverse selection, the act mandated that individuals buy insurance (or pay a monetary penalty) and that insurers cover a list of \"essential health benefits\". Young people were allowed to stay on their parents' insurance plans until they were 26 years old.\nBefore and after its enactment the ACA faced strong political opposition, calls for repeal, and legal challenges. In the Sebelius decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could choose not to participate in the law's Medicaid expansion, but otherwise upheld the law.[12] This led Republican-controlled states not to participate in Medicaid expansion. Polls initially found that a plurality of Americans opposed the act, although its individual provisions were generally more popular.[13] By 2017, the law had majority support.[14] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 set the individual mandate penalty at $0 starting in 2019.[15][16]\nProvisions\nACA amended the Public Health Service Act of 1944 and inserted new provisions on affordable care into Title 42 of the United States Code.[1][2][3][17][4] The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, and many of the law's regulations applied specifically to this market,[1] while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained.[2] Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system.[2]\nInsurance regulations: individual policies\nAll new individual major medical health insurance policies sold to individuals and families faced new requirements.[18] The requirements took effect on January 1, 2014. They include:\n- Guaranteed issue prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals because of preexisting conditions.[19]\n- States were required to ensure the availability of insurance for individual children who did not have coverage via their families.\n- A partial community rating allows premiums to vary only by age and location, regardless of preexisting conditions. Premiums for older applicants can be no more than three times those for the youngest.[20]\n- Essential health benefits must be provided. The National Academy of Medicine defines the law's \"essential health benefits\" as \"ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care\"[21][22] and others[23] rated Level A or B[24] by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.[25] In determining essential benefits, the law required that standard benefits should offer at least that of a \"typical employer plan\".[26] States may require additional services.[27]\n- Preventive care and screenings for women.[28] \"[A]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity\".[29] This mandate applies to all employers and educational institutions except for religious organizations.[30][31] These regulations were included on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine.[32][33]\n- Annual and lifetime coverage caps on essential benefits were banned.[34][35][36]\n- Insurers are forbidden from dropping policyholders when they become ill.[37][38]\n- All policies must provide an annual maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP) payment cap for an individual's or family's medical expenses (excluding premiums). After the MOOP payment is reached, all remaining costs must be paid by the insurer.[39]\n- Preventive care, vaccinations and medical screenings cannot be subject to co-payments, co-insurance or deductibles.[40][41][42] Specific examples of covered services include: mammograms and colonoscopies, wellness visits, gestational diabetes screening, HPV testing, STI counseling, HIV screening and counseling, contraceptive methods, breastfeeding support/supplies and domestic violence screening and counseling.[43]\n- The law established four tiers of coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. All categories offer essential health benefits. The categories vary in their division of premiums and out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans have the lowest monthly premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs, while platinum plans are the reverse.[26][44] The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).[45]\n- Insurers are required to implement an appeals process for coverage determination and claims on all new plans.[37]\n- Insurers must spend at least 80–85% of premium dollars on health costs; rebates must be issued if this is violated.[46][47]\nIndividual mandate\nThe individual mandate[48] required everyone to have insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate and limits on open enrollment[49][50] were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral, minimize the free rider problem and prevent the healthcare system from succumbing to adverse selection.\nThe mandate was intended to increase the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs.[51]\nAmong the groups who were not subject to the individual mandate are:\n- Illegal immigrants. Estimated at 8 million, roughly a third of the 23 million projection, they are ineligible for insurance subsidies and Medicaid.[52][53] They remain eligible for emergency services.\n- Medicaid-eligible citizens not enrolled in Medicaid.[54]\n- Citizens whose insurance coverage would cost more than 8% of household income.[54]\n- Citizens who live in states that opt-out of Medicaid expansion and who qualify for neither existing Medicaid coverage nor subsidized coverage.[55]\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,[56] set to $0 the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate, starting in 2019.[57]\nExchanges\nACA mandated that health insurance exchanges be provided for each state. The exchanges are regulated, largely online marketplaces, administered by either federal or state governments, where individuals, families and small businesses can purchase private insurance plans.[58][59][60] Exchanges first offered insurance for 2014. Some exchanges also provide access to Medicaid.[61][62]\nStates that set up their own exchanges have some discretion on standards and prices.[63][64] For example, states approve plans for sale, and thereby influence (through negotiations) prices. They can impose additional coverage requirements—such as abortion.[65] Alternatively, states can make the federal government responsible for operating their exchanges.[63]\nPremium subsidies\nIndividuals whose household incomes are between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) are eligible to receive federal subsidies for premiums for policies purchased on an ACA exchange, provided they are not eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or other forms of public assistance health coverage, and do not have access to affordable coverage (no more than 9.86% of income for the employee's coverage) through their own or a family member's employer.[66][67][68] Households below the federal poverty level are not eligible to receive these subsidies. Lawful Residents and some other legally present immigrants whose household income is below 100% FPL and are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid are eligible for subsidies if they meet all other eligibility requirements.[69][66] Married people must file taxes jointly to receive subsidies. Enrollees must have U.S. citizenship or proof of legal residency to obtain a subsidy.\nThe subsidies for an ACA plan purchased on an exchange stop at 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). According to the Kaiser Foundation, this results in a sharp \"discontinuity of treatment\" at 400% FPL, which is sometimes called the \"subsidy cliff\".[70] After-subsidy premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan (SCLSP) just below the cliff are 9.86% of income in 2019.[71]\nSubsidies are provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credit.[72][73]\nThe amount of subsidy is sufficient to reduce the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan (SCLSP) on an exchange to a sliding-scale percentage of income. The percentage is based on the percent of federal poverty level (FPL) for the household, and varies slightly from year to year. In 2019, it ranged from 2.08% of income (100%-133% FPL) to 9.86% of income (300%-400% FPL).[68] The subsidy can be used for any plan available on the exchange, but not catastrophic plans. The subsidy may not exceed the premium for the purchased plan.\n(In this section, the term \"income\" refers to modified adjusted gross income.[66][74])\nSmall businesses are eligible for a tax credit provided they enroll in the SHOP Marketplace.[75]\n| Income % of federal poverty level | Premium cap as a share of income | Incomea | Maximumb annual net premium after subsidy (second-lowest-cost silver plan) |\nMaximum out-of-pocket |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 133% | 3.11% of income | $33,383 | $1,038 | $5,200 |\n| 150% | 4.15% of income | $37,650 | $1,562 | $5,200 |\n| 200% | 6.54% of income | $50,200 | $3,283 | $5,200 |\n| 250% | 8.36% of income | $62,750 | $5,246 | $12,600 |\n| 300% | 9.86% of income | $75,300 | $7,425 | $15,800 |\n| 400% | 9.86% of income | $100,400 | $9,899 | $15,800 |\n|\na.^ In 2019, the federal poverty level was $25,100 for family of four (outside of Alaska and Hawaii). b.^ If the premium for the second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) is greater than the amount in this column, the amount of the premium subsidy will be such that it brings the net cost of the SCLSP down to the amount in this column. Otherwise, there will be no subsidy, and the SLCSP premium will (of course) be no more than (usually less than) the amount in this column. Note: The numbers in the table do not apply for Alaska and Hawaii. |\nCost-sharing reduction subsidies\nAs written, ACA mandated that insurers reduce copayments and deductibles for ACA exchange enrollees earning less than 250% of the FPL. Medicaid recipients were not eligible for the reductions.\nSo-called cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies were to be paid to insurance companies to fund the reductions. During 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies were to be paid, versus $34 billion for premium tax credits.[76]\nThe latter was defined as mandatory spending that does not require an annual Congressional appropriation. CSR payments were not explicitly defined as mandatory. This led to litigation and disruption later.[further explanation needed]\nRisk management\nRisk corridors\nThe risk-corridor program was a temporary risk management device.[77]: 1 It was intended to encourage reluctant insurers into ACA insurance market from 2014 to 2016. For those years the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) would cover some of the losses for insurers whose plans performed worse than they expected. Loss-making insurers would receive payments paid for in part by profit-making insurers.[78][79][attribution needed] Similar risk corridors had been established for the Medicare prescription drug benefit.[80]\nWhile many insurers initially offered exchange plans, the program did not pay for itself as planned, losing up to $8.3 billion for 2014 and 2015. Authorization had to be given so DHHS could pay insurers from \"general government revenues\".[attribution needed] However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 stated that no funds \"could be used for risk-corridor payments\".[81][attribution needed] leaving the government in a potential breach of contract with insurers who offered qualified health plans.[82]\nSeveral insurers sued the government at the United States Court of Federal Claims to recover the funds believed owed to them under the Risk Corridors program. While several were summarily closed, in the case of Moda Health v the United States, Moda Health won a $214-million judgment in February 2017. Federal Claims judge Thomas C. Wheeler stated, \"the Government made a promise in the risk corridors program that it has yet to fulfill. Today, the court directs the Government to fulfill that promise.\"[83] Moda Health's case was appealed by the government to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit along with the appeals of the other insurers; here, the Federal Circuit reversed the Moda Health ruling and ruled across all the cases in favor of the government, that the appropriations riders ceded the government from paying out remain money due to the insurers. The Supreme Court reversed this ruling in the consolidated case, Maine Community Health Options v. United States, reaffirming as with Judge Wheeler that the government had a responsibility to pay those funds under the ACA and the use of riders to de-obligate its from those payments was illegal.[84]\nReinsurance\nThe temporary reinsurance program is meant to stabilize premiums by reducing the incentive for insurers to raise premiums due to concerns about higher-risk enrollees. Reinsurance was based on retrospective costs rather than prospective risk evaluations. Reinsurance was available from 2014 through 2016.[85]\nRisk adjustment\nRisk adjustment involves transferring funds from plans with lower-risk enrollees to plans with higher-risk enrollees. It was intended to encourage insurers to compete based on value and efficiency rather than by attracting healthier enrollees. Of the three risk management programs, only risk adjustment was permanent. Plans with low actuarial risk compensate plans with high actuarial risk.[85]\nMedicaid expansion\nACA revised and expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014. All U.S. citizens and legal residents with income up to 133% of the poverty line would qualify for coverage in any state that participated in the Medicaid program. Previously, states could set various lower thresholds for certain groups and were not required to cover adults without dependent children. The federal government was to pay 100% of the increased cost in 2014, 2015 and 2016; 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% in 2020 and all subsequent years.[86][87][88][89] A 5% \"income disregard\" made the effective income eligibility limit for Medicaid 138% of the poverty level.[90] However, the Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius that this provision of ACA was coercive, and that states could choose to continue at pre-ACA eligibility levels.\nMedicare savings\nMedicare reimbursements were reduced to insurers and drug companies for private Medicare Advantage policies that the Government Accountability Office and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found to be excessively costly relative to standard Medicare;[91][92] and to hospitals that failed standards of efficiency and care.[91]\nTaxes\nMedicare taxes\nIncome from self-employment and wages of single individuals in excess of $200,000 annually are subjected to an additional tax of 0.9%. The threshold amount is $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly (threshold applies to their total compensation), or $125,000 for a married person filing separately.[93]\nIn ACA's companion legislation, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, an additional tax of 3.8% was applied to unearned income, specifically the lesser of net investment income and the amount by which adjusted gross income exceeds the above income limits.[94]\nExcise taxes\nACA included an excise tax of 40% (\"Cadillac tax\") on total employer premium spending in excess of specified dollar amounts (initially $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage[95]) indexed to inflation. This tax was originally scheduled to take effect in 2018, but was delayed until 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 and again to 2022. The excise tax on high-cost health plans was completely repealed as part of H.R.1865 - Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.\nExcise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs. An excise tax of 2.3% on medical devices and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services were applied as well.[96] The tax was repealed in late 2019.[97]\nSCHIP\nThe State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollment process was simplified.[98][99]\nDependents\nBeginning September 23, 2010, dependents were permitted to remain on their parents' insurance plan until their 26th birthday, including dependents who no longer lived with their parents, are not a dependent on a parent's tax return, are no longer a student, or are married.[100][101]\nEmployer mandate\nBusinesses that employ fifty or more people but do not offer health insurance to their full-time employees are assessed additional tax if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This is commonly known as the employer mandate.[102][103] This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once the exchanges began operating.[104]\nDelivery system reforms\nThe act includes delivery system reforms intended to constrain costs and improve quality. These include Medicare payment changes to discourage hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions, bundled payment initiatives, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and accountable care organizations.\nHospital quality\nHealth care cost/quality initiatives included incentives to reduce hospital infections, adopt electronic medical records, and to coordinate care and prioritize quality over quantity.[105]\nBundled payments\nMedicare switched from fee-for-service to bundled payments.[106][107] A single payment was to be paid to a hospital and a physician group for a defined episode of care (such as a hip replacement) rather than separate payments to individual service providers.[108]\nAccountable care organizations\nThe Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) was established by section 3022 of the Affordable Care Act. It is the program by which an accountable care organization interacts with the federal government, and by which accountable care organizations can be created.[109] It is a fee-for-service model.\nThe Act allowed the creation of accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers that commit to give coordinated care to Medicare patients. ACOs were allowed to continue using fee-for-service billing. They receive bonus payments from the government for minimizing costs while achieving quality benchmarks that emphasize prevention and mitigation of chronic disease. Missing cost or quality benchmarks subjected them to penalties.[110]\nUnlike health maintenance organizations, ACO patients are not required to obtain all care from the ACO. Also, unlike HMOs, ACOs must achieve quality-of-care goals.[110]\nMedicare drug benefit (Part D)\nMedicare Part D participants received a 50% discount on brand name drugs purchased after exhausting their initial coverage and before reaching the catastrophic-coverage threshold.[111] By 2020, the \"doughnut hole\" would be completely filled.[112]\nState waivers\nFrom 2017 onwards, states can apply for a \"waiver for state innovation\" which allows them to conduct experiments that meet certain criteria.[113] To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as ACA, covers at least as many residents and does not increase the federal deficit.[114] These states can escape some of ACA's central requirements, including the individual and employer mandates and the provision of an insurance exchange.[115] The state would receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under ACA, if they cannot be paid under the state plan.[113]\nOther insurance provisions\nThe Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (or CLASS Act) established a voluntary and public long-term care insurance option for employees,[116][117][118] The program was abolished as impractical without ever having taken effect.[119]\nConsumer Operated and Oriented Plans (CO-OP), member-governed non-profit insurers, could start providing health care coverage, based on a 5-year federal loan.[120] As of 2017, only four of the original 23 co-ops were still in operation,[121] including Mountain Health CO-OP.\nNutrition labeling requirements\nNutrition labeling requirements officially took effect in 2010, but implementation was delayed, and they actually took effect on May 7, 2018.[122]\nLegislative history\nACA followed a long series of unsuccessful attempts by one party or the other to pass major insurance reforms. Innovations were limited to health savings accounts (2003), medical savings accounts (1996) or flexible spending accounts, which increased insurance options, but did not materially expand coverage. Health care was a major factor in multiple elections, but until 2009, neither party had the votes to overcome the other's opposition.\nIndividual mandate\nThe concept of an individual mandate goes back to at least 1989, when The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care.[123][124] It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.[125][126][127]\nPresident Bill Clinton proposed a major healthcare reform bill in 1993[126] that ultimately failed.[128] Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.[129] The failed Clinton plan included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican senators proposed an alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance.\nThe 1993 Republican Health Equity and Access Reform Today (HEART) Act, contained a \"universal coverage\" requirement with a penalty for noncompliance—an individual mandate—as well as subsidies to be used in state-based 'purchasing groups'.[130] Advocates included prominent Republican senators such as John Chafee, Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett and Kit Bond.[131][132] The 1994 Republican Consumer Choice Health Security Act, initially contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision;[133] however, author Don Nickles subsequently removed the mandate, stating, \"government should not compel people to buy health insurance\".[134] At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H. W. Bush, remarked, \"I don't remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax.\"[123]\nIn 2006, an insurance expansion bill was enacted at the state level in Massachusetts. The bill contained both an individual mandate and an insurance exchange. Republican Governor Mitt Romney used a line-item veto on some provisions, and the Democratic legislature overrode some of his changes (including the mandate).[136] Romney's implementation of the 'Health Connector' exchange and individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, Senator Jim DeMint praised Romney's ability to \"take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured\". Romney said of the individual mandate: \"I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation.\"[137]\nIn 2007 Republican Senator Bob Bennett and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Healthy Americans Act, which featured an individual mandate and state-based, regulated insurance markets called \"State Health Help Agencies\".[127][137] The bill attracted bipartisan support, but died in committee. Many of its sponsors and co-sponsors remained in Congress during the 2008 healthcare debate.[138]\nBy 2008 many Democrats were considering this approach as the basis for healthcare reform. Experts said the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bore similarities to the 2007 bill[130] and that it took ideas from the Massachusetts reforms.[139]\nAcademic foundation\nA driving force behind Obama's healthcare reform was Peter Orszag, Director of the Office of Management and Budget.[140] Obama called Orszag his \"healthcare czar\" because of his knowledge of healthcare reform.[141] Orszag had previously been director of the Congressional Budget Office, and under his leadership the agency had focused on using cost analysis to create an affordable and effective approach to health care reform. Orszag claimed that healthcare reform became Obama's top agenda item because he wanted it to be his legacy.[142] According to an article by Ryan Lizza in The New Yorker, the core of \"the Obama budget is Orszag's belief [in]...a government empowered with research on the most effective medical treatments\". Obama bet \"his presidency on Orszag's thesis of comparative effectiveness.\"[143] Orszag's policies were influenced by an article in The Annals of Internal Medicine[144] co-authored by Elliott S. Fisher, David Wennberg and others. The article presented strong evidence based on the co-authors' research that numerous procedures, therapies and tests were being delivered with scant evidence of their medical value. If those procedures and tests could be eliminated, this evidence suggested, medical costs might provide the savings to give healthcare to the uninsured population.[145] After reading a New Yorker article that used the \"Dartmouth findings\"[146] to compare two counties in Texas with enormous variations in Medicare costs using hard data, Obama directed that his entire staff read it.[147] More than anything else, the Dartmouth data intrigued Obama[148] since it gave him an academic rationale for reshaping medicine.[149]\nThe concept of comparing the effectiveness of healthcare options based on hard data (\"comparative effectiveness\" and \"evidence-based medicine\") was pioneered by John E. Wennberg, founder of The Dartmouth Institute, co-founder of The Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making and senior advisor to Health Dialog Inc., a venture that he and his researchers created to help insurers implement the Dartmouth findings.\nHealthcare debate, 2008–10\nHealthcare reform was a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45 million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy without a mandate.[150][151]\nDuring the general election, Obama said fixing healthcare would be one of his top four priorities as president.[152] Obama and his opponent, Senator John McCain, both proposed health insurance reforms, though their plans differed. McCain proposed tax credits for health insurance purchased in the individual market, which was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured people by about 2 million by 2018. Obama proposed private and public group insurance, income-based subsidies, consumer protections, and expansions of Medicaid and SCHIP, which was estimated at the time to reduce the number of uninsured people by 33.9 million by 2018 at a higher cost.[153]\nObama announced to a joint session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform.[154][155] By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives.[156] On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a proposal. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of a Senate bill.[157][158][159]\nCongressional Democrats and health policy experts, such as MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber[160] and David Cutler, argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate to ensure that adverse selection or \"free riding\" would not result in an insurance \"death spiral\".[161] They chose this approach after concluding that filibuster-proof support in the Senate was not present for more progressive plans such as single-payer. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas—the same basic outline was supported by former Senate Majority Leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell—the bill's drafters hoped to garner the necessary votes.[162][163]\nHowever, following the incorporation of an individual mandate into the proposal, Republicans threatened to filibuster any bill that contained it.[123] Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican response, concluded Republicans should not support the bill.[164]\nRepublican senators, including those who had supported earlier proposals with a similar mandate, began to describe the mandate as \"unconstitutional\". Journalist Ezra Klein wrote in The New Yorker, \"a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition.\"[127]\nThe reform debate also attracted focused attention from lobbyists,[165] including pharmaceutical and healthcare insurance company advocacy, to assure continued opposition from all Republicans and even from among more conservative democrats, who had not fully supported the public option in earlier proposals.[166][167][168]\nDuring the August 2009 summer congressional recess, many members went back to their districts and held town hall meetings on the proposals. The nascent Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals attended the meetings to oppose the proposed reforms.[155] Threats were made against members of Congress over the course of the debate.[169]\nIn September 2009 Obama delivered another speech to a joint session of Congress supporting the negotiations.[170] On November 7, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act on a 220–215 vote and forwarded it to the Senate for passage.[155]\nSenate\nThe Senate began work on its own proposals while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House.[171] To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate repurposed H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members.[172] It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content.[173] The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes would be necessary to pass the Senate.[174] At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had 58 votes. The Minnesota Senate election was ultimately won by Democrat Al Franken, making 59. Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic party in April 2009, giving them 60 seats, enough to end a filibuster.\nNegotiations were undertaken attempting to satisfy moderate Democrats and to bring Republican senators aboard; particular attention was given to Republicans Bennett, Enzi, Grassley and Snowe.\nAfter the Finance Committee vote on October 15, negotiations turned to moderate Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying centrists. The holdouts came down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a public option[161][175] was met,[176] although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's failed Green Mountain Care.[176][177]\nThe White House and Reid addressed Nelson's concerns[178] during a 13-hour negotiation with two concessions: a compromise on abortion, modifying the language of the bill \"to give states the right to prohibit coverage of abortion within their own insurance exchanges\", which would require consumers to pay for the procedure out of pocket if the state so decided; and an amendment to offer a higher rate of Medicaid reimbursement for Nebraska.[155][179] The latter half of the compromise was derisively termed the \"Cornhusker Kickback\"[180] and was later removed.\nOn December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end debate on the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster.[181] The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote).[182] The bill was endorsed by the American Medical Association and AARP.[183]\nOn January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the recently deceased Ted Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters.[155][184][185] Additionally, the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of the bill.[186][187]\nHouse\nWith Democrats no longer able to get the 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back, dismissing more moderate reform as \"Kiddie Care\".[188][189]\nObama remained insistent on comprehensive reform. The news that Anthem in California intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as 39% gave him new evidence of the need for reform.[188][189] On February 22, he laid out a \"Senate-leaning\" proposal to consolidate the bills.[190] He held a meeting with both parties' leaders on February 25. The Democrats decided the House would pass the Senate's bill, to avoid another Senate vote.\nHouse Democrats had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a House–Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill.[187] They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.[188][191][192]\nPer the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation cannot be subject to a filibuster. But reconciliation is limited to budget changes, which is why the procedure was not used to pass ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations.[193][194] Although the already-passed Senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: \"these changes—higher subsidy levels, different kinds of taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal—mainly involve taxes and spending. In other words, they're exactly the kinds of policies that are well-suited for reconciliation.\"[191]\nThe remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant to support the bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, but they could not address abortion in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment to continue banning the use of federal funds for abortion.[195][196] This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage.[192][197] The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it.[198] It passed the second bill, by 220–211, the same day (with the Senate passing this bill via reconciliation by 56-43 a few days later). The day after the passage of ACA, March 22, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal it.[199] Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010.[17]\nPost-enactment\nSince passage, Republicans have voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act more than sixty times.[200]\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the fine for violating the individual mandate, starting in 2019. (The requirement itself is still in effect.)[57] In 2019 Congress repealed the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on health insurance benefits, an excise tax on medical devices, and the Health Insurance Tax.[97]\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, expanded subsidies for marketplace health plans. A continuation of these subsidies was introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nImpact\nCoverage\nThe law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance. The CDC reported that the percentage of people without health insurance fell from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.9% from January to June 2016.[201] The uninsured rate dropped in every congressional district in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015.[202] The Congressional Budget Office reported in March 2016 that approximately 12 million people were covered by the exchanges (10 million of whom received subsidies) and 11 million added to Medicaid. Another million were covered by ACA's \"Basic Health Program\", for a total of 24 million.[5] CBO estimated that ACA would reduce the net number of uninsured by 22 million in 2016, using a slightly different computation for the above figures totaling ACA coverage of 26 million, less 4 million for reductions in \"employment-based coverage\" and \"non-group and other coverage\".[5]\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimated that 20.0 million adults (aged 18–64) gained healthcare coverage via ACA as of February 2016;[6] similarly, the Urban Institute found in 2016 that 19.2 million non-elderly Americans gained health insurance coverage from 2010 to 2015.[203] In 2016, CBO estimated the uninsured at approximately 27 million people, or around 10% of the population or 7–8% excluding unauthorized immigrants.[5]\nStates that expanded Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on average in the first quarter of 2016, while those that did not had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18–64.[204] As of December 2016 32 states (including Washington DC) had adopted the Medicaid extension.[205]\nA 2017 study found that the ACA reduced socioeconomic disparities in health care access.[206]\nThe Affordable Care Act reduced the percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who were uninsured from 22.3 percent in 2010 to 12.4 percent in 2016. About 21 million more people have coverage ten years after the enactment of the ACA.[207][208] Ten years after its enactment studies showed that the ACA also had a positive effect on health and caused a reduction in mortality.[208]\nTaxes\nExcise taxes from the Affordable Care Act raised $16.3 billion in fiscal year 2015. $11.3 billion came from an excise tax placed directly on health insurers based on their market share. Annual excise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs.\nThe Individual mandate tax was $695 per individual or $2,085 per family at a minimum, reaching as high as 2.5% of household income (whichever was higher). The tax was set to $0 beginning in 2019.[209]\nIn the fiscal year 2018, the individual and employer mandates yielded $4 billion each. Excise taxes on insurers and drug makers added $18 billion. Income tax surcharges produced 437 billion.[210]\nACA reduced income inequality measured after taxes, due to the income tax surcharges and subsidies.[211] CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. The tax subsidy for the employer market, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total.[5]\nInsurance exchanges\nAs of August 2016, 15 states operated their own health insurance marketplace. Other states either used the federal exchange, or operated in partnership with or supported by the federal government.[212] By 2019, 12 states and Washington DC operated their own exchanges.[213]\nMedicaid expansion in practice\nAs of December 2019, 37 states (including Washington DC) had adopted the Medicaid extension.[205] Those states that expanded Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on average in the first quarter of 2016, while the others had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64.[204] Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they did not expand Medicaid under ACA, several states rejected the option. Over half the national uninsured population lived in those states.[214]\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults.[citation needed] The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.[215][216]\nIn many states income thresholds were significantly below 133% of the poverty line.[217] Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level.[218] Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options.[219][220] For example, in Kansas, where only non-disabled adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a family of three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, non-disabled adults were not eligible for Medicaid there.[214]\nStudies of the impact of Medicaid expansion rejections calculated that up to 6.4 million people would have too much income for Medicaid but not qualify for exchange subsidies.[221] Several states argued that they could not afford the 10% contribution in 2020.[222][223][224] Some studies suggested rejecting the expansion would cost more due to increased spending on uncompensated emergency care that otherwise would have been partially paid for by Medicaid coverage,[225][226]\nA 2016 study found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both expanded Medicaid, were more likely to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period.[227][228] Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. Later Arkansas and Kentucky governors proposed reducing or modifying their programs. From 2013 to 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas.[227][229]\nA 2016 DHHS study found that states that expanded Medicaid had lower premiums on exchange policies, because they had fewer low-income enrollees, whose health on average is worse than that of those with higher income.[230]\nIn September 2019, the Census Bureau reported that states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA had considerably lower uninsured rates than states that did not. For example, for adults between 100% and 399% of poverty level, the uninsured rate in 2018 was 12.7% in expansion states and 21.2% in non-expansion states. Of the 14 states with uninsured rates of 10% or greater, 11 had not expanded Medicaid.[231] The drop in uninsured rates due to expanded Medicaid has broadened access to care among low-income adults, with post-ACA studies indicating an improvement in affordability, access to doctors, and usual sources of care.[232]\nA study using national data from the Health Reform Monitoring Survey determined that unmet need due to cost and inability to pay medical bills significantly decreased among low-income (up to 138% FPL) and moderate-income (139-199% FPL) adults, with unmet need due to cost decreasing by approximately 11 percentage points among low-income adults by the second enrollment period.[232] Importantly, issues with cost-related unmet medical needs, skipped medications, paying medical bills, and annual out-of-pocket spending have been significantly reduced among low-income adults in Medicaid expansion states compared to non-expansion states.[232]\nAs well, expanded Medicaid has led to a 6.6% increase in physician visits by low-income adults, as well as increased usage of preventative care such as dental visits and cancer screenings among childless, low-income adults.[232] Improved health care coverage due to Medicaid expansion has been found in a variety of patient populations, such as adults with mental and substance use disorders, trauma patients, cancer patients, and people living with HIV.[233][234][235][236] Compared to 2011–13, in 2014 there was a 5.4 percentage point reduction in the uninsured rate of adults with mental disorders (from 21.3% to 15.9%) and a 5.1 percentage point reduction in the uninsured rate of adults with substance use disorders (from 25.9% to 20.8%); with increases in coverage occurring primarily through Medicaid.[236] Use of mental health treatment increased by 2.1 percentage points, from 43% to 45.1%.[236]\nAmong trauma patients nationwide, the uninsured rate has decreased by approximately 50%.[233] Adult trauma patients in expansion states experienced a 13.7 percentage point reduction in uninsured rates compared to adult trauma patients in non-expansion states, and an accompanying 7.4 percentage point increase in discharge to rehabilitation.[237] Following Medicaid expansion and dependent coverage expansion, young adults hospitalized for acute traumatic injury in Maryland experienced a 60% increase in rehabilitation, 25% reduction in mortality, and a 29.8% reduction in failure-to-rescue.[238] Medicaid expansion's swift impact on cancer patients was demonstrated in a study using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program that evaluated more than 850,000 patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, prostate cancer, or thyroid cancer from 2010 to 2014. The study found that a cancer diagnosis in 2014 was associated with a 1.9 percentage-point absolute and 33.5% relative decrease in uninsured rates compared to a diagnosis made between 2010 and 2013.[235] Another study, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data from 2010 to 2014, found that Medicaid expansion was associated with a 6.4% net increase in early stage (in situ, local, or regional) diagnoses of all cancers combined.[239]\nData from the Centers for Disease and Prevention's (CDC) Medical Monitoring Project demonstrated that between 2009 and 2012, approximately 18% of people living with HIV (PLWH) who were actively receiving HIV treatment were uninsured[240] and that at least 40% of HIV-infected adults receiving treatment were insured through Medicaid or Medicare, programs they qualified for only once their disease was advanced enough to be covered as a disability under Social Security.[240] Expanded Medicaid coverage of PLWH has been positively associated with health outcomes such as viral suppression, retention of care, hospitalization rates, and morbidity at the time of hospitalization.[234] An analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data found a 2.8% annual increase in viral suppression rates among all PLWH from 2010 to 2015 due to Medicaid expansion.[241] As an early adopter of Medicaid expansion, Massachusetts found a 65% rate of viral suppression among all PLWH and an 85% rate among those retained in healthcare in 2014, both substantially higher than the national average.[241]\nAn analysis of hospital discharge data from 2012 to 2014 in four Medicaid expansion states and two non-expansion states revealed hospitalizations of uninsured PLWH fell from 13.7% to 5.5% in the four expansion states and rose from 14.5% to 15.7% in the two non-expansion states.[242] Importantly, uninsured PLWH were 40% more likely to die in the hospital than insured PLWH.[242] Other notable health outcomes associated with Medicaid expansion include improved glucose monitoring rates for patients with diabetes, better hypertension control, and reduced rates of major post-operative morbidity.[243]\nA July 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicated that states enacting Medicaid expansion exhibited statistically significant reductions in mortality rates.[244] From that study, states that took Medicaid expansion \"saved the lives of at least 19,200 adults aged 55 to 64 over the four-year period from 2014 to 2017.\"[245] Further, 15,600 older adults died prematurely in the states that did not enact Medicaid expansion in those years according to the NBER research. \"The lifesaving impacts of Medicaid expansion are large: an estimated 39 to 64 percent reduction in annual mortality rates for older adults gaining coverage.\"[245]\nDue to many states' failure to expand, many Democrats co-sponsored the proposed 2021 Cover Now Act that would allow county and municipal governments to fund Medicaid expansion.[246]\nGaps in expansion\nDespite the significant increase in access to insurance coverage and healthcare services across the board, the ACA's Medicaid expansion has not fully addressed problems of economic equity. Critics argue that Medicaid expansion has not reduced cost-sharing by a significant margin, as the amount households paid out of pocket for healthcare over the past ten years (in the form of deductibles, co-payments, etc.) rose by 77%.[247] Additionally, 30% of providers deny Medicaid patients, which affects the accessibility of quality care.[248] This increase in denial may be in part because providers receive 62 cents from Medicaid for every dollar received from private insurers.[248] Studies on insurance rates show that economic inequality still persists: a significantly higher proportion of those with income greater than 100% but less than 200% of the federal poverty level were uninsured from 2010 to 2015 than of those with income greater than 200% of the federal poverty level.[247] This is exacerbated by the 2012 Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of Medicaid, since many of the states that have opted out have more vulnerable populations, with large numbers of minorities or low-income people.[247]\nMedicaid patients have also reported receiving \"second-class\" treatment compared to privately insured patients, with longer wait times and lower quality of care.[247]\nMedicaid expansion by state\n| State or territory | Status of expansion | Date of expansion | Health insurance marketplace | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Alabama | No expansion | N/A | HealthCare.gov | |\n| Alaska | In effect | September 1, 2015 | HealthCare.gov | |\n| Arizona | In effect | January 1, 2014 | HealthCare.gov | |\n| Arkansas | In effect | January 1, 2014 | Arkansas Health Connector, HealthCare.gov | State implemented expansion through a \"private option\" under a Section 1115 waiver through the Arkansas Health Care Independence Program (HCIP).

For example, a study published in 2016 found that the average requested 2017 premium increase among 40-year-old non-smokers was about 9 percent, although Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed increases of 40 percent in Alabama and 60 percent in Texas.[251] However, some or all these costs were offset by tax credits. For example, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that for the second-lowest cost \"Silver plan\", a 40-year old non-smoker making $30,000 per year would pay effectively the same amount in 2017 as they did in 2016 (about $208/month) after the tax credit, despite a large increase in the list price. This was consistent nationally. In other words, the subsidies increased along with the premium price, fully offsetting the increases for subsidy-eligible enrollees.[252]\nPremium cost increases in the employer market moderated after 2009. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000 to 2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015,[7] with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.[253] From 2008 to 2010 (before passage of ACA) health insurance premiums rose by an average of 10% per year.[254]\nSeveral studies found that the 2008 financial crisis and accompanying Great Recession could not account for the entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely shared at least partial credit.[255][256][257][258] A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for about a quarter of the recent reduction in inflation.[259][clarification needed] Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.[260]\nIn a 2016 review, Barack Obama claimed that from 2010 through 2014 mean annual growth in real per-enrollee Medicare spending was negative, down from a mean of 4.7% per year from 2000 through 2005 and 2.4% per year from 2006 to 2010; similarly, mean real per-enrollee growth in private insurance spending was 1.1% per year over the period, compared with a mean of 6.5% from 2000 through 2005 and 3.4% from 2005 to 2010.[261]\nDeductibles and co-payments\nA contributing factor to premium cost moderation was that the insured faced higher deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums. In addition, many employees chose to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the net impact of ACA difficult to determine precisely.\nFor the group market (employer insurance), a 2016 survey found that:\n- Deductibles grew 63% from 2011 to 2016, while premiums increased 19% and worker earnings grew by 11%.\n- In 2016, 4 in 5 workers had an insurance deductible, which averaged $1,478. For firms with less than 200 employees, the deductible averaged $2,069.\n- The percentage of workers with a deductible of at least $1,000 grew from 10% in 2006 to 51% in 2016. The 2016 figure dropped to 38% after taking employer contributions into account.[262]\nFor the non-group market, of which two-thirds are covered by ACA exchanges, a survey of 2015 data found that:\n- 49% had individual deductibles of at least $1,500 ($3,000 for family), up from 36% in 2014.\n- Many exchange enrollees qualify for cost-sharing subsidies that reduce their net deductible.\n- While about 75% of enrollees were \"very satisfied\" or \"somewhat satisfied\" with their choice of doctors and hospitals, only 50% had such satisfaction with their annual deductible.\n- While 52% of those covered by ACA exchanges felt \"well protected\" by their insurance, in the group market 63% felt that way.[263]\nHealth outcomes\nAccording to a 2014 study, ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013.[264] Himmelstein and Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a rollback of ACA's Medicaid expansion alone would cause an estimated 43,956 deaths annually.[265]\nAccording to the Kaiser Foundation, expanding Medicaid in the remaining states would cover up to 4.5 million persons.[266] A 2021 study found a significant decline in mortality rates in the states that opted in to the Medicaid expansion program compared with those states that did not do so. The study reported that states decisions' not to expand Medicaid resulted in approximately 15,600 excess deaths from 2014 through 2017.[267][268]\nDependent Coverage Expansion (DCE) under the ACA has had a demonstrable effect on various health metrics of young adults, a group with a historically low level of insurance coverage and utilization of care.[269] Numerous studies have shown the target age group gained private health insurance relative to an older group after the policy was implemented, with an accompanying improvement in having a usual source of care, reduction in out-of-pocket costs of high-end medical expenditures, reduction in frequency of Emergency Department visits, 3.5% increase in hospitalizations and 9% increase in hospitalizations with a psychiatric diagnosis, 5.3% increase in utilizing specialty mental health care by those with a probable mental illness, 4% increase in reporting excellent mental health, and a 1.5-6.2% increase in reporting excellent physical health.[269] Studies have also found that DCE was associated with improvements in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment among young adult patients.[239][270] A study of 10,010 women aged 18–26 identified through the 2008-12 National Health Interview Survey found that the likelihood of HPV vaccination initiation and completion increased by 7.7 and 5.8 percentage points respectively when comparing before and after October 1, 2010.[270] Another study using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2007 to 2012 found a 5.5 percentage point decrease in late-stage (stages III/IV) cervical cancer diagnosis for women aged 21–25 after DCE, and an overall decrease of 7.3 percentage points in late-stage diagnosis compared to those aged 26–34.[239] A study using SEER Program data from 2007 to 2012 found a 2.7 percentage point increase in diagnosis at stage I disease for patients aged 19–25 compared with those aged 26–34 for all cancers combined.[239] Studies focusing on cancer treatment after DCE found a 12.8 percentage point increase in the receipt of fertility-sparing treatment among cervical cancer patients aged 21–25 and an overall increase of 13.4 percentage points compared to those aged 26–34, as well as an increased likelihood that patients aged 19–25 with stage IIB-IIIC colorectal cancer receive timely adjuvant chemotherapy compared to those aged 27–34.[239]\nTwo 2018 JAMA studies found the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) was associated with increased post-discharge mortality for patients hospitalized for heart failure and pneumonia.[271][272][273] A 2019 JAMA study found that ACA decreased emergency department and hospital use by uninsured individuals.[274] Several studies have indicated that increased 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year post-discharge mortality of heart failure patients can be attributed to \"gaming the system\" through inappropriate triage systems in emergency departments, use of observation stays when admissions are warranted, and delay of readmission beyond the 30th day post-discharge, strategies that can reduce readmission rates at the expense of quality of care and patient survival.[275] The HRRP was also shown to disproportionately penalize safety-net hospitals that predominately serve low-income patients.[276] A 2020 study by Treasury Department economists in the Quarterly Journal of Economics using a randomized controlled trial (the IRS sent letters to some taxpayers noting that they had paid a fine for not signing up for health insurance but not to other taxpayers) found that over two years, obtaining health insurance reduced mortality by 12 percent.[277][278] The study concluded that the letters, sent to 3.9 million people, may have saved 700 lives.[277]\nA 2020 JAMA study found that Medicare expansion under the ACA was associated with reduced incidence of advanced-stage breast cancer, indicating that Medicaid accessibility led to early detection of breast cancer and higher survival rates.[279] Recent studies have also attributed to Medicaid expansion an increase in use of smoking cessation medications, cervical cancer screening, and colonoscopy, as well as an increase in the percentage of early-stage diagnosis of all cancers and the rate of cancer surgery for low-income patients.[280][281] These studies include a 2.1% increase in the probability of smoking cessation in Medicaid expansion states compared to non-expansion states, a 24% increase in smoking cessation medication use due to increased Medicaid-financed smoking cessation prescriptions, a 27.7% increase in the rate of colorectal cancer screening in Kentucky following Medicaid expansion with an accompanying improvement in colorectal cancer survival, and a 3.4% increase in cancer incidence following Medicaid expansion that was attributed to an increase in early-stage diagnoses.[280]\nTransition-of-care interventions and Alternative Payment Models under the ACA have also shown promise in improving health outcomes.[282][283] Post-discharge provider appointment and telephone follow-up interventions have been shown to reduce 30-day readmission rates among general medical-surgical inpatients.[282] Reductions in 60, 90, and 180 post-discharge day readmission rates due to transition-of-care interventions have also been demonstrated, and a reduction in 30-day mortality has been suggested.[282] Total joint arthroplasty bundles as part of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative have been shown to reduce discharge to inpatient rehabilitation facilities and post-acute care facilities, decrease hospital length of stay by 18% without sacrificing quality of care, and reduce the rate of total joint arthroplasty readmissions, half of which were due to surgical complications.[283] The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program in Medicaid has also shown the potential to improve health outcomes, with early studies reporting positive and significant effects on total patient experience score, 30-day readmission rates, incidences of pneumonia and pressure ulcers, and 30-day mortality rates for pneumonia.[284] The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) payment and care model, a team-based approach to population health management that risk-stratifies patients and provides focused care management and outreach to high-risk patients, has been shown to improve diabetes outcomes.[285] A widespread PCMH demonstration program focusing on diabetes, known as the Chronic Care Initiative in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, found statistically significant improvements in A1C testing, LDL-C testing, nephropathy screening and monitoring, and eye examinations, with an accompanying reduction in all-cause emergency department visits, ambulatory care-sensitive emergency department visits, ambulatory visits to specialists, and a higher rate of ambulatory visits to primary care providers.[285] The ACA overall has improved coverage and care of diabetes, with a significant portion of the 3.5 million uninsured US adults aged 18–64 with diabetes in 2009-10 likely gaining coverage and benefits such as closure of the Medicaid Part D coverage gap for insulin.[286] 2.3 million of the approximately 4.6 million people aged 18–64 with undiagnosed diabetes in 2009–2010 may also have gained access to zero-cost preventative care due to section 2713 of the ACA, which prohibits cost sharing for United States Preventive Services Taskforce grade A or B recommended services, such as diabetes screenings.[286]\nDistributional impact\nIn March 2018, the CBO reported that ACA had reduced income inequality in 2014, saying the law led the lowest and second quintiles (the bottom 40%) to receive an average of an additional $690 and $560 respectively while causing households in the top 1% to pay an additional $21,000 due mostly to the net investment income tax and the additional Medicare tax. The law placed relatively little burden on households in the top quintile (top 20%) outside of the top 1%.[10]\nFederal deficit\nCBO estimates of revenue and impact on deficit\nThe CBO reported in multiple studies that ACA would reduce the deficit, and repealing it would increase the deficit, primarily because of the elimination of Medicare reimbursement cuts.[8][9] The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012–2021 period:[9][287] it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in total receipts, resulting in a $210 billion net deficit reduction.[9] The CBO separately predicted that while most of the spending provisions do not begin until 2014,[288][289] revenue would exceed spending in those subsequent years.[290][dead link] The CBO claimed the bill would \"substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs\"[291]—ultimately extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by eight years.[292]\nThis estimate was made prior to the Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the related federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.[293][294][295]\nThe CBO in June 2015 forecast that repeal of ACA would increase the deficit between $137 billion and $353 billion over the 2016–2025 period, depending on the impact of macroeconomic feedback effects. The CBO also forecast that repeal of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2025, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.[8]\nAlthough the CBO generally does not provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period because of the degree of uncertainty involved in the projection, it decided to do so in this case at the request of lawmakers, and estimated a second decade deficit reduction of $1.2 trillion.[291][296] CBO predicted deficit reduction around a broad range of one-half percent of GDP over the 2020s while cautioning that \"a wide range of changes could occur\".[297]\nIn 2017 CBO estimated that repealing the individual mandate alone would reduce the 10-year deficit by $338 billion.[298]\nOpinions on CBO projections\nThe CBO cost estimates were criticized because they excluded the effects of potential legislation that would increase Medicare payments by more than $200 billion from 2010 to 2019.[299][300][301] However, the so-called \"doc fix\" is a separate issue that would have existed with or without ACA.[302][303][304] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities objected that Congress had a good record of implementing Medicare savings. According to their study, Congress followed through on the implementation of the vast majority of provisions enacted in the past 20 years to produce Medicare savings, although not the doc fix.[305][306] The doc fix became obsolete in 2015 when the savings provision was eliminated, permanently removing that spending restraint.[307]\nHealth economist Uwe Reinhardt, wrote, \"The rigid, artificial rules under which the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation.\"[308] Douglas Holtz-Eakin alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562 billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.[309]\nScheiber and Cohn rejected critical assessments of the law's deficit impact, arguing that predictions were biased towards underestimating deficit reduction. They noted, for example, it is easier to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than to account for savings from preventive healthcare, and that the CBO had a track record of overestimating costs and underestimating savings of health legislation;[310][311] stating, \"innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of electronic medical records[312] and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses ... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another—and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize.\"[310]\nIn 2010 David Walker said the CBO estimates were not likely to be accurate, because they were based on the assumption that the law would not change.[313]\nEmployer mandate and part-time work\nThe employer mandate applies to employers of more than fifty where health insurance is provided only to the full-time workers.[314] Critics claimed it created a perverse incentive to hire part-timers instead.[315][316] However, between March 2010 and 2014, the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000 while the number of full-time jobs increased by two million.[317][318] In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector.[317][319] A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.[320]\nSeveral businesses and the state of Virginia added a 29-hour-a-week cap for their part-time employees,[321][unreliable source?][322][unreliable source?] to reflect the 30-hour-or-more definition for full-time worker.[314] As of 2013, few companies had shifted their workforce towards more part-time hours (4% in a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).[316] Trends in working hours[323] and the recovery from the Great Recession correlate with the shift from part-time to full-time work.[324][325] Other confounding impacts include that health insurance helps attract and retain employees, increases productivity and reduces absenteeism; and lowers corresponding training and administration costs from a smaller, more stable workforce.[316][323][326] Relatively few firms employ over 50 employees[316] and more than 90% of them already offered insurance.[327]\nMost policy analysts (both right and left) were critical of the employer mandate provision.[315][327] They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, even if they did not change existing plans, were real and harmful;[328][329] that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth;[330] that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans;[328][329] and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools.[331][332] The provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions who were not granted exemptions.[329][333]\nHospitals\nFrom the start of 2010 to November 2014, 43 hospitals in rural areas closed. Critics claimed the new law had caused these closures. Many rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but only a small number operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.[334]\nBetween January 2010 and 2015, a quarter of ER doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed they lacked the resources to deal with large increases in the number of patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured.[335] Michael Lee Jr. and Michael C. Monuteaux at Boston Children's Hospital analyzed national emergency department visits among children aged 0 to 17 from 2009 to 2016 using the American Community Survey (ACS) and Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). They found no immediate change in pediatric emergency department visit rates the year after the ACA took full effect in 2014, but the rate of change from 2014 to 2016 was significantly higher than previous rate trends, almost 10%.[336]\nSeveral large insurers formed ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices, amounting to a significant consolidation of the provider industry. The increased market share gave them more leverage with insurers and reduced patient care options.[110]\nEconomic consequences\nCBO estimated in June 2015 that repealing ACA would:\n- Decrease GDP in the short-term, as government spending (on subsidies) was only partially replaced by spending by recipients.\n- Increase the supply of labor and aggregate compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021–2025 period. CBO cited ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so repealing ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more labor, increasing the total number of hours worked by about 1.5% over the 2021–2025 period.\n- Remove the higher tax rates on capital income, thereby encouraging investment, raising the capital stock and output in the long-run.[8]\nIn 2015 the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research found no evidence that companies were reducing worker hours to avoid ACA requirements[337] for employees working more than 30 hours per week.[338]\nCBO estimated that ACA would slightly reduce the size of the labor force and number of hours worked, as some would no longer be tethered to employers for their insurance. Jonathan Cohn claimed that ACA's primary employment effect was to alleviate job lock[339] and the reform's only significant employment impact was the retirement of those who were working only to stay insured.[340]\nPublic opinion\nPublic views became increasingly negative in reaction to specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Approval varied by party, race and age. Some elements were more widely favored (preexisting conditions) or opposed (individual mandate).\nIn a 2010 poll, 62% of respondents said they thought ACA would \"increase the amount of money they personally spend on health care\", 56% said the bill \"gives the government too much involvement in health care\", and 19% said they thought they and their families would be better off with the legislation.[341] Other polls found that people were concerned the law would cost more than projected and would not do enough to control costs.[342]\nIn a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans favored the law. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate.[343] Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers and providing subsidies.[344][345]\nSome opponents believed the reform did not go far enough: a 2012 poll indicated that 71% of Republican opponents rejected it overall, while 29% believed it did not go far enough; independent opponents were divided 67% to 33%; and among the much smaller group of Democratic opponents, 49% rejected it overall and 51% wanted more.[343]\nIn June 2013, a majority of the public (52–34%) indicated a desire for \"Congress to implement or tinker with the law rather than repeal it\".[346] After the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate, a 2012 poll held that \"most Americans (56%) want to see critics of President Obama's health care law drop efforts to block it and move on to other national issues\".[347]\nAs of October 2013, approximately 40% were in favor while 51% were against.[348][349] About 29% of whites approved of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans.[350] A solid majority of seniors opposed the idea and a solid majority of those under forty were in favor.[351]\nA 2014 poll reported that 26% of Americans support ACA.[352] A later 2014 poll reported that 48.9% of respondents had an unfavorable view of ACA versus 38.3% who had a favorable view (of more than 5,500 individuals).[353] Another held that 8% of respondents agreed the Affordable Care Act \"is working well the way it is\".[354] In late 2014, a Rasmussen poll reported Repeal: 30%, Leave as is: 13%, Improve: 52%.[355]\nIn 2015, a poll reported that 47% of Americans approved the health care law. This was the first time a major poll indicated that more respondents approved than disapproved.[356] A December 2016 poll reported that: a) 30% wanted to expand what the law does; b) 26% wanted to repeal the entire law; c) 19% wanted to move forward with implementing the law as it is; and d) 17% wanted to scale back what the law does, with the remainder undecided.[357]\nSeparate polls from Fox News and NBC/WSJ, both taken during January 2017, indicated more people viewed the law favorably than did not for the first time. One of the reasons for the improving popularity of the law is that Democrats who had once opposed it (many still prefer \"Medicare for all\") shifted their positions because ACA was under threat of repeal.[358] Another January 2017 poll reported that 35% of respondents believed \"Obamacare\" and the \"Affordable Care Act\" were different or did not know. (About 45% were unsure whether \"repeal of Obamacare\" also meant \"repeal of the Affordable Care Act\".) 39% did not know that \"many people would lose coverage through Medicaid or subsidies for private health insurance if the ACA were repealed and no replacement enacted\", with Democrats far more likely (79%) to know that fact than Republicans (47%).[359] A 2017 study found that personal experience with public health insurance programs led to greater support for the ACA, most prominently among Republicans and low-information voters.[360]\nBy the end of 2023, a Morning Consult poll of registered voters found that 57% approved of the Affordable Care Act, while 30% disapproved of it. 85% of Democrats, 56% of independents, and 28% of Republicans supported the law.[361]\nPolitical aspects\n\"Obamacare\"\nThe term \"Obamacare\" was originally coined by opponents as a pejorative. According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured.[362] The term officially emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott wrote, \"We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s\".[363][364]\nIn May 2007, Mitt Romney introduced it to political discourse, saying, \"How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it.\"[363]\nBy mid-2012, Obamacare had become the colloquial term used both by supporters and opponents.[362] Obama eventually endorsed the nickname, saying, \"I have no problem with people saying Obama cares. I do care.\"[365] By 2016 Obama explicitly and repeatedly referred to the ACA as \"Obamacare\".[366]\nThe use of \"Obamacare\" became increasingly rare, and at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Obama said, \"I noticed, by the way, since it became popular, they don't call it 'Obamacare' no more.\"[367]\nCommon misconceptions\n\"Death panels\"\nOn August 7, 2009, Sarah Palin created the term \"death panels\" to describe groups who would decide whether sick patients were \"worthy\" of medical care.[368] \"Death panel\" referred to two claims about early drafts.\nOne was that under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age[369] and the other that the government would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).[370] IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when statutory expenditure levels were exceeded within any given three-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.[371][372]\nThe other related issue concerned advance-care planning consultation: a section of the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive.[373] The provision was not included in ACA.[374]\nIn 2010, the Pew Research Center reported that 85% of Americans were familiar with the claim, and 30% believed it was true, backed by three contemporaneous polls.[375] The allegation was named PolitiFact's 2009 \"Lie of the Year\",[368][376] one of FactCheck.org's \"whoppers\"[377][378] and the most outrageous term by the American Dialect Society.[379] AARP described such rumors as \"rife with gross—and even cruel—distortions\".[380]\nMembers of Congress\nACA requires members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance either through an exchange or some other program approved by the law (such as Medicare), instead of using the insurance offered to federal employees (the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program).[381][382]\nIllegal immigrants\nACA explicitly denies insurance subsidies to \"unauthorized (illegal) aliens\".[52][53][383]\nExchange \"death spiral\"\nOpponents claimed that combining immediate coverage with no provision for preexisting conditions would lead people to wait to get insured until they got sick. The individual mandate was designed to push people to get insured without waiting. This has been called a \"death spiral\".[384] In the years after 2013, many insurers did leave specific marketplaces, claiming the risk pools were too small.\nThe median number of insurers per state was 4.0 in 2014, 5.0 in 2015, 4.0 in 2016 and 3.0 in 2017. Five states had one insurer in 2017, 13 had two, 11 had three; the remainder had four or more.[385]\n\"If you like your plan\"\nAt various times during and after ACA debate Obama said, \"If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.\"[386][387] However, in fall 2013 millions of Americans with individual policies received notices that their insurance plans were terminated,[388] and several million more risked seeing their current plans canceled.[389][390]\nObama's previous unambiguous assurance that consumers could keep their own plans became a focal point for critics, who challenged his truthfulness.[391][392] Various bills were introduced in Congress to allow people to keep their plans.[393]\nPolitiFact initially cited various estimates that only about 2% of the total insured population (4 million out of 262 million) received such notices,[394] but readers later voted Obama's claims as the 2013 \"Lie of the Year\".[395]\nCriticism and opposition\nOpposition and efforts to repeal the legislation have drawn support from sources that include labor unions,[333][396] conservative advocacy groups,[397][398] Republicans, small business organizations and the Tea Party movement.[399] These groups claimed the law would disrupt existing health plans, increase costs from new insurance standards, and increase the deficit.[400] Some opposed the idea of universal healthcare.[401][402] President Donald Trump repeatedly promised to \"repeal and replace\" it.[403][404]\nAs of 2013[update] unions that expressed concerns included the AFL–CIO,[405] which called ACA \"highly disruptive\", claiming it would drive up costs of union-sponsored plans; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and UNITE-HERE, whose leaders argued \"PPACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\"[333] In 2014, Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) president Terry O'Sullivan and Unite Here president D. Taylor wrote, \"ACA, as implemented, undermines fair marketplace competition in the health care industry.\"[396]\nIn October 2016, Mark Dayton, the governor of Minnesota, said ACA had \"many good features\" but it was \"no longer affordable for increasing numbers of people\"; he called on the state legislature to provide emergency relief to policyholders.[406] Dayton later said he regretted his remarks after they were seized on by Republicans seeking to repeal the law.[407]\nSocialism debate\nMany economically conservative opponents called the ACA \"socialist\" or \"socialized medicine\", pointing to the government redistribution of wealth via subsidies for low-income purchasers of private insurance, expansion of Medicaid, government requirements as to what products can be sold on the exchanges, and the individual mandate, which reduces freedom of consumer choice to be uninsured.[408][409][410]\nOther observers considered the law a relatively capitalist or \"regulated free-market\" means of paying for near-universal health care, because it creates new marketplaces with choices for consumers, largely relies on private employers and private health insurance companies, maintains private ownership of hospitals and doctor's offices, and was originally advocated by economic conservatives as a capitalist alternative to single-payer health care.[411][412][413] Some pointed out that the previous system also had socialist aspects. Even for-profit private health insurance companies socialize risk and redistribute wealth from people who have it (all premium payers) to those who need it (by paying for medically necessary healthcare).[413] The requirement to provide emergency care also forced redistribution from people who pay insurance premiums to those who choose to be uninsured, when they visit the emergency room.[412]\nSome ACA supporters accused conservatives of using the term \"socialism\" as a negative buzzword for ACA as it was for Medicare and Medicaid,[413] and some embraced the label \"socialism\" as desirable, distinguishing democratic socialism as desirable for education and health care[414] and communism as undesirable.[413] Milos Forman opined that critics \"falsely equate Western European-style socialism, and its government provision of social insurance and health care, with Marxist–Leninist totalitarianism\".[415]\nLegal challenges\nNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\nOpponents challenged ACA's constitutionality in multiple lawsuits on multiple grounds.[416][417][failed verification] The Supreme Court ruled, 5–4, that the individual mandate was constitutional when viewed as a tax, although not under the Commerce Clause.\nACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Court ruled that this was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out without losing preexisting Medicaid funding.[12]\nContraception mandate\nIn March 2012, the Catholic Church, while supportive of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that aspects of the mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns,[418][419] including Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which looked at private corporations and their duties under the ACA.\nIn Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court ruled 7–2 on July 8, 2020, that employers with religious or moral objections to contraceptives can exclude such coverage from an employee's insurance plan. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said, \"No language in the statute itself even hints that Congress intended that contraception should or must be covered. It was Congress, not the [administration], that declined to expressly require contraceptive coverage in the ACA itself.\" Justices Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined Thomas's opinion. Justice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in the judgment, in which Stephen Breyer joined. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented, saying the court's ruling \"leaves women workers to fend for themselves.\"[420]\nIn a later lawsuit brought by private health insurance buyers and businesses, Judge Reed O'Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in March 2023 that the ACA's provision of contraceptives, HIV testing, and screenings for cancer, diabetes, and mental health violated the plaintiffs' freedom of religious exercise, and placed an injunction on that portion of the ACA. The Biden administration planned to seek a hold on O'Connor's decision.[421]\nKing v Burwell\nOn June 25, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, 6–3, that federal subsidies for health insurance premiums could be used in the 34 states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges.[422]\nHouse v. Price\nHouse Republicans sued the Obama administration in 2014, alleging that cost-sharing reduction subsidy payments to insurers were unlawful because Congress had not appropriated funds to pay for them. The argument classified the CSR subsidy as discretionary spending subject to annual appropriation. In May 2016, a federal judge ruled for the plaintiffs, but the Obama administration appealed.[423] Later, President Trump ended the payments. This led to further litigation.[424]\nUnited States House of Representatives v. Azar\nThe House sued the administration, alleging that the money for CSRs to insurers had not been appropriated, as required for any federal government spending. The ACA subsidy that helps customers pay premiums was not part of the suit.\nWithout the CSRs, the government estimated that premiums would increase by 20% to 30% for silver plans.[425] In 2017, the uncertainty about whether the payments would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina to try to raise premiums by 22.9% the next year, as opposed to an increase of 8.8% that it would have sought if the payments were assured.[426]\nU.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that the cost-sharing program was unconstitutional for spending money that has not been specifically provided by an act of Congress, but concluded that Congress had in fact authorized that program to be created. The judge also found that Congress had provided authority to cover the spending for the tax credits to consumers who use them to help afford health coverage.[427] Collyer enjoined further cost-sharing payments, but stayed the order pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The case ended in a settlement before the Circuit Court.\nCalifornia v. Texas\nTexas and 19 other states filed a civil suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in February 2018, arguing that with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which eliminated the tax for not having health insurance, the individual mandate no longer had a constitutional basis and thus the entire ACA was no longer constitutional.[428] The Department of Justice said it would no longer defend the ACA in court, but 17 states led by California stepped in to do so.[429]\nDistrict Judge Reed O'Connor of Texas ruled for the plaintiffs on December 14, 2018, writing that the \"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause—meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\" He then further reasoned that the individual mandate is an essential part of the entire law, and thus was not severable, making the entire law unconstitutional.[430][431] O'Connor's decision regarding severability turned on several passages from the Congressional debate that focused on the importance of the mandate.[432] While he ruled the law unconstitutional, he did not overturn the law.[429]\nThe intervening states appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit. These states argued that Congress's change in the tax was only reducing the amount of the tax, and that Congress had the power to write a stronger law to this end.[433][434] O'Connor stayed his decision pending the appeal.[435] The Fifth Circuit heard the appeal on July 9, 2019; in the interim, the U.S. Department of Justice joined with Republican states to argue that the ACA was unconstitutional, while the Democratic states were joined by the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. An additional question was addressed, as the Republican plaintiffs challenged the Democratic states' standing to defend the ACA.[436]\nIn December 2019, the Fifth Circuit agreed the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but did not agree that the entire law should be voided. Instead, it remanded the case to the District Court for reconsideration of that question.[437] The Supreme Court accepted the case in March 2020, to be heard in the 2020–2021 term,[438] with the ruling likely falling after the 2020 elections.[439]\nDemocrats pointed out that the effect of invalidating the entire law would be to remove popular provisions such as the protection for preexisting conditions, and that the Republicans had still not offered any replacement plan—important issues in the 2020 elections.[439]\nOn June 17, 2021, the Court rejected the challenge in a 7–2 decision, ruling that Texas and the other plaintiff states did not have standing to challenge the provision, leaving the full ACA intact.[440][441][442]\nSection 1557\nIn April 2024, the Biden administration issued a final rule implementing Section 1557 of the ACA, adding gender identity to Title IX's definition of discrimination based on sex.[443][444] In May 2024, 15 states led by Tennessee sued HHS in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, arguing that the 2024 rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution.[445] In October 2025, a federal judge struck down the 2024 rule to the extent that it prohibits discrimination against transgender people in education and health-care programs.[446]\nRisk corridors\nThe Supreme Court ruled that promised risk corridor payments must be made even in the absence of specific appropriation of money by Congress.[84]\nNon-cooperation\nOfficials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those elements over which they had discretion.[447][448] For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law.[449] Other Republicans discouraged efforts to advertise the law's benefits. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.[450][451]\nRepeal and modification efforts\nACA was the subject of many unsuccessful repeal efforts by Republicans in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses: Representatives Steve King and Michele Bachmann introduced bills in the House to repeal the ACA the day after it was signed, as did Senator Jim DeMint in the Senate.[452] In 2011, after Republicans gained control of the House, one of the first votes held was on a bill titled \"Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act\" (H.R. 2), which the House passed 245–189.[453] All Republicans and three Democrats voted for repeal.[454] In the Senate, the bill was offered as an amendment to an unrelated bill, but was voted down.[455] President Obama said he would veto the bill had it passed.[456]\nOn February 3, 2015, the House of Representatives added its 67th repeal vote to the record (239 to 186). This attempt also failed.[457]\n2013 federal government shutdown\nStrong partisan disagreement in Congress prevented adjustments to the Act's provisions.[458] But at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, received bipartisan support.[459] Some Congressional Republicans argued against improvements to the law on the grounds that they would weaken the arguments for repeal.[329][460]\nRepublicans attempted to defund the ACA's implementation,[448][461] and in October 2013 House Republicans refused to fund the federal government unless it came with an implementation delay, after Obama unilaterally deferred the employer mandate by one year, which critics claimed he had no power to do. The House passed three versions of a bill funding the government while submitting various versions that would repeal or delay the ACA, with the last version delaying enforcement of the individual mandate. The Democratic Senate leadership said the Senate would pass only a bill without any restrictions on ACA. The government shutdown lasted from October 1 to October 17.[462][463][464]\n2017 repeal effort\nDuring a midnight congressional session starting January 11, the Senate of the 115th Congress of the United States voted to approve a \"budget blueprint\" that would allow Republicans to repeal parts of the law \"without threat of a Democratic filibuster\".[465][466] The plan, which passed 51–48, was named by Senate Republicans the \"Obamacare 'repeal resolution.'\"[467] Democrats opposing the resolution staged a protest during the vote.[468]\nHouse Republicans announced their replacement, the American Health Care Act, on March 6.[469] On March 24, the AHCA failed amid a revolt among Republican representatives.[470]\nOn May 4 the House voted to pass the AHCA by a margin of 217 to 213.[471] The Senate Republican leadership announced that Senate Republicans would write their own version of the bill instead of voting on the House version.[472]\nLeader McConnell named a group of 13 Republicans to draft the substitute version in private, raising bipartisan concerns about lack of transparency.[473][474][475] On June 22, Republicans released the first discussion draft, which renamed it the \"Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017\" (BCRA).[476] On July 25, although no amendment proposal had garnered majority support, Republicans voted to advance the bill to the floor and begin formal consideration of amendments. Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were the only two dissenting Republicans, making the vote a 50–50 tie. Vice President Mike Pence then cast the tie-breaking vote in the affirmative.[477]\nThe revised BCRA failed, 43–57. A subsequent \"Obamacare Repeal and Reconciliation Act\" abandoned the \"repeal and replace\" approach in favor of a straight repeal, but that too failed, 45–55. Finally, the \"Health Care Freedom Act\", nicknamed \"skinny repeal\" because it would have made the least change to ACA, failed by 49–51, with Collins, Murkowski, and McCain joining all Democrats and independents in voting against it.[478]\nProposed changes in 2024\nDonald Trump, who has historically opposed the ACA,[479][480][481] said during the 2024 United States presidential debates that he had \"concepts of a plan\" to modify or scrap it. JD Vance has said that Trump intends to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or disability, with subsidized insurance replaced with private insurance.[482][483][484] Kamala Harris said she would \"maintain and grow\" the ACA.[485][486]\nFederal government shutdown 2025\nDuring the 2025 federal government shutdown, the Affordable Care Act once again became a focal point of partisan disagreement. On November 8–9, 2025, as the shutdown reached its 39th day, President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans to redirect federal funds used for ACA insurance subsidies toward direct cash payments to individuals, framing the proposal as a strategy to resolve the budgetary impasse. Several Republican senators expressed openness to considering the idea, while Democrats rejected it. Analysts noted that the proposal lacked the bipartisan support necessary to reopen the federal government. Contemporary reports described the dispute over the ACA's subsidy structure as one of the key issues contributing to the protracted shutdown.[487] Trump believes that this law will expire once its tax credit is eliminated and is not renewed.[488]\nThe disagreement focused on whether to continue the enhanced premium tax credits expanded under previous legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, which lowered the portion of health insurance costs paid by consumers. Observers noted that if these subsidies were allowed to expire, many individuals could face significant premium increases, potentially more than doubling for some enrollees. This raised concerns about decreased enrollment in the ACA marketplaces, especially among individuals who previously received little or no subsidy.[489]\nIn addition to the impacts on consumers, small businesses and self-employed individuals relying on ACA marketplace plans faced potential financial strain. Reports also highlighted that certain federal health agency employees were furloughed during the shutdown, temporarily affecting the oversight and administration of health programs. The debate over ACA funding illustrated how federal budget impasses can have immediate effects on both insurance markets and the delivery of health services.[490][491][492]\nActions to hinder implementation\nUnder both the ACA (current law) and the AHCA, the CBO reported that the health exchange marketplaces would remain stable.[494] But Republican politicians took a variety of steps to undermine it, creating uncertainty that adversely impacted enrollment and insurer participation while increasing premiums.[495] Concern about the exchanges became another argument for reforms. Past and ongoing Republican attempts to weaken the law have included:\n- Lawsuits such as King v. Burwell and House v. Price.\n- President Trump ended the payment of cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers on October 12, 2017. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15–20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.[496] In response, insurers sued the government for reimbursement. Various cases are under appeal as of 2019.[424] Several insurers and actuarial groups estimated this resulted in a 20 percentage point or more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year. In other words, premium increases expected to be 10% or less in 2018 became 28–40% instead.[497][498] The insurers would need to make up the $7 billion they had previously received in cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) by raising premiums. Since most premiums are subsidized, the federal government would cover most of the increases. CBO also estimated that initially up to one million fewer people would have health insurance coverage, although rising subsidies might eventually offset this. The 85% of enrollees who received subsidies would be unaffected. CBO expected the exchanges to remain stable (i.e., no \"death spiral\" before or after Trump's action) as the premiums would increase and prices would stabilize at the higher (non-CSR) level.[499] Several insurance companies who sued the United States for failure to pay CSRs won cases in 2018 and 2019. The judiciary decided the insurance companies are entitled to unpaid CSRs.[424][500]\n- The 2015 appropriations bill had a rider that ended the payment of risk corridor funds. This was repeated in later years. This resulted in the bankruptcy of many co-ops. This action was attributed to Senator Marco Rubio.[501] The cutoff generated some 50 lawsuits. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2019 in the case Maine Community Health Options v. United States.[502][503][504]\n- Trump weakened the individual mandate with his first executive order, which limited enforcement of the tax. For example, tax returns without indications of health insurance (\"silent returns\") will still be processed, overriding Obama's instructions to reject them.[505]\n- Trump reduced funding for advertising for exchange enrollment by up to 90%, with other reductions to support resources used to answer questions and help people sign-up for coverage.[506] The CBO said the reductions would reduce ACA enrollment.[496]\n- Trump reduced the enrollment period for 2018 by half, to 45 days.[507]\n- Trump made public statements that the exchanges were unstable or in a death spiral.[508]\nPerceived inadequacies\nIn December 2009, former DNC chairman and former Vermont governor Howard Dean called the ACA \"a bigger bailout for the insurance industry than AIG\" and \"an insurance company's dream\". He viewed the bill's end form as a death of the health care reform effort.[509]\nIn his 2011 book Remedy and Reaction, Paul Starr, the former senior advisor for Bill Clinton's health care reform plan, notes that the ACA did not make health insurance a right and did not make medical care free at the point of service. He criticizies the ACA on the grounds that some lower-income individuals still cannot afford treatment and go without care \"if health care and insurance are treated as ordinary commodities\".[510]\nThe ACA's critics often cite its inability to control costs and lower deductibles,[511][512] the difficulty for average people to compare plans,[513] lack of a strong public option, and inadequate regulations on or alternatives (such as co-operatives) to large corporate health care companies.[514]\nImplementation\nIn 2010 small business tax credits took effect.[515] Then Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) took effect to offer insurance to those who had been denied coverage by private insurance companies because of a preexisting condition.[515] By 2011, insurers had stopped marketing child-only policies in 17 states, as they sought to escape this requirement.[516] In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion.[517][518][519]\nIn 2013, the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the cost of covering only the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income. Family plans would not be considered even if the cost was above the 9.5% income threshold.[520][521] On July 2 Obama delayed the employer mandate until 2015.[327][522][523] The launch for both the state and federal exchanges was beset by management and technical failings. HealthCare.gov, the website that offers insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered many problems.[524] Operations stabilized in 2014, although not all planned features were complete.[525][526]\nThe Government Accountability Office released a non-partisan study in 2014 that concluded the administration had not provided \"effective planning or oversight practices\" in developing the exchanges.[527] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court exempted closely held corporations with religious convictions from the contraception rule.[528] At the beginning of the 2015, 11.7 million had signed up (ex-Medicaid).[529] By the end of the year about 8.8 million consumers had stayed in the program.[530] Congress repeatedly delayed the onset of the \"Cadillac tax\" on expensive insurance plans first until 2020[531] and later until 2022 and repealed it in late 2019.[97]\nAn estimated 9 to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage in 2016, mostly low-income adults. The five major national insurers expected to lose money on ACA policies in 2016,[532] in part because the enrollees were lower income, older and sicker than expected.[533]\nMore than 9.2 million people (3.0 million new customers and 6.2 million returning) enrolled on the national exchange in 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump.[534] The eleven states that run their own exchanges signed up about 3 million more.[534] The IRS announced that it would not require that tax returns indicate a person has health insurance, reducing the effectiveness of the individual mandate, in response to Trump's executive order.[535] The CBO reported in March that the healthcare exchanges were expected to be stable.[494] In May the House voted to repeal the ACA using the American Health Care Act (AHCA), but the AHCA was defeated in the Senate.[536][537] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set the individual mandate penalty at $0 starting in 2019.[56] The CBO estimated that the change would cause 13 million fewer people to have health insurance in 2027.[538]\nThe 2017 Individual Market Stabilization Bill was proposed to fund cost-sharing reductions,[539] provide more flexibility for state waivers, allow a new \"Copper Plan\" offering only catastrophic coverage, allow interstate insurance compacts, and redirect consumer fees to states for outreach. The bill failed.\nBy 2019, 35 states and the District of Columbia had either expanded coverage via traditional Medicaid or via an alternative program.[540]\nIn popular culture\nSNL presented a sketch in October 2009 about the legislation's gridlock, with Dwayne Johnson playing an angry President Obama confronting three senators opposing the plan.[541]\nThe show aired another sketch in September 2013 with Jay Pharoah as President Obama rolling out the plan to the public, and Aaron Paul and other cast members playing ordinary Americans helping him in advocating for the legislation.[542]\nSee also\n- Broccoli mandate\n- Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\n- Individual shared responsibility provision\n- Massachusetts health care reform (sometimes called \"Romneycare\")\n- Medicaid\n- Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Reform to the American Health Care system signed into law by President Obama)\n- Single-payer health care\n- Blue Dog Coalition\n- Universal health care\n- Universal health coverage by country\n- U.S. health care compared with eight other countries (tabular form)\nReferences\n- ^ a b c d Oberlander, Jonathan (June 1, 2010). \"Long Time Coming: Why Health Reform Finally Passed\".

We asked analysts from The Heritage Foundation to examine what is in the bill text. Here are their responses:\n>>> View the Budget Reconciliation Tracker\nBudget Gimmicks\nThe White House’s newly released framework returns to a tried-and-true way to obscure the true cost of the legislation: budget gimmicks. The current reconciliation instructions place caps on the 10-year deficit impact of provisions that could be included in the bill.\nHowever, the new framework provides partial funding for many programs—creating temporary benefits that are clearly intended to be made permanent. This means that the cost estimates in this framework are only the tip of the iceberg of what the White House has planned.\nFor example, both the child care and pre-K provisions are reported as being given “funding for six years” despite both being listed also as “a long-term program.” The Obamacare tax credit extension would last only through 2025. The expanded Child and Earned Income tax credits would each be extended for only one year.\nKeep in mind that the annual cost for each of these programs would, likely, be higher in the 10th year of the budgetary window than in the first year. As such:\n- Childcare and Pre-K: Actual 10-year cost is likely more than twice the reported cost of $400 billion\n- Obamacare Tax Credit: Actual 10-year cost is likely much more than three times the reported cost of $130 billion.\n- Child and Earned Income Tax Credits: Actual 10-year cost is likely more than 10times the reported cost of $200 billion.\nIn total, these programs would likely cost well over $2.3 trillion above the estimate in this framework over 10 years. This excess would be more than $18,700 of new spending per American household.\nThese gimmicks will set up future congresses with intentionally tough votes whether to extend new entitlement benefits. This process is clearly intended to circumvent the fiscally responsible controls in the reconciliation process. Using these gimmicks, the bill could be used to sneak in much larger debt-busting spending.\nThe issue here is not simply the spending—it is where that money comes from and where it goes.\nBy front-loading the spending and spreading tax hikes across 10 years, the framework would increase already-high inflationary pressures. Even worse, the taxes would suppress business investment at a time when the economic recovery is in danger of stalling out.\nThe drafters of this framework use the term “investment” to cover their planned corporate cronyism and wealth redistribution. This bill would make no investment—it would only misdirect the wealth generated by all Americans through their hard work.\nMake no mistake, this plan is ultimately a framework for how much Biden wants to take out of your wallet to fund his ideological interests.\n– Richard Stern is a senior policy analyst focusing on budget policy at The Heritage Foundation and David Ditch is a policy analyst at Heritage’s Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget\nChild Allowance Tax Credit\nIn March, Democrats transformed the child tax credit into a $250 to $300 per child\nmonthly child allowance—no work conditions attached. Now, Democrat’s newly released framework would extend the monthly child allowance for another year, through the end of 2022.\nThe child tax credit used to increase as low-income parents worked more. The Biden child allowance, however, now go to non-working families because they removed the child tax credit’s existing requirement to work. Proponents insist that this giveaway won’t substantially affect low-income parents’ interest in working, but a new study has made it clear what history also teaches us: Fewer low-income families will work.\nThe Biden administration has claimed that this change would provide tax relief to families; in reality, this is a “bait and switch” claim. The vast majority of the spending would send unconditional welfare checks to low-income Americans.\nThis policy will subsidize nonworking families, increasing the likelihood that the most vulnerable will remain outside the workforce. It also will subsidize single parenthood, including among teens, thereby weakening the probability that children will be raised by a married mother and father. Overall, the policy will undermine marriage and discourage work, fewer children will experience social success and upward mobility, and low-income Americans will be left behind.\nHistory teaches us the failures of such a flawed policy. In the 1990s, Congress replaced a failed program, Aide to Families with Dependent Children, with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, a work-based program. Prior to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, income families faced profoundly negative results from no-strings attached cash benefits.\nOne in seven children was dependent on the Aide to Families with Dependent Children welfare program, and intergenerational poverty worsened. Some 90% of cash-safety-net recipients were single mothers; the majority were never married. The majority of families were on Aide to Families with Dependent Children welfare program rolls for an average of eight years.Work among the recipient parents was extremely low—nearly nine in 10 families were workless. Many remained in long-term poverty.\nMoreover, researchers at the University of Chicago have warned that the Democrats’ effort to rollback work-requirements in welfare would lay the stage for history to repeat itself. The researchers found that 1.5 million workers—2.6% of all working parents—would exit the labor force if the child allowance is made permanent. Accounting for the drop in work, the authors calculate that the child allowance would not ease deep child poverty (families making less than $18,945). This is a far cry from the 39% reduction in deep poverty the left promised.\nUnpublished data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests the payments may already be reducing work. When the pandemic began, parents experienced fewer employment losses. But since the late spring of this year—coinciding with the beginning of the child payments—that trend reversed, and parents’ employment actually declined.\nOur nation’s safety net already serves tens of millions of people with over $1.1 trillion federal tax dollars allocated to 89 means-tested federal welfare programs, including nearly $500 billion spent on means-tested cash, food, housing, and medical care for poor and low-income families with children. This money has a direct impact on the well-being of poor and lower-income Americans and often provides incentives that are actively harmful to the poor, including by undermining marriage formation.\nPolicymakers are rightly looking for ways to support marriage, encourage work, foster upward mobility, and help more Americans to overcome poverty and attain self-sufficiency. Those who want to achieve that goal should begin by rejecting Biden’s plan to reverse the successes of a quarter-century of work-based welfare reform.\n– Leslie Ford, a visiting Fellow focusing on domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, and Rachel Greszler, a research fellow focusing on economics, the budget, and entitlements at The Heritage Foundation\nCorporate Tax\nThe framework claims it will raise $325 billion from a 15% corporate minimum tax on large companies’ book income. Book income is what companies report in their financial statements. Different accounting rules apply for determining taxable income and book income, and that’s by design.\nIt’s troubling that the rules for determining book income are determined by a Connecticut-based nonprofit, the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Effectively, Congress could be handing some of its taxing authority over to a private organization.\nAdvocates of the new minimum tax justify the tax on the grounds that some corporations “get away with” not paying tax in certain years.\nCorporations often pay zero taxes in a year because of losses in that year or because they accrued net operating losses in prior years. Net operating losses are an efficient, desirable feature of a corporate income tax because they help ensure that the tax code is not biased against businesses with large year-over-year fluctuations in loss and income.\nSuppose Company A has $1 million of profit one year and another $1 million profit in the second year. Company B, on the other hand, suffers a loss of $10 million in the first year, followed by a gain of $12 million in the second year. Note: both companies have a total profit of $2 million over the second years. If not for the allowance of net operating losses, Company B would have to pay tax on $12 million of profit in the second year but would get no tax relief for the $10 million of losses incurred in the first year.\nIntroducing a minimum tax on book income complicates and distorts the net operating losses system by leaving certain taxpayers unable to use net operating losses to offset future gains. Book income does not factor in net operating losses, introducing a bias in the tax code against companies with large fluctuations in loss and income. This bias would extend to companies that have a significant one-time investment expense leading to a taxable loss. Effectively, this plan would force certain Taxpayers to pay taxes on their losses, dollar for dollar, as if they were income.\nSince the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, companies have been able to immediately expense investments in short-lived assets. By encouraging capital investment, this is one of the most pro-growth policies in the tax code. The minimum tax would counterproductively work to offset these pro-growth expensing provisions, because under current financial accounting rules, such expenses may only be deducted over the course of several years.\nUnder the present tax system, when companies do consistently avoid paying tax, it is usually because they are able to claim preferential tax credits that are only available to favored businesses or industries. Unfortunately, there are dozens of provisions now being considered that would expand corporate tax credits.\nMinimum taxes are burdensome to administer and comply with, as they effectively represent entirely new parallel tax systems. In addition to the corporate profits minimum tax, Congress is also weighing expansion of another minimum tax system in the international tax code. These additional layers of complexity are good news for auditors and accountants, but bad news for businesses that want to focus on improving the goods and services they provide.\n– Preston Brashers is a senior policy analyst focusing on tax policy at The Heritage Foundation\nEnergy\nDemocrats went back to the playbook of the 2000s and are regurgitating stale energy policies that don’t work to subsidize politically preferred energy technologies through the tax code. Included in the House Democrats’ massive spending package is a $555 billion wealth transfer from taxpayers to fund the lifestyle choices of wealthy Americans, corporations, and environmental activists.\nThe biggest ticket item is $320 billion in tax subsidies for electric vehicles, solar energy, wind turbines, biofuels and other boutique fuels, and other so-called green energy technologies. This is to say nothing of the $10 billion for college programs to train a generation of environmental activists, $2.5 billion for “tree equity,” and $5 million apiece for desert fish and bee conservation.\nIt’s bad enough that years of lobbying by special interests appears to be working. Back in 2015, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise in the omnibus spending bill to extend credits one more time and put them on a schedule to sunset in 2022, a decision that diverted over $14 billion to the green energy industry. From the beginning, these credits were designed to be temporary but have expired, been extended, re-extended, and retroactively extended for decades.\nThe bill would not only renew these tax credits—it would expand them by making them available for cash rebates. Of course companies are taking the hint and already figuring out creative ways to cash in—for example, by buying electric vehicles to offer as rental cars and loaners just to get the tax write off. While that may be a shrewd business move one can’t blame companies for making, one should blame Congress for being all too willing to push policies that put taxpayers on the bill for it.\nYet somehow, the left has managed to make these green energy subsidies even worse. Tied to tax credits for electric vehicles, wind, and solar are additional bonuses for labor unions. While the framework promises to help “more Americans to join and remain in the labor force,” it intentionally rigs the game against workers who choose not to join a labor union and against foreign-owned companies investing in the U.S.\nIronically, this could harm plans for expansive new manufacturing spaces for electric vehicles and batteries—allegedly the very technologies the left wants—by companies that don’t fit the bill’s narrow agenda.\nTo be very clear—the problem isn’t green energy technologies. The problem is cronyist energy policy that are patently unfair, increase barriers to entry for innovative technologies that don’t fit the government’s mold, mask risks and costs, and encourage behavior our common sense might otherwise dissuade us from.\nIf Congress wants to support energy innovation in the U.S., it should be moving closer to—not further from—a pro-growth, competitive tax policy. This should include getting rid of alltargeted energy tax credits and championing policies like full and immediate expensing of R&D, short-term assets (like tools and equipment) and long-term assets (like manufacturing space).\nWe know what the results of good energy policy can look like. Between 2018 and 2019, the economy was breaking records in growth and employment as average energy costs fell 5% and Americans’ per capita energy costs decreased in every state except California. And yet the left wants the rest of America to look like California and is trying to export the state’s climate policy experiment through the tax code and the Biden administration’s regulatory agenda.\nIf green energy technologies are low-cost and competitive, why is Congress still throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at them every year? And what will it take to get Congress to keep the promise it made in 2015?\n– Katie Tubb is a senior policy analyst focusing on energy and environment at The Heritage Foundation\nEnergy Tax\nThe White House has been trying to use the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next week to force a vote on its radical social and economic legislative agenda and to force unity within the Democrat party. As the Build Back Better bill’s total spending has been whittled down (which isn’t saying much considering the whopping $1.7 trillion price tag), centerpiece climate policies like the Clean Electricity Performance Plan have gone to the wayside.\nThat’s a relief for taxpayers and electricity customers alike, however harmful climate policies still remain in addition to hundreds of billions in spending on green energy subsidies.\nOne consequential climate policy still on the table is a fee on oil and natural gas. The bill would amend the Clean Air Act to create a whole new program in the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and fine methane emissions from onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage, imports, and exports.\nGiven that oil and natural gas provide over two-thirds of Americans’ total energy use—think heat, power, transportation – it’s basically an energy tax. Policies that increase the costs of energy harm all people, and particularly the poor. Further, oil and natural gas are critical feedstocks for making thousands of products that improve Americans’ lives—pharmaceuticals and hospital equipment, food safety packaging, fertilizer, road top, even cosmetics and sports equipment.\nThe House bill gives the EPA $775 million to monitor methane emissions, administer and collect fines, and set regulations which the bill directs the EPA to make even more strict within two years. A grant program is perhaps meant to soften the blow, but it’s a fantasy to think that the higher costs of producing oil and gas won’t be passed down to customers—who will also be paying a second time as taxpayers to foot the bill for this new EPA program.\nTo make matters worse, the bill would also ban new production of oil and gas off of nearly all of America’s coastline.\nThe Biden administration acknowledges eliminating all greenhouse emissions from the US will have no meaningful impact on global temperatures. Yet the administration and allies in Congress continues to push punishing climate policies that will raise costs and taxes on American families and businesses.\nIn 2015, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said: “Time and time again, Republicans pledge their allegiance to foreign special interests above the American middle class.” He was speaking of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have brought Canadian energy, investment, and jobs for Americans. Ironically, the Biden administration and allies in Congress are all too eager to force through a penalizing bill on American families and businesses just to curry favor with countries at Glasgow.\nWhile the Biden administration has made climate change an end all be all, there’s something missing in his agenda: support for American families and businesses.\n– Katie Tubb\nHealth Care\nThe proposal would make existing Affordable Care Act subsidies more generous and make them available to more people, regardless of income.\nSpecifically, individuals with income between 100% and 150% of the federal poverty line would no longer have to contribute to the cost of their Obamacare premiums. Obamacare subsidies would be extended to the “rich”—defined here as individuals with incomes above 400% poverty, and it would also offer new federal subsidies for those individuals in state that chose not to adopt the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in lieu of the creation of a new Medicaid-public option.\nAlthough the subsidies are temporary since they are tethered to Obamacare (another budget gimmick), these changes are intended to drive more people to the government-run Obamacare exchanges, including some of whom would have otherwise had insurance.\nThe more people enrolled in Obamacare, the more the government controls the delivery of care and benefits. Moreover, these changes attempt to cover up the fact that Obamacare is driving up—not down—the costs of coverage, and that means that the mega-insurance plans in Obamacare will continue to raise premiums, knowing that ultimately the taxpayers will pick up the cost.\nIt changes the requirements for those with access to employer-based coverage to qualify for Obamacare subsidies.\nUnder current law, individuals with access to employer-based coverage are not eligible for Obamacare subsidies unless their share of the premium costs exceed 9.2%. The bill would lower that threshold to 8.5%.\nThe private, employer-based market is where the majority of American still get their health care and remains a critical obstacle to a full-blown government-run health care plan. Lowering the threshold is a small, but significant, shift in the opposite direction.\nThis change alongside expanding the availability of subsidies could disrupt the employer-based market by driving more people out of their existing coverage and toward the government-run plan. A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate notes that the package of policies embedded in the plan would result in 2.8 million fewer people with employer-based coverage.\nThe proposal blocks access to information about non-Obamacare coverage options. The bill would prohibit federal funds from being used to “promote non-[Affordable Care Act] compliant health insurance coverage” and explicitly defines short-duration and association health plans as such options.\nThis comes on the heels of the Biden administration’s move earlier this year to use taxpayer money to fund a marketing campaign to promote Obamacare.\nWith rising costs and fewer options, many Americans have sought out alternative health care arrangements. Promoting Obamacare over non-Obamacare alternatives is yet another attempt to shut down private competition and drive people to the government-run Obamacare exchanges, where the government determines access to the coverage options.\n– Nina Owcharenko Schaefer is a senior research fellow focusing on health policy at The Heritage Foundation\nHigher Education\nBiden’s framework would spend $40 billion to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $550, send additional subsidies to historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, and provide additional funding for community colleges and workforce development.\nThese additional federal subsidies will only encourage schools to raise prices, shifting more of the burden of paying for higher education from the student who benefits to all taxpayers.\nColleges will have received an additional $76 billion in federal spending over the past year and a half in response to COVID-19—a monumental sum nearly equivalent to the Department of Education’s entire annual discretionary budget. This plan would add tens of billions more.\nColleges have needed a course-correction for decades, and new federal subsidies will continue to enable general fiscal maladministration, avoiding necessary structural reforms, and changes at the university level that would actually reduce college costs.\nFor example, from 2001 to 2011, the number of non-teaching employees and administrators increased 50% faster than teaching faculty. Non-instructional staff now accounts for more than half of university payroll costs.\nEver-increasing college costs fueled in part by federal subsidies have muddied colleges’ value proposition. Across the country, tuition and fees for in-state students attending four-year universities have nearly tripled in real terms since 1990. Since 1970, inflation-adjusted tuition rates have quintupled at both public and private colleges.\nFederal subsidies have increased dramatically, with spending on student loans rising 328 percent over the last 30 years, from $20.4 billion during the 1989-90 school year to $87.5 billion during the 2019-20 school year. As University of Ohio economist Richard Vedder explains:\n[I]t takes more resources today to educate a postsecondary student than a generation ago… Relative to other sectors of the economy, universities are becoming less efficient, less productive, and, consequently, more costly.\nThis spending package, by adding another $40 billion in federal subsidies, will only continue this trend, fueling increases in higher education costs while shifting more of the burden onto taxpayers.\n– Lindsey Burke is the director of The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy and the Mark A. Kolokotrones fellow in Education\nHousing\nThe framework’s proposed spending on affordable housing will fund the efforts of D.C. bureaucrats to intrude on local housing policies in a concerted effort to socially reengineer communities through the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule.\nThe Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule’s objectives are pursued by conditioning federal housing grants—particularly from the Community Development Block Grant program—on local governments approving affordable housing projects, transportation initiatives, and zoning guidelines preferred by the federal government.\nThe Trump administration suspended Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule in 2018, and terminated it in July 2020. Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, explained that the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule is “unworkable and ultimately a waste of time for localities to comply with, too often resulting in funds being steered away from communities that need them most.”\nThe Biden administration restored the definitions and certification requirements of Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule in June 2021. Affordability concerns are best addressed by voluntary reforms of local land use regulations, eliminating rent control, and making it easier for landlords to evict non-paying tenants.\nDown payment assistance will further stoke price increases in the price of housing—especially for lower and moderately priced homes most likely to be purchased by recipients of these grants. Although a select few purchasers may benefit from the proceeds, other families seeking to purchase homes will suffer from the increase in costs.\nFurthermore, property tax burdens may increase as the valuation of these properties increases from this artificial injection of additional capital into the housing market.\n– Joel Griffith is a research fellow focusing on financial regulations at The Heritage Foundation\nImmigration\nThe Biden administration has turned the U.S. immigration system into immigration chaos, and now the left wants American taxpayers to pay for it. The Democrats will continue to try to ram through amnesty using budget tricks. This will effectively reward illegal immigrants and will fuel the surge we are seeing play out every day at our southern border.\nThe Biden administration has itself to blame for inflating the backlog of immigration benefit applications. When they continue to add hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to the application line, those who followed the law and apply for legitimate benefits are forced to wait years longer to have their application adjudicated.\nWhat’s more, immigration benefits are fee-based. This is sound fiscal policy as applicants, not taxpayers, should pay for their own benefit application. To force U.S. taxpayers to pay for the Biden administration’s own backlog punishes Americans, fails to hold the administration accountable for their open border policies, and hurts lawful immigrants, their family members, and employers.\n“Expanding legal representation” is a euphemism for taxpayer-funded attorneys for deportable aliens. Aliens already have a right to counsel in (civil) immigration proceedings, but at no expense to the government. The left has sought to chip away at this sound fiscal policy for decades, starting with illegal alien minors.\nRequiring taxpayers to fund attorneys would be a fiscal bottomless pit, given the unknown millions of illegal aliens already in the country, plus the unending flow of illegal aliens currently crossing the border, plus the years’ long immigration court backlogs.\nFurthermore, it would treat deportable aliens better than U.S. citizens, who do not have a right to taxpayer-funded attorneys in civil proceedings.\nThe left continues to ruin our asylum system while calling it “efficient and humane.” Asylum is intended to protect those who suffered or have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Yet the left shoe horns in general violence, crime, and climate change into membership in a particular social group and labels them asylees.\nThose conditions do not meet the definition for asylum and such applicants are not eligible. Watering down asylum to declare every applicant eligible hurts those who truly faced or fear real persecution. This is chaotic and inhumane.\nThe House Rules Committee is considering text that is different from the president’s framework language that would do the following:\n- Provide amnesty to illegal aliens who entered the U.S. prior to January 1, 2010. The House text uses the little-known registry section of the Immigration and Nationality Act to legalize unknown millions of illegal aliens. This was the Senate Democrats’ “plan B” approach to amnesty, which the Senate Parliamentarian already rejected.\n- “Recapture unused visas.” The Immigration and Nationality Act currently places an annual cap on family-based and employment-bases visas; the first to limit chain migration and the second to protect American workers. Also, under current law, “unused” visas are added to the next fiscal year cap, providing for two bites of the apple for utilization. Advocates of the House bill text ignore this current formula, ignore the purpose of visa caps, and seek unlimited visas.\n- Accelerate adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence for visa petition beneficiaries whose visas are not immediately available due to annual caps. This would benefit corporations and universities, but ignore worker protections for Americans.\n- Require several additional filing fees for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n- Appropriate $2.8 billion to decrease the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services backlog. As stated above, applicants, not American taxpayers, should fund application adjudications. To decrease the backlog, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services should adjust its fees to eliminate many fee waivers and exemptions and the Biden administration should end its open border policies that put so many illegal aliens in the benefit queue, thereby increasing the backlog.\n– Lora Ries is the director of The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Technology Policy and a senior research fellow focused on homeland security at Heritage’s Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy\nIncome Tax\nThe latest version of the Build Back Better Act would raise the top individual income tax rate even higher than the prior House Ways and Means version of the bill did. Rather than directly raising the top personal income tax rate or creating a new tax bracket, the bill raises taxes by sneaking a surcharge on high income individuals.\nThe surcharge starts at 5% for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income of $10 million and rises to 8% for taxpayer over $25 million.\nThe bill also would expand the 3.8% net investment income tax to apply to all net income, not just investment income. The top individual income tax rate (before these add-on taxes) is already set to increase from 37% to 39.6% in 2026. Adding this up yields a top federal income tax rate of 51.4%.\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that the average top marginal state and local tax rate is 6.0%, bringing the average top combined federal-state-local tax rate to 57.4%.\nAccording to the Tax Foundation’s estimates, this is higher than the 2026 statutory income tax rate of every other country in the OECD, inclusive of subnational taxes.\nTaxpayers in high-tax states and cities would have it even worse. Taxpayers in New York City face a top combined state and city income tax rate of 14.776%, meaning some Big Apple residents would have a staggering 66.176% total income tax rate.\nIt likely wouldn’t stop there, though. The taxes imposed in the Build Back Better plan are imposed for 10 years but fund the extravagant social agenda for fewer years. Any extensions of the programs would only push taxes higher. Worse, the looming crisis of existing unfunded entitlement programs could drive those exorbitant taxes yet higher.\nHouse Democrats also released another bill this week that would modestly reduce Social Security’s shortfalls, by including an additional 12.4% payroll tax on income above $400,000. Our unfortunate New York City resident could then face a whopping 78.576% combined income tax rate.\nThis isn’t just money out of the pockets of wealthy individuals. This will stall business investment, drive down economic growth, and drive up unemployment. Entrepreneurship will slow to a crawl. Regardless of how one feels about individuals with very high incomes, the reality is that most of their money is used in ways that help small businesses start and grow, that leads to new and better products and services, and that creates jobs with rising wages.\nFar fewer people will be willing to take risks or to invest in things that create widespread benefits if government will claim almost all the rewards.\n– Preston Brashers and Rachel Greszler\nIRS Slush Fund\nThe bill would provide a massive $79 billion slush fund for the Internal Revenue Service, paid in a lump sum and available to use through 2031.\nThis slush fund is about six times the IRS’ entire annual budget. The IRS had a $13 billion budget in 2021, including $5 billion for nearly 35,000 enforcement agents.\nThe bill would even give the secretary of the Treasury, “or the Secretary’s delegate,” “personnel flexibilities” to “to take such personnel actions as the Secretary (or the Secretary’s delegate) determines necessary to administer the Internal Revenue Code.”\nThere simply is no credible way for the scandal–ridden and union-dominated agency to absorb so much extra funding and power while avoiding waste, fraud, and abuse.\nThis slush fund raises the risk of returning to a politicized IRS. The IRS has a decades-long history of overreach and abuse, from the collecting of a list of enemies of the Nixon administration to attempting to fire a whistleblower who participated in a series of hearings on IRS abuse in the Clinton administration to the infamous targeting scandal under the Obama administration to the leak of confidential taxpayer records and associating the teachings of the Bible with a political party this year.\nThe bill would also provide $105 million to the Treasury’s Office of Tax Policy to issue new regulations and $153 million to the U.S. Tax Court.\n– Matthew Dickerson\nLabor Unions\nThe framework includes $350,000,000 that will be allocated to the National Labor Relations Board for the fiscal year 2022. The funds will remain available until Sept. 30, 2026.\nAccording to the Build Back Better plan, this money will be used to fund the implementation of electronic voting for union elections. The federal government should not involve itself in union elections. Unions should fund electronic voting through the dues they receive from their members.\nAs a self-professed “union guy,” Biden has strongly advocated for greater unionization in the U.S. workforce. American workers, however, do not seem to agree.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the union membership rate declined to 10.8% in 2020 with strong union presence among public sector workers. In fact, the union membership rate has been in decline for approximately the past 40 years.\nThe Biden administration’s plans to increase unionization are evidently misaligned with the needs of the current labor market. With long-term societal trends showing diminished union favorability, Biden insists on using taxpayer funding to support his political objectives.\nBiden’s pro-union, anti-business economic policies are harmful to American firms, workers, and consumers. This provision uses taxpayer money to support union efforts, in essence, raising taxes on all Americans to provide a political giveaway to unions.\nUnions are partially to blame for the supply chain crisis plaguing the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. Strong union presence and restrictive operating procedures that resulted from union pressure and collective bargaining have left many Americans unconvinced that they should provide more of their earnings to support union activities.\nWith the salary of dock workers at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports averaging $171,000 annually, it is difficult to argue that these union workers are unable to fund their own election infrastructure.\nAside from high costs, Biden’s unionization efforts promote lower productivity that typically coincides with union participation. At a time when Americans are struggling with a supply chain crisis and rising consumer prices that are partially a result of unions, Americans would be better served by an administration that is more focused on free enterprise and free market labor policies.\nNow would be a good time for Biden to invoke his promise of unity and do what’s best for all Americans.\n– Elizabeth Hanke is a research fellow focusing on labor economics and policy at The Heritage Foundation\nMedicare\nThe bill adds a hearing services benefit to the Medicare program, effective Jan. 1, 2024. The provision would reimburse “qualified” audiologists and physicians for providing a variety of hearing services, as well as reimbursement for hearing aids. Payment rates are to be set by the secretary of Health and Human Services, and $370 million is appropriated for the implementation of the program.\nAs anticipated, the bill does not add dental or vision coverage. That’s a good thing—because all these benefits are a solution in search of a problem. They duplicate coverage already provided in private supplemental coverage as well as Medicare Advantage plans. Thus, the provision continues the step-by-step government crowd-out of the private financing and delivery of coverage and care.\n– Robert Moffit is a senior fellow focusing on health care and entitlement programs, particularly Medicare, at The Heritage Foundation\nMedicaid and Medicare\nThe legislation assumes a larger role for the federal government in Medicaid. The proposal would create a new grant program within Medicaid that would add new federal funding for home and community-based services.\nThe proposal would also impose new federal requirements on state Medicaid programs, would allow states to remove certain income limits to qualify for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and would weaken oversight and accountability through various policy changes.\nCongress already provided significant federal Medicaid resources to the states, including for home- and community-based services earlier this year. Using Medicaid to solve the country’s health care woes is shortsighted and poorly targeted, and supplanting state flexibility with federal mandates only makes matters worse.\nThese efforts would drive out private alternatives and stretch an already overburdened safety-net program.\nWhile the legislation drops dental and vision benefits, it still adds a new hearing benefit to the traditional Medicare program. To avoid an even bigger price tag, the benefit would be phased-in in 2024.\nWhile traditional Medicare does not include dental, vision, or hearing coverage, Medicare Advantage—the private Medicare alternatives—already offers many of these benefits to seniors without government intervention or interference.\nNot only does this proposal inject the government where it isn’t necessary, but also piles new obligations onto the already overdrawn Medicare program that will only accelerate the fragile fiscal circumstances facing the program.\n– Nina Owcharenko Schaefer\nPre-K and Child Care\nThe framework includes $400 billion in new spending for universal pre-K and large child care subsidies that cap parents’ child care costs at 7% of families’ income for those earning up to 250% of the state median income (topping out at $429,000 for a family of four in D.C.). Both programs would initially be funded for six years.\nInstead of reducing child care costs, expanding options, and helping more parents achieve the child care they desire, the proposals would drastically increase costs and restrict options to government-controlled providers.\nA whole host of government dictates—such as requiring subsidized providers to pay “living wages” ($27 per hour for a single mom in Mississippi and $39 in Boston) and that all Pre-K workers have a bachelor’s degree (despite zero evidence that such degrees make someone a better caretaker)—would easily drive up costs by 50% or more.\nAnd at the same time, the proposal would limit access to child care. In Chicago, the roll-out of universal pre-K is “strangling private day care,” as most parents send children to the government program, even if it doesn’t meet their needs. New Jersey’s “model” pre-K program has an accountability crisis and is wrought with political favoritism.\nThe proposed federal subsidies would likely be out-of-reach to faith-based providers, because in declaring them recipients of federal funds, it would compromise their ability to run their programs and hire workers according to their beliefs.\nPushing children into government-controlled, center-based child care that’s been shown to have negative impacts on kids’ and families’ long-term outcomes is not a sound “investment.”\nIn fact, the preeminent author of studies upon which these proposal are based, James Heckman, said, “I have never supported universal pre-school… Public preschool programs can potentially compensate for the home environments of disadvantaged children. No public preschool program can provide the environments and the parental love and care of a functioning family and the lifetime benefits that ensue.” He estimated that parental care has “rates of return of more like 30 or 40%.”\nWhile this proposal provides nothing to the majority of disproportionately low-income parents who prefer family-based care, it would provide $30,000 in child care subsidies to a couple with $344,000 income and two children living in D.C.\nIf policymakers really want to help families in need, they should expand choices for existing child care funds, including allowing parents to use the roughly $10,000 per child worth of ineffective Head Start spending at a provider of their choice.\n– Lindsey Burke and Rachel Greszler\nPrescription Drugs\nStill to be determined is whether the bill will include provisions to impose government price controls on prescription drugs.\nPrevious versions would have the federal government set prices for certain prescription drugs in the Medicare program, based on prices paid in other countries. Companies that refused to accept the government price would be subject to an excise tax.\nGovernment control over the price of pharmaceuticals means government control over access to pharmaceuticals. Like residents in those selected other countries, seniors would face less access and fewer choices under this model.\nMoreover, government price controls would not end with pharmaceuticals. Similar mechanisms are envisioned with a full-blown government-run program, where the government sets payment rates for all health care services.\nAmericans only need to look to Canada and the United Kingdom to see the impact such controls have on access to care, where wait lists are common and expected, and where access to treatments are limited or denied.\n– Nina Owcharenko Schaefer\nState and Local Tax Deduction\nBiden’s newest big government socialism framework makes no mention of repealing the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes—popularly known as “SALT.”\nAn important reform included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was to cap the SALT deduction at $10,000. The SALT deduction subsidizes high taxes imposed by state and local governments. The primary beneficiary of the SALT deduction is high-income taxpayers in high-tax states. Prior to the cap being put in place, the average millionaire from New York or California deducted more than $450,000 per year of SALT, while the average Texas millionaire only deducted about $50,000 resulting in a federal tax liability nearly $180,000 higher than their high-tax state counterparts.\nRestoring subsidies for high income taxpayers in high tax states has been a priority for some blue-state lawmakers that have said “No SALT, no deal”. There have been reports that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep, Richard Neal, D-Mass., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, “have given NJ/NY Democrats assurance it will be in bill.”\nInstead of this harmful proposal, Congress should finish the job and repeal the SALT deduction.\n– Matthew Dickerson is the director of The Heritage Foundation’s Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget\nWoke Gender Ideology\nAccording to Senate rules, a reconciliation package should be limited to budget questions. But in 2021, the reconciliation process offers the chance for radical gender activists to slip the language and assumptions of their ideology into federal legislation.\nFor instance, the text on “Maternal Mortality” consists of 15 sections that appropriate funds for a range of grants and programs for research and education on women’s health.\nAnd yet, in these sections discussing mothers who might face high-risk conditions related to childbearing, we find gender-neutral terminology repeated 18 times in more than half of the 15 sections. The most common phrase? “Pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individuals.”\nWhile “individual” or “person” is common in legal documents when the referent could be male or female, that doesn’t explain what’s happening here. The use of vague, ungendered terms is an attempt to make legal language compliant with an ideology that denies the innate binary of male and female.\nThe newest reconciliation draft makes this agenda even more obvious.\nIn an earlier version, for instance, in a separate section on Medicaid, the text retained “pregnant and postpartum women”—since it was referring to past legislation. In the current version, this doesn’t slip through. Whereas before it referred to “pregnant and postpartum women,” it now calls for the offending “w” word (in the singular) with “individual.” To be clear, this is a deliberate erasure of the word “women.”\nThey did let a shocking reference to “she” slip through. (Perhaps they’ll catch that during the next round of edits.)\nThere is now only one use of “women” in the entire document that is not directly quoting a previous law. It’s here: “Assessing the potential causes of relatively low rates of maternal mortality among Hispanic individuals and foreign-born Black women.”\nThe trajectory is unmistakable: Whenever feasible, references to woman are being neutered. We’ve seen this Congress’ commitment to radical gender ideology since its opening days. In early January, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made gender-neutral language standard practice for Congress.\nThis approach persists even when the bill is dealing with topics unique to women. In 2021, opting to refer to a woman as a “pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individual” suggests that someone need not be a female to be pregnant, to lactate, or to suffer postpartum health complications.\nThat is, of course, exactly the point. For certain radical gender activists, being a woman is more a function of nurture and self-designation than nature and biology. That language reflects that conviction.\n– Jay Richards, the William E. Simon senior research fellow in Heritage’s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, and Jared Eckert a research assistant at Heritage’s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Republican Candidates Debate at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire\nPARTICIPANTS:\nRepresentative Michele Bachmann (MN);\nHerman Cain (GA);\nFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (GA);\nRepresentative Ron Paul (TX);\nFormer Governor Tim Pawlenty (MN);\nFormer Governor Mitt Romney (MA); and\nFormer Senator Rick Santorum (PA)\nMODERATOR:\nJohn King (CNN)\nJOHN KING: Welcome to Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, and the first Republican presidential debate in this first-in-the-nation primary state. Behind me on this stage, the Republican candidates for president appearing together on the same stage for the first time tonight.\nAnd tonight's debate will be different than any presidential debate you've ever seen. Over the course of the next two hours, in addition to questions from myself and journalists from our partners, WMUR and the New Hampshire Union Leader, the candidates will take questions directly from voters right here in Manchester, as well as from voters at town meetings taking place tonight all across New Hampshire.\nSo let's get right to it and meet the candidates. Now, we've asked for no opening statements. However, we will continue a tradition from our past New Hampshire debates, to ask each candidate in one short sentence -- hopefully, five, maybe six or seven seconds -- to introduce themselves to the voters of New Hampshire and the United States of America.\nLet me begin with an example. I'm John King with CNN. I am honored to be your moderator tonight, and I am thrilled to be back in Red Sox nation.\n[Applause]\nNow, let's start at the edge of the stage with Senator Rick Santorum.\nSANTORUM: Hello, New Hampshire. I'm Rick Santorum. I served 12 years representing Pennsylvania in the United States Senate, but I also have substantial executive experience making the tough decisions and balancing budgets and cutting spending. Karen and I are the parents of seven children.\n[Applause]\nKING: Congresswoman?\nBACHMANN: Hi, my name is Michelle Bachmann. I'm a former federal tax litigation attorney. I'm a businesswoman. We started our own successful company. I'm also a member of the United States Congress. I'm a wife of 33 years. I've had five children, and we are the proud foster parents of 23 great children. And it's a thrill to be here tonight in the \"Live Free or Die\" state. Thank you.\n[Applause]\nKING: Mr. Speaker?\nGINGRICH: I'm Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House. And when 14 million Americans are out of work, we need a new president to end the Obama depression.\n[Applause]\nKING: Governor?\nROMNEY: I'm Mitt Romney, and it's an honor to be back at Saint Anselm. Hopefully I'll get it right this year. And appreciate the chance to be with you and to welcome my wife. And I have five sons, as you know, five daughters-in law, 16 grandkids. The most important thing in my life is to make sure their future is bright and that America is always known as the hope of the Earth. Thank you.\n[Applause]\nPAUL: I am Congressman Ron Paul. I've been elected to the Congress 12 times from Texas. Before I went into the Congress, I delivered babies for a living and delivered 4,000 babies. Now I would like to be known and defend the title that I am the champion of liberty and I defend the Constitution. Thank you.\n[Applause]\nKING: Governor?\nPAWLENTY: Good evening, I'm Tim Pawlenty. I'm a husband. My wife, Mary, and I have been married for 23 years. I'm the father of two beautiful daughters, Anna and Mara. I'm a neighbor. And I'm running for president of the United States because I love America, but like you, I'm concerned about its future. I've got the experience and the leadership and the results to lead it to a better place.\n[Applause]\nKING: Mr. Cain?\nCAIN: Hello, I'm Herman Cain. I am not a politician. I am a problem-solver with over 40 years of business and executive experience, father of two, grandfather of three, and I'm here tonight because it's not about us. It's about those grandkids. Happy to be here in New Hampshire.\n[Applause]\nKING: All right.\nOur thanks to the candidates. You'll get to know them better as the night goes on. Our rules are pretty straightforward. Each candidate will be given one minute to answer our leadoff questions. At my discretion, I may ask other candidates to weigh in on each topic. Now, candidates would get about 30 seconds to answer those follow-up questions. I say about 30 seconds, because we're on the honor system tonight, no bells, no whistles. You won't see any flashing lights up here.\nIf they're running over time, I'll try to gently remind them it's time to move on. And we're hoping some of the answers will be as short -- maybe a sentence, maybe even just one word. We can hope, right?\nWe've also asked the candidates to answer the questions that they're asked, rather than the question they might have wished to be asked.\nThat's enough -- uh-huh -- that's enough for me tonight. Let's get straight to the people of New Hampshire. Now, our first question comes from a voter up in Plymouth. Also there is the New Hampshire Union Leader's Tom Fahey. Tom?\n[Applause]\nJOHN FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thank you, John.\nI'm here with Mr. Marquez-Sterling. He is a retired professor from Plymouth State University, and he's got a question about jobs.\nQ: Yes. Mr. Gingrich said that 14 million people are unemployed. My question is this. The Democrats say that the Republicans don't have any plans to create jobs, and jobs -- and jobs in the private sector, not in the government jobs. I'd like to know, what are those plans?\nKING: Mr. Cain, let me start with you tonight. And be as specific as you can. I hope I don't have to repeat this throughout the night. How would you -- what would you do as president of the United States to create jobs?\nCAIN: The thing we need to do is to get this economy boosted. This economy is stalled. It's like a train on the tracks with no engine. And the administration has simply been putting all of this money in the caboose.\nWe need an engine called the private sector. That means lower taxes, lower the capital gains tax rate to zero, suspend taxes on repatriated profits, then make them permanent. Uncertainty is killing this economy. This is the only way we're going to get this economy moving, and that's to put the right fuel in the engine, which is the private sector.\nKING: All right, let me come down to this. And, Senator Santorum, you mentioned -- you said you have executive experience, as well as your Senate experience. Governor Pawlenty laid out an economic plan. A lot of tax cuts in that plan. Some economists said he had some unrealistic expectations, and he said you could grow the economy 5 percent a year, then 5 percent a year, then 5 percent a year. Do you believe that is a possible? Or is that too optimistic to the American people, who want help but don't want to be misled?\nSANTORUM: Yeah, I think we need a president who's optimistic, who has a pro-growth agenda. I'm not going to comment on 5 percent or 4 percent. What we need is a -- is an economy that's unshackled.\nAnd what's happened in this administration is that they have passed oppressive policy and oppressive regulation after -- Obamacare being first and foremost. The oppressiveness of that bill on businesses -- anybody that wants to invest to get any kind of return, when you see the regulations that are going to be put on business, when you see the taxation.\nThrow on top of that what this president's done on energy. The reason we're seeing this second dip is because of energy prices, and this president has put a stop sign again -- against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, and that is depressing. We need to drill. We need to create energy jobs, just like we're doing, by the way, in Pennsylvania, where we're drilling 3,000 wells this year for gas, and gas prices are down -- natural gas prices are down as a result.\nKING: OK, I'm going to try to ask all of you to keep the follow- ups to 30 seconds as we -- so we can get more in.\nGovernor Pawlenty, answer the critics -- and as you do so -- who say 5 percent every year is just unrealistic. And as you do so, where's the proof -- where's the proof that just cutting taxes will create jobs? If that were true, why during the Bush years, after the big tax cut, where were the jobs?\nPAWLENTY: Well, John, my plan involves a whole plan, not just cutting taxes. We're proposing to cut taxes, reduce regulation, speed up this pace of government, and to make sure that we have a pro-growth agenda.\nThis president is a declinist. He views America as one of equals around the world. We're not the same as Portugal; we're not the same as Argentina. And this idea that we can't have 5 percent growth in America is hogwash. It's a defeatist attitude. If China can have 5 percent growth and Brazil can have 5 percent growth, then the United States of America can have 5 percent growth.\nAnd I don't accept this notion that we're going to be average or anemic. So my proposal has a 5 percent growth target. It cuts taxes, but it also dramatically cuts spending. We need to fix regulation. We need to have a pro-American energy policy. We need to fix health care policy. And if you do those things, as I've proposed, including cut spending, you'll get this economy moving and growing the private economy by shrinking government.\nKING: I don't want to do much of this, but I'm going to have to interrupt if people go a little bit long so we can get more done.\nGovernor Romney, I want you to come in on that point. Is 5 percent overly optimistic? And is it fair to compare the United States' economy, a fully developed economy, to the Chinese economy, which is still in many ways developing?\nROMNEY: Look, Tim has the right instincts, which is he recognizes that what this president has done has slowed the economy. He didn't create the recession, but he made it worse and longer. And now we have more chronic long-term employment than this country has ever seen before, 20 million people out of work, stopped looking for work, or in part-time jobs that need full-time jobs. We've got housing prices continuing to decline, and we have foreclosures at record levels.\nThis president has failed. And he's failed at a time when the American people counted on him to create jobs and get the economy growing. And instead of doing that, he delegated the stimulus to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and then he did what he wanted to do: card-check, cap-and-trade, Obamacare, reregulation.\nI spent my life in the private sector, 25 years.\nKING: All right.\nROMNEY: And as I went around the world -- this is an important topic -- I went around the world...\nKING: We'll have a lot of time on the topic. We just -- we won't get through this...\nROMNEY: You can tell how -- how to get jobs going in this country, and President Obama has done it wrong. And the ideas Tim described, those are in the right wheelhouse.\nKING: Mr. Speaker, if you look at a poll in the Boston Globe just the other day, 54 percent of Republican voters in this state say they're willing to have higher taxes on the wealthy to help bring down the deficit. Are they wrong?\nGINGRICH: Well, the question is, would it, in fact, increase jobs or kill jobs? The Reagan recovery, which I participated in passing, in seven years created for this current economy the equivalent of 25 million new jobs, raised federal revenue by $800 billion a year in terms of the current economy, and clearly it worked. It's a historic fact.\nThe Obama administration is an anti-jobs, anti-business, anti- American energy destructive force. And we shouldn't talk about what we do in 2013. The Congress this year, this next week ought to repeal the Dodd-Frank bill, they ought to repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, they ought to start creating jobs right now, because for those 14 million Americans, this is a depression now.\nKING: The speaker just said, Congresswoman, repeal Dodd-Frank. Answer the American out there who says maybe I don't like all of the details, but after what happened in 2007 and 2008, I don't want Wall Street to not have somebody looking at them, watching what they're doing. BACHMANN: Well, I'm looking forward to answering that question, because I introduced the repeal bill to repeal Dodd-Frank, because it's an over-the-top bill that will actually lead to more job loss, rather than job creation.\nBut before I fully answer that, I just want to make an announcement here for you, John, on CNN tonight. I filed today my paperwork to seek the office of the presidency of the United States today. And I'll very soon be making my formal announcement.\nSo I wanted you to be the first to know.\n[Applause]\nKING: I appreciate that. Well, welcome. If you're out there and you don't get the distinction coming into the night, Congresswoman Bachmann was exploring. She hadn't taken that last step. The other candidates had taken it. I'm sure they welcome you to the fray.\nLet's continue the conversation. I want to come to Congressman Paul. You're all here saying the president of the United States is making the economy worse. Has he done one thing -- has he done one thing right when it comes to the economy in this country?\nPAUL: Boy, that's a tough question.\n[Laughter]\nNo, no, I can't think of anything, but may I answer the question that you alluded to before about whether or not 5 percent is too optimistic? No, there's nothing wrong without -- without setting a goal of 5 percent or 10 percent or 15 percent, if you have a free- market economy.\nWe're trying to unwind a Keynesian bubble that's been going on for 70 years, and you're not going to touch this problem until you liquidate the bad debt and the mal-investment, go back to work. But you have to have sound money, and you have to recognize how we got in the trouble.\nWe got in the trouble because we had a financial bubble, and it's caused by the Federal Reserve. If you don't look at monetary policy, we will continue the trend of the last decade. We haven't even -- we haven't developed any new jobs in the last decade. Matter of fact, we've had 30 million new people and no new jobs, and it's because they don't -- the people don't understand monetary policy and central economic planning things.\nFree markets will give you 10 percent or 15 percent growth or whatever [ph] and you will not have to turn it off because you think it's going to cause inflation. It doesn't work that way.\nKING: All right, I'm going to jump -- I'm going to jump in here. I'm going to ask one more time politely. We want to get as many voters as we can involved, so please try to shorten the follow-up answers just a bit if you can. Let's go back to Tom in Plymouth. He has another voter with a question.\nFAHEY: Yes, thank you, John. I'm here with Sylvia Smith. She's from Littleton. And she is a freelance journalist who's written about the health care industry. She has a question about health care.\nQ: Yes. As a journalist who's written frequently about health care and medicine for both newspapers and for corporate publications, I'm very concerned about the overreach of the massive health care legislation that was passed last year. My question is, what would each candidate do? What three steps would they take to de- fund Obamacare and repeal it as soon as possible? Thank you.\nKING: Congresswoman Bachmann, let's start with you on that.\nBACHMANN: Thank you, John. Sylvia, thank you for that great question. I was the very first member of Congress to introduce the full-scale repeal of Obamacare. And I want to make a promise to everyone watching tonight: As president of the United States, I will not rest until I repeal Obamacare. It's a promise. Take it to the bank, cash the check. I'll make sure that that happens.\nThis is the symbol and the signature issue of President Obama during his entire tenure. And this is a job-killer, Sylvia. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs. What could the president be thinking by passing a bill like this, knowing full well it will kill 800,000 jobs?\nSenior citizens get this more than any other segment of our population, because they know in Obamacare, the president of the United States took away $500 billion, a half-trillion dollars out of Medicare, shifted it to Obamacare to pay for younger people, and it's senior citizens who have the most to lose in Obamacare.\nKING: Governor Romney, just yesterday, Governor Pawlenty, who is to your left on the stage tonight, called your Massachusetts plan, which you know has become a focal point of the criticism in this campaign from your friends here, Obamneycare, Obamneycare. Is that a fair comparison?\nROMNEY: You know, let me say a couple things. First, if I'm elected president, I will repeal Obamacare, just as Michelle indicated. And also, on my first day in office, if I'm lucky enough to have that office, I will grant a waiver to all 50 states from Obamacare.\nNow, there's some similarities and there are some big differences. Obamacare spends a trillion dollars. If it were perfect -- and it's not perfect, it's terrible -- we can't afford more federal spending.\nSecondly, it raises $500 billion in taxes. We didn't raise taxes in Massachusetts.\nThird, Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare. We, of course, didn't do that.\nAnd, finally, ours was a state plan, a state solution, and if people don't like it in our state, they can change it. That's the nature of why states are the right place for this type of responsibility. And that's why I introduced a plan to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a state-centric program.\nKING: Governor, you just heard the governor rebut your characterization, Obamneycare. Why?\nPAWLENTY: Well, let me first say to Sylvia, she has put her finger on one of the most important issues facing the country, which is President Obama stood before the nation in 2008 and said he promised to do health care reform focused on cost containment, along with Republicans, he'd do it on a bipartisan basis...\nKING: The question -- the question, Governor, was, why Obamneycare?\nPAWLENTY: That's right. Well, I'm going to get to that, John.\nKING: You have 30 seconds, Governor.\nPAWLENTY: Yeah, so we -- this is another example of him breaking his promise, and he has to be held accountable. And in order to prosecute the case against President Obama, you have to be able to show that you've got a better plan and a different plan. We took a different approach in Minnesota. We didn't use top-down government mandates and individual requirements from government. We created market alternatives and empowered consumers. I think that's the way to fix health care in the United States of America.\nKING: And you don't want to address why you called Governor Romney's Obamneycare?\nPAWLENTY: Well, the issue that was raised in a question from a reporter was, what are the similarities between the two? And I just cited President Obama's own words that he looked to Massachusetts as a blueprint or a guide when he designed Obamacare.\nKING: But you chose -- you say you were asked a question, which is fair enough, but you chose those words. And so one of my questions is, why would you chose those -- choose those words maybe in the comfort of a Sunday show studio? Your rival is standing right there. If it was Obamneycare on \"Fox News Sunday,\" why isn't it not Obamneycare standing here with the governor right there?\nPAWLENTY: It -- President Obama is -- is the person who I quoted in saying he looked to Massachusetts for designing his program. He's the one who said it's a blueprint and that he merged the two programs. And so using the term \"Obamneycare\" was a reflection of the president's comments that he designed Obamacare on the Massachusetts health care plan.\nKING: All right.\nGovernor, you want to respond to that at all?\nROMNEY: No, just -- just to say this, which is my guess is the president is going to eat those words and wish he hasn't -- hadn't put them out there. And I can't wait to debate him and say, Mr. President, if, in fact, you did look at what we did in Massachusetts, why didn't you give me a call and ask what worked and what didn't? And I would have told you, Mr. President, that what you're doing will not work.\nIt's a huge power grab by the federal government. It's going to be massively expensive, raising taxes, cutting Medicare. It's wrong for America. And that's why there's an outpouring across the nation to say no to Obamacare. And I'm delighted to be able to debate him on that.\nKING: OK. Mr. Speaker...\n[Crosstalk]\nKING: ... you have a -- I'll let you -- Mr. Speaker, you have at times said, you know, maybe you do have a consider a mandate. You've been very open to the individual mandate. It has become, it seems, at least at the moment, a litmus test in this Republican primary. Should it be?\nGINGRICH: Yes, it should be. If you -- if you explore the mandate, which even the Heritage Foundation at one time looked at, the fact is, when you get into an mandate, it ultimately ends up with unconstitutional powers. It allows the government to define virtually everything. And if you can do it for health care, you can do it for everything in your life, and, therefore, we should not have a mandate.\nBut I want to answer Sylvia at a different level. This campaign cannot be only about the presidency. We need to pick up at least 12 seats in the U.S. Senate and 30 or 40 more seats in the House, because if you are serious about repealing Obamacare, you have to be serious about building a big enough majority in the legislative branch that you could actually in the first 90 days pass the legislation.\nSo I just think it's very important to understand, it's not about what one person in America does. It's about what the American people do. And that requires a senatorial majority, as well as a presidency.\nKING: All right. We'll have more time to discuss the health care issue. Let's get down to the floor.\nJennifer Vaughn from WMUR has a question from a voter.\nVAUGHN: Hi, John. Thank you very much. I'd like you to meet Terry Pfaff tonight. Tell me I said that last name correctly, Terry. Granite Stater born and bred?\nTERRY PFAFF, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE SENATE CANDIDATE: Yes, ma'am.\nVAUGHN: Thank you for being here. And what's your question for the candidates tonight?\nPFAFF: Well, my question is that I am a New Hampshire native and I've been an active Republican for years from a town committee chairman, Republican chairman, Merrimack County, vice chairman, all the way up to 2004 delegate for President Bush.\nMy question is, how will you convince myself? I'm not a libertarian Republican, I'm not a Tea Party Republican. I'm just a mainstream Republican. And we need both -- the independents and mainstream Republicans to win in November.\nHow can you convince me and assure me that you'll bring a balance and you won't be torn to one side or the other for many factions within the party? You have to have a balanced approach to governing to solve our serious problems.\nKING: Senator Santorum, let me go to you first on that one.\nSANTORUM: Well, if you look at my record, I'm someone who's actually accomplished a lot on big issues. Take for example welfare reform. I was in the United States Senate and actually at the direction of Newt Gingrich I was on the Ways and Means Committee and I drafted the Contract with America Welfare Reform Bill.\nIt was considered this extreme measure. Well, that extreme measure we ended up winning an election and getting those seats. And that was now the starting point. And I managed that bill in the United States Senate because I cared about the dignity of every person.\nI didn't believe that poverty was the ultimate disability. I believed that people could work and they could succeed. And we brought people together. I got 70 votes to end a federal entitlement -- to end a federal entitlement which was what Paul Ryan's proposed for Medicaid, he's proposed for food stamps, he's proposed for other welfare programs.\nWe did it. We set the template, and I led and got bipartisan support to do it.\nKING: Can I ask you quickly now? That wasn't -- addressed part of the question. But are you concerned at all about the influence of the Tea Party?\nSANTORUM: Not at all. I think the Tea Party is a great backstop for America. I love it when people hold up this Constitution and say we have to live by what our founders laid out for this country. It is absolutely essential that we have that backbone to the Republican Party going into this election.\nKING: I know you agree, Congresswoman. So help the gentleman. Address his concerns that the Tea Party somehow -- the influence of the Tea Party somehow pushes him out?\nBACHMANN: Terry, what I've seen in the Tea Party -- I'm the chairman of the Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives. And what I've seen is unlike how the media has tried to wrongly and grossly portray the Tea Party, the Tea Party is really made up of disaffected Democrats, independents, people who've never been political a day in their life.\nPeople who are libertarians, Republicans. It's a wide swath of America coming together. I think that's why the left fears it so much. Because they're people who simply want to take the country back. They want the country to work again.\nAnd I think there's no question, Terry, this election will be about economics. It will be about how will we create jobs, how will we turn the economy around, how will we have a pro-growth economy.\nThat's a great story for Republicans to tell. President Obama can't tell that story. His report card right now has a big failing grade on it, but Republicans have an awesome story to tell.\nWe need every one of us in a three-legged stool. We need the peace through strength of Republicans, we need the fiscal conservatives, we need the social conservatives. We need everybody to come together because we're going to win. Just make no mistake about it.\nI want to announce tonight. President Obama is a one-term president.\n[Cheers and Applause]\nBACHMANN: You'll win.\nKING: I'm being polite so far. But I want to remind everybody about the time.\nMr. Cain, as somebody who has no elective no experience.\nCAIN: Yes.\nKING: To this gentleman's question. If you were to become the nominee of this party.\nCAIN: Yes.\nKING: And you associate yourself with the Tea Party, politics is about math. It's about coalition building. And a candidate who loses a mainstream Republican as he describes himself might not win this state in November. Might not win a big state like Senator Santorum's Pennsylvania in November.\nAddress the concern of the gentleman who seems to think that at least some people in the Tea Party maybe in their dissatisfaction, their anger of the president are too negative, too critical.\nCAIN: They're not too negative and they're not too critical. As a businessman, one of the first things that you do, which has allowed me to be successful throughout my career is make sure you're working on the right problem. If we make sure we're working on the right problem, I will surround myself with the right people and then we will put together the right plans that I'm going to take it to the people. I will be a president to do what's right, not what's politically right.\nAnd so if the other party disagrees but the American people embrace those common sense solutions, that's how we get things done. So those experiences in the business world, managing large organizations with a very diverse constituency are the same skills that can help get the people involved and not exclude the people like this administration has done.\nKING: I want to remind the candidates, though, this as I remind people in the audience. CNN is hosting a Tea Party debate September 12th. So watch how this plays out. The Tea Party was a vocal in 2010. We'll see how much the influence is in 2012.\nLet's continue our conversation here with the voters of New Hampshire.\nJean Mackin of WMUR is in Hancock with a voter and a question -- Jean.\nJEAN MACKIN, WMUR: Thanks very much, John. And welcome to the Hancock Inn. I'm standing here with Mike Patinsky. He is a small business owner from Harris Field, New Hampshire.\nAnd Mike, what question do you have tonight?\nMIKE PATINSKY, DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORTATION, FRANKLIN PIERCE COLLEGE: Well, for the candidates I'd like to know how they plan on returning manufacturing jobs to the United States.\nKING: Congressman Paul, why don't you start with that one?\nPAUL: Pretty important because everything we've done in the last 20 or 30 years we've exported our jobs. And when you have a reserve currency of the world and you abuse it, you export money. That becomes the main export so it goes with the money.\nYou have to invite capital. The way you get capital into a country, you have to have a strong currency, not a weak currency. Today it's a deliberate job of the Federal Reserve to weaken the currency. We should invite capital back.\nFirst thing is, we have trillions of dollars, at least over a trillion dollars of U.S. money made overseas, but it stays over there because if you bring it home, they get taxed. If you want to, we need to get the Fed to quit printing the money and if you want capital, you have to entice those individuals to repatriate their money and take the taxes office, set up a financial system, deregulate and de-tax to invite people to go back to work again.\nBut as long as we run a program of deliberately weakening our currency, our jobs will go overseas, and that is what's happened for a good many years, especially in the last decade. KING: Governor Pawlenty, does the congressman have it right?\nPAWLENTY: There's a number of things we need to do. Restore manufacturing in this country. And I grew up if in a meat packing town. I grew up in a manufacturing town. I was in a union for six or seven years.\nI understand what it's like to see the blue-collar communities and the struggles that they've had when manufacturing leaves. So I've seen that firsthand. But number one, we've got to have fair trade, and what's going on right now is not fair.\nI'm for a fair and open trade but I'm not for being stupid and I'm not for being a chump. And we have individuals and organizations and countries around this world who are not following the rules when it comes to fair trade. We need a stronger president and somebody who's going to take on those issues.\nNumber two, we need to make the costs and burdens of manufacturing in this country lower. We're asking them to climb the mountain with a big backsack full of rocks on their back. We have to take the rocks out.\nOne of them is Obamacare. I mean somebody in Arizona the other day. He's moving his whole company out of the country just because of Obamacare. The taxes are too high. The regulations are too heavy, the permitting is too slow, and the message everywhere around this country, from business leaders large and small, including manufacturing, is get the government off my back. As president I will.\nKING: How about to help workers, Congressman, get ready for the new jobs in manufacturing? Should the United States government, the federal government we say help in community colleges with their vocational training programs and things like that?\nBACHMANN: Well, the United States federal government and the states have done numerous job training programs over the year with mixed results. This is what we need to do to turn job creation around and bring manufacturing back to the United States.\nWhat we need to do is today the United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the world. I'm a former federal tax lawyer. I've seen the devastation. We've got to bring that tax rate down substantially so that we're among the lowest in the industrialized world.\nHere's the other thing. Every time the liberals get into office, they pass an omnibus bill of big spending projects. What we need to do is pass the mother of all repeal bills, but it's the repeal bill that will get a job killing regulations. And I would begin with the EPA, because there is no other agency like the EPA. It should really be renamed the job-killing organization of America.\nKING: OK. OK. I'll get to you in one second. I just want to show people. We're asking people watching at home also to tell us on Facebook, in Twitter what concerns them.\nIf you watch up here and take a look. Just look what's happened. Three most important issues this election season regardless of party, jobs, the jobless, and whether you want a job.\nSenator Santorum, your state of Pennsylvania, a big industrial state that has struggled in recent years.\nSANTORUM: I always am from Pennsylvania. We still make things there, and I represented the Steel Valley of Pittsburgh when I was in the Congress. And what I learned from growing up in Butler, Pennsylvania, steel town is that the broad middle of America was a broad middle of America when we had lots of manufacturing here because that's how the wealth from those who create the jobs get down.\nAnd we've been outsourcing those jobs. So what we need to do is a lot of what was said here. I would add another thing that I'm specifically proposing. We need to cut the capital gains tax in half which others have proposed but for manufacturers we need to give a five-year window where we cut it to zero.\nWe want to encourage people to set up jobs here in America. Take that R&D credit, make it permanent, take that innovation and then invest that money here to create that broad middle of America and have that wealth really trickle down.\nKING: Let's stay on jobs and the economy. We'll get to everybody. Just want to bring in Josh McElveen from WMUR who's down there on the floor. He has a question related to this.\nJOSH MCELVEEN, WMUR POLITICAL REPORTER: Thank you, John. Good evening, candidates.\nGovernor Pawlenty, the possibility exists that New Hampshire could soon become the 23rd state to pass right to work legislation. Unions don't like it because they feel it making membership volunteer. We can organize labor, you know, you've seen the protest in your home state of Minnesota.\nMy question is, where do you fall on right to work and would you support a federal right-to-work law?\nPAWLENTY: We live in the United States of America and people shouldn't be forced to belong or be a member in any organization. And the government has no business telling you what group to be a member of or not. I support strongly right-to-work legislation.\n[Applause]\nPAWLENTY: Like I said, for much of his life my dad was a teamster truck driver. My brothers and sisters, many of them are in unions, I was in a union. We grew up in a blue-collar town. I understand these issues.\nMy family were Reagan-Democrats, now most of them listen to Rush Limbaugh actually. But the point is, I understand these issues, but we don't have a government tell us what organizations or associations we should be in. We tell the government what to do.\nKING: Mr. Speaker, I assume you agree. And as you come into the conversation, one of the criticisms -- you tell me whether it's fair or not. One of the criticisms has been, as you watch some of these governors deal with this issue across the country, that some people say there's a tone about it. That they seem to be trying to demonize public employees or union workers.\nGINGRICH: Well, that's a totally different question. The question that's asked was right to work. And one of the things the Congress should do immediately is defund the National Labor Relations Board which has gone into South Carolina to punish Boeing, which wants to put 8,000 American jobs in South Carolina by fundamentally eliminating right-to-work at the National Labor Relations Board.\nThat's a real, immediate threat from the Obama administration to eliminate right to work. And I think that it is fundamentally the wrong direction. I hope that New Hampshire does adopt right-to-work. I frankly keep it at the state level because as each new state becomes right to work, they send a signal to the remaining states, don't be stupid.\nWhy you want to be at California's unemployment level when you can be Texas's employment level? Or North Dakota's?\nAnd I think, Kevin [ph], that if you believe in the 10th Amendment, we ought to -- let the states learn from each other. And the right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today that they heavily unionized states. The public employee union question is a totally different issue.\nKING: All right. Maybe we'll come back to that.\nMr. Cain, I will let you in quickly on this one. As a businessman who says your strength in this campaign is someone who's created jobs, the question of right-to-work?\nCAIN: Yes. I do believe that the states should have the right. I believe in right-to-work, and I hope that New Hampshire is able to get it passed. And I agree with the speaker and the others who believe that if the federal government continues to do the kinds of thing that this administration is trying to do through the back door, through the National Labor Relations Board, that's killing our free market system, and the free market system is what made this economy great. And we have to keep the free market system strong.\nKING: A lot more ground to cover with our candidates. We're about to take our first break of the evening. We will have several. A lot more ground to cover. A lot more domestic policy, a lot of foreign policy. We want to see who you might want as your next commander in chief should you choose to make President Obama a one- term president.\nOne of the other things we want to do, though, is to learn a little bit more about these candidates and their personalities. So I'm going to borrow something from my sports fan experience. Every time we go to break or come back from break, I'm going to ask the candidates one at a time a question I'll call this or that. I give them a choice. These are not serious political issues. It's just to show a little bit of the personal sides of our candidate.\nSenator Santorum, I want to start with you.\nSANTORUM: Thank you.\nKING: Of course.\n[Laughter]\nKING: Leno or Conan?\nSANTORUM: Probably Leno. But I don't watch either. Sorry.\nKING: All right. That's all right. That's the answer -- the answer is the answer.\nAnd for those of you watching at home, remember, the Facebook, Twitter, send us questions, send us your analysis. A little bit later we'll also give you a chance for some exclusive content. Get your smartphone ready. I'll explain that a little bit ahead. We'll be right back at Saint Anselm College in just a moment.\n[Commercial Break]\nKING: Welcome back to our Republican debate at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.\nOne of the things we are very eager to do throughout the campaign is to involve you at home and to use technology and innovation. So if you have a smartphone, look at your screen right now.\nIf you've used it before, you'll know. You'll see an electronic code on your screen. You can snap a picture of that code, you'll get some exclusive access about the debate. Some behind-the-scenes video, some analysis and content. We'll do this throughout the debate and we'll do it throughout the campaign.\nNow we're going to get back to questioning our seven Republican candidates for president.\nRight before the break we did this thing called \"This or That.\" Just to learn a little bit about the personality of the candidates.\nSenator Santorum doesn't stay up very late. He's a parent. I understand that. He said if he had to he would pick Leno over Conan.\nCongresswoman Bachmann, to you, Elvis or Johnny Cash?\nBACHMANN: That's really tough. That's really -- both, both.\nKING: Both?\nBACHMANN: Yes.\nKING: Both.\nBACHMANN: I've \"Christmas with Elvis\" on my iPod.\n[Laughter]\nKING: All right. Now we know what's on the congresswoman's iPod.\nLet's get to John Distaso of the \"Union Leader.\" He's down here in the audience and he has a question.\nJOHN DISTASO, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER SR. POLITICAL REPORTER: Thank you, John.\nTo federal -- Congressman Paul, this is for you. The federal government now assists many industries, green jobs, the auto industry, research and development, all get subsidies. Given the current state of the economy, what standards do you have, if any, for government assistance to private enterprise?\nPAUL: There shouldn't be any government assistance to private enterprise. It's not morally correct, it's legal, it's bad economics. It's not part of the constitution. If you allow an economy to thrive, they'll decide how R&D works or where they invest their monies.\nBut when the politicians get in and direct things, you get the malinvestment. They do the dumb things. They might build too many houses. And they might not direct their research to the right places. So no, it's a fallacy to think that government and politicians and bureaucrats are smart enough to manage the economy, so it shouldn't happen.\nKING: All right. These are the Republicans, the conservative candidates. Every time you applaud, I know you're happy with the answer. You take your time away, though.\nWe would expect to get an answer of less government is better. One of the questions we want to explore tonight is when -- when do you reach that extraordinary moment where the government might want to do something.\nMr. Cain, I want to ask you because you're a businessman who initially at least supported the TARP program. The former senator Judd Gregg of this great state of New Hampshire was one of the architects of that program during the late hours of the Bush administration. Then you said, quote, \"We needed to do something drastic because we were facing a very drastic situation.\"\nCAIN: I studied the financial meltdown and concluded on my own that we needed to do something drastic, yes. When the concept of TARP was first presented to the public, I was willing to go along with it. But then when the administration started to implement it on a discretionary basis, picking winners and losers and also directing funds to General Motors and others that had nothing to do with the financial system, that's where I totally disagreed.\nWe should -- the government should not be selecting winners and losers, and I don't believe in this concept of too big to fail. If they fail, the free market will figure out who's going to pick the up the pieces.\nKING: Well, let's stay on this topic. Let's bring Tom Fahey back into the conversation. He has a question -- Tom.\nFAHEY: Yes, thank you, John. I wanted to ask Governor Romney about the auto industry. General Motors and Chrysler have rebounded since the Obama administration bailed them up. Bankruptcy is no longer a threat.\nWould you say the bailout program was a success?\nROMNEY: The bailout program was not a success because the bailout program wasted a lot of money. About $17 billion was used unnecessarily.\nWhen the CEOs of the auto companies went to Washington asking for money from Washington, I wrote an op-ed, and I said, look, the right process for these companies is not a bailout, not a big check from Washington, but instead letting these enterprises go through bankruptcy, re-emerge, getting rid of the unnecessary costs that they had, the excessive debt, re-emerge, and that would be the preferred way for them to be able to get on their feet again.\nInstead, the Bush administration and the Obama administration wrote checks to the auto industry. Ultimately, they went through the very bankruptcy process that I suggested from the beginning.\nBut the big difference was $17 billion was wasted. And then President Obama, given that money, was able to put his hands on the scales of justice and give the company to the UAW.\nThere is a perception in this country that government knows better than the private sector, that Washington and President Obama have a better view for how an industry ought to be run. Well, they're wrong. The right way for America to create jobs is to -- is to keep government in its place and to allow the private sector and the -- and the energy and passion of the American people create a brighter future for our kids and for ourselves.\nKING: Let me read you, Governor, just a little bit of an op-ed piece you wrote back in November 2008.\n[Applause]\n\"If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.\" From a profit standpoint, they're doing pretty well right now. On that point, \"kiss goodbye,\" I understand you disagree with the policy. Kiss the industry goodbye, were you wrong?\nROMNEY: No, I wasn't wrong, because if you read the rest of the op-ed piece, it says what they need to do is go through a bankruptcy process to shed unnecessary costs. If they just get paid checks after checks from the federal government, they're going to be locked in with high UAW costs, legacy costs. They'll never be able to get on their feet. They have to go through bankruptcy.\nAnd it turned out that that's finally what they did. And the head of the UAW, he wrote an op-ed piece saying, Romney's wrong, the government has to step in and give them a check.\nThat's the wrong way to go. Use the process of law. Use the process of American ingenuity. Don't have government try and guide this economy.\nKING: Anyone -- is there anyone here who, given that prospect, and President Bush started the program, given that prospect, anyone here who would have stepped in and said, \"I don't want to do this, but this is the backbone of American manufacturing, I'll do something\"?\nSANTORUM: No, absolutely not. We should -- we should not have had a TARP. We should not have had the auto bailout. Governor Romney's right. They could have gone through a structured bankruptcy without the federal government.\nAll the federal government did was basically tip to the cronies, tip to the unions, gave the unions the company. If they'd have gone through the orderly bankruptcy process, gone through a structured bankruptcy, they'd have come out in the same place, only we would have kept the integrity of the bankruptcy process without the government putting its fingers into it.\nKING: Quickly, please.\nBACHMANN: John, I was in the middle of this debate. I was behind closed doors with Secretary Paulson when he came and made the extraordinary, never-before-made request to Congress: Give us a $700 billion blank check with no strings attached.\nAnd I fought behind closed doors against my own party on TARP. It was a wrong vote then. It's continued to be a wrong vote since then. Sometimes that's what you have to do. You have to take principle over your party.\nKING: All right, let's continue the conversation, but we'll come back to this if we have to. Let's go to Jean Mackin in Hancock. She has a question.\nMACKIN: Thanks, John. This question goes out to Speaker Gingrich. Next month, the space shuttle program is scheduled to retire after 30 years, and last year, President Obama effectively killed government-run space flight to the International Space Station and wants to turn it over to private companies. In the meantime, U.S. astronauts would ride Russian spacecraft at a cost of $50 million to $63 million a seat. What role should the government play in future space exploration?\nGINGRICH: Well, sadly -- and I say this, sadly, because I'm a big fan of going into space and I actually worked to get the shuttle program to survive at one point -- NASA has become an absolute case study in why bureaucracy can't innovate.\nIf you take all the money we've spent at NASA since we landed on the moon and you had applied that money for incentives to the private sector, we would today probably have a permanent station on the moon, three or four permanent stations in space, a new generation of lift vehicles. And instead, what we've had is bureaucracy after bureaucracy after bureaucracy and failure after failure.\nI think it's a tragedy, because younger Americans ought to have the excitement of thinking that they, too, could be part of reaching out to a new frontier.\nYou know, you'd asked earlier, John, about this idea of limits because we're a developed country. We're not a developed country. The scientific future is going to open up, and we're at the beginning of a whole new cycle of extraordinary opportunities. And, unfortunately, NASA is standing in the way of it, when NASA ought to be getting out of the way and encouraging the private sector.\nKING: Is there any candidate who would step in and say, no, this is vital to America's identity, this is vital to America's innovation, I want the government to stay in the lead here when it comes to manned space flight? Nobody?\nPAWLENTY: Yeah, I think the space program has played a vital role for the United States of America. I think in the context...\nKING: But can we afford it going forward?\nPAWLENTY: In the context of our budget challenges, it can be refocused and reprioritized, but I don't think we should be eliminating the space program. We can partner with private providers to get more economies of scale and scale it back, but I don't think we should eliminate the space program.\nKING: In a sentence -- in a sentence or two?\n[Crosstalk]\nGINGRICH: John, you mischaracterized me. I didn't say end the space program. We built the transcontinental railroads without a national department of railroads. I said you could get into space faster, better, more effectively, more creatively if you decentralized it, got it out of Washington, and cut out the bureaucracy. It's not about getting rid of the space program; it's about getting to a real space program that works.\nROMNEY: I think fundamentally there are some people -- and most of them are Democrats, but not all -- who really believe that the government knows how to do things better than the private sector.\nKING: All right, let's go down to the...\nROMNEY: And they happen to be wrong. And... [Crosstalk]\nKING: All right, the role of government -- we'll continue on the role of government. I'm sorry -- Josh, please.\nMCELVEEN: Thanks very much, John. And, Governor Pawlenty, I'd like to go back to you. Let's talk about housing. Roughly right now, there are about a million -- a million homes in the -- in the hands of banks and lenders, millions of more homeowners are upside-down, meaning they owe more than their home is worth. What would you or your administration do to try to right the housing ship?\nPAWLENTY: Well, the first thing we need to do is get the government out of crony capitalism. We have this alliance between big government, big unions, and certain big bailout businesses. And as Congressman Paul said a few minutes ago, we had politicians in Congress trying to micromanage the housing market, and they created a bubble and they created the mess. And now we have all these innocent bystanders, the good people of the United States of America, many middle-income and modest-income people, who've been devastated by this.\nAnd so the market is going to have to adjust. The programs that President Obama has put forward haven't really worked. They've been a failure. They've been slow. They haven't really solved the problem.\nBut the best thing that we can do is get the economy moving again. And it's not going to happen by growing government. His way failed. We've got to get the private sector going. We have to have people starting businesses, growing businesses, building things, starting places of employment. This is how we're going to get money back in people's pockets and get them financially stable.\nKING: So, Congressman, come into the conversation. As you do, don't make it just about foreclosures. This is -- this is an interesting topic of discussion, especially -- especially when money is scarce and you've got to start cutting. It's a question of priorities. What should the government be doing? And maybe what should the government be doing in a better economy that it can't do now that has to go?\nSo talk about foreclosures a bit, but then tell me something, if you were president and you were dealing with it in your first few weeks, and you said, \"I might like to do this, but I can't afford to do this,\" be as specific as you can, what goes?\nPAUL: Well, I -- I would want to do much less, much sooner. The government shouldn't be involved. You take the bankruptcies, we've been doing a whole lot. We've been propping them up. We've had the Federal Reserve buy all the illiquid assets, which were worthless, stick it with the taxpayers. The people who've made the money when the bubble was being blown up, they're the ones who got bailed out.\nBut you want the correction. Corrections are good. The mal- investment in the bubbles are caused by the Federal Reserve and the government, and we keep propping it up. And that's why this is going -- it was predictable it would come. It's predictable it's lasted three years. And it's predictable, as long as we do what we're doing in Washington, it's going to last another 10 years.\nWe're doing what we did in the depression. We're doing what the Japanese have done. You need to get the prices of houses down to clear the market, but they're trying to keep the prices up. They actually have programs in Washington which stimulating housing. You need to clear the -- clear the market and then we can all go back to work. But what we're doing now is absolutely wrong.\nKING: Well, let me give you another topic that people say the government is too involved in. That's food safety. You worked in the business.\nCAIN: Yes.\nKING: You see the E. coli scare that's going on in Europe right now. You're trying to cut money. The FDA, other agencies that get involved in that are in front of you. What do you do?\nCAIN: You look inside the FDA and determine whether or not it needs to be streamlined, and maybe it does.\nKING: But should the federal government be doing food safety inspections?\nCAIN: The federal government should be doing food safety, yes. But I want to go back to this point about what we need to do to help the housing market.\nWe don't just have one problem; we have a crisis of the three E's. We've got the economy, entitlement spending, and energy. We've got to simultaneously work on all of those so we can put 13 million to 14 million people back to work. That's what we've got to do. So it's not just a single issue. It is the multiplicity and the compounding effect of those three critical problems.\nKING: What else, Governor Romney? You've been a chief executive of a state. I was just in Joplin, Missouri. I've been in Mississippi and Louisiana and Tennessee and other communities dealing with whether it's the tornadoes, the flooding, and worse. FEMA is about to run out of money, and there are some people who say do it on a case-by-case basis and some people who say, you know, maybe we're learning a lesson here that the states should take on more of this role. How do you deal with something like that?\nROMNEY: Absolutely. Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better.\nInstead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in. We cannot...\nKING: Including disaster relief, though?\nROMNEY: We cannot -- we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.\nKING: All right, we need to work in another break. I know all the candidates want to get in on these issues and other issues. We will get back to them, I promise you that.\nAs we go to break, remember at home, if you have a question on Facebook, send it to us. If you have a question on Twitter, send it to us. You also can use your smartphone to get some exclusive information.\nWe're playing a little bit of an exercise called \"This or That\" to learn more about our candidates. It was Conan or Leno. It was Elvis or Johnny Cash.\nMr. Speaker, \"Dancing with the Stars\" or \"American Idol\"?\nGINGRICH: \"American Idol.\"\nKING: \"American Idol\" it is.\nOur candidates continue their debate in just a moment. Stay with us.\n[Applause]\n[Commercial Break]\nKING: Welcome back to our Republican debate here in the first- in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. Seven candidates up on stage as they try to impress the voters of New Hampshire and the voters of the country tonight. We've become, we are told, a trending topic on Twitter.\nLadies and gentlemen, I want you to look up there just a bit, and we'll get to some of these questions, because they're good questions, privatization there, improving relationships with the Middle East, what industries do you think can reinvent America. All good suggestions from concerned citizens across the country watching this debate unfold.\nBefore we go and out of every break, we're doing an exercise called \"This or That\" to learn more about our candidates. The speaker had no hesitation at all: \"American Idol\" over \"Dancing with the Stars.\nCongressman Paul, BlackBerry or iPhone?\nPAUL: BlackBerry. KING: BlackBerry it is.\nAll right. We're going to continue our conversation now. We want to bring up a very important issue I know all of you will want to weigh in on, and that is the debate about entitlements -- Mr. Cain mentioned those -- and specifically -- specifically Medicare. Right now, I want to go down to our audience. We've got Josh McElveen with a question.\nMCELVEEN: Thanks very much, John. And I have Dr. Paul Collins who -- you've been running a family practice in Manchester for how long?\nQ: Twenty-seven years.\nMCELVEEN: Nice work. So not surprising your question is related to health care. What's your question, sir?\nQ: Yes, sir. As a member of the Baby Boomer generation, I've been contributing to Medicare through payroll taxes for over 30 years. How do you propose to keep Medicare financially solvent for the next 50 years and beyond?\nKING: Let's start with Dr. Paul on this one.\nPAUL: Well, under these conditions, it's not solvent and won't be solvent. You know, if you're -- if you're an average couple and you paid your entire amount into -- into Medicare, you would have put $140,000 into it. And in your lifetime, you will take out more than three times that much.\nSo a little bit of arithmetic tells you it's not solvent, so we're up against the wall on that, so it can't be made solvent. It has to change. We have to have more competition in medicine.\nAnd I would think that if we don't want to cut any of the medical benefits for children or the elderly, because we have drawn so many in and got them so dependent on the government, if you want to work a transition, you have to cut a lot of money.\nAnd that's why I argue the case that this money ought to be cut out of foreign welfare, and foreign militarism, and corporate welfare, and the military industrial complex. Then we might have enough money to tide people over.\nBut some revamping has to occur. What we need is competition. We need to get a chance for the people to opt out of the system. Just -- you talk about opting out of Obamacare? Why can't we opt out of the whole system and take care of ourselves?\n[Applause]\nKING: All right, let's -- let's continue the conversation. Governor Pawlenty, Congressman Paul says opt out. Congressman Ryan says squeeze a lot of savings across the federal budget, including a lot out of Medicare to turn it into a -- he doesn't like this word -- but it turns essentially into a voucher program. Instead of having the federal program, the government would give you some money and you'd go out in the marketplace and shop for it. Is that the right way to do it?\nPAWLENTY: Let me first address the doctor. Doctor, you said in your question that you've paid in your whole life, and we respect that. People have made plans, particularly people who are on the program now or close to eligibility. We should keep our word to people that we've made promises to.\nSo under my proposal, if you're on the program or near the program, we'll keep our word. But we also have to recognize what Congressman Paul just said. There was a recent report out that the premiums for Medicare and the payroll withholdings are only paying about half the program. So it is not financially solvent. We have to fix it; we have to reform it.\nI'm going to have my own plan, John, that will feature some differences from Congressman Ryan's plan. It will feature performance pay rather than just volume pay to hospitals and clinics and providers. It will allow Medicare to continue as an option, but it'll be priced against various other options that we're going to offer people, as well, and some other things.\nAnd I also said, if it was a choice between Barack Obama's plan and doing nothing [ph], we have a president of the United States got one of the worst crises financially in the history of the country, and you can't find him on these issues. He's missing. I'll lead on this issue.\nKING: All right, Governor.\nMr. Speaker, I want to bring you into this conversation, because I'm looking down -- I want to get the words just right -- your initial reaction to the Ryan plan? It's radical right-wing social engineering. Then you backtracked. Why?\nGINGRICH: Well, first of all, it was a very narrow question, which said, should Republicans impose an unpopular bill on the American people? Now, I supported the Ryan budget as a general proposal. I actually wrote a newsletter supporting the Ryan budget. And those words were taken totally out of context.\nI'm happy to repeat them. If you're dealing with something as big as Medicare and you can't have a conversation with the country where the country thinks what you're doing is the right thing, you better slow down.\nRemember, we all got mad at Obama because he ran over us when we said don't do it. Well, the Republicans ought to follow the same ground rule. If you can't convince the American people it's a good idea, maybe it's not a good idea. So let me start there.\nSecond, there are certain things I would do different than Paul Ryan on Medicare. I agree strongly with him on Medicaid, and I think it could be done. But let me just say two quick things. KING: Quickly.\nGINGRICH: Congressman Tom Price has a very good bill in that would allow private contracting so those people who want to voluntarily could contract with their doctor or their hospital in addition to Medicare, and it would be outside the current system and it would relieve the pricing pressure on the current system. We did a study called \"Stop Paying the Crooks.\" We think you can save $70 billion to $120 billion in Medicare and Medicaid annually by not paying crooks...\nKING: All right. We have to -- we have to save time.\nGINGRICH: ... two examples.\nKING: We have to save time. Let me start with the senator first. Should the Republicans slow down?\nSANTORUM: No. We have a $1.4 trillion deficit, and it isn't getting any better anytime soon. We have to deal with this problem now. And what Paul Ryan has suggested, which I wholeheartedly support, is to use a program that is identical to what seniors already have. It's called Medicare Part D.\nThey have a program right now which seniors like. It is a program that's called a premium support program. We give seniors -- depending on income -- a certain amount of money so they can go out and they can purchase health care that they want that helps them -- and this is the key, John -- we need to include seniors in controlling costs.\nWhat President Obama -- let me finish, please -- what President Obama has done is he put in, in the Obamacare bill, the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Ladies and gentlemen, seniors, Medicare is going to be cut, starting in 2014, by the federal government, and it's going to be rationing of care from the top down.\nWhat Paul Ryan and Rick Santorum want to do, which is not radical, which is take a program, Medicare prescription drugs, that is 41 percent under budget, because seniors are involved in controlling costs, and apply it all to Medicare. It is the right approach for Medicare.\nKING: The speaker's point -- the speaker's point, Mr. Cain, was that if you've lost the American people, if they're not following you, you have to slow down until you can get them with you. Is that a fair point?\nCAIN: We don't need to slow down. I hate to tell you -- I hate to be the one to give you the bad news, Doctor. You're not going to get most of the money you put into Medicare if we don't restructure it.\nThe reason we're in the situation we are today with Medicare and Social Security is because the problem hasn't been solved. We can no longer rearrange it. We've got to restructure those programs. And the Paul Ryan approach I totally support.\nAnd he has been very courageous in taking the lead on this.\nAnd you know that commercial where they have demagogued the whole thing with medi-scare and having grandma tossed off the bridge? If we don't fix this problem, it's going to be our grandkids in that wheelchair that they were going to be throwing off the bridge. We have got to fix the problem.\nKING: Let's continue the conversation on entitlements. I know Congresswoman Bachmann wants to get in and others want to get in.\nLet's get on John Distaso on the floor.\nDISTASO: Thank you, John.\nMr. Cain, back to you. And while you're fired up there, let's turn to Social Security. Can you be specific regarding ages and income levels? Everyone talks about reform. What is your specific Social Security reform plan in regards to raising the retirement age, at what ages, cutting benefits and what income level means testing kicking in?\nThank you.\nCAIN: Let's fix the problem and that is to restructure Social Security. I support a personal retirement account option in order to phase out the current system. We know that this works. It worked in the small country of Chile when they did it 30 years.\nThat payroll tax had gotten up to 27 percent for every dollar that the worker made. I believe we can do the same thing. That break point would approximately 40 years of age.\nNow, young people realize they still got to contribute to the current system for those people that are on Social Security, that are near Social Security.\nDISTASO: Are you going to raise the retirement age as president of the United States?\nCAIN: I don't have to raise the retirement age, because that by itself isn't going to solve the problem. If Congress decides to do that, that's a different matter.\nHere's -- let me give you one another example where this approach has worked. The city of Galveston, they opted out of the Social Security system way back in the '70s. And now, they retire with a whole lot more money. Why? For a real simple reason -- they have an account with their money on it.\nWhat I'm simply saying is we've got to restructure the program using a personal retirement account option in order to eventually make it solvent.\nKING: All right. We're going to keep the conversation move. I know people want to weigh in. You'll get a chance to weigh in.\nLet's move now. Jennifer Vaughn is on the floor with a question.\nVAUGHN: John, thank you very much.\nGovernor Romney, I'd like to ask this to you first, please.\nThe Treasury Department says the United States will hit its credit limit on August the 2nd. Do you believe we will ultimately have to raise the debt ceiling?\nROMNEY: I believe we will not raise the debt ceiling unless the president finally, finally is willing to be a leader on issues that the American people care about. And the number one issue that relates to that debt ceiling is whether the government is going to keep on spending money they don't have.\nAnd the American people and Congress and every person elected in Washington has to understand we want to see a president finally lay out plans for reining in the excesses of government.\nYou've heard on here a whole series of ideas about entitlements. And that's about 60 percent of federal spends. That's a big piece. That's a big chunk. Ideas from all these people up here.\nWhere are the president's ideas?\nEach person has different ideas here. We can try them and try different ideas in different states and different programs at the federal level.\nBut why isn't the president leading? He isn't leading on balancing our budget and he's not leading on jobs. He's failed the American people both in job creation and the scale the government.\nVAUGHN: Governor --\nROMNEY: And that's why he's not going to be reelected.\nVAUGHN: Governor, what happens if you don't raise it? What happens then? Is it OK not to?\nROMNEY: Well, what happens if we continue to spend time and time again, year and year again more money than we take in?\nWhat we say to America is: at some point, you hit a wall. At some point, people around the world say, \"I'm not going to keep loaning money to America to pay these massive deficits pay for them because America can't pay them back and the dollar is not worth anything anymore.\" In that circumstance, we saddled our future -- the future of our kids in a way that is just unacceptable.\nAnd so, you're going to see Republicans stand up and say, \"Mr. President, lay down plans to balance this budget.\" If he does so, if we gets Democrats to come at that time table and honestly deal with the challenges we have, with the entitlement challenges, with the spending and discretionary accounts, with our jobs issues, and finally say you know what? We really can't afford another trillion dollars of Obamacare.\nKING: OK.\nROMNEY: If he'll be honest about these things, then I think you'll see the kind of progress you'd hope to see.\nKING: Congresswoman Bachmann, you'll get a vote on this issue. What Governor Romney outlined is the goal of Republicans, who's got a big deal to balance the budget. If you can't get that on the short term and this date approaches, those negotiations are continuing, what is your price tag -- what is your price tag in at least a first wave of cuts? And if you don't get it, would you say to the House Republicans, \"No, let the government go into default, that's where we need to stand\"?\nBACHMANN: I've already voted no on raising the debt ceiling in the past. And unless there are serious cuts, I can't.\nBut I want -- I want to speak to someone that's far more eloquent than I. Someone who said just dealing with the issue of raising the debt ceiling is a failure of leadership. That person was then Senator Barack Obama. He refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership.\nClearly, President Obama has failed in leadership. Under his watch, in two and a half years, we've increased the federal debt 35 percent just in that amount of time.\nSo, what we need to do both, from the Congress and president, he needs to direct his treasury secretary: pay the interest on the debt first, then we won't have a failure of our full faith and credit from their prioritized spending. We have to have serious spending cuts.\nKING: OK. Appreciate that again. I want to ask the candidates a little shorter on those answers so we can keep the voters involved.\nLet's go down to Josh on the floor.\nMCELVEEN: Thank you, John.\nAnd I'm joined by Mr. Jerry Kitty [ph] who runs a juvenile institution out of Massachusetts.\nAnd I'm told that has nothing to do with your question.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct.\nI'm just wondering what your definition of the separation of church and state is and how it will affect your decision-making.\nKING: Governor Pawlenty, I want you to take that one first.\nPAWLENTY: Well, the protections between the separation of church and state were designed to protect people of faith from government, not government from people of faith. This is a country that in our founding documents says we're a nation that's founded under God, and the privileges and blessings at that we have are from our creator. They're not from our member of Congress. They're not from our county commissioner.\nAnd 39 of the 50 states have in the very early phrases of their constitutions language like Minnesota has in its preamble. It says this, \"We the people of Minnesota, grateful to God for our civil and religious liberties,\" and so the Founding Fathers understood that the blessings that we have as a nation come from our creator and we should stop and say thanks and express gratitude for that. I embrace that.\n[Cheers and Applause]\nKING: Let's spend a little time talking. Let's spend a little bit of time talking about it.\nSenator, let's start with you. Just what role does faith play in your political life? Are there decisions, certain issues where some might you just, let's meet with my advisers, what does my gut say, and others where you might retreat and have a moment of private prayer?\nSANTORUM: I'm some who believes that you approach issues using faith and reason. And if your faith is pure and your reason is right, they'll end up in the same place.\nI think the key to the success of this country, how we all live together, because we are a very diverse country -- Madison called it the perfect remedy -- which was to allow everybody, people of faith and no faith, to come in and make their claims in the public square, to be heard, have those arguments, and not to say because you're not a person of faith, you need to stay out, because you have strong faith convictions, your opinion is invalid. Just the opposite -- we get along because we know that we -- all of our ideas are allowed in and tolerated. That's what makes America work.\nKING: Congressman Paul, does faith have a role in these public issues, the public square, or is it a personal issue at your home and in your church?\nPAUL: I think faith has something to do with the character of the people that represent us, and law should have a moral fiber to it and our leaders should. We shouldn't expect us to try to change morality. You can't teach people how to be moral.\nBut the Constitution addresses this by saying -- literally, it says no theocracy. But it doesn't talk about church and state. The most important thing is the First Amendment. Congress shall write no laws -- which means Congress should never prohibit the expression of your Christian faith in a public place.\nKING: OK. Great. Let's go down to Josh McElveen, and let's continue the conversation.\n[Cheers and Applause]\nMCELVEEN: Thank you.\nWhile we're on the topic of faith and religion, the next question goes to Mr. Cain. You recently said you would not appoint a Muslim to your cabinet and you kind of back off that a little bit and said you would first want to know if they're committed to the Constitution. You expressed concern that, quote, \"a lot of Muslims are not totally dedicated to this country.\"\nAre American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christian or Jews?\nCAIN: First, the statement was would I be comfortable with a Muslim in my administration, not that I wouldn't appoint one. That's the exact transcript.\nAnd I would not be comfortable because you have peaceful Muslims and then you have militant Muslims, those that are trying to kill us.\nAnd so, when I said I wouldn't be comfortable, I was thinking about the ones that are trying to kill us, number one.\nSecondly, yes, I do not believe in Sharia law in American courts. I believe in American laws in American courts, period. There have been instances -\n[Cheers and Applause]\nCAIN: There have been instances in New Jersey -- there was an instance in Oklahoma where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law. I was simply saying very emphatically, American laws in American courts.\nKING: So, on that point, Governor Romney let me come to you on this.\nWhat Mr. Cain is saying that he would have -- my term, not his -- a purity test or a loyalty test. He would want to ask a Muslim a few question or a few questions before he hired them, but he wouldn't ask those questions of a Christian or Jew.\nCAIN: Sorry. No, you are restating something I did not say, OK? If I may, OK?\nKING: Please let's make it clear.\nCAIN: When you interview a person for a job, you look at their -- you look at their work record, you look at their resume, and then you have a one-on-one personal interview. During that personal interview, like in the business world and anywhere else, you are able to get a feeling for how committed that person is to the Constitution, how committed they are to the mission of the organization --\nKING: When I asked -- I asked this question the other night, though, you said you want to ask a Muslim those questions but you didn't you have to ask them to a Christian or a Jew? CAIN: I would ask certain questions, John. And it's not a litmus test. It is simply trying to make sure that we have people committed to the Constitution first in order for them to work effectively in the administration.\nKING: Should one segment, Governor -- I mean, one segment of Americans, in this case, religion, but in any case, should one segment be singled out and treated differently?\nROMNEY: Well, first of all, of course, we're not going to have Sharia law applied in U.S. courts. That's never going to happen. We have a Constitution and we follow the law.\nNo, I think we recognize that the people of all faiths are welcome in this country. Our nation was founded on a principal of religious tolerance. That's in fact why some of the early patriots came to this country and we treat people with respect regardless of their religious persuasion.\nObviously, anybody who would come into my administration would be someone who I knew, who I was comfortable with, and who I believed would honor as their highest oath -- their oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States.\nKING: Mr. Speaker, go ahead.\nGINGRICH: I just want to comment for a second. The Pakistani who emigrated to the U.S. became a citizen, built a car bomb which luckily failed to go off in Times Square was asked by the federal judge, how could he have done that when he signed -- when he swore an oath to the United States. And he looked at the judge and said, \"You're my enemy. I lied.\"\nNow, I just want to go out on a limb here. I'm in favor of saying to people, if you're not prepared to be loyal to the United States, you will not serve in my administration, period.\n[Applause]\nGINGRICH: We did this -- we did this in dealing with the Nazis and we did this in dealing with the communists. And it was controversial both times, and both times we discovered after a while, you know, there are some genuinely bad people who would like to infiltrate our country. And we have got to have the guts to stand up and say no.\nKING: We're going to work in another break.\nStill a lot more ground to cover with our seven Republican candidates for president tonight. Voters here in New Hampshire are asking the questions. You can help us at home on Facebook and on Twitter. Please send in your suggestions.\nIn and out of every break, we're asking a candidate a personal question, this or that, to make a choice.\nMr. Cain, deep dish or thin crust?\n[Laughter]\nCAIN: Deep dish.\nKING: Deep dish, it is. Our seven candidates for the Republican presidential nomination will be right back.\n[Cheers and Applause]\n[Commercial Break]\n[Cheers and Applause]\nKING: Seven Republican candidates for president here on the campus of St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. Let's continue our conversation.\nBut, first, let's continue to know our candidates a little better.\nDeep dish emphatically from Mr. Cain before the break.\nGovernor Romney, to you now. Imagine you're getting to the barbecue joint. Maybe it's here in New Hampshire, maybe it's South Carolina ordering some wings. Spicy or mild?\nROMNEY: Oh, spicy. Absolutely.\nAnd, by the way, Bruins are up 4-0.\n[Cheers and Applause]\nKING: All right. All right. There you go. There you go. I think -- I think that's an audience pleaser.\nLet's continue our questions. Let's get right down on the floor with John Distaso of the \"Union Leader.\"\nDISTASO: Thank you, John.\nCongresswoman Bachmann, let's turn to a serious subject.\nNew Hampshire is one of five states where individuals who happen to be gay can marry legally. This is a question of conflicting interest. I know you're opposed to same-sex marriage.\nAs president, would you try to overturn -- what influence would you use from the White House to try to overturn these state laws despite your own personal belief that states should handle their own affairs whenever possible and in many circumstances?\nBACHMANN: Well, I do believe in the 10th Amendment and I do believe in self-determination for the states.\nI also believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. I carried that legislation when I was a senator in Minnesota, and I believe that for children, the best possible way to raise children is to have a mother and father in their life.\nNow, I didn't come from a perfect background. My parents were divorced. And I was raised by a single mother. There's a lot of single families and families with troubled situations. That's why my husband and I have broken hearts for at-risk kids and it's why we took 23 foster children into our home.\nDISTASO: What would a President Bachmann do to initiate or facilitate a repeal law on the state level? Anything at all from the White House? Would you come into the state of New Hampshire, for instance, and campaign on behalf of a repeal law?\nBACHMANN: I'm running for the presidency of the United States. And I don't see that it's the role of a president to go into states and interfere with their state laws.\n[Cheers and Applause]\nKING: On that point -- on that point, to voters out there for whom this is an important issue, let's try to quickly go through it. Let me start at this end, we'll just go right through. I'll describe it this way. Are you a George W. Bush Republican, meaning a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, or a Dick Cheney who, like I believe, the congresswoman just said, this should be made -- this decision, same sex marriage, should be a state's decision?\nCAIN: State's decision.\nQ: Yes.\nPAWLENTY: I support a constitutional amendment to define marriage between a man and woman. I was the co-author of the state -- a law in Minnesota to define it and now we have courts jumping over this.\nKING: OK. Let's just go through this.\nPAUL: The federal government shouldn't be involved. I wouldn't support an amendment. But let me suggest -- one of the ways to solve this ongoing debate about marriage, look up in the dictionary. We know what marriage is all about.\nBut then, get the government out of it. Why doesn't it go to the church? And why doesn't it to go to the individuals? I don't think government should give us a license to get married. It should be in the church.\nKING: Governor Romney, constitutional amendment or state decision?\nROMNEY: Constitutional.\nKING: Mr. Speaker? GINGRICH: Well, I helped author the Defense of Marriage Act which the Obama administration should be frankly protecting in court. I think if that fails, at that point, you have no choice except to [ph] constitutional amendment.\nKING: We heard the congresswoman's answer, Senator.\nSANTORUM: Constitutional amendment. Look, the constitutional amendment includes the states. Three-quarters of the states have to -- have to ratify it. So the states will be involved in this process. We should have one law in the country with respect to marriage. There needs to be consistency on something as foundational as what marriage is.\nKING: Very quickly?\nBACHMANN: John, I do support a constitutional amendment on -- on marriage between a man and a woman, but I would not be going into the states to overturn their state law.\nKING: All right, let me ask you another question. The Obama administration is in the process -- and Leon Panetta, who's the new defense secretary, will implement -- essentially, the repeal of \"don't ask/don't tell\" so gays will be allowed to serve openly in the military. I want to ask each of you -- and, again, if we can be quickly, because then we want to get to the voters question -- if you were president -- if you become president of the United States, now gays are allowed to serve openly in the military, would you leave that policy in place or would you try to change it, go back to \"don't ask/don't tell,\" or something else?\nCAIN: If I had my druthers, I never would have overturned \"don't ask/don't tell\" in the first place. Now that they have changed it, I wouldn't create a distraction trying to turn it over as president. Our men and women have too many other things to be concerned about rather than have to deal with that as a distraction.\nKING: Leave it in place if you inherit the new Obama administration policy or try to overturn it?\nPAWLENTY: John, we're a nation in two wars. I think we need to pay deference to our military commanders, particularly our combatant commanders, and in this case, I would take my cues from them as to how this affects the military going forward. I know they expressed concerns -- many of the combatant commanders did -- when this was originally repealed by the Obama administration.\nKING: Congressman?\nPAUL: I would not work to overthrow it. We have to remember, rights don't come in groups. We shouldn't have gay rights. Rights come as individuals. If we would [ph] have this major debate going on, it would be behavior that would count, not the person who belongs to which group.\n[Applause] KING: Leave it in place, what you inherit from the Obama administration or overturn it?\nROMNEY: Well, one, we ought to be talking about the economy and jobs. But given the fact you're insistent, the -- the answer is, I believe that \"don't ask/don't tell\" should have been kept in place until conflict was over.\nKING: Mr. Speaker?\nGINGRICH: Well, I think it's very powerful that both the Army and the Marines overwhelmingly opposed changing it, that their recommendation was against changing it. And if as president -- I've met with them and they said, you know, it isn't working, it is dangerous, it's disrupting unit morale, and we should go back, I would listen to the commanders whose lives are at risk about the young men and women that they are, in fact, trying to protect.\nKING: Congresswoman?\nBACHMANN: I would -- I would keep the \"don't ask/don't tell\" policy.\nKING: So you would -- whatever the Obama administration does now, you would go -- try to go back? You'd try to reverse what they're doing?\nBACHMANN: I would, after, again, following much what the speaker just said, I would want to confer with our commanders-in-chief and with -- also with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because I'd want to know how it was being implemented and if it has -- had had the detrimental effects that have been suggested that will come.\nKING: All right. Last word on this issue, Senator?\nSANTORUM: The job of the United States military is to protect and defend the people of this country. It is not for social experimentation. It should be repealed. And the commanders should have a system of discipline in place, as Ron Paul said, that punishes -- that punishes bad behavior.\nKING: Let's go back down to the floor here. Jennifer Vaughn has a question.\nVAUGHN: Thanks, John.\nSenator Santorum, staying with you for a moment, if I may, you are staunchly pro-life. Governor Romney used to support abortion rights until he changed his position on this a few years ago. This has been thoroughly discussed. But do you believe he genuinely changed his mind, or was that a political calculation? Should this be an issue in this primary campaign?\nSANTORUM: I think -- I think an issue should be -- in looking at any candidate is looking at the authenticity of that candidate and looking at their -- at their record over time and what they fought for. And I think that's -- that a factor that -- that should be determined.\nYou can look at my record. Not only have I been consistently pro-life, but I've taken the -- you know, I've not just taken the pledge, I've taken the bullets to go out there and fight for this and lead on those issues. And I think that's a factor that people should consider when you -- when you look, well, what is this president going to do when he comes to office?\nA lot of folks run for president as pro-life and then that issue gets shoved to the back burner. I will tell you that the issue of pro-life, the sanctity and dignity of every human life, not just at birth, not just on the issue of abortion, but with respect to the entire life, which I mentioned welfare reform and -- and the dignity of people at the end of life, those issues will be top priority issues for me to make sure that all life is respected and held with dignity.\n[Applause]\nKING: Governor Romney, let me give you -- take -- take 20 or 30 seconds, if there's a Republican out there for whom this important, who questions your authenticity on the issue?\nROMNEY: People have had a chance to look at my record and look what I've said as -- as I've been through that last campaign. I believe people understand that I'm firmly pro-life. I will support justices who believe in following the Constitution and not legislating from the bench. And I believe in the sanctity of life from the very beginning until the very end.\nKING: Is there anybody here who believes that that's an issue in the campaign, or is it case closed?\nUNKNOWN: Case closed.\nKING: Case closed it is. All right. Let's move on to the questions.\nTom Foreman is standing by up in Rochester.\nFOREMAN: Hi, John. Representative Bachmann, I have a question for you. Governor Pawlenty says he opposes abortion rights except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at stake. Do you have any problem with that position? And if so, why?\nBACHMANN: I am 100 percent pro-life. I've given birth to five babies, and I've taken 23 foster children into my home. I believe in the dignity of life from conception until natural death. I believe in the sanctity of human life.\nAnd I think the most eloquent words ever written were those in our Declaration of Independence that said it's a creator who endowed us with inalienable rights given to us from God, not from government. And the beauty of that is that government cannot take those rights away. Only God can give, and only God can take.\nAnd the first of those rights is life. And I stand for that right. I stand for the right to life. The very few cases that deal with those exceptions are the very tiniest of fraction of cases, and yet they get all the attention. Where all of the firepower is and where the real battle is, is on the general -- genuine issue of taking an innocent human life. I stand for life from conception until natural death.\n[Applause]\nKING: All right. Governor Pawlenty, it was your position that was brought into the question. We'll give you a few seconds.\nPAWLENTY: Well, this is a great example where we can look at our records. The National Review Online, which is a conservative publication, said based on results -- not just based on words -- I was probably the most pro-life candidate in this race.\nAs governor of the state of Minnesota, I appointed to the Supreme Court a conservative court for the first time in the modern history of my state. We passed the most pro-life legislation anytime in the modern history of the state, which I proposed and signed, including women's right to know, including positive alternatives to abortion legislation, and many others.\nI'm solidly pro-life. The main pro-life organization in Minnesota gives me very, very high marks. And I haven't just talked about these things; I've done it.\nKING: All right, Governor, thank you for that. Let's go back up to -- now up to Plymouth, New Hampshire. Thomas Fahey is standing by with a voter and a question.\nFAHEY: Yes, thanks, John. I'm here with Lydia Cumbee. She lives in Franconia, and she is a naturalized citizen who moved to New Hampshire several years ago from Minnesota, of all places. And she's got a question about immigration.\nQ: As a naturalized American citizen who came here legally, I would like to know how you, as America -- as president, plan to prevent illegal immigrants from using our health care, educational, or welfare systems?\nKING: Senator Santorum, why don't you lead off on that one?\nSANTORUM: Well, I'm the son of a legal immigrant in this country and -- and believe in legal immigration. That is a great wellspring of -- of strength for our country.\nBut we cannot continue to provide -- the federal government should not require states to provide government services. And I have consistently voted against that and believe that we are, unfortunately -- my grandfather came to this country -- I announced in Somerset County. He didn't come here because he was guaranteed a government benefit. He came here because he wanted freedom.\nAnd I think most people who come to this country -- certainly all people who come here legally -- want it because they wanted the opportunities of this country. And that's what we should be offering. We should not be offering to people -- particularly those who broke the law to come here or overstayed their visa -- we should not be offering government benefits.\nKING: And so, Dr. Paul, to you on this one, the question comes up, though, once they're in the country illegally, you have -- compassion sometimes bumps up against enforcing the law and state budget crises. A 5-year-old child of an illegal immigrant walks into an emergency room. Does the child get care?\nPAUL: Well, first off, we shouldn't have the mandates. We bankrupted the hospitals and the schools in Texas and other states. We shouldn't give them easy citizenship.\nWe should think about protecting our borders, rather than the borders between Iraq and Afghanistan. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n[Applause]\nBut on -- on coming in, you know, there was a time when government wasn't -- we didn't depend on government for everything. There was a time when the Catholic Church actually looked after...\nKING: But should they get care? Should they get care? Should taxpayers have to pay for that care?\nPAUL: No, they should not be forced to, but we wouldn't -- we shouldn't be penalizing the Catholic Church, because they're trying to fulfill a role. And some of the anti-immigrants want to come down hard on the Catholic Church, and that is wrong.\nIf we believed in our free society -- as a matter of fact, this whole immigration problem is related to the economy. People aren't coming over as much now because it's weak. When we had a healthy economy, some of our people didn't work [ph] and people flowed over here getting jobs. So there is an economic issue here, as well.\nBut, no, if you have an understanding and -- and you want to believe in freedom, freedom has solved these kind of problems before. You don't have to say, oh, you're not going to have care or there won't be any care and everybody is going to starve to death and -- and die on the streets without medical care. That's the implication of the question. That's just not true, and you shouldn't accept it.\nKING: Mr. Cain, another issue that's come up in recent years...\n[Applause]\n... as this debate has bubbled up is the whole question of birthright citizenship. If there are two illegal immigrants, two adults who came into this country illegally, and they have a child, should that child be considered a citizen of the United States?\nCAIN: I don't believe so. But let's -- let's look at solving the real problem, OK? Immigration is full of problems, not one. This is why we keep kicking the can down the road. Secure the borders. Get serious about securing our borders.\nNumber two, enforce the laws that are already there.\nNumber three, promote the path to citizenship, like this lady did, by getting -- cleaning up the bureaucracy.\nAnd here's how we deal with the illegals that are already here. Empower the states to do what the federal government hasn't done, won't do, and can't do. Then we won't be getting into the problem that was raised.\nWe are a compassionate nation. Of course they're going to get care. But let's fix the problem.\nKING: Well, to empower the states, Mr. Cain says, Governor Pawlenty, do you support, then -- Arizona has its version, parts of it -- parts of it, employee enforcement law, have been upheld. The big SB 1070 making its way to the Supreme Court. Alabama just has a new bill. Would you want to be president of the United States in which each state can decide what it does? Or would you make the point, look, this is a federal purview, period?\nPAWLENTY: I'm a strong supporter of state rights, but if the federal government won't do its job -- in this case, protecting and securing our border -- then let the states do it. And they will. And...\n[Applause]\n... when President Bush asked governors to volunteer their National Guard to go to the border to help reinforce, through Operation Jump Start, our border, I was one of the few governors who did it. I sent Minnesota National Guard there to reinforce the border, and it works. And that's what we need to do.\nAnd, by the way, this issue of birthright citizenship again brings up the importance of appointing conservative justices. That result is because a U.S. Supreme Court determined that that right exists, notwithstanding language in the Constitution. I'm the only one up here -- I believe I'm the only one up here -- who's appointed solidly, reliably conservative appointees to the -- to the court.\nKING: I want to do one more on this issue. President Bush and Senator McCain spent a lot of time on this, Mr. Speaker. I want your view. There are an estimated maybe 20 million illegal immigrants in this country. People have different numbers. If you were going to round them all up -- Congressman Tom Tancredo on this stage four years ago would have said round them up and kick them up, they broke the law, they shouldn't be here. I don't know where the money would come from in this environment.\nSo I want you sense. Do you -- is that what the states should be doing, the federal government should be spending money and resources on? Or -- or like President Bush and like Senator McCain, at least in the McCain-Kennedy days, should we have some path to status for those who are willing to step up and admit where they are and come out of the shadows?\nGINGRICH: One of the reasons this country is in so much trouble is that we are determined among our political elites to draw up catastrophic alternatives. You either have to ship 20 people out of America or legalize all of them.\nThat's nonsense. There's not -- we're never going to pass a comprehensive bill. Obama proved that in the last two years. He couldn't get a comprehensive bill through with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and he didn't even try, because he knew he couldn't do it.\nYou break this down. Herman Cain's essentially right, you break it down. First of all, you control the border. We can ask the National Guard to go to Iraq. We ask the National Guard to go to Kuwait. We ask the National Guard to go to Afghanistan. Somehow we would have done more for American security if we had had the National Guard on the border.\nBut if you don't want to use the National Guard, I'm...\n[Applause]\nJust one last example. If you don't want to use the National Guard, take -- take half of the current Department of Homeland Security bureaucracy in Washington, transplant it to Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. You'll have more than enough people to control the border.\n[Applause]\nKING: All right. Let's...\nGINGRICH: No, but let me say this, John. No serious citizen who's concerned about solving this problem should get trapped into a yes/no answer in which you're either for totally selling out protecting America or you're for totally kicking out 20 million people in a heartless way. There are -- there are humane, practical steps to solve this problem, if we can get the politicians and the news media to just deal with it honestly.\nKING: All right.\nJohn Distaso down on the floor has a question.\nDISTASO: Thank you, John.\nCongressman Paul, this is for you. John, if you don't mind, I'd also like to hear from Governor Romney and a couple of the candidates, because it relates to a specific New Hampshire issue with a national question.\nHere in New Hampshire, there is a popular bill that is being considered by our state legislature that would restrict the state's power to seize private land to build a power plant or a transmission facility. Should governments at any level be able to use eminent domain for major projects that will reduce America's dependence on foreign oil?\nPAUL: No. We -- we shouldn't have that power given to the government where they can take private land and transfer it to a private industry. The eminent domain laws are going to vary in different states, but we have the national eminent domain laws. It was never meant to take it from some people, private owners, and then take it and give it to a corporation because it's going to help that locality.\nAnd this goes back to the basic understanding of property rights. Property and free society should be owned by the people, and it shouldn't be regulated to death by the governments, whether it's Washington, D.C., or local governments.\nRight now, we really don't own our land. We just pay rent on our land and we listen to all these regulations. So I would say that courts should get out of the way, too. They should not have this right to take land from individuals to provide privileges for another group.\n[Applause]\nDISTASO: Governor Romney, you're a property owner in New Hampshire. You are a New Hampshire property owner, but you also are for reducing our dependence on foreign oil. There are a lot of people in the state who are concerned about this project, but they also want to have energy independence. How do you feel about that?\nROMNEY: Well, I don't believe that land should be taken -- the power of government to give to a private corporation. And so the right of eminent domain is a right which is used to foster a public purpose and public ownership for a road, highways, and so forth. And so my view is, if land is going to be taken for purposes of a private enterprise, that's the wrong way to go.\nNow, the right answer for us to have energy independence is to start developing our own energy in this country, and we're not doing that. We -- we have a huge find with natural gas; 100 years of new natural gas has been found. More drilling for oil, natural gas, clean coal. We have coal in great abundance, nuclear power ultimately, and all the renewables. But it's time for us to have a president who really cares about finally getting America on track for energy security.\nKING: And so let's stay on this issue, because it is a very important issue. Josh McElveen down on the floor.\nMCELVEEN: Thanks very much, John. Timely issue. Question for Senator Santorum. The Senate tomorrow is going to be voting on possibly abolishing the ethanol tax, effective July 1st [inaudible] major impact on our friends in another early voting state in Iowa. They grow corn. This is a move that would basically remove tax credits worth $6 billion. Question to you is, do you support abolishing?\nSANTORUM: Yeah, I actually had proposed that we can phase out the ethanol subsidy, which is the blender's credit, over a five-year period of time. I also proposed, as part of helping him in that transition -- one other thing. I also phase out the tariff on ethanol coming into this country over that five-year period of time.\nOne of the issues for the ethanol industry is distribution networks. So I would take half of that credit every year, 4.5 cents, and use it to help expand distribution for E-85 in other areas of the country. And that all would be shut down in five years.\nAnd I say that because I think the ethanol industry -- I voted against ethanol subsidies my entire time in Congress. But I will tell you, the ethanol industry has matured greatly, and I think they are actually capable of surviving and doing quite well going forward under that -- under that plan.\nKING: All right. I want to -- got to work in one more break before we go. We've got a lot more ground to cover. Believe it or not, our candidates -- we're running out of time here.\nInto and out of every break we're having a little experiment called \"This or That.\" \"Spicy\" from Governor Romney was the last one.\nGovernor Pawlenty, to you, Coke or Pepsi?\nPAWLENTY: Coke.\nKING: Coke it is, a good, swift answer there.\nWe've got to work in one more break. Before we go to break, though, I just want to show you. We're asking you on Twitter to show us what you think. What are the candidates' opinions on whether or not to withdraw troops from Afghanistan? That and a number of foreign policy questions when we return here to the campus of Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, seven Republicans who want to be your next president debating. Stay right here.\n[Commercial Break]\nKING: Welcome back. Seven Republican candidates for president debating on the campus of St. Anselm Congress in beautiful Manchester, New Hampshire -- St. Anselm College, excuse me. We want to turn to foreign policy now.\nI want to move up to Hancock and Jean Mackin, and she's got a question.\nMACKIN: I'm here with John Brown from Swanzey, New Hampshire. He's retired from the U.S. Navy, 25 years of service. Right now, he has three sons serving in the Navy. So you can imagine he has a very important question. What would you like to ask tonight, John?\nJOHN BROWN, VOTER: Osama bin Laden is dead. We've been in Afghanistan for ten years. Isn't it time to bring our combat troops home from Afghanistan?\nKING: Governor Romney, take the lead on that one. ROMNEY: It's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, consistent with the word that comes to our generals that we can hand the country over to the Taliban military in a way that they're able to defend themselves. Excuse me, the Afghan military to defend themselves from the Taliban. That's an important distinction.\nI want to say, first of all, thank you to you for the sacrifice of your family and your sons in defending the liberty that we have and our friends around the world. Thank you for what you've done.\nKING: Congressman Paul?\nROMNEY: Let me -- let me continue. That is I think we've learned some important lessons in our experience in Afghanistan. I want those troops to come home based upon not politics, not based upon economics, but instead based upon the conditions on the ground determined by the generals.\nBut I also think we've learned that our troops shouldn't go off and try and fight a war of independence for another nation. Only the Afghanis can win Afghanistan's independence from the Taliban. Thank you.\nKING: Congressman Paul, do you agree with that decision?\nPAUL: Not quite. I served five years in the military. I've had a little experience. I've spent a little time over in the Pakistan/Afghanistan area, as well as Iran. But I wouldn't wait for my generals. I'm the commander in chief.\nI make the decisions. I tell the generals what to do. I'd bring them home as quickly as possible. And I would get them out of Iraq as well. And I wouldn't start a war in Libya. I'd quit bombing Yemen. And I'd quit bombing Pakistan.\nI'd start taking care of people here at home because we could save hundreds of billions of dollars.\nOur national security is not enhanced by our presence over there. We have no purpose there. We should learn the lessons of history. The longer we're there, the worse things are and the more danger we're in as well, because our presence there is not making friends let me tell you.\nKING: Governor Pawlenty, a growing number of Republicans are more skeptical of these foreign involvements. But I want you to take what Congressman Paul just said there. Let's focus on one.\nHe said no bombing in Yemen. The strikes in Yemen have been targeted at al Qaeda leaders, at al Qaeda operatives, who the president of the United States, who happens to be a Democrat in his case, views as serious threats against this nation. Do you agree with Congressman Paul there or do you agree with President Obama and the strikes?\nPAWLENTY: Let me first say to John, thank you for your family's commitment to our nation, to your service, to the sacrifices that you made and to the burdens that you bear. I know I speak for everyone in this room and all across this country when we say we're grateful to you. We wouldn't have the country without people lie you and your sons. Thank you very much.\nBeyond that, John, I start with this perspective. On September 11th, 2001, individuals and groups killed 3,000 or so of our fellow Americans. They would have killed not 3,000, but 30,000 or 300,000 or 30 million if they could have. If they had the capability to do that in their hands -- and as soon as they get it, they'll try.\nThe first duty of the president of the United States, as the leader of this nation and commander in chief, is to make sure the nation is safe. You bet. If there are individuals I have intelligence on, or groups in Yemen that present a threat to our security interests in that region or the United States of America, you can bet they will hear from me and we'll continue the bombings.\nKING: Let's stay on foreign policy. I want to move the questioning. Tom Foreman up in Rochester. Tom. We lost him.\n[Crosstalk]\nQ: I'd like to know your opinion on your involvement with Libya.\nKING: Congresswoman Bachmann, should the president have supported and jointed more U.S. presence, but now a NATO operation? Was that the right thing to do? Is that in the vital national interest of the United States of America?\nBACHMANN: No, I don't believe so it is. That isn't just my opinion. That was the opinion of our defense secretary, Gates, when he came before the United States Congress. He could not identify a vital national American interest in Libya.\nOur policy in Libya is substantially flawed. It's interesting. President Obama's own people said that he was leading from behind. The United States doesn't lead from behind. As commander in chief, I would not lead from behind.\nWe are the head. We are not the tail. The president was wrong. All we have to know is the president deferred leadership in Libya to France. That's all we need to know. The president was not leading when it came to Libya.\nFirst of all, we were not attacked. We were not threatened with attack. There was no vital national interest. I sit on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. We deal with the nation's vital classified secrets.\nWe to this day don't yet know who the rebel forces are that we're helping. There are some reports that they may contain al Qaeda of North Africa. What possible vital American interests could we have to empower al Qaeda of North Africa and Libya? The president was absolutely wrong in his decision on Libya. KING: Mr. Speaker, address the same question. Was it in the vital national interest of the United States? As you do so, I had a conversation with a soon-to-be candidate who is not here tonight, Governor Huntsman, recently, who said he didn't think when it came to vital national interest. And he also said we can't afford it right now.\nShould the price tag be a factor when you're the commander in chief of the United States?\nGINGRICH: Sure. The price tag is always a factor, because, as General Eisenhower once he was president pointed out, as Abraham Lincoln understood, as George Washington understood, that's part of the decision.\nBut I think what Congresswoman Bachmann just said ought to really sober everybody about how much trouble we're in. Ten years after 9/11, our intelligence is so inadequate that we have no idea what percent of the Libyan rebels are, in fact, al Qaeda. Libya was the second largest producer of people who wanted to kill Americans in Iraq.\nI think that we need to think fundamentally about reassessing our entire strategy in the region. I think that we should say to the generals we would like to figure out to get out as rapid as possible with the safety of the troops involved. And we had better find new and very different strategies because this is too big a problem for us to deal with the American ground forces in direct combat.\nWe have got to have a totally new strategy for the region, because we don't today have the kind of intelligence we need to know even what we're doing.\nKING: Mr. Cain, take 30 seconds, please. People might say he's a businessman. He has no experience in government. How would you look at your responsibilities, draw that line, vital U.S. national interests as commander in chief?\nCAIN: It starts with making sure we understand the problem, which I don't think we did. We didn't have the intelligence. Number two, is it in the vital interest of the United States of America? If the answer is no, then we don't go any further. If it's not in the vital interest of America, To paraphrase my grandmother, with the situation in Libya and many of these other situations, they're not simple situations. It's a mess. It's just an absolute mess.\nAnd there's more that we don't know than we do know, so it will be very difficult to know exactly what we do until, like others have said, we learn from the commanders in the field.\nKING: Let's stay on how you would all focus as a commander in chief. Let's move down. Jennifer has a voter with a question.\nVAUGHN: Staying on this topic, John, thank you. I'd like you to meet Greg Salts, who lives here in Manchester, New Hampshire. What's your question tonight for the candidates? GREG SALTS, TRUCK DRIVER: Well, I support the U.S. military. But frankly, we're in debt up to our eyeballs. We have nation building going on around the world. We're the world's police force. World War II is over. The Korean War is over. But we still have military bases all over Europe, all over Asia.\nWe have something like 900 military bases all around the world. I want to know if there's a candidate on the stage who is willing to shut down the bulk -- not the bulk of these bases, but the bases that aren't vital to our national security, and take that money to pay off our national debt?\nKING: Senator Santorum, why don't I start with you on this one?\nSANTORUM: We have actually closed down a lot of bases overseas. Look, what we're dealing with is a failure of leadership on this administration's part to actually put together a strategy where we can confront our enemies. And our enemies are asymmetric threats: terrorism.\nThat means that they are not just the positioned in the Middle East, but around the world. That means we have to have the ability to confront those threats from around the world, which means we need basing around the world.\nSo number one, we do need that basing. We do need to be able to be nimble and to be able to attack where we're attacked because it's not just a threat. We don't need to build bases in Germany for a threat from the Soviet Union.\nIts much broader threat, number one. So we have to engage our allies and have our allies know that we have their back. The president has not done that. He's done everything he can, whether it's Israel or Honduras or whether it's Colombia or whether it's Czechs, the Poles -- he has turned his back on American allies and he has embraced our enemies.\nOur enemies no longer respect us. Our friends no longer trust us. And we have a foreign policy that unfortunately now we're probably going to need more of a presence, because we've created such a vacuum. Thus, all the contingency operations you're seeing here as a result of America's fecklessness in dealing with the threats that confront us.\nKING: I need to step in on time here. We have to take our last break of the evening. I know a lot of you have a lot of things to say. We'll get to more issues.\nAs we do some, if you take a look up here, you'll see the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. A lot of good questions. Would you have released the bin Laden photos? Would you support Israel at any cost if they're attacked by surrounding hostile countries.\nGood questions from our viewers there. We're here on the campus of St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. Seven Republican candidates for president. We'll be right back.\n[Commercial Break]\nKING: We're in the closing moments of our Republican presidential debate here on the St. Anselm College campus, Manchester, New Hampshire. Time flies when you're having fun. One last segment with the candidates.\nLet's kick off by going down on to the floor, WMUR's Jennifer Vaughn.\nVAUGHN: Hi, Mr. Cain. This one is for you. Public opinion polls consistently result in low approval ratings for Congress as a whole. And early polls show a lack of enthusiasm for this field of candidates. Most of you will say that you don't watch polls, but shouldn't you pay attention to public sentiment? And aren't these polls a direct reflection of what voters are and are not looking for?\nCAIN: Yes. I happen to believe that the polls do represent a barometer, because it's way too early. Secondly, probably a lot of the people don't know us yet, because it's still real early in the process.\nSo as people get to know us more and more, I think they're going to find that this really is a good field of candidates, at least in my opinion. But the people that know the most about everybody up here, they don't see this as a weak field, and neither do I.\nKING: All right. It is likely that the Republican nominee for president is standing on the stage tonight. If you win the nomination, you'll have to make the choice that a nominee makes, and that is picking a running mate.\nGovernor Pawlenty to you, look back on 2008 and the process. President Obama made a pick. Senator McCain made a pick. Who made the best choice?\nPAWLENTY: Senator Biden has been wrong about every major strategic decision in the modern history of the international conflict and military. Look at his judgment about partitioning Iraq, for example. Now we have Iraq being probably one of the shining example of success in the Middle East.\nIf Vice President Biden would have had his way, we would have had a partitioned Iraq and probably more mayhem in the Middle East. I think Governor Palin is a remarkable leader. I think she's qualified to be president of the United States.\nI think she's equally as qualified or more qualified, and would have been as strong of a president as Joe Biden. He's wrong on everything.\nKING: Go ahead, Governor.\nROMNEY: John, any one of the people on this stage would be a better president than President Obama. He has failed in job one, which was to get this economy going again. He failed in job two, which was to restrain the growth of the government. And he failed in job three, which is to have a coherent, consistent foreign policy.\nWe've had presidents in the past that had bad foreign policies. This is the first time we've had a president that doesn't have a foreign policy. And this hit or miss approach has meant a couple of successes, like getting Osama bin Laden -- congratulations -- but a lot of misses, like throwing our friends under the bus. And that's why any of these people who gets better known by the American people will serve as president with distinction over the future.\nKING: If that is you, if there is a President Bachmann, and you're only allowed to hire one of the candidates on the stage, which one would it be and why?\nROMNEY: Don't choose the old guys.\nBACHMANN: Well, maybe we'll have to have an \"American Idol\" contest and go from there. We'll let the audience decide.\nKING: Let the audience decide. Congressman Paul, if you were the president of the United States and you could pick one, but just one of these gentlemen and the lady, to join your administration, who would it be and why?\nPAUL: Join the administration?\nKING: Yes.\nPAUL: I would think everybody would qualify.\nKING: You only get to pick one. It's about choices.\nPAUL: I have to pick one? Hum? Let me look -- let me look them over. I would have to do a bit more quizzing. I would have to -- they haven't even told me how they feel about the Federal Reserve yet. They haven't told me about the foreign policy. So I have to do some more quizzing.\nKING: We're down to our last minute. I want to try to get to everybody. I want to start with you, Senator Santorum. What have you learned in the last two hours.\nSANTORUM: I think what Hermann said. We have a great field of candidates. I was very impressed by what I heard. I hope everybody else was. These are folks that answered the questions that were asked of them.\nKING: Congresswoman?\nBACHMANN: In the last two hours, I've learned more about the goodness of the American people -- from the question from John, his three sons that are serving in the Navy, his wonderful service. Everyone who asked a question has talked to me about --\nKING: Don't mean to interrupt you.\nGINGRICH: I think once again, New Hampshire is proving why it's first in the nation as the primary, because the questions are so good.\nKING: Governor?\nROMNEY: And New Hampshire is proving that the issue people care most about is getting this economy growing again, so that we can have rising housing prices again. People can have the kind of incomes they deserve. They don't have to wonder whether the future is brighter than the past. People in New Hampshire love the future.\nPAUL: I've learned with the group here that disagrees on some issues, we can talk about it and be civil to each other.\nKING: Governor?\nPAWLENTY: I learned that if you trust the people, our future is bright and I learned that the Boston Bruins have more heart than the Vancouver Canucks.\nKING: Mr. Cain?\nCAIN: What I've learned is that all of these candidates up here share one thing in common. And that is, it's not about us. It's about the children and the grandchildren. We're not that far apart on all of the big issues.\nKING: I want to thank all seven of our candidates tonight. I want to thank \"The Union Leader,\" WMUR and St. Anselm College for having us. We have a feisty campaign to come. Please pay attention at home.\nI want to thank everybody here. I'm John King.\nPresidential Candidate Debates, Republican Candidates Debate at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Seventy-one percent said they see his tariffs as a negative factor in price inflation. And just 31% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, said they accept Trump's argument that the economy will emerge with a stronger foundation for the long term.\nNegative assessments go beyond the economy. Sixty-five percent said Trump's administration is trying to avoid complying with federal court orders, and 64% said he's going too far in trying to expand presidential powers.\nSixty-two percent said they don't think his administration respects the rule of law.\nMajorities also expressed concern that the president will do too much to reduce the size and role of government (58%), argued he's acted beyond his authority as president without justification (56%) and doubted the Trump administration's commitment to protecting citizens' rights and freedoms (55%).\nAnywhere from 57% to 67% of Americans said they disapprove of Trump's performance on six of seven issues tested in this survey, including at least 6 in 10 on his handling of stock market volatility, tariffs, foreign relations and the economy overall.\nFewer, 53%, said they disapprove of his handling of immigration.\nSix in 10 or more said they oppose various administration initiatives, peaking at 77% opposed to cuts in federal funding for medical research.\nSeventy percent were opposed to increasing the federal government's role in how private universities are run, 67% were opposed to ending birthright citizenship and 66% were opposed to closing the Department of Education.\nAs reported Friday, opposition to deporting immigrants is lower, 51%. Additionally, on university governance, the public sided with Harvard University over the Trump administration in their dispute, 66%-32%.\nIn another gauge, 57% said Trump is \"going too far\" in closing federal agencies, and it's about the same, 56%, in both laying off federal employees and in taking action against his political opponents.\nThis eases to about half on ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, reflecting the public's divide on whether DEI efforts help level the playing field (51%) or create unfair discrimination (47%).\nIn a positive for the president, more people said they believe waste throughout the federal government has decreased rather than increased under Trump, 43%-25%. The rest said it's stayed the same.\nThat doesn't carry over in perceptions of fraud: Thirty-four percent said they think this has increased, while 32% said it has decreased.\nAnother question, raised by Trump's comprehensive efforts to reshape the government, found that 49% think the president is moving the country away from its founding principles, while 34% think he's moving it closer toward them. Seventeen percent said they don't think he's moving it either way.\nApproval\nAt 39%, Trump's job approval rating is down from 45% in a Washington Post/Ipsos poll in February. It now almost exactly matches his average, 40%, across his first term -- tied with Biden for the lowest presidential career average available, dating back to President Harry Truman.\nNotably, just 21% now said they \"strongly\" approve of Trump's work in office, his lowest percentage on record. About twice as many, 44%, said they strongly disapprove.\nTrump's approval rating from non-college-educated white men, a core support group, is 54%, tying his low in this group from his first term.\nThat may reflect that 43% of non-college-educated white men said the nation's economy has worsened under Trump, and a third said they have gotten less well off financially since he's taken office.\nTrump is also tied with his previous lows in approval among Democrats and liberals.\nStill, Trump is hanging on to the vast bulk of his voters.\nAmong people who voted for him in November, just 6% said they now regret it, while 94% said it was the right thing to do. (Buyer's regret was even lower, 2%, at this point in his first term, a 4-point swing.)\nIn another gauge of partisanship, 83% of Republicans said they approve of Trump's work in office, while 93% of Democrats and 60% of independents said they disapprove.\nA difference is that 51% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while 85% of Democrats strongly disapprove. So do 44% of independents, three times as many as those who strongly approve.\nTrump's ratings on individual issues, absent immigration, are also underwater.\nSixty-seven percent said they disapprove of his handling of the recent turmoil in the stock market.\nThe S&P 500 is down 8.7% since Trump took office.\nOn tariffs, 64% said they disapprove; on both the economy overall and U.S. relations with other countries, 61% said they disapprove; on looking out for the interests of average Americans, 58% said they disapprove; and on managing the federal government, 57% said they disapprove.\nThe opposition\nThe silver lining for Trump is that the opposition party remains out of favor.\nPeople said they trust him over the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems by 37%-30%. Underscoring bipartisan disaffection, 30% said they don't trust either party.\nFurther, while 60% said Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the country, even more, 69%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. It's 64% for the Republican Party overall.\nThere are some telling partisan gaps.\nIn the political middle, 62% of independents said Trump is out of touch, while substantially more, 76%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. And in their own camps, relatively few Republicans said Trump is out of touch, 19%, while twice as many Democrats, 38%, said this about their own party.\nAt the same time, more people said both parties should be doing more to oppose Trump rather than more to support him -- the Democratic Party by 46%-38% and the Republican Party by 50%-26%, with the rest saying each party is handling this about right.\nIn both cases, independents help tip the balance to opposing versus supporting Trump.\nCourts and Compliance\nIn terms of the legal battles over Trump's moves, people widely rejected the administration's accusations of improper judicial interference.\nMost, 62%-35%, said federal judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump's legal authority rather than trying to interfere with his authority.\nAn even wider margin of people, 67%-31%, said federal judges should have the authority to block an administration policy until a trial is held if they think it will harm people and is probably illegal.\nFurther, people said by a margin of 67%-31% that they think the Trump administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders regarding its activities rather than trying to comply with those orders.\nCutting government\nMajority perceptions of presidential overreach are common.\nAs mentioned, 58% said they express concern that Trump will do too much to reduce the size and role of the federal government. That's essentially a mirror of attitudes under Biden: Fifty-nine percent said they were concerned he'd do too much to increase the government's size and role.\nThe difference is in partisan divisions, reflecting sharply different views of government between Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on one hand and Republicans and Republican-leaning independents on the other.\nIn the Democratic group, 91% said they are concerned Trump will do too much to shrink the size and role of government, while 26% in the Republican group said the same.\nIn 2021, by contrast, 87% in the GOP camp said they were concerned that Biden would go too far to increase the government's size and role, while 31% in the Democratic group said so.\nViews on the Trump administration cutting federal regulations are more closely divided.\nFifty-two percent said they think it will cut regulations that are needed to protect public health and safety, while 46% instead said they think it will cut unnecessary regulations while keeping those that are needed.\nForeign relations and Russia\nIn the last area covered by this survey, respondents by 49%-34% said they think Trump has weakened rather than strengthened U.S. leadership in the world.\nWhile still negative, that's better than Biden's 48%-23% result on the same question in 2022.\nRegarding Russia, 46% said Trump's approach is too friendly, while 11% said it's too confrontational and 40% said it's about right. That's similar to what it was in a January 2017 poll.\nThis survey was completed before the administration's move in the past week, pressuring Ukraine to accept a ceasefire deal favorable to Russia.\nMethodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults. Partisan divisions are 30%-30%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.\nResults have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect.

Slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats.\nThe public is increasingly skeptical of how the economy will fare, in terms of inflation, in response to President Donald Trump’s policies generally. A majority of adults, 58%, think Trump’s policies will increase inflation, 30% think his policies will decrease inflation, and 12% think they will have no effect on inflation. Among Republicans, 62% think the policies will decrease inflation, a decline from 70% in late January and from 76% in December. Only 16% of independents think inflation will decrease, compared to 26% in January and 28% in December. Ninety-two percent of Democrats say Trump’s policies will increase inflation, an increase from 85% who said that in January and 82% in December.\nTrump’s national job approval declined slightly in this late March survey to 46%, with 54% disapproval. In January, 48% approved and 52% disapproved. Trump continues to enjoy high approval among Republicans, 87%, hardly changed from 89% in January. His approval has slipped somewhat among independents, to 32%, down from 37%. Approval among Democrats is 10% in March compared to 9% in January.\nApproval of how Elon Musk is handling his work in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) stands at 41%, with disapproval at 58%. Musk’s personal favorability is 38%, with 60% unfavorable.\nThe survey was conducted March 17-27, 2025, interviewing 1,021 adults nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-3.5 percentage points.\nAcross lines of race, education, and gender, more people think tariffs will hurt rather than help the economy. The sole exception is white, non-college-educated men, one of Trump’s strongest supporting groups with 67% reporting having voted for Trump in November. Among this core of Trump’s support, 44% say tariffs help the economy and 40% say they hurt the economy. Among all other categories of race, education, and gender, more think the economy will be hurt rather than helped, as shown in Table 1. Large majorities of college-educated white people of either sex and all categories of non-white people expect damage to the economy. A plurality of non-college white women agree, though a quarter don’t think there will be much of an effect.\nTable 1: Effect of tariffs on the economy, by race, education and gender\nAmong adults\n|\n|\nEffect of tariffs\n|\n|\nRace, education, gender\n|\nHelps U.S. economy\n|\nHurts U.S. economy\n|\nDoesn't make much difference\n|\n|\nAmong all adults\n|\n28\n|\n58\n|\n14\n|\n|\nwhite non-college male\n|\n44\n|\n40\n|\n16\n|\n|\nwhite non-college female\n|\n33\n|\n42\n|\n25\n|\n|\nwhite college male\n|\n24\n|\n61\n|\n16\n|\n|\nwhite college female\n|\n23\n|\n72\n|\n5\n|\n|\nNon-white non-college male\n|\n28\n|\n68\n|\n4\n|\n|\nNon-white non-college female\n|\n18\n|\n60\n|\n22\n|\n|\nNon-white college male\n|\n14\n|\n76\n|\n10\n|\n|\nNon-white college female\n|\n20\n|\n72\n|\n8\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national survey, March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: In general, do you think imposing tariffs or fees on products imported from other countries helps the U.S. economy, hurts the economy, or doesn’t make much of a difference either way?\n|\nExpectations about inflation are similar, with half of white, non-college-educated males thinking inflation will go down due to Trump’s policies, while a plurality of white, non-college-educated females and a majority of all other categories expect his policies to increase inflation, as shown in Table 2.\nTable 2: Effect of Trump policies on inflation, by race, education, and gender\nAmong adults\n|\n|\nPolicies’ effect on inflation\n|\n|\nRace, education, gender\n|\nDecrease inflation\n|\nIncrease inflation\n|\nHave no effect on inflation\n|\n|\nAmong all adults\n|\n30\n|\n58\n|\n12\n|\n|\nwhite non-college male\n|\n50\n|\n38\n|\n12\n|\n|\nwhite non-college female\n|\n35\n|\n46\n|\n19\n|\n|\nwhite college male\n|\n27\n|\n58\n|\n14\n|\n|\nwhite college female\n|\n26\n|\n70\n|\n4\n|\n|\nNon-white non-college male\n|\n31\n|\n58\n|\n11\n|\n|\nNon-white non-college female\n|\n16\n|\n74\n|\n10\n|\n|\nNon-white college male\n|\n11\n|\n71\n|\n17\n|\n|\nNon-white college female\n|\n23\n|\n74\n|\n3\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national survey, March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: Do you think Trump’s policy proposals will decrease inflation, increase inflation, or have no effect on inflation?\n|\nOther policies and executive orders\nA substantial majority (65%) of adults believe that the number of immigrants crossing the southern border has decreased since December, with 30% saying crossings are about the same and 5% saying border crossings have gone up.\nA substantial majority (68%) favor deportation of immigrants who are in the United States illegally, an increase from 60% in January. Thirty-two percent are opposed.\nWhen asked about deporting those immigrants in the United States illegally who have been in the country for a number of years and have jobs and no criminal record, support for deportation falls to 41% and opposition rises to 59%, slightly changed from January when 43% favored and 57% opposed deportation of this group.\nA substantial majority (64%) say that freezing spending or closing agencies that have been authorized by Congress is beyond the president’s powers, while 36% say the president does have this authority. Within the Republican party, 38% say this is beyond the president’s authority and 62% say he has this power.

Those with a favorable opinion of Zelensky include 23% of Republicans, 28% of independents, and 72% of Democrats. He is seen unfavorably by 59% of Republicans, 39% of independents, and 18% of Democrats.\nIn contrast to Zelensky, a large majority (85%) of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with 7% holding a favorable view. Republicans are only slightly more positive to Putin than are adults overall, with 10% favorable and 82% unfavorable. Independents are slightly more positive, 12% favorable and 74% unfavorable, with 14% saying they haven’t heard enough.

In the cases of both Russia and Putin, more than 70% of each U.S. partisan group have unfavorable opinions of both country and leader.\nA substantial majority (64%) of adults say the United States will be better off if it takes an active part in world affairs, while 36% say the country should stay out of world affairs. The percentage favoring an active role has increased in each partisan category since October 2024, during the Biden presidency. In October, 49% of Republicans chose an active role in the world, compared to 58% in March. Among independents, in October, 34% said an active role, while in March 48% said the same.

Those with an unfavorable opinion include 79% of Republicans, 67% of independents, and 69% of Democrats.\nAmericans have far more favorable views of Canada. 73%, with 20% unfavorable.

This gradient with age also persists within each partisan category.\nTable 8: Favorability to Israel by age\nAmong adults\n|\nAge\n|\nView of Israel\n|\n|\nFavorable\n|\nUnfavorable\n|\nHaven't heard enough\n|\n|\nAmong all adults\n|\n43\n|\n43\n|\n14\n|\n|\n18-29\n|\n23\n|\n62\n|\n15\n|\n|\n30-44\n|\n32\n|\n46\n|\n21\n|\n|\n45-59\n|\n50\n|\n34\n|\n16\n|\n|\n60+\n|\n59\n|\n35\n|\n6\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national survey, March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: [Israel] Do you have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the following countries or haven’t you heard enough yet to have an opinion?\n|\nThose with and those without a college degree (“non-graduates”) have nearly identical favorability to Israel, 43% among college graduates and 44% among non-graduates. Unfavorable views are a bit higher among college grads, 47%, than among non-graduates, 40%, though more non-graduates lack an opinion, 16%, than do graduates, 9%.\nViews of the parties\nApproval of the way Republicans in Congress are handing their job stands at 45%, with disapproval at 55%. Approval of how Democrats in Congress are doing their job is substantially lower at 29%, with disapproval at 71%. Republican approval of Republicans in Congress is 87%, while approval among Democrats of the way congressional Democrats are handling their job is only 50%. Among independents, 28% approve of the job by congressional Republicans and 15% approve of the job by congressional Democrats. Partisans of both parties are equally negative about the other party’s members of Congress: 88% of Republicans disapprove of job by Democrats in Congress, and 90% of Democrats disapprove of that by congressional Republicans.\nFavorability to the Democratic Party has declined from 46% in October to 35% in March, while the favorable rating of the Republican Party has increased from 42% in October to 46% in March. Favorability to the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement trails that of the Republican Party at 41%, up slightly from 39% in October.\nVaccinations and measles outbreak\nA relatively modest 37% say they have heard or read a lot about a measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, with 43% who say they have heard a little and 20% who have heard nothing at all. Democrats are considerably more likely to have heard a lot, 49%, than are Republicans, 29%, or independents, 23%. Only 12% of Democrats have heard nothing at all about the outbreak, while 24% of Republicans and 33% of independents have heard nothing.\nA large majority (87%) of adults say the benefits of childhood vaccinations for measles, mumps, and rubella outweigh the risks, while 13% say the risks outweigh the benefits.\nThose with children under 18 at home are more skeptical of vaccines than those without children. Among those with children, 81% say the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccines, while for those without school-age children, 90% say the benefits are worth it. This pattern holds across age groups for those under 30, 30-44, and 45-59. In each group those with children are less confident that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks than are those without children.\nThose who think the benefits outweigh the risks are almost twice as likely to have heard a lot about the measles outbreak than those who think the risks outweigh the benefits, by a margin of 39% to 21%.\nRacism and antisemitism\nSixty-eight percent say racism is a very big or moderately big problem, while 32% say it is a small problem or no problem at all. This percentage has varied little across 11 national surveys since late 2022.\nOpinion is evenly divided over whether discrimination against white people has become as big of a problem as discrimination against Black people and other minorities, with 51% saying that it is as big a problem and 49% disagreeing. As with views of racism, this perception has hardly changed over the past year. A majority of white people (60%) say discrimination against white people is as big a problem, while 76% of Black people disagree, as do 55% of Hispanics and 68% of people of other or multiple races.\nThose who view antisemitism as a very big or moderately big problem in the United States make up 61%, while 39% say it is a small problem or not a problem at all. Unlike views of Israel, there are modest partisan differences in concern with antisemitism, with 59% of Republicans, 51% of independents, and 65% of Democrats saying it is a problem.\nDirection of the country\nThe percentage saying the country is headed in the right direction has more than doubled since October, going from 20% in October to 42% in March. Those saying the country is off on the wrong track has declined from 80% in October to 58% in March. The recent trend is shown in Table 9.\nTable 9: Direction of the country\nAmong adults\n|\nPoll dates\n|\nDirection of country\n|\n|\nRight direction\n|\nWrong track\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n42\n|\n58\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n38\n|\n62\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n25\n|\n75\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n20\n|\n80\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: Do you feel things in this country are generally going in the right direction, or do you feel things have gotten off on the wrong track?\n|\nThese changing views are heavily influenced by partisan perceptions which shifted dramatically following Trump’s election in November. The percentage of Republicans saying right direction jumped from 7% in October to 80% in March, while Democrats dropped from 33% in October to 11% in March. Independents became somewhat more positive about the direction of the country, rising from 14% saying right direction in October to 25% in March. The full trend by party is shown in Table 10.\nTable 10: Direction of the country, by party identification\nAmong adults\n|\nPoll dates\n|\nDirection of country\n|\n|\nRight direction\n|\nWrong track\n|\n|\nRepublican\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n80\n|\n20\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n76\n|\n24\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n22\n|\n78\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n7\n|\n93\n|\n|\nIndependent\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n25\n|\n75\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n20\n|\n80\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n27\n|\n73\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n14\n|\n86\n|\n|\nDemocrat\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n11\n|\n89\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n7\n|\n93\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n29\n|\n71\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n33\n|\n67\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: Do you feel things in this country are generally going in the right direction, or do you feel things have gotten off on the wrong track?\n|\nEconomic conditions\nThe share of adults saying the economy is poor has declined over the last several months, from 31% in October to 20% in March. But the percentage saying the economy is excellent or good has only slightly increased, rising from 24% in October to 26% in March. Most of the reduction in those saying the economy is poor was absorbed by those saying the economy is “not so good,” which is now 53%—up from 45% in October. The full trend is shown in Table 11.\nTable 11: Views of the national economy\nAmong adults\n|\nPoll dates\n|\nNational economy\n|\n|\nExcellent/Good\n|\nNot so good\n|\nPoor\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n26\n|\n53\n|\n20\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n27\n|\n58\n|\n15\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n29\n|\n50\n|\n21\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n24\n|\n45\n|\n31\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: How would you describe the state of the nation's economy these days?\n|\nThe economy is seen through profound partisan lenses. Republicans now see a far better economy than they did in October when Joe Biden was president. Likewise, Democrats have become more negative about the economy with Trump as president. Independents became less negative from October to December but have changed little since then. Table 12 shows the trends by partisanship.\nTable 12: Views of the national economy, by party identification\nAmong adults\n|\nPoll dates\n|\nNational economy\n|\n|\nExcellent/Good\n|\nNot so good\n|\nPoor\n|\n|\nRepublican\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n45\n|\n46\n|\n9\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n27\n|\n63\n|\n10\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n11\n|\n57\n|\n32\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n8\n|\n47\n|\n44\n|\n|\nIndependent\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n15\n|\n56\n|\n29\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n16\n|\n60\n|\n24\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n20\n|\n55\n|\n25\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n18\n|\n38\n|\n44\n|\n|\nDemocrat\n|\n|\n3/17-27/25\n|\n12\n|\n60\n|\n28\n|\n|\n1/27-2/6/25\n|\n33\n|\n51\n|\n16\n|\n|\n12/2-11/24\n|\n51\n|\n41\n|\n8\n|\n|\n10/1-10/24\n|\n41\n|\n44\n|\n15\n|\n|\nMarquette Law School Poll, national surveys, latest: March 17-27, 2025\n|\n|\nQuestion: How would you describe the state of the nation's economy these days?\n|\nFamily finances\nLooking to the financial situation within the home, the percentage saying they are struggling has declined from 23% in October to 15% in March.

The executed prisoners had spent an average of 11 years and 5 months on death row before being put to death, which was about 6 months less than those executed in 1999.\nDuring 2000, Texas executed 40 people, Oklahoma executed 11 inmates, Virginia 8, Florida 6, Missouri 5, Alabama 4, Arizona 3 and Arkansas 2. Delaware, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and California each executed 1 person. As of December 31, 2000, 38 states and the federal government authorized capital punishment.\nThose executed during 2000 included 49 whites, of which 6 were white Hispanics; 35 blacks and 1 American Indian. Eighty of the executions were by lethal injection and 5 by electrocution. Twenty-one states authorized lethal injections in 1990, which increased to 36 states by 2000.\nFrom January 1, 1977, through December 31, 2000, there were 683 executions in 31 states. Sixty-five percent of those executions were in five states: Texas (239), Virginia (81), Florida (50), Missouri (46) and Oklahoma (30). The other states that executed offenders during the period were as follows: Louisiana, 26; South Carolina, 25; Alabama, 23; Arkansas, 23; Georgia, 23; Arizona, 22; North Carolina 16; Illinois, 12; Delaware, 11; California, 8; Nevada, 8; Indiana, 7; Utah, 6; Mississippi, 4; Maryland, 3; Nebraska, 3; Pennsylvania, 3; Washington State, 3; Kentucky, 2; Montana, 2; Oregon, 2 and Colorado, Idaho, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wyoming 1 each.\nAt year-end 2000, 37 states and the federal government held 3,539 men and 54 women on death row. California had the most (586), followed by Texas (450), Florida (371) and Pennsylvania (238). The federal system held 18.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, the number of offenders under sentence of death increased 52 percent, a period in which prison populations nationwide grew by 79 percent.\nThe race of those sentenced to death and those removed from death row during 2000 mirrored that of the total death row population at the end of last year:\n| Under sentence of death | Admissions | Removals | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Total | 3,593 | 214 | 161 | |||\n| White | 55% | 57% | 57% | |||\n| Black | 43% | 40% | 41% | |||\n| All other races | 2% | 3% | 2% |\nFor those under a death sentence as of last December 31 for whom the data were available, all had committed murder and most had a prior criminal background - 64 percent had a prior felony conviction and 8 percent had been convicted of a prior homicide. About 4 in 10 had an existing criminal justice status at the time of their capital offense, including 18 percent who had been on parole, 10 percent on probation and about 11 percent who had charges pending, had been escapees or had committed the capital offense while incarcerated. Approximately 1 in 6 offenders admitted since 1988 had 2 or more death sentences.\nAmong the 6,588 persons under sentence of death since the Supreme Court reaffirmed the death penalty in 1976, about 10 percent of those eligible for execution have had the sentence carried out. More than a third (35 percent) of those sentenced to death subsequently had the death sentence removed as a consequence of an appeal or commutation or died while incarcerated.\nThe average term served prior to execution for those executed since 1977 is 121 months; for those executed during 2000, the elapsed time from sentence to execution was 137 months. Just over 1 percent of those awaiting execution at the end of 2000 had been under a death sentence for more than 20 years.\nAmong the 683 executed since 1977, 518 were by lethal injection, 149 by electrocution, 11 by lethal gas, 3 by hanging (two in Washington State and one in Delaware) and 2 by firing squad (both in Utah).\nThe BJS bulletin, \"Capital Punishment 2000\" (NCJ-190598) was written by BJS statistician Tracy L.

For the first time, the number of executions exceeded the number of new death sentences.\n- The majority of states (29) have now either abolished the death penalty or paused executions by executive action.\n- 2023 is the 9th consecutive year with fewer than 30 people executed (24) and fewer than 50 people sentenced to death (21).\n- Three exonerations this year bring the total to 195 in the modern death penalty era.\n- High profile innocence cases in several states received intense media attention but found no relief in the courts, raising questions about the adequacy of state procedures and the ability of the legal system to protect innocent people.\n- The United States Supreme Court overwhelmingly rejected petitions from death-sentenced prisoners over the increasingly alarmed dissents of Justices Jackson, Kagan, and Sotomayor.\n- Prisoners who were executed spent an average of 23 years in prison, the longest average time since executions resumed in 1976, and were an average age of 54 years old at the time of their execution, the oldest average age since executions resumed in 1976 (tied with 2021).\n- The Biden Administration’s Department of Justice secured its first death sentence for Robert Bowers, convicted of killing eleven people in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Tree of Life Synagogue.\nIntroduction Top\nDeath Row Population By State†\n| Jurisdiction | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---|---|---|\n| California | 665 | 692 |\n| Florida | 313 | 330 |\n| Texas | 192 | 199 |\n| Alabama | 167 | 170 |\n| North Carolina | 140 | 139 |\n| Ohio | 129 | 135 |\n| Pennsylvania | 123 | 129 |\n| Arizona | 114 | 117 |\n| Louisiana | 63 | 62 |\n| Nevada | 62 | 65 |\n| Tennessee | 47 | 47 |\n| U.S. Federal Gov’t | 44 | 44 |\n| Georgia | 41 | 42 |\n| Oklahoma | 40 | 44 |\n| Mississippi | 36 | 37 |\n| South Carolina | 36 | 37 |\n| Arkansas | 28 | 30 |\n| Kentucky | 26 | 27 |\n| Missouri | 18 | 20 |\n| Nebraska | 11 | 12 |\n| Kansas | 9 | 9 |\n| Idaho | 8 | 8 |\n| Indiana | 8 | 8 |\n| Utah | 7 | 7 |\n| U.S. Military | 4 | 4 |\n| Montana | 2 | 2 |\n| New Hampshire^ | 1 | 1 |\n| South Dakota | 1 | 1 |\n| Oregon | 22 | |\n| Wyoming | ||\n| Total | 2331‡ | 2436‡ |\n- † Data from NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund for January 1 of the year shown.\n- ^ New Hampshire prospectively abolished the death penalty May 30, 2019.\n- ‡ Persons with death sentences in multiple states are only included once in the total.\nInnocence cases dominated much of the media’s attention on death penalty cases in 2023. While these prisoners were largely unsuccessful in the courts, there was unprecedented support for their claims from state legislators, prosecutors, judges, and other elected officials, some of whom declared themselves newly disillusioned with use of the death penalty in their state. This year is the 9th consecutive year with fewer than 30 people executed (24) and fewer than 50 people sentenced to death (21, as of December 1). The 23 men and one woman who were executed in 2023 were the oldest average age (tied with 2021) and spent the longest average number of years in prison in the modern death penalty era before being executed. As in previous years, most prisoners had significant physical and mental health issues at the time of their executions, some of which can be attributed to the many years they spent in severe isolation on death row. Continued difficulties obtaining lethal injection drugs led some states to explore new, untested methods of execution or revive previously abandoned methods. Other states enacted or continued pauses on executions while the state’s method of execution was studied.\nBefore 1972, state officials generally used the death penalty without fear of federal court review. That changed with Furman v. Georgia, when the Supreme Court invalidated all death penalty statutes, citing serious constitutional concerns with the arbitrariness and racial discrimination in many state processes and death sentences. After the Court approved the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, the Court assumed a more active role in regulating states’ use of the death penalty. In what Justice Blackmun later called “tinkering with the machinery of death,” the Court spent decades scrutinizing state laws and procedures, interpreting arcane statutory provisions, clarifying constitutional safeguards, reviewing challenges to methods of execution, and deciding cases that narrowed the application of the death penalty. The Court also intervened in extraordinary cases to grant stays of execution and resisted state efforts to expand use of the death penalty.\nNow, more than 50 years after Furman was decided, the majority of the Court appears unwilling to continue in this role. The Supreme Court granted only one stay of execution, reflecting the view of some members of the Court that prisoners bring “last-minute claims that will delay the execution, no matter how groundless.” The Court granted certiorari in only four death penalty cases, all of which pertained to procedural issues, and turned away the overwhelming majority of petitions filed by death-sentenced prisoners. Some state officials and legislatures may once again feel unrestrained by the risk of judicial oversight or correction; Florida directly flouted Supreme Court precedent with new legislation making a non-homicide crime a death-eligible offense, while states like Alabama announced plans to use nitrogen gas in an untested, risky method of execution.\nBut the pivot away from the Supreme Court does not mean there is (or will be) increased use of the death penalty. For the first time, more Americans now believe that the death penalty is administered unfairly than fairly. The data show that the death penalty is increasingly disfavored, and the continued, years-long decline in its use has little to do with the Supreme Court. It is, instead, the result of society’s greater understanding about the fallibility of our legal system and its inability to protect innocent people from execution, the vulnerabilities of the people who are sentenced to death, and a recognition that the significant resources and time necessary to use the death penalty do not deliver enough of a return on the public’s investment in terms of safety or deterrence. These lessons are reflected in changing public opinion polls, jury verdicts, state legislative and executive decisions, and charging decisions, as this 2023 Year End Report details below.\nPublic Opinion Top\nMore Americans Believe the Death Penalty is Applied Unfairly\nThe Gallup Crime Survey has asked for opinions about the fairness of death penalty application in the United States since 2000. For the first time, the October 2023 survey reports that more Americans believe the death penalty is applied unfairly (50%) than fairly (47%). Between 2000 and 2015, 51% — 61% of Americans said they thought capital punishment was applied fairly in the U.S., but this number has been dropping since 2016. This year’s 47% represents a historic low in Gallup’s polling.\nOverall support for capital punishment remains at a five-decade low in the United States. In 2023, the Gallup survey found that 53% of Americans favor the death penalty, the lowest number since March 1972, although not a statistically significant change from the 54% and 55% level of support recorded over the previous three years. Results from 2019 indicate that support for the death penalty drops even lower (36%) when respondents are given the option of life without parole. When Gallup first asked about the death penalty in 1936, 59% of Americans supported the death penalty for convicted murderers. Public support for the death penalty peaked in 1994, with 80% of Americans in favor, but has steadily declined since that year.\nGallup also asked respondents whether they believe the death penalty is imposed too often, about the right amount, or not enough. 39% of respondents said that capital punishment is not used often enough, while 56% of respondents believe it is either imposed too often or about the right amount. There are also partisan differences. 62% of Republicans think that the death penalty is not imposed often enough, while 25% say it is imposed about the right amount. 52% of Democrats think that the death penalty is imposed too often, while 24% think it is used about the right amount. There is a greater divide among Independents, as 37% think that it is not used enough, 32% think it is used about the right amount, and 26% think it is used too often.\nGallup’s Moral Issues Survey was administered in May 2023 against the backdrop of the Tree of Life Synagogue trial in Pittsburgh. Gallup reported a slight (5%) increase in the number of respondents who believe that capital punishment is morally acceptable, with 60% of individuals responding in the affirmative. The results of this survey have varied over the past two decades, reaching a high of 71% in 2006. Gallup reports that 82% of Republicans find the death penalty morally acceptable, compared to 59% of Independents, and just 40% of Democrats.\nInnocence and Clemency Top\nThree New Exonerations End Decades-Long Imprisonment\nThree exonerations (John Huffington, Jesse Johnson, and Glynn Simmons) occurred in 2023; collectively, the three men spent 109 years in prison. Including the previously unrecorded exonerations of Larry Hudson in 1993 and Joe Cota Morales in 1981, the total number of U.S. death-row exonerations since 1973 is 195.\nBefore leaving office, former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan granted death-sentenced prisoner John Huffington a full pardon on January 13, 2023 based on evidence that conclusively showed his “convictions were in error.” Originally convicted in 1981, Mr. Huffington, who always maintained his innocence, agreed in 2017 to accept an Alford plea in exchange for a reduced sentence which later resulted in his release. The original case was tried by disgraced prosecutor Joseph Cassilly, who was disbarred after an investigation revealed he had withheld exculpatory evidence regarding the scientific inaccuracy of forensic evidence in the case.\n“I have fought for over 40 years for this day, and I feel a deep sense of closure and vindication. This pardon officially acknowledges that I was wrongly convicted and imprisoned for crimes I never committed.”\nJesse Johnson, who has long maintained his innocence, was released from Oregon’s Marion County Jail on September 5, 2023. Deputy district attorneys Katie Suver and Matt Kemmy wrote in their motion to dismiss the case that, “Based on the amount of time that has passed and the unavailability of critical evidence in this case, the state no longer believes that it can prove the defendant’s guilt to twelve jurors beyond a reasonable doubt.” Two years earlier, Mr. Johnson’s conviction was overturned by the Oregon Court of Appeals after finding he had not received effective representation from his defense counsel at trial. According to Oregon’s Innocence Project, who assisted with appeals in 2014, racism on the part of the detective played a role in Mr. Johnson’s wrongful conviction.\n“I’m happy and excited and ready for the next phase now. Been a lot of years for something I didn’t do.”\n48 years after being sentenced to death, Glynn Simmons was exonerated on September 19, 2023, becoming the 11th person exonerated in Oklahoma since 1973. During his trial, prosecutors failed to disclose that the surviving victim identified multiple people in the line-up, not solely Mr. Simmons. Oklahoma District Attorney Vicki Behenna, agreeing that the original trial was unfair, first requested that Mr. Simmons’ sentence, which had already been reduced to life in prison in 1977, be vacated in July 2023. Ms. Behenna later asked that the case be dismissed due to the state’s inability to “prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Simmons was responsible for Ms. [Carolyn Sue] Rogers’ murder” in a new trial.\n“I’m happy, and I’m free. It’s a long, long struggle. … We need to reimagine justice and how we do it.”\nAlthough he does not meet DPIC’s strict criteria to be included in its Innocence Database, Barry Jones was freed on June 15, 2023 after serving 29 years for a crime that the Arizona Attorney General agreed he did not commit. Mr. Jones was sentenced to death in 1995 after being convicted of murdering his girlfriend’s four-year-old daughter in 1994. Medical evidence that was readily available at the time of trial showed that the child did not sustain her fatal internal injuries during the time she was in Mr. Jones’ care. But this evidence was not discovered by either his trial attorney or his state post-conviction attorney. In 2018, Mr. Jones presented this evidence for the first time in federal court as proof that his state counsel had been ineffective for failing to investigate and present medical evidence that contradicted the prosecution’s timeline. Both the federal district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed he was entitled to a new trial, but the Supreme Court ruled against him in Shinn v. Ramirez (2022). The decision, however, did not bar the Arizona Attorney General’s Office from independently reviewing the case and after doing so, the office agreed to a settlement agreement that had Mr. Jones pleading guilty to second-degree murder — for failing to take his girlfriend’s daughter to a hospital while she was in his care and already suffering from her fatal internal injury — in exchange for which he was released from prison for time served.\nUnprecedented Support for Prisoners with Innocence Claims from State Legislators, Prosecutors, and Other Elected Officials\nThe appeals of Areli Escobar, Richard Glossip, Phillip Hancock, Toforest Johnson, and Robert Roberson received unprecedented public support from former and current state officials.\nAreli Escobar’s successful appeal to the Supreme Court was the result of Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza’s admission that the conviction was based on “flawed and misleading forensic evidence.” In remanding the case for a new trial on January 9, 2023, the Court briefly explained its decision was made “in light of the confession of error by Texas.”\nLast year, a bipartisan group of 62 Oklahoma lawmakers, including 45 Republican legislators, publicly expressed concern about Richard Glossip’s case and asked then Attorney General John O’Connor to support a new evidentiary hearing. Mr. Glossip currently has two petitions pending at the Supreme Court. The first is on the denial of his innocence claim. His second petition is supported by Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who also argued in favor of clemency for Mr. Glossip. The reply he filed with the Court stated, “After careful consideration – including a thorough review by an independent counsel – the State came to the conclusion that …ensuring that justice is done in this case requires a retrial.” Both Mr. Glossip and Phillip Hancock, who has long claimed self-defense, received personal support from Republican state legislators Kevin McDugle and J.J. Humphrey, who say they strongly support the death penalty but believe executions should be paused in Oklahoma because of the system-wide failures and injustices in these cases. “[I]f we can’t fix it… then we need to get rid of it,” Rep. McDugle told the PBS Newshour. Mr. Glossip was denied clemency based on a 2 – 2 vote from the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board and has since filed suit against the Board. Mr. Hancock received a recommendation for clemency from the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board which, at the time of this writing, is pending in front of the Governor. Reps. McDugle and Humphrey testified in support of Mr. Glossip and Mr. Hancock at their respective clemency hearings.\nAmong many others, Toforest Johnson’s case has the support of his original trial prosecutor, the current Jefferson County district attorney Danny Carr, former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley, state bar presidents, three of the jurors in his case, and former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Drayton Nabers, all of whom support a new trial. “As a lifelong defender of the death penalty, I do not lightly say what follows: An innocent man is trapped on Alabama’s death row,” wrote Mr. Baxley in a March, 2021 Washington Post op-ed. Mr. Johnson’s petition for certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court on October 2, 2023.\nRobert Roberson’s petition to the Supreme Court was supported by five retired federal judges, including one from Texas, and groups of scientists, medical experts, forensic experts, and others who argued that the Shaken Baby Syndrome theory relied upon by prosecutors to convict Mr. Roberson has been soundly discredited. The Supreme Court denied his petition on the same day as Mr. Johnson.\nCredible Innocence Claims in Death Penalty Cases\nAreli Escobar, Richard Glossip, Toforest Johnson, Rodney Reed, and Robert Roberson, whose cases are described above, were among several death penalty cases with credible innocence claims that received significant media attention this year.\nOn January 13, the special counsel appointed by California Governor Gavin Newsom to conduct an investigation into Kevin Cooper’s innocence claim released its report, finding that the “evidence of Cooper’s guilt is extensive and conclusive,” while also noting that the fairness of the trial in relation to Mr. Cooper’s race was not assessed. In response, lawyers for Mr. Cooper criticized the investigation as improperly conducted and incomplete. “Most fundamentally, we are shocked that the governor seemingly failed to conduct a thorough review of the report that contains many misstatements and omissions and also ignores the purpose of a legitimate innocence investigation, which is to independently determine whether Mr. Cooper’s conviction was a product of prosecutorial misconduct.” Mr. Cooper was convicted in 1985 and has consistently maintained his innocence.\nIn Missouri, Leonard Taylor consistently maintained that he was not in St. Louis at the time of the crime that sent him to death row. Although Mr. Taylor’s attorneys discovered new evidence to substantiate his innocence claim, including support from a forensic pathologist, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell declined to avail himself of a Missouri law that allows prosecutors to reopen possible wrongful convictions, saying there were no facts “to support a credible claim of innocence” in the case. Mr. Taylor was executed on February 7.\nOn June 29, Missouri Governor Mike Parson lifted the stay of execution for Marcellus Williams, ending a six-year panel review of his innocence claims and maintaining the confidentiality of the panel’s recommendations. In 2017, former Governor Eric Greitens stayed Mr. Williams’ execution and asked five former judges as a board of inquiry to investigate new DNA testing results that were unavailable at the time of his trial. A DNA test authorized by the Missouri Supreme Court excluded Mr. Williams and matched an unknown person, and three separate DNA experts confirmed the findings. Gov. Parson explained his decision to end the inquiry in a statement, saying, “We could stall and delay for another six years, deferring justice, leaving a victim’s family in limbo, and solving nothing. This administration won’t do that.” No new execution date for Mr. Williams has been set, but in August he sued Gov. Parson for dissolving the board of inquiry before it completed its investigation of his innocence claim.\nCrosley Green, a former Florida death-sentenced prisoner whose conviction was overturned in 2018, was denied parole on June 21, 2023 by the Florida Commission on Offender Review. Mr. Green was released from prison in April 2021 following a federal court’s determination that the prosecution had withheld critical evidence from his defense at trial that pointed to another shooter. Mr. Green has maintained his innocence. After two years of release, he returned to prison earlier this year after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s decision and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his appeal in February. The Commission ruled that Mr. Green’s tentative parole release date will be in 2054, when he will be 97 years old.\nExecutive Clemency, the “Fail Safe” of the Death Penalty System, Largely Unavailable\nIn the last ten years, just 15 individual clemencies have been granted in death penalty cases.\nIn June, nearly every death-sentenced prisoner in Louisiana filed a request for clemency with the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole shortly after Governor John Bel Edwards announced his opposition to the death penalty. After the Board initially declined to consider the petitions without reviewing the merits of the claims, Governor Edwards used his executive authority to direct the Board to set hearings for the prisoners. Twenty clemency hearings were thereafter scheduled to begin in October.\nAttorney General (and Governor-elect) Jeff Landry and some state district attorneys quickly denounced the ‘rushed’ efforts of the Board to hear the clemency applications and sued to block any applications from moving forward. A last-minute legal settlement resulted in a reduction in the number of scheduled clemency hearings from 20 to just five. On October 13, the Board administratively screened the five petitions and denied full clemency hearings to the applicants; on November 8, another five petitions were denied full clemency hearings. On November 9, Chief U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick of the Middle District of Louisiana denied a request from the clemency applicants for a preliminary injunction, stating, “There is no constitutional right to a clemency hearing, nor is there a right to challenge the Board’s failure to follow its own procedures.” Governor Edwards will leave office on January 8, 2024 and cannot constitutionally commute any death sentence without the recommendation of the Board.\nAttorneys for Florida death-sentenced prisoners Darryl Barwick and Michael Zack separately petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether Florida’s clemency process offered adequate due process. Mr. Barwick’s attorneys wrote, “For 40 years, the chances of obtaining clemency or commutation of a death sentence in Florida is 0%. Not since 1983 has any death-sentenced individual in Florida been granted executive clemency.” The Court denied both petitions. Mr. Barwick was executed on May 4, and Mr. Zack was executed on October 3.\nOn November 8, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board narrowly recommended clemency to Phillip Hancock following an emotional clemency hearing. After failing to act for 22 days, Governor Stitt allowed the execution to go forward on November 30. Mr. Hancock was the last person executed in 2023.\nDevelopments in the States Top\nNew Executive Actions in Two States Pause Executions\nIn Arizona, newly elected Governor Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes acted almost immediately upon taking office to order an examination of the state’s execution procedures. On January 20, Governor Hobbs issued an executive order appointing a Death Penalty Independent Review Commissioner “to review and provide transparency into the [Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation & Reentry’s (ADCRR)] lethal injection drug and gas chamber chemical procurement process, execution protocols, and staffing considerations.” Attorney General Mayes filed a motion to withdraw the state’s only pending request for a death warrant. The governor’s executive order noted that “Arizona has a history of executions that have resulted in serious questions about ADCRR’s execution protocols and lack of transparency.” In 2022, the state performed three executions, all of which were visibly problematic. The order went on to say that “a comprehensive and independent review” was necessary “to ensure these problems are not repeated in future executions.” The actions by the governor and attorney general have halted executions in Arizona until the review is complete.\nGovernor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania announced on February 16 that he would continue his predecessor’s moratorium on executions. He called upon the legislature to repeal the death penalty, saying, “The Commonwealth shouldn’t be in the business of putting people to death. Period. I believe that in my heart. This is a fundamental statement of morality. Of what’s right and wrong. And I believe Pennsylvania must be on the right side of this issue.” Pennsylvania has executed only three people in the modern era of the death penalty, all of whom waived their appeals and “volunteered” for execution.\nStates Approve Alternative Execution Methods When Lethal Injection is Unavailable; Legal Challenges Continue\nIn response to continuing difficulties obtaining lethal injection drugs, South Carolina and Idaho passed legislation authorizing alternative methods of execution, and Alabama announced its plan to use an untested execution method.\nAfter the South Carolina Supreme Court ordered the state to disclose its efforts to obtain lethal injection drugs, the legislature passed a secrecy law and authorized a new lethal injection protocol. The new law, signed in May 2023, conceals from the public the identity of manufacturers and suppliers of execution drugs, as well as those on the team responsible for carrying out the execution. Republican state officials previously cast blame on the lack of ‘shield laws’ for the state’s inability to acquire drugs. State officials announced on September 19 that they had obtained a supply of pentobarbital and intended to use it in a one-drug protocol, rather than using the state’s previous three-drug protocol. Officials in the Department of Corrections admitted contacting more than 1,300 people in their efforts to obtain execution drugs. Litigation is ongoing in the state Supreme Court in a challenge to South Carolina’s 2021 statute making electrocution the default method of execution and authorizing firing squad as an alternative method. In 2022, a trial court found that both of those methods violated the state’s constitutional prohibition against “cruel, unusual, and corporal punishments.”\nAlabama released a heavily redacted protocol for using nitrogen gas in August. While Oklahoma and Mississippi also authorize execution by nitrogen suffocation, no state has ever used the method, and Alabama was the first to release a protocol. Alongside the release of the protocol, Alabama officials asked the Alabama Supreme Court to authorize an execution date for Kenneth Smith, who survived an earlier, botched attempt to execute him in 2022. Governor Kay Ivey has set Mr. Smith’s execution date for January 25, 2024. Mr. Smith’s attorneys have argued that he should not be used as a “test subject” for the new execution method.\nIdaho became the fifth state to authorize executions by firing squad. Under the law, which went into effect July 1, 2023, the director of the Idaho Department of Correction will have up to five days after a death warrant is issued to determine whether an execution by lethal injection is possible. If it is not, the execution will be performed by firing squad. Prior to the law’s passage, Idaho had twice delayed execution dates for Gerald Pizzuto, Jr. because lethal injection drugs couldn’t be obtained.\nU.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled in favor of Mr. Pizzuto, indefinitely pausing his March 2023 execution date, and granting him a hearing on his claim that Idaho violates his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment by repeatedly scheduling execution dates while knowing the state does not have the means to carry it out.\n“As Pizzuto describes it, defendants’ repeated rescheduling of his execution is like dry firing in a mock execution or a game of Russian roulette… With each new death warrant comes another spin of the revolver’s cylinder, restarting the 30-day countdown until the trigger pulls. Not knowing whether a round is chambered, Pizzuto must relive his last days in a delirium of uncertainty until the click sounds and the cylinder spins again.”\nMr. Pizzuto, who has been on death row since 1986, has faced five execution dates during his 37 years behind bars, three of which have been set during the past two years.\nFlorida Expands Death Penalty Eligibility and Revises Sentencing Requirement\nFlorida passed two new death penalty laws in April which are likely to expand the number of people sentenced to death in the state. First, the legislature removed the requirement that a jury must unanimously agree to impose a death sentence. Second, the legislature passed a law that allows the death penalty as punishment for sexual battery of a child under the age of 12 that does not result in the death of the victim. The sexual battery law is in direct conflict with U.S. Supreme Court precedent under Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), which struck down a similar law.\nWhile the Court has never held that a unanimous jury recommendation is required for a death sentence, nearly every death penalty state requires all 12 jurors to agree. Prior to the passage of Florida’s new law this year, only Alabama allowed a non-unanimous jury to impose a death sentence. Florida has now set the lowest threshold for the imposition of death, allowing a death sentence if at least eight jurors agree. In Alabama, the threshold is ten jurors. Opponents of the non-unanimity bill noted that Florida has the highest number of exonerations from death row in the nation, at 30. Most of those exonerated were sent to death row by non-unanimous jury votes.\nTennessee Unsuccessfully Attempts to Remove Power from Local District Attorneys\nThe Tennessee legislature passed a law intended to remove power from elected district attorneys and provide the unelected attorney general with greater control over death penalty cases. It appeared aimed at some newly elected district attorneys who had expressed concerns about the use of the death penalty and indicated they would be more reluctant to pursue new death sentences. A Shelby County judge struck it down just three months later, finding the law unconstitutional. An appeal of that decision is pending before the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.\nTexas Cannot Execute Scott Panetti\nOn September 28, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas ruled that the state cannot execute Scott Panetti, a death row prisoner with a decades-long history of serious mental illness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Despite a state expert conceding Mr. Panetti’s serious mental illness, Texas argued that he is competent to face execution because he has “some degree” of rational understanding. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ruled, however, that “[Mr.] Panetti is not sane enough to be executed” and that he “lack[s] a rational understanding of the connection between his actions and his death sentence.” The decision ends decades of litigation through Texas state and federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court. Judge Pittman explained his decision: “There are several reasons for prohibiting the execution of the insane, including the questionable retributive value of executing an individual so wracked by mental illness that he cannot comprehend the ‘meaning and purpose of the punishment,’ as well as society’s intuition that such an execution ‘simply offends humanity.’ Scott Panetti is one of these individuals.”\nState Legislative Action on Mental Illness and Repeal\nThree state legislatures (Arizona, Arkansas, and Texas) proposed bills to exempt people with severe mental illness from death penalty eligibility. The bills failed in Arizona and Arkansas. The Texas bill passed the House 97 – 48 on April 5, 2023. No action has been taken in the Senate, but Texas’ legislative session continues into 2024.\nFive years after the Washington Supreme Court struck down the state’s death penalty law, Governor Jay Inslee signed legislation to formally remove the unconstitutional law from the books. Gov. Inslee said the new legislation codified the concerns that were raised in the court’s decision about the application of the death penalty in Washington: “The [court] made clear, and we know this to be true, that the penalty has been applied unequally and in a racially insensitive manner.”\nThe Pennsylvania House Judiciary Committee voted 15 – 10 in favor of a death penalty repeal bill on October 31. With 14 Democrats and one Republican voting in favor, the committee passage is the first step toward abolishing the death penalty in Pennsylvania, which has not executed anyone since 1999 and has had a moratorium on executions since 2015.\nLegislators in twelve different states and U.S. Congress introduced bills to abolish the death penalty. In September 2023, a bipartisan group of Ohio state house representatives introduced a bill that would abolish the death penalty and replace it with life in prison without parole. The proposed legislation came just a few months after Ohio state senators introduced a similar bill.\nUnsuccessful legislative efforts to abolish the death penalty were also seen in Louisiana, following Governor John Bel Edwards’ first public announcement of his opposition to capital punishment. In March, Gov. Edwards expressed his opposition in a seminar at Loyola University in New Orleans: “The death penalty is so final. When you make a mistake, you can’t get it back. And we know that mistakes have been made in sentencing people to death.” He cited his deep religious faith and “pro-life” views as the reason for his opposition and said it was “fortuitous” that there is a shortage of the drugs required for lethal injection executions. Louisiana has carried out just one execution in the past twenty years.\nExecutions Top\nLong-Term Decline in Executions Continued, Despite Slight Increase in 2023\nAlthough the 24 people executed in 2023 represented an increase from last year’s number of 18, this year was the ninth consecutive year with fewer than 30 executions.\nAs in past years, most of the people executed in 2023 had significant vulnerabilities, and many likely would not have been sentenced to death if tried today. 79% of the people executed this year had at least one of the following impairments: serious mental illness; brain injury, developmental brain damage, or an IQ in the intellectually disabled range; and/or chronic serious childhood trauma, neglect, and/or abuse. 33% had all three. At least three (Darryl Barwick, Michael Tisius, and Casey McWhorter) were under the age of 20 at the time of their crimes.\nFlorida and Texas Conducted Almost 60% of the Year’s Total Number of Executions\nOnly five states executed people this year. Florida and Texas accounted for more than half (58%) of the year’s total number. Florida’s six executions in 2023 were the highest number since 2014. Before this year, Florida had not executed anyone since 2019. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is running for President, has scheduled eight executions since he took office in 2019, bringing the total number of executions in Florida since 1976 to 105. With eight executions, Texas maintained its status as the state that has conducted the most executions in 2023 — and overall since 1976.\nMost Execution Warrants Not Carried Out\nOnly 41% of the 58 death warrants issued in 2023 were carried out. Four executions were stayed for reasons including mental incompetency, intellectual disability, and credible innocence of the prisoners. Ten executions were halted by gubernatorial reprieve in Ohio, where executions have been on hold since 2019 over concerns about its lethal injection protocol. Three were halted in Pennsylvania, which has had a moratorium on executions since 2015. One was halted in Arizona after Governor Katie Hobbs announced an investigation into the state’s execution protocol. Two prisoners (Henry Skinner in Texas and Michael Webb in Ohio) died while their execution dates were pending. Five dates were stayed to allow time for additional court proceedings or clemency hearings.\nOklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond reacted to recent events in his state by requesting that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals slow the pace of executions. Prior to AG Drummond’s 2022 election, Oklahoma had set an unprecedented 25 execution dates over the course of two years. Attorney General Drummond, who generally supports the death penalty but has advocated in favor of death row prisoner Richard Glossip, wrote that the compressed execution schedule “is unduly burdening the Department of Corrections and its personnel” and called it “unsustainable in the long run.” In response to Attorney General Drummond’s request, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reset the state’s execution schedule to perform one execution approximately every two months, resulting in the rescheduling of nine execution dates that had been set for 2023.\nRace Continues to Matter\nOnce again, the majority of the crimes for which defendants were executed involved white victims (79%). Based on racial classifications from state departments of corrections, none of the 15 white defendants executed in 2023 were convicted of killing a person of color. Nine of the 24 prisoners executed were people of color. Four of the nine (44.4%) were people of color executed for killing white victims. In Texas, people of color were overrepresented among those executed in 2023. Five of the eight prisoners (62.5%) executed in Texas were people of color.\nExecuted Prisoners Spent Longer on Death Row\nThe length of time that prisoners spend on death row before being executed has steadily increased. Those executed in 2023 spent an average of nearly 23 years on death row, the longest average time in the modern era of the death penalty. More than half (54%) of the prisoners had been on death row for more than 20 years, in violation of international human rights norms. Six prisoners were on death row for more than 30 years before being executed this year.\nThe deleterious mental health effects of significant stays on death row are well-known. Researchers and experts have found that extended solitary confinement and the harsh conditions on death row cause mental illness in healthy prisoners and exacerbate it in those with existing conditions. Legal teams for two executed prisoners (Duane Owen and Johnny Johnson) raised claims that their clients were incompetent to be executed by reason of insanity. Both men had lengthy histories of mental illness worsened by their time on death row. Both presented the opinions of mental health experts who had thoroughly examined them and believed they met the criteria for incompetence: that they did not understand their impending execution or the reason for it. In both cases, courts denied the claims, giving greater weight to the opinions of state experts who had engaged in much more cursory examinations of the men. Similarly, James Barnes was allowed to waive his appeals and “volunteer” for execution without ever being examined by a mental health expert.\nMost Executed Prisoners Would Likely Not Be Sentenced to Death Today\nThe significant changes that have occurred during the decades that most death-sentenced prisoners have spent in prison almost certainly mean that many of them would not be sentenced to death if they were prosecuted today. Changes in the law, such as the alternative sentence of life without parole, the elimination of non-unanimous death sentences in most states, the exclusion of people with intellectual disability from death penalty eligibility, and changes in the common and scientific understanding of mental illness and trauma and their lasting effects mean that arguments in favor of an alternative sentence are much stronger today than they were in previous years. Theories such as “Shaken Baby Syndrome” have been resoundingly debunked, meaning that some people were convicted of causing deaths that are no longer considered crimes.\nThe number of death sentences imposed each year has steadily decreased over the last two decades, a strong indication that juries’ attitudes about the effectiveness, accuracy, and morality of the death penalty have changed. Prosecutors, too, are more cognizant of the allocation of resources required for capital cases and less likely to seek a death sentence. Finally, improvements in the quality and availability of defense representation have been proven to significantly alter the outcomes of capital trials, especially in sentencing.\nAppellate attorneys for two people executed this year (Wesley Ruiz and Michael Tisius) obtained signed affidavits from jurors stating that they would change their votes or support a different sentence now based on the mitigating evidence that new counsel presented on appeal. Mr. Tisius’ clemency petition included statements from four jurors and two alternates who supported a reduced sentence. One juror told the New York Times, “I feel angry and remorseful. I feel that I wronged Michael. … I hated having a part in somebody dying.”\nThose two cases illustrate some of the critical improvements that have occurred in the quality of defense representation. The defense bar invested significant time training lawyers to follow detailed guidance found in the ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (2003). Juries today are more likely to be presented with a comprehensive biopsychosocial history of the defendant and a more compelling argument for an alternative sentence. By contrast, Mr. Ruiz and Mr. Tisius were just two of at least seven defendants executed this year whose juries did not hear significant mitigating evidence of mental illness, childhood trauma, or both. While mental illness was once presented as aggravating evidence – as was true for Robert Fratta, whom prosecutors falsely claimed had Antisocial Personality Disorder to convince the jury that he presented an ongoing danger to society – evidence of mental illness is properly presented today as part of the defense’s “case for life” to demonstrate a defendant’s diminished culpability.\nChanges in sentencing procedures could have affected the outcomes of several people executed this year. Seven prisoners (John Balentine, Donald Dillbeck, Arthur Brown, Duane Owen, Jedidiah Murphy, Brent Brewer, and David Renteria) were sentenced to death before their states offered the alternative sentence of life without parole. Seven prisoners (Amber McLaughlin, Donald Dillbeck, Louis Gaskin, Duane Owen, James Barber, Michael Zack, and Casey McWhorter) were sentenced to death after non-unanimous jury sentencing recommendations. Only Florida and Alabama currently allow death sentences to be imposed without the agreement of all 12 jurors, making non-unanimity an outlier practice among death penalty states.\nExecuted in 2023\n| Name | Execution Date | State | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Phillip Hancock | 11/30/2023 | OK | Mr. Hancock sought DNA testing to support his claim that he killed Robert Jett and James Lynch in self-defense. He received support from two Republican legislators, and the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommended clemency by a 3 – 2 vote. |\n| David Renteria | 11/16/2023 | TX | Mr. Renteria maintained that he was coerced by gang members into abducting five-year-old Alexandra Flores, and that he did not kill the girl. His attorneys unsuccessfully sought access to evidence they said would have shown he was not responsible for the child’s death. |\n| Casey McWhorter | 11/16/2023 | AL | Mr. McWhorter was just three months past his 18th birthday at the time of his crime. His jury recommended a death sentence by a vote of 10 – 2. |\n| Brent Brewer | 11/9/2023 | TX | Mr. Brewer’s death sentence relied on unreliable “future dangerousness” junk science testimony from a psychiatrist who never even met Mr. Brewer. |\n| Jedidiah Murphy | 10/10/2023 | TX | Mr. Murphy had a long history of mental illness and killed 79-year-old Bertie Lee Cunningham during a dissociative episode. His appellate attorneys argued that, if his history of trauma and mental illness were presented to a jury today, he would not be sentenced to death. |\n| Michael Zack | 10/3/2023 | FL | Attorneys for Mr. Zack argued that he was intellectually disabled due to his diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder, making his execution unconstitutional under Atkins v. Virginia (2002). |\n| Anthony Sanchez | 9/21/2023 | OK | Mr. Sanchez maintained his innocence in the murder of Juli Busken. His request to reexamine the DNA evidence in his case was denied. |\n| James Barnes | 8/3/2023 | FL | At his trial, Mr. Barnes waived his right to counsel and to a jury, represented himself, pled guilty, and waived all mitigation evidence at sentencing. After his execution was scheduled, he discharged his lawyers and waived his appeals. A judge found Mr. Barnes competent for execution; however, a medical professional did not complete a mental evaluation of Mr. Barnes, who had a lengthy history of mental illness. |\n| Johnny Johnson | 8/1/2023 | MO | Attorneys for Mr. Johnson asserted that his longstanding, severe mental illness and diagnosed schizophrenia prevented him from understanding the connection between his imminent execution and the crime he committed, rendering him incompetent for execution. |\n| James Barber | 7/21/2023 | AL | Mr. Barber was sentenced to death for the 2001 murder of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps via a non-unanimous jury verdict. Sarah Gregory, the granddaughter of Dorothy Epps, had forgiven Mr. Barber and was against the execution. |\n| Jemaine Cannon | 7/20/2023 | OK | At Mr. Cannon’s trial, his defense team presented testimony from neuropsychologist Dr. Herman Jones, who falsely characterized the severe abuse and trauma Mr. Cannon had endured in childhood as making him more dangerous. |\n| Duane Owen | 6/15/2023 | FL | Mr. Owen’s attorneys presented evidence that he was incompetent to be executed. They argued it was error for the Florida courts to find that “the psychiatrists that only briefly examined Owen were more credible than the neuropsychologist who spent over 13 hours with Owen conducting interviews and testing.” |\n| Michael Tisius | 6/6/2023 | MO | Four jurors and two alternates from Mr. Tisius’ trial said they would have voted for life, or would now support a reduced sentence, after they heard mitigating evidence that was not presented at his trial. |\n| Darryl Barwick | 5/3/2023 | FL | Mr. Barwick was just 19 years old at the time of his crime. He was mentally ill, and had brain damage from the trauma he experienced, including his mother’s attempt to abort him by throwing herself down the stairs while pregnant. |\n| Louis Gaskin | 4/12/2023 | FL | Mr. Gaskin was tried by an all-white jury who voted 8 – 4 to sentence him to death, a verdict that would result in a life sentence in every state except Florida. His jury never heard evidence of his schizophrenia, brain damage, or trauma. |\n| Arthur Brown | 3/9/2023 | TX | Mr. Brown maintained his innocence and may have been ineligible for the death penalty due to his intellectual disability. He had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder and as a child was placed in special education due to his low IQ scores. |\n| Gary Green | 3/7/2023 | TX | Mr. Green’s attorneys presented evidence that he was intellectually disabled and had schizoaffective disorder. Experts testified that the paranoia associated with his mental illness likely contributed to his crime. |\n| Donald Dillbeck | 2/23/2023 | FL | Testing of Mr. Dillbeck indicated “widespread and profound neurological damage throughout Mr. Dillbeck’s brain, with particular abnormality in the portions of the brain most responsible for regulating planning, mood, judgment, behavior, impulse control and intentionality.” |\n| John Balentine | 2/8/2023 | TX | Mr. Balentine was tried by all-white jury in Texas. Mr. Balentine’s jury foreperson used racist epithets and told fellow jurors that a death sentence was “biblically justified.” Mr. Balentine’s own defense team passed handwritten notes calling his death sentence a “justifiable lynching.” |\n| Leonard Taylor | 2/7/2023 | MO | New evidence uncovered shortly before Mr. Taylor’s execution supported his claim of innocence, confirming his claim that he was not in St. Louis at the time of the murders. Mr. Taylor claimed the medical examiner was pressured to change the time of death at the prosecutor’s request. |\n| Wesley Ruiz | 2/1/2023 | TX | Mr. Ruiz’s legal team held racist beliefs that affected their ability to represent him. Multiple jurors said they would support a reduced sentence based on mitigating evidence that was not presented at his trial. |\n| Scott Eizember | 1/12/2023 | OK | Mr. Eizember’s clemency petition described the significant trauma he experienced during his youth and explained that he had been a model prisoner throughout his time on death row. |\n| Robert Fratta | 1/10/2023 | TX | Mr. Fratta’s trials were tainted by prosecutorial misconduct, which resulted in the reversal of his first conviction. At his second trial, prosecutors presented unreliable and misleading evidence, including a false claim that Mr. Fratta had Antisocial Personality Disorder, making him more likely to be dangerous. |\n| Amber McLaughlin | 1/3/2023 | MO | Ms. McLaughlin was the first openly transgender prisoner executed in the United States. Ms. McLaughlin was sentenced to death by a Missouri judge after her jury could not come to a unanimous sentencing decision. |\nNew Death Sentences Top\nNew Death Sentences from Seven States and the Federal Government\nThe number of people on death rows across the United States has continued to decline from a peak population in the year 2000. As of January 1, 2023, there were 2,331 people on death row.\nAs of December 1, twenty-one people had been sentenced to death in 2023. Florida imposed the most death sentences in the U.S. in 2023, with five. California imposed four. Alabama and Texas imposed three each. Arizona and North Carolina imposed two each. Louisiana imposed a single new death sentence. The federal government also secured its first new death sentence since 2019.\nFor the first time since executions resumed in 1977, the number of executions exceeded the number of new death sentences. This is further evidence of juries’ growing reluctance to impose death sentences, and a reflection of the fact that today’s executions are an indicator only of past support for the death penalty.\nNine of the defendants sentenced to death (42.9%) were people of color. Five Latino defendants and four Black defendants were sentenced to death.\nSupreme Court Top\nAt the United States Supreme Court, 2023 saw the continued ceding of ground to state death penalty laws and procedures. Last year, the Court rolled back its own precedent in Shinn v. Ramirez, holding that defendants with ineffective trial and appellate counsel had no right to an evidentiary hearing in federal court — in other words, defendants were limited to the evidence developed by the very lawyers they were challenging as ineffective. The decision, as Justice Sotomayor noted in her dissenting opinion, “overrule[d] two recent precedents” and “will leave many people who were convicted in violation of the Sixth Amendment to face incarceration or even execution without any meaningful chance to vindicate their right to counsel.” The majority opinion held that federal review must be limited so as not to encroach on states’ rights and complained that federal habeas review “overrides the State’s sovereign power to enforce societal norms through criminal law.” This year the Court enforced that point by overwhelmingly rejecting the petitions of state death-sentenced prisoners and declining to review cases that presented major constitutional concerns.\nStays of Execution Remain Rare\nThe data show death-sentenced petitioners continue to be largely unsuccessful when seeking stays of execution at the Supreme Court. In the 2022 – 23 term, the Court granted just one of 26 stays of execution sought, and has granted none of the eight stays sought during the first half of the 2023 – 24 term. A recent analysis by Bloomberg Law identified 270 emergency stay requests filed since 2013 and found that the Court agreed to stay an execution just 11 times in ten years (4%). Several of these stays concerned execution protocols, not challenges to the execution itself. Justice Neil Gorsuch issued clear instructions to the federal courts in Bucklew v. Precythe (2019), writing that “[c]ourts should police carefully against attempts to use such challenges as tools to interpose unjustified delay…[l]ast-minute stays should be the extreme exception, not the norm.” On the other hand, the Court has not hesitated to lift a lower court’s stay in order to allow an execution to proceed. Bloomberg found that the Court had granted 18 of 21 emergency requests by states to vacate stays of execution in the same ten-year period (86%).\nIn July, the Court denied James Barber’s request for a stay to obtain more information about Alabama’s botched executions last year, described by DPIC as “the year of the botched execution.” Mr. Barber challenged the method in light of the “ever-escalating levels of pain and torture” reported by Kenneth Smith and Alan Miller during the state’s aborted attempts to execute them in 2022. Justice Sotomayor wrote in dissent that the denial in Mr. Barber’s case was “another troubling example of this Court stymying the development of Eighth Amendment law by pushing forward executions without complete information…the Eighth Amendment does not tolerate playing such games with a man’s life.”\nSince the release of the Bloomberg report, the Court granted Texas’ request to lift a lower court stay for Jedidiah Murphy, issuing the decision on its “shadow docket” with no accompanying opinion explaining its reasoning. Justices Sotomayor, Jackson, and Kagan dissented. Mr. Murphy’s execution had been stayed based on his argument that DNA testing could have exonerated him of crimes that formed the basis for the jury’s finding of “future dangerousness,” a requirement for death sentences in Texas. This decision was the tenth stay lifted since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death in 2020 — indicating the Court’s growing intolerance of stays. Indeed, the Texas Attorney General’s Office echoed Justice Gorsuch by arguing that Mr. Murphy had waited “until the eleventh hour” to raise a “manipulative” request for DNA testing. Texas executed Mr. Murphy on October 10, the 21st World Day Against the Death Penalty.\nNew Decisions on Procedure, with Rare Group Relief in Arizona\nThe cases the Court did decide hinged largely on procedure. In Reed v. Goertz, the Court ruled 6 – 3 that Texas prisoner Rodney Reed’s request for DNA testing could proceed because his civil rights claim had been timely filed. Though Mr. Reed’s innocence case has received substantial media attention, the Court ruled only on the interpretation of a statute regarding the timing of the two-year limit on federal claims, holding that the clock begins to run “at the end of the state-court litigation.” Mr. Reed, who is Black, was sentenced to death by an all-white Texas jury for the rape and murder of a white woman in 1998. Mr. Reed’s request to test the murder weapon and additional evidence, with the hope of identifying the true perpetrator, now proceeds in state court.\nIn Escobar v. Texas, the Court issued a two-sentence summary opinion reversing and remanding the case in light of the State’s confession of error. Areli Escobar was convicted in 2011 of the rape and murder of a teenage girl in his apartment complex based almost entirely on the Austin Police Department crime lab’s forensic testing. However, the State permanently closed the lab in 2016 after an investigation by the Texas Forensic Science Commission identified serious concerns about the accuracy of its DNA testing. The district attorney’s office supported a new trial, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief. In its Supreme Court brief, the State wrote in support of Mr. Escobar that based on a “comprehensive reexamination” of the record, it was clear that prosecutors “had offered flawed and misleading forensic evidence at [his] trial and this evidence was material to the outcome of his case in violation of clearly established federal due process law.”\nIn Cruz v. Arizona, the Court held that its earlier ruling in Simmons v. South Carolina (1994) applied retroactively. The case was the Court’s second intervention to prevent Arizona from circumventing settled law. The Court previously held in Simmons that a defendant has the right to inform the jury at sentencing that a life sentence means life without parole. However, Arizona consistently denied defendants that right, disingenuously arguing to juries that life-sentenced prisoners might receive clemency. The Court rejected that argument in Lynch v. Arizona (2016), but the State later denied John Montenegro Cruz the right to renew his appeal on those grounds. The Court ruled 5 – 4 in favor of Mr. Cruz, holding that Arizona had created a “catch-22” for defendants. This decision resulted in rare group relief: two subsequent cases, Burns v. Arizona and Ovante v. Arizona, granted summary relief to seven additional defendants affected by the decision in Cruz. Experts estimate that up to thirty Arizona death-sentenced prisoners may be eligible for relief, which will likely result in new sentencing trials.\nPrecedent Observed in Dissents, Not Majority Opinions\nThis year, the justices issued more dissents to denials of certiorari in death penalty cases than they did to opinions on the merits — and these dissents uniformly addressed the Court’s failure to uphold its own earlier decisions regarding the constitutional rights of criminal defendants. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (in her first full year on the bench) stood united in their criticism of the Court’s “rush[…] to finality” in capital cases and cautioned that the Court’s decisions and indifference may embolden states to disregard established Supreme Court precedent in the future.\nIn Brown v. Louisiana, the evidence showed that the prosecution withheld a confession by David Brown’s co-defendant that never mentioned Mr. Brown at all, a clear violation of Brady v. Maryland (1963). However, the Louisiana Supreme Court found no Brady violation, reasoning that the confession was not exculpatory because it did not point to an alternative killer and did not explicitly state that Mr. Brown was not involved. After the U.S. Supreme Court declined review, Justice Jackson, joined by Justices Kagan and Sotomayor, wrote in dissent that the Court had “repeatedly reversed lower courts — and Louisiana courts, in particular — for similar refusals to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment’s mandate that favorable and material evidence in the government’s possession be disclosed to the defense before trial.” Justice Jackson argued that the “requirement that the withheld evidence must speak to or rule out the defendant’s participation in order for it to be favorable is wholly foreign to our case law.” Finally, she cautioned that the rejection of Mr. Brown’s petition “should in no way be construed as an endorsement of the lower court’s legal reasoning.”\nIn Clark v. Mississippi, the evidence established that prosecutors violated the defendant’s constitutional rights by illegally striking potential jurors of color. Just four years earlier, the Court had decided Flowers v. Mississippi (2019), reversing the conviction and death sentence in a case where the same prosecutor had struck 41 of 42 Black jurors across six trials. The Court ruled in Flowers that the prosecutor’s conduct violated Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Court’s landmark decision forbidding racial discrimination in jury selection. Like Curtis Flowers, Tony Clark’s trial featured stark racial disparities: 34.5% of the jury pool was Black, but the seated jury had just one Black juror (7%) and eleven white jurors. In total, the State struck 87.5% of Black and just 16.7% of white potential jurors. On appeal, the State presented printouts of criminal records for everyone in the area with the same last name as Black prospective jurors to imply that those jurors had lied to the trial court about having no family members with felony convictions, but never asked about the records during voir dire to verify that they were even related. Justice Sotomayor forcefully dissented from the majority’s decision not to review the case, joined by Justices Jackson and Kagan:\nApparently Flowers was not clear enough for the Mississippi Supreme Court, however. In yet another death penalty case involving a Black defendant, that court failed to address not just one but three of the factors Flowers expressly identified. This was a direct repudiation of this Court’s decision. This can only be read as a signal from the Mississippi Supreme Court that it intends to carry on with business as usual, no matter what this Court said in Flowers. By allowing the same court to make the same mistakes applying the same standard, this Court acquiesces in the Mississippi Supreme Court’s noncompliance. Today, this Court tells the Mississippi Supreme Court that it has called our bluff, and that this Court is unwilling to do what is necessary to defend its own precedent. The result is that Flowers will be toothless in the very State where it appears to be still so needed.\nIn Johnson v. Vandergriff, the defense asked the Court to order a hearing on Johnny Johnson’s competence to be executed based on a psychiatrist’s finding that he did not have a “rational understanding of the link between his crime and his punishment.” Mr. Johnson, who suffered from schizophrenia and had decades of documented severe mental illness, said that Satan told him that his execution was part of Satan’s plan to destroy the world. Mr. Johnson insisted that “he is a vampire and able to ‘reanimate’ his organs,” and that he could “enter an animal’s mind…to go on living after his execution.” Although Mr. Johnson appeared to be a textbook case of incompetence for execution under Ford v. Wainwright (1986), a majority of the Court rejected his application and the execution proceeded. “The Court today paves the way to execute a man with documented mental illness before any court meaningfully investigates his competency to be executed,” Justice Sotomayor wrote in dissent. “There is no moral victory in executing someone who believes Satan is killing him to bring about the end of the world… Instead, this Court rushes to finality, bypassing fundamental procedural and substantive protections.”\nThe dissenting justices questioned why the Court did not resolve the cases through summary disposition, also referred to as “Grant-Vacate-Remand” or GVR, as it had in Escobar, when doing so would have been simple and straightforward. Justice Sotomayor had previously observed in a 2022 dissent from denial of certiorari that the Court “appears to be quietly constricting its GVR practice” in criminal cases even when the ruling held “great stakes for the individual petitioner.” In Clark, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the starkness of the misconduct should have made it an “easy case” to resolve — the Court could have just vacated the judgment and directed the Mississippi Supreme Court to conduct a proper analysis — but that “appears to be too much for this Court today.” Likewise, in Brown and Johnson, Justices Jackson and Sotomayor wrote that they would have summarily reversed. In Burns v. Mays, also denied review, the defense lawyer failed to impeach a surviving witness who gave contradictory testimony at each co-defendant’s trial; Mr. Burns’ petition argued that the lawyer’s conduct was ineffective under Strickland v. Washington (1984). Justice Sotomayor dissented that the “Court’s failure to act is disheartening because this case reflects the kind of situation where the Court has previously found summary action appropriate,” and the “need for action is great because Burns faces the ultimate and irrevocable penalty of death.” As a result, as Justice Sotomayor put it in Clark, when the “Court is unwilling to take even that modest step to preserve the force of its own recent precedent…courts throughout the State will take note and know that this Court does not always mean what it says.”\nReview Denied for High-Profile Innocence Cases\nThe Court also turned away several high-profile innocence cases this year. As former Justice Antonin Scalia stated in Herrera v. Collins (1993), the Court “has never held that the Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a habeas court that he is ‘actually’ innocent.” The decisions of the Court this year indicate a reluctance to assume a role as the court of last resort for the wrongfully convicted.\nIn Toforest Johnson’s case, Alabama prosecutors flatly denied for seventeen years that they had compensated their star witness until a former employee of the prosecutor’s office told the defense team about a set of “confidential reward files” that were never disclosed. This revelation prompted the State to finally admit it had paid $5,000 to the witness, claiming that the check to her had been “misfiled.” The witness, Violet Ellison, had approached police after the posting of a public reward offer for the same amount, and testified at trial that she overheard a three-way jail phone call in which a man referred to himself as “Toforest” and confessed to the crime. Mr. Johnson’s conviction largely rested on Ms. Ellison’s “earwitness” testimony even though she had never met Mr. Johnson and over ten eyewitnesses placed him across town at a nightclub at the time of the crime. The current district attorney, the original trial prosecutor, and three of the original jurors all support a new trial for Mr. Johnson. Nevertheless, the Court rejected his petition on appeal from denials of relief in Alabama courts.\nIn Robert Roberson’s case, a robust record of scientific and medical evidence presented in state court demonstrated that no murder occurred at all. Mr. Roberson was convicted of killing his daughter, Nikki, based on the now-discredited scientific theory of “Shaken Baby Syndrome.” Experts say that pneumonia and an accidental fall caused Nikki’s death, not Mr. Roberson. At least 32 caregivers convicted based on Shaken Baby Syndrome in the past have been exonerated, and even its creator Dr. Norman Guthkelch has disavowed the condition. Dr. Guthkelch called for a review of the cases in 2012, writing that he was “quite disturbed” that what he “intended as a friendly suggestion for avoiding injury to children has become an excuse for imprisoning innocent people.” When Texas courts denied Mr. Roberson relief, a group of physicians, scientists, and federal judges supported his request for the Supreme Court to review his case. But as in Mr. Johnson’s case, the Court denied review.\nThe Court’s denial of review in innocence cases paralleled its procedural decision in Jones v. Hendrix, where it held that federal prisoners who are actually innocent are not entitled to an opportunity to petition the court for release. The petitioner, Marcus DeAngelo Jones, was incarcerated based on conduct that the Court later found did not constitute a crime. However, when he tried to argue this claim on appeal, he was barred under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act’s (AEDPA) strict rules limiting successive petitions. The Court held that Mr. Jones had no “end-run” around AEDPA even though he was by definition innocent of the charges. In dissent, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan criticized the “disturbing results” of the decision: a “prisoner who is actually innocent, imprisoned for conduct that Congress did not criminalize, is forever barred…from raising that claim, merely because he previously sought postconviction relief. […] By challenging his conviction once before, he forfeited his freedom.” Though Jones was not a death penalty case, its holding further narrows options for death-sentenced prisoners with innocence claims. In a separate dissent, Justice Jackson expressed that she was “deeply troubled by the constitutional implications of the nothing-to-see-here approach that the majority takes with respect to the incarceration of potential legal innocents.”\nThe Court has yet to announce whether it will review the widely-reported innocence case of Richard Glossip, who received the Court’s only stay of execution this year pending the outcome of his petition for certiorari. Mr. Glossip is in the rare position of having the State’s support for his claim of prosecutorial misconduct — but was forced to petition the Supreme Court for relief when the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals denied a joint request for a new trial. Evidence shows that prosecutors pressured Mr. Glossip’s co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Mr. Glossip and lie on the stand regarding the murder of motel owner Barry Van Treese, who had employed both men. The State did not dispute that Mr. Sneed bludgeoned Mr. Van Treese to death while high on methamphetamines, but argued that Mr. Glossip had ordered the killing. Mr. Glossip has received nine execution dates and eaten his “last meal” three times. A bipartisan group of 62 Oklahoma legislators supports relief for Mr. Glossip. “There has never been an execution in the history of this country where the state and the defense agreed that the defendant was not afforded a fair trial,” said Representative Kevin McDugle, a Republican. “Oklahoma cannot become the first.”\nSome Death Penalty States Urge the Court to Adopt a New Eighth Amendment Standard\nFirst used in Trop v. Dulles (1958), the Court’s practice has been to look to state legislatures, jury verdicts, and other objective criteria to evaluate whether a punishment is cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, drawing its meaning from “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” The Court applied this test to reach landmark rulings in Ford v. Wainwright (1986) (holding the execution of people with insanity unconstitutional), Roper v. Simmons (2005) (holding the execution of juveniles unconstitutional), Atkins v. Virginia (2002) (holding the execution of people with intellectual disability unconstitutional), and Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008) (holding the execution of people who commit non-homicide crimes unconstitutional).\nSome justices on the Court have questioned the doctrine over the years, advocating for an “originalist” interpretation of the Eighth Amendment that rejects only punishments that were considered “cruel and unusual” when the Constitution was drafted. Former Justice Scalia believed that the Eighth Amendment “is addressed to always-and-everywhere ‘cruel’ punishments, such as the rack and the thumbscrew,” but “is not a ratchet, whereby a temporary consensus on leniency for a particular crime fixes a permanent constitutional maximum.” Justice Thomas has echoed these arguments, writing that “the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality of a particular type of punishment to turn on a snapshot of American public opinion taken at the moment a case is decided.” Justice Gorsuch, who joined the Court in 2017, endorsed the originalist approach in Bucklew, writing that capital punishment is lawful because it was “the standard penalty for all serious crimes” at the time of the founding and appears in the Constitution. He did not mention the “evolving standards of decency” test once in his opinion. Justice Gorsuch’s majority opinion garnered the votes of four other conservatives still on the Court, but no other current member of the Court except Justice Thomas has directly criticized the test.\nThis year in Hamm v. Smith, Alabama appealed to the Supreme Court after lower courts vacated Joseph Clifton Smith’s death sentence, having found that Mr. Smith had an intellectual disability that rendered him ineligible for execution under Atkins. Alabama argued in its petition that Atkins’ “dubious methodology subjects States not to the fixed and objective strictures of the Constitution’s original meaning but to the ‘judgment’ of other States.” Attorneys General of thirteen death penalty states, including Texas and Florida, filed an amicus brief in support of Alabama in which they advocated for a new “originalist” test. They argued that the “evolving standards of decency” test is a “lawless standard” that “cannot be squared with the text, structure, and history of the Eighth Amendment,” and “States will continue to be on the receiving end of federal overreach” until the Court imposes a new standard. The Court has not yet announced whether it will grant certiorari in Mr. Smith’s case.\nDevelopments in Federal Government Top\nLawsuit Alleges Federal Death Row Conditions Violate U.S. Constitution and Human Rights Treaty Obligations\nIn January 2023, Jurijus Kadamovas, a Russian national on U.S. federal death row, filed a civil rights lawsuit alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement. The complaint, filed on behalf of Mr. Kadamovas and seeking class certification for 37 other individuals incarcerated in the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, alleges that the “severely isolating” and “unrelenting solitary confinement” on death row falls below the standards outlined by international human rights instruments regarding the treatment of prisoners, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. The suit, which was filed by the ACLU of Indiana and national law firm Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, argues that this treatment is also a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. As of December 2023, Mr. Kadamovas’ lawsuit is pending in federal court.\nFederal Government Seeks Death Sentences\nTrial of Sayfullo Saipov Ends in Life Sentence\nIn January 2023, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Sayfullo Saipov guilty of intentionally killing eight people in New York City by driving a truck on a bike path in 2017. In March 2023, the same jury concluded its sentencing-phase deliberations without coming to a unanimous decision. Under federal law, if the jury in the penalty phase of the trial cannot come to a unanimous decision, the defendant cannot be sentenced to death. Mr. Saipov was sentenced to eight consecutive life sentences, two concurrent life sentences, and a consecutive sentence of 260 years in prison for carrying out an act of terrorism. At trial, neither Mr. Saipov nor his attorneys contested his involvement in the crime, but argued that a death sentence would not bring more justice: “It is not necessary to kill Sayfullo Saipov,” said attorney David Patton. “It is not necessary to keep us or anyone else safe. It is not necessary to do justice. So we are asking you to choose hope over fear, justice over vengeance and, in the end, life over death.”\nTrial of Robert Bowers Ends in Death Sentence\nIn May 2023, Robert Bowers went to trial five years after his attack on the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Tree of Life Synagogue that resulted in 11 deaths and many more injuries. Mr. Bowers had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, but the federal government rejected Mr. Bowers’ offer. Twelve death-qualified jurors and six alternates were selected to hear federal charges that included hate-based crimes. During voir dire, prosecutors struck all Black, Latinx, and Jewish potential jurors. Victims’ family members did not agree about whether a death sentence should be sought. A 2021 letter from seven of the nine families who lost a relative expressed support for the death penalty, while the other families expressed their concerns with the incompatibility of Judaism and capital punishment. In July 2023, the jury found Mr. Bowers guilty of all 63 federal charges related to the synagogue shooting. Following an eligibility determination phase and two hours of deliberation, the jury determined that prosecutors had met their burden by proving that Mr. Bowers had the “necessary intent” to commit a crime with specific aggravating factors that made him eligible for the death penalty. Attorneys for Mr. Bowers told jurors about his history of mental illness and brain impairment from childhood, including several suicide attempts and commitments to psychiatric facilities before the age of 13, and argued that he was too delusional to be eligible for the death penalty.\nOn August 1, 2023, the jury unanimously recommended a sentence of death for Mr. Bowers. This is the first new federal death sentence since 2019 and the first secured during the Biden Administration. Mr. Bowers may face a state trial and potential state death sentences if the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania District Attorney’s office decides to prosecute him. There is currently a governor-imposed moratorium on executions in Pennsylvania.\nDepartment of Justice Continues Pause on Federal Executions But Defends Existing Death Sentences\nSince Attorney General Garland took office, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has withdrawn notices of intent to seek the death penalty for 32 defendants that were initially filed during President Trump’s administration. Capital charges against Mr. Saipov and Mr. Bowers were both authorized under Attorney General Barr and prosecuted this year by Attorney General Garland. In March 2023, the U.S. Attorney for the District of North Dakota, at the direction of AG Garland, withdrew the notice of intent to seek another death sentence for Alfonso Rodriguez, Jr., who had been convicted and sentenced to death in 2007 for the 2003 kidnapping and murder of college student Dru Sjodin. In September 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Ralph Erickson overturned Mr. Rodriguez’s death sentence because of false testimony presented at trial, in addition to defense counsel’s failure to introduce evidence of their client’s post-traumatic stress disorder, which may have prevented him from entering an insanity defense.\nNo new notices of intent to seek a federal death sentence have been authorized by AG Garland. In February 2023, the DOJ decided against seeking a death sentence for Patrick Crusius, who pled guilty to nearly 50 federal hate crime charges in the racially motivated killing of 23 Latinx people and injuring of 22 others in an El Paso, Texas Walmart in August 2019. Mr. Crusius intended on pleading not guilty to the charges against him before federal prosecutors decided against seeking the death penalty. Attorneys for the Department of Justice agreed with Mr. Crusius’ defense counsel that Mr. Crusius has schizoaffective disorder. The mental health of a defendant is one factor that must be considered by federal prosecutors when deciding whether to seek a death sentence. Pursuant to Mr. Crusius’ plea agreement, he received 90 consecutive life sentences for the 90 charges against him. In July 2023, El Paso District Attorney Bill Hicks announced that he intends to seek a state death sentence for Mr. Crusius, who remains in local custody. In 2023, the Department of Justice agreed to the resentencing to life without parole for Jeffrey Paul, a severely mentally ill prisoner who was federally sentenced to death for his involvement in the robbery and murder of a retired national park employee in 1995.\nThe Department of Justice is still considering whether to seek a death sentence for Payton Gendron, who is accused of the racially motivated killing of 10 Black people and injury of many others at the Tops Friendly Supermarket in Buffalo, New York in May 2022. In November 2022, Mr. Gendron pled guilty to 15 state charges, including ten counts of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder as a hate crime, one count of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, and one count of domestic terrorism in the first degree. In February 2023, Mr. Gendron was sentenced to the most severe punishment in New York state: life in prison without parole. New York abolished the death penalty in 2007.\nFederal Legislation Introduced to End Federal Death Penalty\nIn July 2023, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin reintroduced the Federal Death Penalty Prohibition Act of 2023. The bicameral legislation would prohibit the use of the death penalty at the federal level and would require the commutation of all death sentences for prisoners currently on federal death row. Rep. Pressley and Sen. Durbin previously introduced legislation in 2019, following then-Attorney General Bill Barr’s announcement regarding the resumption of federal executions, and in 2021, following the execution spree under President Trump’s administration. Both Rep. Pressley and Sen. Durbin have also written to the Department of Justice and urged AG Merrick Garland to keep the pause on federal executions in place.\nU.S.S. Cole and 9/11 Military Commissions Capital Proceedings Stall\nOn September 6, 2023, President Biden rejected proposed conditions for a plea agreement with five Guantanamo Bay prisoners accused of aiding in the preparation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that would have removed the death penalty as a possible sentence. According to the New York Times, the defendants’ plea request included the condition that they avoid solitary confinement and receive mental health treatment to mitigate the effects of the torture they endured at the hands of American agents. President Biden rejected this deal, as a spokesperson for the National Security Council told the press that “the President does not believe that accepting the joint policy principles as a basis for a pre-trial agreement would be appropriate in these circumstances.” The U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of the Convening Authority for the Office of Military Commissions will make the final decision regarding settlement.\nOn September 21, 2023, Judge Matthew McCall ruled that Ramzi bin al-Shibh, one of the five defendants in pretrial capital proceedings, is mentally incompetent to stand trial. Mr. bin al-Shibh has been in military custody for 21 years and will remain at Guantanamo as authorities treat his post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the “enhanced interrogations” employed by the U.S. government and its agents.\nIn his opinion, Judge McCall wrote that Mr. bin al-Shibh is wholly focused on his delusions and thus incompetent to stand trial. “They disrupt his sleep and lead to outbursts that result in disciplinary confinement measures. The result is a sleep-deprived accused whose primary focus is on stopping attacks, not defending himself against the charged offenses.… The fact that Mr. bin al-Shibh understands the vital role that his defense counsel plays and yet, again and again, he focuses his counsel’s work on stopping his delusional harassment, demonstrates the impairment of his ability to assist in his defense.”\nOn August 18, 2023, Judge Lanny Acosta Jr., a military judge overseeing the pretrial capital proceedings of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi national who is accused of organizing the October 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, ruled that Mr. al-Nashiri’s confessions could not be entered in evidence at trial because they are products of torture. Judge Acosta acknowledged that excluding this evidence may have societal implications, but “permitting the admission of evidence obtained by or derived from torture by the same government that seeks to prosecute and execute the accused may have even greater societal cost.”\nProsecutors argued that Mr. al-Nishiri’s confessions were voluntary and thus admissible in court, but the judge disagreed. “Even if the 2007 statements were not obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, they were derived from it,” said Judge Acosta (emphasis in original).\nDefense attorneys have long argued that the torture and trauma endured during years-long interrogations at CIA blacksites and Guantanamo Bay have caused permanent damage to all the 9/11 and U.S.S. Cole defendants and should make them ineligible for the death penalty.\nInternational Top\nContinued Isolation of the United States as a Retentionist Country Amid Rising Global Execution Numbers\nThe United States remains a global outlier in its use of the death penalty. The overall worldwide trend toward abolition of the death penalty in law or practice continued in 2023 with developments in Malaysia, Kenya, and Ghana. On July 4, Malaysia took a step closer to abolition by eliminating the mandatory death penalty for 11 capital offenses; following this reform, seven death row prisoners were resentenced to a 30 year life imprisonment term on November 14. In July, Kenyan President Dr. William Ruto commuted all death sentences imposed prior to November 21, 2022 to life sentences. On July 25, Ghana joined 28 other African nations in abolishing the death penalty. Uganda is at odds with the trend toward abolition in sub-Saharan Africa. It passed the Anti-Homosexuality Act 2023 on May 29 that made the death penalty a possible punishment for “aggravated homosexuality.” A 20-year-old man has recently been charged under this new law.\nAlthough the geographic scope of capital punishment has narrowed, the total number of known executions worldwide increased for the second year in a row. This year’s increase is attributable to a surge in executions by Iran, which has reportedly surpassed 700 executions for the first time in eight years. Saudi Arabia (at least 121 executions as of November 8) and Somalia (at least 55 executions as of November 30) have the second and third highest number of reported executions in the world.\nThough the United States has at times joined the international community in condemning the unlawful actions of fellow retentionist countries, the criticism has limited impact given the fact that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)’s precautionary measures for American death-sentenced prisoners are frequently ignored. This year, the IACHR granted precautionary measures to South Carolina prisoner Richard Moore and to Missouri prisoner Michael Tisius; Mr. Tisius was executed on June 6.\nIncreased Use of the Death Penalty in Violation of International Law and Norms\n“Although international law permits the death penalty in very limited circumstances, in practice it is almost impossible for States to impose the death penalty while complying with human rights obligations, including the absolute and universal prohibition of torture.”\nSecrecy shields much of the information about the use of capital punishment in the U.S. and in many retentionist countries. China, Vietnam, and North Korea classify information relating to the death penalty, such as number of death sentences and executions, as state secrets. China is estimated to execute thousands of people per year, making it the world’s leading executioner, and North Korea has executed at least 17 people this year. In Iran, the Revolutionary Court has reportedly convicted and sentenced to death individuals without adequate counsel in quick, secret trials, routinely characterized by human rights advocates as unfair and lacking due process.\nIll-treatment of prisoners or trials based on information obtained through torture are prohibited under international law. Some countries, including Iran, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia, have executed individuals this year despite serious allegations of torture. In Vietnam, Le Van Manh was executed amidst numerous appeals from the international community to spare his life. “I am disturbed by the execution of Le Van Manh despite calls for clemency, in light of serious doubts about the fairness of his trial proceedings and credible allegations of torture or ill-treatment to extract a confession,” said Mr. Tidball-Binz.\nExecutions for Drug Crimes and Other Non-Homicides\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits the use of the death penalty for “the most serious offenses,” defined as intentional killing, in retentionist countries; only two retentionist countries, Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, follow this standard. In 2023, many people were charged and executed for non-serious offenses, such as drug-related offenses and political speech. As of October 10, 305 executions in Iran, or 57%, have been the result of drug-related charges, marking a dramatic increase from the previous year’s number of 180 drug-related executions. Saudi Arabia continues to execute people for drug-related crimes after resuming in November 2022. In the 54th session of the UN Human Rights Council, Saudi Arabia led a proposal to remove paragraphs in a proposed resolution condemning capital punishment for drug-related crimes, emphasizing state sovereignty in establishing appropriate legal punishments; the proposal was rejected. Singapore has notoriously strict laws on drug possession, prescribing the death penalty for people convicted of trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of cocaine, 250 grams of methamphetamines, or 500 grams of cannabis. As of July 28, at least four people were executed for drug-related offenses in Singapore. Pakistan has sentenced several people to death for sharing blasphemous content on social media. Saudi Arabia sentenced a retired schoolteacher to death for retweeting criticism of the government on social media. Iran executed at least five protesters on security-related charges and two for blasphemy. In North Korea, nine people were publicly executed for operating a beef distribution ring, one warehouse manager for allegedly stealing 20,000 doses of penicillin, and two women for reportedly watching South Korean television programs.\nOver-Representation of Vulnerable Populations\nVulnerable populations, such as the very poor, people with serious mental impairments, and juveniles, as well as people from ethnic, religious, or racial minorities, are overrepresented on death rows across most retentionist countries. At least three juveniles are believed to have been executed in Iran, and the Baluch population accounts for 21% of all executions and 31% of drug-related executions in 2023 (as of October 10) despite comprising only 2 – 5% of Iran’s population. 90% of those executed for security-related charges in Iran in the last 13 years were Kurdish (51%), Baluch (28%), and Arab (15%). Despite a 2020 royal decree ordering the implementation of a 2018 law abolishing the death penalty for juveniles, at least nine children in Saudi Arabia face the death penalty. In June, Saudi Arabia executed two Bahraini Shi’a on terrorism-related charges after what Amnesty International described as a “grossly unfair trial.” These two are among at least 16 executions of Shiites in Saudi Arabia this year.\nKey Quotes Top\nNow I know the public, quite reasonably, has conjured up in their minds, what the worst of the worst is, and it has to do with the crime committed. As a lay person, public citizen, I can understand that. But being involved in corrections at the level that I’ve been over 20 years, at least, and administering prisons, I’ve been able to see below the surface of that type of classification. So, it’s not that easy to come up with a singular profile of what the worst of the worst might be.\nIt’s a very important issue that has to be done correctly, and we will take the time to fix the protocol and to make certain that we don’t move forward until everything’s in place.\nThis Court has so prioritized expeditious executions that it has disregarded well-reasoned lower court conclusions, preventing both the meaningful airing of prisoners’ challenges and the development of Eighth Amendment law… Unfortunately, lower courts are receiving the message.\nJustice has been delayed for too long in South Carolina… This filing brings our state one step closer to being able to once again carry out the rule of law and bring grieving families and loved ones the closure they are rightfully owed.\nIf I thought that the death penalty was going to stop people from committing brutal murders, I would seek it. But we know that it won’t… The reality is that the death penalty doesn’t serve as a deterrent, and the death penalty does not bring people back…What I can assure you is that we’re going to do everything within our legal power to make sure that this defendant never is out of prison.\nIf the death penalty is reinstated, or if we start seeing it applied more, we can expect it’s going to be applied in a disproportionate way and that those are the same racial disparities that we have seen over years. My concern is [the number of defendants of color sentenced to death] may even increase because the rhetoric lately has been so much stronger. We have to know that if we’re going to punish more, that it’s going to be disproportionately borne by Black and Brown communities.\nIn my heart, I feel that he is not only remorseful for his actions but has been doing good works for others and has something left to offer the world… I respectfully request that his sentence be changed to life in prison where hopefully he can continue to help others and make amends for his past crimes.\nFor me, the opposition to capital punishment has just been a natural extension of our pro-life position of building an inclusive society, a society that welcomes everyone into the human family and says: ‘Listen, your worth is not dependent on whether somebody wants you or not.’ God’s given you human dignity, God’s giving you worth, and so we just want to stand on the side of the Lord.\nHad we not had this trial, the deeds of this criminal would have been glossed over in history… The purpose of the death penalty is not so much punishing, as cutting off the person from society, eliminating the evil, taking away the risk, the potential for infection, and the possibility of further harm to the citizens.\nI am also deeply troubled by the constitutional implications of the nothing-to-see-here approach that the majority takes with respect to the incarceration of potential legal innocents… Apparently, legally innocent or not, Jones must just carry on in prison regardless, since…no path exists for him to ask a federal judge to consider his innocence assertion. But forever slamming the courtroom doors to a possibly innocent person who has never had a meaningful opportunity to get a new and retroactively applicable claim for release reviewed on the merits raises serious constitutional concerns.\nAs governors, we had the power to commute the sentences of all those on Alabama’s death row to life in prison… We missed our chance to confront the death penalty and have lived to regret it, but it is not too late for today’s elected officials to do the morally right thing.\nDownloadable Resources Top\nClick the images below to view at full resolution.\nCredits Top\nThe Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) is a national non-profit organization whose mission is to serve the media, policymakers, and the general public with data and analysis on issues concerning capital punishment and the people it affects.

Wendy Davis gave reasons “why I stood up for Texas women” in a filibuster against abortion restrictions that drew national attention.\nAmong them: “Each year, about 25,000 American women … become pregnant through rape or incest,” wrote the Fort Worth Democrat.\nA Democratic effort to exclude victims of rape and incest from the Texas restrictions eventually proved futile, as did Davis’ filibuster; the measure was signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry on July 18.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nWe remained curious about Davis’ pregnancy statistic.\nDavis spokesman Rick Svatora told us that the number came from a media fact sheet posted online by NARAL Pro Choice America, an abortion rights advocacy group formerly called the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The fact sheet says, “Each year, approximately 25,000 women in the United States become pregnant as a result of rape.”\nWant more Statesman?\nThere are no incest pregnancy statistics on the sheet, and we found none in other sources. Dean Kilpatrick, director of the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, told us that although rape and incest often are mentioned together in abortion laws, there is little research on incest, a difficult area to study for reasons that include underreporting.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nSvatora provided two articles on rape-related pregnancy:\n• A 1996 Medical University of South Carolina analysis of the federally funded 1990-92 National Women’s Study of 3,031 women over 18. (Kilpatrick worked on both the study and the analysis.) The analysis concluded that among rape victims aged 12 to 45, 5 percent of rapes resulted in pregnancies, and, using the study’s figure of 683,000 “forcible rapes” in 1990, estimated that “there may be 32,101 rape-related pregnancies annually among American women older than 18 years.”\n• A 2000 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, using the 1996 analysis’ estimated rate of 5 percent of rapes resulting in pregnancies, assumed a 50 percent drop in rapes since 1992 to reach an estimate of 25,000 pregnancies from rape in 1998.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t keep data on pregnancy due to rape, nor does the U.S. Department of Justice. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists spokesman Greg Phillips said the 32,000 figure is “the best estimate we have now.”\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nKilpatrick said the 1996 analysis he worked on is still cited because of the National Women’s Study’s large population sample and the fact that more recent research has tended to support its 5 percent pregnancy rate.\nThe Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a Washington, D.C.-based charity, reached a much lower figure by doing the same calculation with an estimate from the Justice Department’s 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey. On its website, the network takes the survey’s annual average of 64,080 rapes committed in 2004 and 2005 and applies the 5 percent pregnancy rate to reach an estimate of 3,204 pregnancies a year from rape.\nThat’s 10 times less than the 1996 estimate of 32,000. The biggest reason for that difference: According to federal statistics, rapes — like other violent crimes — declined significantly in the U.S. during those years.\nA federal report in March 2013 compiled statistics from the National Crime Victimization Survey and showed that the annual average for completed rapes dropped 65 percent from 402,000 in 1995 to 143,300 in 2010.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nUsing the method the 1996 and 2000 researchers did — multiplying the rape counts by the 5 percent pregnancy rate — we calculated 7,165 pregnancies from rape in 2010.\nBut Kilpatrick disagreed with the results of the federal survey, which he said misses most rape cases in large part because its questions are framed in the context of crime and can leave doubt about exactly what’s being asked. He and his colleagues estimated higher numbers of rapes in the 1990-92 survey and in a 2007 follow-up, estimating in both studies that only about 17 percent of rapes were reported.\nKilpatrick noted that a 2010 CDC report found that 1.3 million women were raped in the previous 12 months. Applying the 5 percent pregnancy rate to a rounded estimate of 1 million rapes yields 50,000 possible pregnancies, the number that Kilpatrick endorses.\nOur ruling: Davis said, “Each year, about 25,000 American women … become pregnant through rape or incest.” She offered no backup for the incest part of the statement, and we found none.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nEstimates of rape-related pregnancies per year vary from 3,200 to 50,000. Davis’ number, despite dating from 1998, fits inside that range, but there is too much disagreement for us — or Davis — to pin any one statistic as the definitive number of rape-related pregnancies per year.\nWendy Davis\nWe rate her statement as Half True.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Pregnancy from rape\n| Part of a series on |\n| Violence against women |\n|---|\n| Murder |\n| Sexual assault and rape |\n| Disfigurement |\n| Other issues |\n|\n| International legal framework |\n| Related topics |\n| Rape |\n|---|\nPregnancy is a potential result of rape. It has been studied in the context of war, particularly as a tool for genocide, as well as in other unrelated contexts, such as rape by a stranger, statutory rape, incest, and underage pregnancy. The scientific consensus is that rape is at least as likely to lead to pregnancy as consensual sexual intercourse, with some studies suggesting rape may actually result in higher rates of pregnancy than consensual intercourse.[1][2][3]\nRape can cause difficulties during and after pregnancy, with potential negative consequences for both the victim and a resulting child.[4] Medical treatment following a rape includes testing for, preventing, and managing pregnancy. A woman who becomes pregnant after a rape may face a decision about whether to have an abortion, to raise the child, or to make an adoption plan. In some countries where abortion is illegal after rape and incest, over 90% of pregnancies in girls age 15 and under are due to rape by family members.[5]\nThe false belief that pregnancy can almost never result from rape was widespread for centuries. In Europe, from medieval times well into the 18th century, a man could use a woman's pregnancy as a legal defense to \"prove\" that he could not have raped her. A woman's pregnancy was thought to mean that she had enjoyed the sex and, therefore, consented to it. In recent decades, some anti-abortion organizations and politicians (such as Todd Akin) who oppose legal abortion in cases of rape have advanced claims that pregnancy very rarely arises from rape, and that the practical relevance of such exceptions to abortion law is therefore limited or non-existent.[6][7][8]\nRape-pregnancy incidence\n[edit]Estimates of the numbers of pregnancies from rape vary widely.[9][10] Recent estimates suggest that rape conception happens between 25,000 and 32,000 times each year in the U.S. In a 1996 three-year longitudinal study of more than 4,000 American women, physician Melisa Holmes estimated from data from her study that forced sexual intercourse causes over 32,000 pregnancies in the United States each year.[11] Physician Felicia H. Stewart and economist James Trussell estimated that the 333,000 assaults and rapes reported in the US in 1998 caused about 25,000 pregnancies, and up to 22,000 of those pregnancies could have been prevented by prompt medical treatment, such as emergency contraception.[12] Other analyses indicate a much lower rate. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a charity based in Washington, D.C., reached a much lower figure calculated using estimates from the Justice Department's 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey. The network took that survey's annual average of 64,080 rapes committed in 2004 and 2005 and applies the 5 percent pregnancy rate to reach an estimate of 3,204 pregnancies a year from rape.[10]\nRate\n[edit]A 1996 study of 44 cases of rape-related pregnancy estimated that in the United States, the pregnancy rate is 5.0% per rape among victims of reproductive age (aged 12 to 45).[11][13] A 1987 study also found a 5% pregnancy rate from rape among 18- to 24-year-old college students in the US.[14] A 2005 study placed the rape-related pregnancy rate at around 3–5%.[15]\nA study of Ethiopian adolescents who reported being raped found that 17% subsequently became pregnant,[16] and rape crisis centres in Mexico reported the figure the rate of pregnancy from rape at 15–18%.[17] Estimates of rape-related pregnancy rates may be inaccurate since the crime is under-reported, resulting in some pregnancies from rape not being recorded as such,[15] or alternately, social pressure may mean some rapes are not reported if no pregnancy results.\nMost studies suggest that conception rates are independent of whether insemination is due to rape or consensual sex.[18]\nSome analysts have suggested that the rate of conception may be higher from insemination due to rape.[19][20][21][22] Psychologist Robert L. Smith states that some studies have reported \"unusually high rates of conception following rape\".[19] He cites a paper by C.A. Fox and Beatrice Fox, reporting that biologist Alan Sterling Parkes had speculated in personal correspondence that \"there is a high conception rate in rape, where hormonal release, due to fear or anger, could produce reflex ovulation\".[20] Smith also cites veterinary scientist Wolfgang Jöchle, who \"proposed that rape may induce ovulation in human females\".[21][22] Literary scholar Jonathan Gottschall and economist Tiffani Gottschall argued in a 2003 Human Nature article that previous studies of rape-pregnancy statistics were not directly comparable to pregnancy rates from consensual intercourse, because the comparisons were largely uncorrected for such factors as the use of contraception. Adjusting for these factors, they estimated that rapes are about twice as likely to result in pregnancies (7.98%) as \"consensual, unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse\" (2–4%). They discuss a variety of possible explanations and advance the hypothesis that rapists tend to target victims with biological \"cues of high fecundity\" or subtle indications of ovulation.[3]\nIn contrast, psychologists Tara Chavanne and Gordon Gallup Jr., found that women in the ovulatory phase of their menstrual cycle reduce risk-taking behaviors, which could theoretically reduce the likelihood of rape during fertile periods.[23] Anthropologist Daniel Fessler disputed these findings, saying, \"analysis of conception rates reveals that the probability of conception following rape does not differ from that following consensual coitus\".[18]\nSociobiological theories of rape pregnancy\n[edit]Sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape may be a mating strategy in humans, as a way for males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations.[24] Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are women of childbearing age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and women of childbearing age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women.[25] Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by natural selection.[3]\nSome anthropologists and evolutionary theorists have challenged the view that rape is an adaptive mating strategy. Feminist scholars argue that sexual violence is better understood as a byproduct of social structures rather than an evolved reproductive tactic. For example, anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday has documented significant cross-cultural variation in the prevalence of rape, suggesting that sexual violence correlates more strongly with social factors like male dominance and militarism than with evolutionary imperatives. In societies with egalitarian gender norms, she found rape to be rare or absent, undermining claims that it is a universal or biologically selected behavior.[26]\nSimilarly, evolutionary biologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy has emphasized the importance of female reproductive agency in human evolution, arguing that cooperative childrearing and mutual mate selection, rather than coercion, were central to early human reproductive success. These perspectives suggest that rape is not an evolved strategy, but a socially contingent behavior that arises under certain cultural and institutional conditions.[27][28]\nStatutory rape, incest and underage pregnancy\n[edit]In 1995–1996, the journal Family Planning Perspectives published a study by the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual health research and policy organization, on statutory rape (sexual intercourse with a minor) and resulting pregnancies. It drew on other research[29][30] to conclude that \"at least half of all babies born to minor women are fathered by adult men\", and that \"although relatively small proportions of 13–14-year-olds have had intercourse, those who become sexually active at an early age are especially likely to have experienced coercive sex: Seventy-four percent of women who had intercourse before age 14 and 60% of those who had sex before age 15 report having had a forced sexual experience\". Because of difficulties in bringing such cases to trial, however, \"data from the period 1975–1978 ... indicate that, on average, only 413 men were arrested annually for statutory rape in California, even though 50,000 pregnancies occurred among underage women in 1976 alone\".[31] In that state, it was found that two thirds of babies born to school-age mothers were fathered by adult men.[29]\nSexual abuse early in life can lead young women to feel a lack of control over their sexual lives, decrease their future likelihood of using contraceptives such as condoms, and increase their chances of becoming pregnant or acquiring sexually transmitted infections.[17] A 2007 paper by Child Trends[32] examined studies from 2000 to 2006 to identify links between sexual abuse and teenage pregnancy, starting with Blinn-Pike et al.'s 2002 metastudy of 15 studies since 1989.[33] It found that childhood sexual abuse has a \"significant association\" with adolescent pregnancy. Direct connections have been demonstrated both by retrospective studies examining antecedents to reported pregnancies and prospective studies, which track the lives of sex abuse victims and \"can be helpful for determining causality\".[32]: 3 The more severe forms of abuse, such as rape and incest, entail a greater risk of adolescent pregnancy.[32]: 4 [34][35] Although some researchers suggest that pregnancy could be a choice made to escape a \"bad situation\", it may also be \"a direct result of unwanted intercourse\", which one study found to be the case for about 13% of participants in a Texas parenting program.[32]: 4 [36]\nIn Nicaragua, between 2000 and 2010, around 172,500 births were recorded for girls under 14, representing around 13% of the 10.3 million births during that period. These were attributed to poverty, laws forbidding abortion for rape and incest, lack of access to justice, and beliefs held in the culture and legal system.[5][37] A 1992 study in Peru found that 90% of babies delivered to mothers aged 12–16 were conceived through rape, typically by a father, stepfather, or other close relative.[5][verification needed] In 1991 in Costa Rica, the figure was similar, with 95% of adolescent mothers under 15 having become pregnant through rape.[5][verification needed]\nMany of the youngest documented birth mothers in history experienced precocious puberty and were impregnated as a result of rape, including incest. The youngest, Peruvian Lina Medina, was impregnated when she was four and had a live birth in 1939, at age five.[38]\nRape in war and conflict\n[edit]Rape has been used as a weapon of psychological warfare for centuries, to terrorize, humiliate, and undermine the morale of the enemy. Rape was also used as an act of ethnic cleansing to produce babies that share the perpetrators' ethnicity.[39] Forced pregnancy has been noted in places including Bangladesh, Darfur, and Bosnia.[40] More broadly, pregnancy commonly results from wartime rape that was perpetrated without the intention of impregnating the enemy, as has been found in conflicts in East Timor, Liberia, Kosovo, and Rwanda.[40] Gita Sahgal of Amnesty International commented that, rather than being primarily about \"spoils of war\" or sexual gratification, rape is often used in ethnic conflicts as a way for attackers to perpetuate social control and redraw ethnic boundaries.[41] Children may be born to women and girls forced to \"marry\" abductors and occupiers; this happened in the Indonesian occupation of East Timor and in the Lord's Resistance Army's conflict in Uganda.[42]\nRape during war is recognized under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820 as a war crime and a crime against humanity.[43] \"Forced pregnancy\" is specifically enumerated as a war crime and crime against humanity in the Rome Statute, which was the \"first international criminal tribunal ever officially to criminalize forced pregnancy\".[44]\nChildren born as the result of wartime rape may be identified with the enemy and grow up stigmatized and excluded by their communities; they may be denied basic rights or even killed before reaching adulthood.[40] Children are particularly at risk for such abuse when they are visibly identifiable as sharing half their ethnicity with the occupying forces, as in the case of half-Arab children of Darfuri women raped by janjaweed soldiers as part of the war in Darfur.[45] Children of war rape are also at risk due to neglect by traumatized mothers unable to provide sufficient care.[45]\nRape of Nanking\n[edit]In 1937 the Japanese army took over Nanking, which at the time was the capital of China. In the resulting seven-week occupation known as the Rape of Nanking, as many as 80,000 women were raped.[46] Chinese women and girls of all ages were raped, mutilated, tortured, sexually enslaved, and killed; unknown numbers of them were left pregnant.[46] Many pregnant Nanking women killed themselves in 1938, and others committed infanticide when their babies were born.[46] During the rest of the 20th century there was no record of any Chinese woman acknowledging her child as having been born as a result of the Rape of Nanking.[46]\nBosnian War\n[edit]During the 1992–1995 Bosnian War, pregnancy from rape was used to perpetrate genocide. There were reports of deliberately created \"rape camps\" intended to impregnate captive Muslim and Croatian women. Women were reported to have been kept in confinement until their pregnancies had advanced beyond a stage at which abortion would be safe.[47] In the context of a patrilineal society, in which children inherit their father's ethnicity, such camps were intended to create a new generation of Serbian children.[47] The women's group Tresnjevka claimed that more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run camps.[48][49][50] Estimates range from 20,000[51] to 50,000[52] victims.[53][54][55] Feryal Gharahi of Equality Now reported:[56]\n- Families were separated, and women and children were kept in the gym, where all of the women and girls over ten years old were raped in the first few days.... There are rape camps all over the country. Thousands of women are being raped and killed. Thousands of women are pregnant as a result of rape. Over and over again, everywhere I went in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatian refugee camps, women told me stories of abomination – of being kept in a room, raped repeatedly and told they would be held until they gave birth to Serbian children.\nAfter the Bosnian War, the International Criminal Court updated its statute to prohibit \"confin[ing] one or more women forcibly made pregnant, with the intent of affecting the ethnic composition of any population\".[57]\nTreatment and outcomes\n[edit]Immediate post-rape protocols call for medical professionals to assess the likelihood that a victim will become pregnant in their assessment of the physical damage done to the woman. Protocol for gaining a history of the use of contraceptives, as a woman's use of birth control pills or other contraceptives before a rape affect her chance of becoming pregnant.[58] Treatment protocols also call for clinicians to provide access to emergency contraception and counseling on abortion in countries where it is legal.[59] High-dose estrogen pills were tried as an experimental treatment after rape in the 1960s, and in 1972 Canadian physician A. Albert Yuzpe and his colleagues began systematic studies on the use of ethinylestradiol and norgestrel to provide emergency contraception after an assault. These treatments reduced the rate of pregnancy after rape by 84%.[60] This method is now called the Yuzpe regimen.[61] Before being treated with pregnancy prevention measures, a rape victim is given a HCG pregnancy test to determine whether she was already pregnant before the rape.[62]\nWhen being discharged from emergency care, clinicians provide information about pregnancy as well as other complications such as infection and emotional trauma.[62] While a woman who has become pregnant during the past 48 hours will test negative for pregnancy in an HCG pregnancy test (unless she was already pregnant before the rape), pregnancy resulting from the rape can be detected at the two-week follow-up visit.[63]\nDecisions of whether to end a rape-related pregnancy or carry it to term, and whether to keep the child or place the child for adoption can be severely traumatizing for a woman.[64] Abortion rates for pregnancies due to rape vary significantly by culture and demographics; women who live in countries where abortion is illegal must often give birth to the child or secretly undergo a dangerous, unsafe abortion.[17] Some women do not wish to get abortions for religious or cultural reasons.[65] In a third of cases, rape-related pregnancies are not discovered until the second trimester of pregnancy, which may reduce a woman's options, particularly if she doesn't have easy access to legal abortion or is still recovering from the trauma of the rape itself.[66]\nIn the United States, 1 percent of 1,900 women questioned in 1987 listed rape or incest as the reason for having an abortion; of these, 95 percent named other reasons as well.[67] A 1996 study of thousands of US women showed that, of pregnancies resulting from rape, 50% were aborted, 12% resulted in miscarriage, and 38% were brought to term and either placed for adoption or raised.[13] Peer-reviewed studies have reported from 38% of American women to 90% of Peruvian adolescents carrying the pregnancy to term.[11][68] In Lima, Peru, where abortion is illegal, 90% of girls aged 12 to 16 who became pregnant through rape carried the child to term.[68] Of all children born, 1% are placed for adoption; the number of children conceived from rape who are placed for adoption was found to be about 6% in one study and 26% in another.[69] When a mother commits neonaticide, killing an infant younger than 24 hours old, the child's birth being the result of rape is a main cause, although other psychological and situational factors are generally present.[70] Some people turn to drugs or alcohol to cope with emotional trauma after a rape; use of these during pregnancy can harm the fetus.[71]\nChildren of rape\n[edit]The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. (April 2018) |\nWhen a mother chooses to raise her child conceived in rape, the traumatic effect of the rape and the child's biological relationship to the rapist has the potential to create some psychological challenges, but the circumstance of conception is no guarantee to cause psychological problems.[69][72] If a woman decides to keep and raise the child, she may have difficulty accepting them, and both mother and child may face ostracism in some societies.[73]\nMothers may also face legal difficulties. In most US states, the rapist maintains parental rights.[74] Research by legal scholar Shauna Prewitt indicates that the resulting continued contact with the rapist is damaging for women who keep the child.[74] She wrote in 2012 that in the US, 31 states allow rapists to assert custody and visitation rights over children conceived through rape.[72]\nHistory\n[edit]Infanticide\n[edit]Children whose births result from rape have been killed by their mothers at various times in history. During ancient and medieval times, such infanticide was not prohibited (however, penance was expected of these mothers in medieval Europe).[66]\nBeliefs about whether rape can result in pregnancy\n[edit]Beliefs that rape could not lead to pregnancy were widespread in both legal and medical opinion for centuries.[75][76] Galen, an ancient Greek physician, believed that a woman must experience pleasure to release \"seed\" and become pregnant, and could not derive such pleasure from nonconsensual sex.[77] Galen's thinking influenced understanding from medieval England to Colonial America.[77] Aristotle disagreed, as he believed that \"women's bodies were not hot enough to produce semen\".[78] Female reproduction was, in many ways, viewed through the lens of male reproductive processes, imagining that female organs functioned as inverted versions of male organs, and hence orgasm was required for conception.[75]\nCenturies later, in medieval Europe, the belief that pregnancy could not occur without consent was still standard; in fact, conception by a woman was considered a legitimate defense against charges of rape.[76] The belief was codified in the medieval British law texts Fleta[75] and Britton. Britton states:[79]\nIf the defendant confesses the fact, but says that the woman at the same time conceived by him, and can prove it, then our will is that it be adjudged no felony, because no woman can conceive if she does not consent.\nMedieval literary scholar Corinne Saunders acknowledged a difficulty in determining how widely held was the belief that pregnancy implies consent, but concluded that it influenced \"at least some justices\", citing a 1313 case in Kent.[80] Against this, in his popular 12th-century Dragmaticon, the early Scholastic philosopher William of Conches noted the objection of Geoffrey of Plantagenet—count of Anjou in France and father of King Henry II of England—to Galen's idea, stating that it was certain that some rape resulted in births; William acknowledged that this occurred but averred that it was merely proof that some or all women experienced involuntary carnal pleasure from the act despite their lack of rational consent.[81] However, the same rationale was used as an explanation for the supposed infrequency of births among prostitutes.[81]\nBy the late 1700s, scientists no longer universally accepted the view that pregnancy was impossible without pleasure, although this view was still common.[82] A 1795 British legal text, Treatise of Pleas of the Crown, disparaged the belief's legal utility and its biological veracity:[76][83]\nAlso it hath been said by some to be no rape to force a woman who conceives at the time; for it is said, that if she had not consented, she could not have conceived, but this opinion seems very questionable, not only because the previous violence is no way extenuated by such a subsequent consent, but also because, if it were necessary to shew that the woman did not conceive, the offender could not be tried till such time as it might appear whether she did or did not, and likewise because the philosophy of this notion may very well be doubted of.\nThe 1814 British legal text Elements of Medical Jurisprudence by Samuel Farr claimed that conception \"probably\" could not occur without a woman's \"enjoyment\", so that an \"absolute rape\" was unlikely to lead to pregnancy.[75][84] On the other hand, in the US in an 1820 court case in the Arkansas Territory a man pleaded not guilty to rape charges because the victim became pregnant, but the court rejected the argument:[85]\nThe old notion that if the woman conceive, it could not be a rape, because she must have in such case have consented, is quite exploded. Impregnation, it is well known, does not depend on the consciousness or volition of the female. If the uterine organs be in a condition favorable to impregnation, this may take place as readily as if the intercourse was voluntary.\nIn more recent times, opponents of legal abortion have argued that pregnancy resulting from rape is rare.[7][2] In a 1972 article, physician and anti-abortion activist Fred Mecklenburg argued that pregnancy from rape is \"extremely rare\", adding that a woman exposed to the trauma of rape \"will not ovulate even if she is 'scheduled' to\".[86] Blythe Bernhard wrote in The Washington Post, \"That article has influenced two generations of anti-abortion activists with the hope to build a medical case to ban all abortions without any exception.\"[87]\nIslamic law\n[edit]Historian Ian Talbot has written about how countries with Quran-based Islamic codes on rape and pregnancy use Sura An-Nur, verse 2, as a legal basis: \"The law of evidence in all sexual crimes required either self-confession or the testimony of four upright (salah) Muslim males. In the case of a man, self-confession involved a verbal confession. For women however medical examinations and pregnancy arising from rape were admissible as proof of self-guilt.\"[clarification needed] Under Islamic law, a woman can kill her rapist.[88]\nMale victims\n[edit]Pregnancy from rape can also occur when the victim is male and the rapist is female. Many such cases involve the statutory rape of underage boys by adult women who subsequently became pregnant. In Kansas, Hermesmann v. Seyer established that a 13-year-old male victim of rape can be held liable to pay child support for a baby that results from the rape, and later cases in the United States have held likewise.[89][90][91]\nSee also\n[edit]- Abortion-rights movements\n- Effects and aftermath of rape\n- Forced pregnancy\n- Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections\n- Reproductive coercion\n- Sociobiological theories of rape\n- Forced fatherhood\n- Unintended pregnancy\n- War on Women\n- Wartime sexual violence\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Dellorto, Danielle (22 August 2012). \"Experts: Rape does not lower odds of pregnancy\".

R. 4113 To provide for the provision by hospitals of emergency contraceptives to women who are survivors of sexual assault. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES April 9, 2002 Mrs. Morella (for herself, Mr. Greenwood, Ms. Slaughter, and Ms. DeGette) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To provide for the provision by hospitals of emergency contraceptives to women who are survivors of sexual assault. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Compassionate Care for Female Sexual Assault Survivors Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) It is estimated that 25,000 women become pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. (2) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment after being sexually assaulted. (3) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not protected by some form of contraception at the time of the attack. (4) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89 percent. (5) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner emergency contraception is administered, the greater the likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy, and it is most effective if administered in the first 12 hours after unprotected intercourse. (6) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have endorsed more widespread availability of such pills. (7) It is essential that all hospitals that provide emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception as a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually assaulted, so she may prevent an unintended pregnancy. SEC. 3. SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT; PROVISION BY HOSPITALS OF EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVES WITHOUT CHARGE. (a) In General.--Federal funds may not be provided to a hospital under any health-related program unless the hospital meets the conditions specified in subsection (b) in the case of any woman who presents at the hospital and-- (1) states that she is the victim of sexual assault; (2) is accompanied by someone who states she is a victim of sexual assault; or (3) whom hospital personnel have reason to believe is a victim of sexual assault. (b) Assistance for Victims.--The conditions specified in this subsection regarding a hospital and a woman described in subsection (a) are as follows: (1) The hospital promptly provides the woman with medically and factually accurate and unbiased written and oral information about emergency contraception, including information explaining that-- (A) emergency contraception does not cause an abortion; and (B) emergency contraception is effective in most cases in preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex. (2) The hospital promptly offers emergency contraception to the woman, and promptly provides it to her upon her request. (3) The information provided pursuant to paragraph (1) is in clear and concise language, is readily comprehensible, and meets such conditions regarding the provision of the information in languages other than English as the Secretary may establish. (4) The services described in paragraphs (1) through (3) are not denied because of the inability of the woman or her family to pay for the services. (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section: (1) The term ``emergency contraception'' means a drug that is-- (A) used postcoitally; (B) prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation, preventing fertilization of an egg, or preventing implantation of an egg in a uterus; and (C) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (2) The term ``hospital'' has the meanings given such term in title XVIII of the Social Security Act, including the meaning applicable in such title for purposes of making payments for emergency services to hospitals that do not have agreements in effect under such title. (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. (4) The term ``sexual assault'' means coitus in which the woman involved does not consent or lacks the legal capacity to consent. (d) Effective Date; Agency Criteria.--This section takes effect upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. Not later than 30 days prior to the expiration of such period, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register criteria for carrying out this section. <all>\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Perhaps they would've seemed less out of place if we weren't just a few minutes away from Medical City, the University of Central Florida's sprawling new campus of hospitals and teaching facilities that's becoming a magnet for Orlando-area developers. Its gleaming new VA hospital loomed ahead.\nMy mother had been talking about the rent-a-cows since she had begun house-hunting in the area a couple of months before. It was a tax thing, she explained one day. You could rent a cow, put it in your yard, and get a property tax break. I took the story with a grain of salt. Zoe had spent the last four decades of her life living in New York City before moving to Florida for a job at UCF's medical school. I assumed something had just gotten lost in translation.\nNo. Sadly, my mother was basically right.\nRENT A COW, SAVE A BUCK\nIt's known as Florida's greenbelt law. The statute is meant to preserve farmland by taxing it at special, low rate. But some of the act's biggest beneficiaries are deep-pocketed developers, who often take advantage of it by literally renting cows.\n\"It's kind of symbolic of a lot of the problems we see with the tax code today,\" Carl Davis, a senior analyst with Citizens for Tax Justice, told me, \"of how needlessly polluted and complicated and loophole ridden it is.\"\nThe greenbelt law dates back to 1959, a time when Florida's swamps and orange groves were first giving way to suburban strip malls and sub divisions. As former state senator Steven Geller said to me, it was a troubled time for farmers. Land was assessed and taxed based on its most profitable potential use, and for the most part, that meant real estate. Because citrus trees didn't offer the same returns as new condos, many farmers were forced to either sell their property or risk being priced out. The greenbelt law offered a solution by dropping rates for agricultural land.\nOther states have passed similar laws that work as intended. The problem with Florida's, Geller said, is its vague wording. To qualify for the exemption, property owners are required to use their land for \"bona fide\" agricultural purposes. But what does \"bona fide\" mean? That's far from clear. Aided by lax court rulings, developers have seized on that ambiguity by leasing out their land to cattle ranchers while they prepare to build, often shaving hundreds of thousands of dollars off their tax bills.\nWhat does it take to qualify for the exemption? Often just a few underfed animals roaming around a mud patch. Property owners must submit a form to the government and provide evidence that they are engaged in \"good-faith commercial agriculture.\" They don't have to generate an income from their operations. Many have been allowed to claim the exemption even after rezoning their land for non-agricultural purposes. Others have received the break after starting construction. In its unsparing, 2005 investigation of the greenbelt law, reporters from the Miami Herald visited so-called farmland where they encountered cows eating trash in grassless fields and dead animals decomposing in the dirt. Here are couple of their descriptions:\n- Developer Armando Codina and his partners pay ranchers to keep cows on their land in northwest Miami-Dade County so they can get agricultural tax breaks while building industrial warehouses. One so-called pasture is a soggy wasteland littered with downed trees. Months before Codina requested farmland tax breaks, he asked Miami-Dade to declare the entire site an environmentally contaminated \"brownfield.\" 2004 property tax savings: $250,273.\n...- Cows wander amid concrete pads and utility boxes on 49 acres in Southwest Ranches, where developer Richard Bell plans to build homes priced at $1.5 million and up.... The rancher reported 16 cows last year. 2004 property tax savings: $140,168.\nOther beneficiaries of the law have included Walt Disney World ($1.5 million in savings), as well as U.S. Senator Bill Nelson ($43,000 in savings), who keeps about six cows on 55 acres of land near the Indian River, courtesy of a cattle ranching operation that leases the property for free. Like Nelson, some developers simply offer their land to ranchers for no charge. Others, as the Herald noted, actually pay the ranchers -- hence the loophole's nickname, \"rent-a-cow.\"\nThe total cost of these abuses isn't clear, but there are hints that it may be significant. According to a 2006 Associated Press article, the law costs Florida $950 million a year total. Some of the breaks go to legitimate commercial farms. But according to the Herald's 2005 investigation, more than two-thirds of the loophole's top 60 beneficiaries in South Florida weren't farmers.\n\"This thing's a game. Always has been since I've been here,\" one cattle rancher told the paper.\n'NO BABY TO SPLIT'\nIn 2006, Geller, who chaired the Florida Senate's Agriculture and Consumers Services Committee, tried to reform the game. His attempt was inspired by a property he passed each day on his morning commute. The owners had cleared it for development by removing the trees and grass, collapsing the field in the process.\n\"They called Hertz rent-a-cow and three or four cows showed up on this property the next day,\" Geller said. Thanks to the livestock, the landowners got to keep their tax exemption. Geller later learned about another case where the developers held on to their low rate even as they began bulldozing roads through their property. The construction crews were forced to shoo cattle away as they plowed through.\n\"If you've got a bulldozer on the property putting on the roads, it's not agriculture, despite the presence of four cows,\" Geller said.\nIn spite of these absurdities, Geller said he still saw the need to safeguard farmland. He decided to try and hash out a compromise with the state's farm lobby that would restrain some of the more flagrant abuses of the loophole. For instance, he suggested that, like other states, Florida could require property owners to pay back a few years worth of tax savings if they started developing their land. No deal. He suggested requiring farmland to actually make money to qualify for the exemption. No deal.\n\"There is no compromise that Solomon the Wise could have come up with that would have satisfied the ag guys,\" Geller said. \"There is no baby to split.\"\n\"Part of the problem, he said, was that in Florida, developers and farmers are frequently one in the same. Dairy owners and orange growers often cash out their operations by turning fields into condos.\nGeller eventually introduced a reform bill that died in committee. But two years later, the legislature did quietly pass a change to the the greenbelt law: They made it easier to claim the exemption even if your land was probably too small for commercial farming.\nAfter the 2006 reform effort failed, the director of the Florida Farm Bureau told the AP he believed \"The Greenbelt Law has achieved exactly what the legislature said it wanted to achieve.\" By that, he presumably meant agricultural land. But the sad irony is that Florida has lost has more than 40 percent of its farm acres since 1954. That shouldn't be a surprise. After all, the law makes it cheaper to buy land, then hold it until the market is ripe for building.\nBut why was my mother just \"basically\" right? Turns out, the greenbelt law does have one reasonable boundary: residential properties don't qualify for the exemption. That might sound like common sense. But for years, Colorado's own version of the statute let celebrity landowners like Tom Cruise shrink the tax bills on their vacation homes by letting a few sheep graze nearby. The state legislature there has since taken some small steps to fix the problem.\nSo in Florida, you cannot in fact park some livestock on your lawn and claim a write off. Even the dumbest of laws have limits.\n><\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context.

The election was concurrent with other elections for Virginia state offices. Incumbent Democratic Governor Ralph Northam was ineligible to run for re-election, as the Constitution of Virginia prohibits governors from serving consecutive terms. Businessman Glenn Youngkin won the Republican nomination at the party's May 8 convention, which was held in 37 polling locations across the state,[3] and was officially declared the nominee on May 10.[4] The Democratic Party held its primary election on June 8,[5] which former Governor Terry McAuliffe easily won.[6]\nIn the general election, Youngkin defeated McAuliffe by 63,688 votes in what was considered a mild upset because McAuliffe led over Youngkin in the polls until right before Election Day.[7] Youngkin was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Virginia since 2009. The economy, education, public health, and cultural issues were centerpieces of Youngkin's campaign.[8][9][10] Youngkin promised to ban the perceived teaching of critical race theory within public schools on \"day one\", push back against certain COVID-19 restrictions including vaccination mandates and mask mandates, and advocate for small government within the state of Virginia.[11][12][13][14]\nDemocrats tried to portray Youngkin as a political ally of Donald Trump, who lost Virginia in 2020, and Trump did indeed express support for Youngkin. Walking a fine line between welcoming the endorsement and demonstrating independence, Youngkin was successfully able to appeal to both Republicans and independents.[15] Political analysts believe that the main reason for the Democratic Party's defeat in Virginia was that voters were not satisfied with the performance of President Joe Biden, with whom McAuliffe allied himself.[16][17]\nDemocratic primary\n[edit]Candidates\n[edit]Nominee\n[edit]- Terry McAuliffe, former governor of Virginia (2014–2018) and former chair of the Democratic National Committee (2001–2005)[18][19]\nEliminated in primary\n[edit]- Jennifer Carroll Foy, former state delegate for Virginia's 2nd House of Delegates district (2018–2020)[20]\n- Lee J.

I've spent 31 years building this party and electing Democrats at the local, state and national level. It's not enough to give someone something to vote against. We've got to give people something to vote for,\" McClellan said. Foy said in her opening statement that she is presenting bold ideas that past politicians have failed to bring to Virginia. The pointed remark came before she went after the record of McAuliffe, the first criticism of the night directed at the presumptive frontrunner.[67] Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax compared scrutiny of his sexual assault allegations to that of the cases of George Floyd and Emmett Till in the debate.[68] McAuliffe mainly avoided directly responding to the attacks, focusing instead on his record as governor, the support he's received during his campaign and, stopping Glenn Youngkin in November's general election. Later in the debate, Carter called McAuliffe out for mentioning Youngkin and Trump so often. \"The debate that we're supposed to be having on this stage is a debate about the future of this commonwealth,\" he said. \"It's about what we stand for and what we're going to fight for. And this is the first opportunity for the Democratic Party to define what it is going to be after Donald Trump is gone. And he is gone. So, we can't just be a party that is opposed to the other guys. We have to fight for something.\" Carter, a self-described socialist, reiterated his proposal to use tax revenue from the marijuana industry to fund reparations.[67]\nPolling\n[edit]| Poll source | Date(s) administered |\nSample size[a] |\nMargin of error |\nJennifer Carroll Foy |\nLee Carter |\nJustin Fairfax |\nTerry McAuliffe |\nJennifer McClellan |\nOther | Undecided |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Roanoke College[69] | May 24 – June 1, 2021 | 637 (LV) | ± 3.9% | 11% | 1% | 5% | 49% | 9% | 0% | 24% |\n| Christopher Newport University[70] | April 11–20, 2021 | 806 (LV) | ± 3.9% | 5% | 1% | 8% | 47% | 6% | 2% | 31% |\n| Public Policy Polling (D)[71] | April 12–13, 2021 | 526 (LV) | ± 4.3% | 8% | 4% | 7% | 42% | 8% | – | 29% |\n| Christopher Newport University[72] | January 31 – February 14, 2021 | 488 (RV) | ± 4.9% | 4% | 1% | 12% | 26% | 4% | 0% | 54% |\n| YouGov Blue (D)[73] | February 6–11, 2021 | 235 (RV) | ± 7.4% | 7% | 6% | 6% | 43% | 8% | 0% | 30% |\n| Global Strategy Group (D)[74][A] | January 12–20, 2021 | 600 (LV) | ± 4.0% | 7% | – | 14% | 42% | 6% | – | 30% |\n| Expedition Strategies (D)[75][B] | December 2020 | – (LV) | – | 5% | – | 16% | 32% | 8% | – | 38% |\nResults\n[edit]| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Democratic | Terry McAuliffe | 307,367 | 62.10% | |\n| Democratic | Jennifer Carroll Foy | 98,052 | 19.81% | |\n| Democratic | Jennifer McClellan | 58,213 | 11.76% | |\n| Democratic | Justin Fairfax | 17,606 | 3.56% | |\n| Democratic | Lee J.

These efforts were unsuccessful and the party reaffirmed their decision to hold a convention.[82] On February 9, 2021, the Chase campaign sued the Republican Party of Virginia, arguing that the convention is illegal under COVID-19-related executive orders signed by Governor Ralph Northam.[83] The Richmond Circuit Court dismissed the Chase campaign's lawsuit on February 19, 2021.[84] The Republican Party of Virginia announced on March 26, 2021, that seven gubernatorial candidates had qualified to appear on the convention ballot.[85] On April 11, 2021, the state Republican Party Rules Committee voted to tabulate the ballots by hand; three days later, however, the committee reversed itself and decided to use a vendor's software-based tabulation method.[77]\nOn April 20, 2021, five candidates (Amanda Chase, Kirk Cox, Sergio de la Peña, Peter Doran, and Glenn Youngkin) participated in a forum at Liberty University in Lynchburg.[86] Two candidates, Octavia Johnson and Pete Snyder, did not attend the forum.[86][87]\nThe state Republican convention to select the party's nominees for governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general took place on May 8, 2021,[78][77] in \"unassembled\" format,[77] with ballots to be cast remotely at up to 37 locations statewide[78] using ranked-choice voting.[77] The complex process fueled internal party disputes.[88] Up to 40,000 people were anticipated to become delegates, although not all would necessarily cast votes.[77] Local Republican Party leaders control the application process to become a delegate, decide who can participate (voter registration in Virginia does not include a space to indicate party affiliation), and select the convention voting site.[88] In the preceding Virginia Republican gubernatorial convention, 12,000 participated.[77]\nOrthodox Jewish Virginia Republicans asked the party to allow absentee voting for religious reasons (May 8 is on the Jewish Sabbath), but the State Central Committee initially voted down the request, failing to achieve the 75% supermajority needed to change the rules.[89] However, the Virginia GOP ultimately reversed course and allowed those with religious objections to vote in the May 8 convention via absentee ballots. Republican candidates Kirk Cox, Peter Doran, and Glenn Youngkin had criticized the previous decision to not accommodate Orthodox Jews.[90]\nCox received crucial endorsements of Bob McDonnell and George Allen, the former of whom was the last statewide elected Republican (alongside Bill Bolling and Ken Cuccinelli) in Virginia prior to 2022. He was regarded by some as the establishment favorite heading into the convention.[91] Nonetheless, he finished fourth on the first voting round behind Glenn Youngkin, Pete Snyder, and Amanda Chase. Youngkin was nominated on the sixth round of voting.\nCandidates\n[edit]Nominated at convention\n[edit]- Glenn Youngkin, former co-CEO of The Carlyle Group[92]\nEliminated at convention\n[edit]-

The foundation had been run by Hillary and Bill Clinton, who are close allies to Terry McAuliffe.[138] On July 28, after discovering that Youngkin would participate in an 'election integrity' rally at Liberty University, McAuliffe declined a debate at the same university.[140] On August 2, Youngkin declined participation in The People's Debate.[141] The two candidates pledged to two debates; one on September 16 and one on September 28.[142]\nFirst debate\n[edit]Youngkin and McAuliffe met at Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Virginia on September 16, 2021, one day before early voting began.[143] The debate was hosted by USA Today Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page.[144]\nThe debate started with discussion over a recent COVID-19 mandate President Joe Biden signed requiring federal workers, employees of large companies, and contractors to be vaccinated.[145][146] Youngkin doubted if Biden had the power to authorize the mandate, and supported personal choice for receiving the vaccine. McAuliffe supported the mandate and accused Youngkin of spreading \"anti-vax\" rhetoric.[146] Youngkin denied the claim. McAuliffe also supported requiring vaccines for students over the age of 12.[147] McAuliffe has also repeatedly made false statements about COVID-19, often inflating the number of cases.[148]\nThe discussion moved to climate change, where Youngkin stated he would use all sources of energy to address climate change without \"putting [the] entire energy grid at risk for political purposes.\" McAuliffe called for clean energy in the state by 2035 and stressed the idea for the state to be a production hub.[142]\nThe discussion then moved to abortion, specifically the recent Texas Heartbeat Act signed by Texas governor Greg Abbott (who endorsed Youngkin).[149] When asked whether or not Youngkin would sign a similar bill, Youngkin stated that he would not sign the bill, and that he was anti-abortion and supports exclusions in cases such as rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is endangered. He also stated he supports a \"pain-threshold\" bill that would ban most abortions at the point when a fetus can feel pain, which proponents of this type of law define as 20 weeks.[142] In addition, Youngkin stated McAuliffe was \"the most extreme pro-abortion candidate in America today\".[149] In response to Youngkin, McAuliffe stated he was a \"brick wall\" on women's rights and would protect a woman's decision over abortion and supports reducing the number of doctors needed to certify a third-trimester abortion from three to one.[149]\nThe next discussion topic was over election integrity. After supporting an \"Election Integrity Taskforce\", Youngkin stated he does not believe there has been \"significant fraud\", and stated the issue of fraud as \"a democracy issue\". Youngkin stressed that he believes that \"Joe Biden's our president\" and criticized the withdrawal from Afghanistan. McAuliffe took note of Donald Trump's endorsement of Youngkin, calling him a \"Trump wannabe\".[146] Both candidates stated they would concede the election if the other came out on top.[149]\nThe final discussion topic was over the economy. McAuliffe attacked Youngkin on his top economic advisor, Stephen Moore, who advised Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Youngkin defended Virginia's right-to-work law.[149]\nSecond debate\n[edit]Youngkin and McAuliffe met at the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce on September 28, 2021.[150] The event was hosted by Chuck Todd, moderator of NBC's Meet the Press. Less than a week before the debate, one of the panelists, Michael Fauntroy, withdrew from the debate after tweets against the GOP and Evangelicals were found.[151]\nOn the discussion topic of COVID-19, Youngkin and McAuliffe reiterated their stances on the vaccines. Youngkin stated he believed in mandates for vaccines for diseases measles, mumps and rubella, but not for COVID-19, saying that \"the data associated with those vaccines is something that we should absolutely understand the difference between this vaccine.\"[152] Youngkin said people should get vaccinated against COVID-19.[152]\nDuring the debate, Youngkin noted that Trump was regularly mentioned by McAuliffe, who again called Youngkin a \"Trump wannabe.\"[152][153] When asked, Youngkin stated he would support Trump if he were to become the Republican nominee in 2024.[153]\nApproximately 15 minutes into the debate, third party candidate Princess Blanding, who was in the audience, disrupted the debate, screaming that her exclusion from the debate was \"unfair\" and claiming that McAuliffe would not win the election.[154] After being escorted out by security, she claimed that being excluded from the debate was racist and sexist, and that it constituted \"censorship\".[155]\nYoungkin asserted that McAuliffe had vetoed legislation that would have required schools to inform parents about sexually explicit content in educational materials.[156][157] McAuliffe defended his veto, saying: \"'I'm not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decision... I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach'\".[158][159][157] McAuliffe received criticism for these remarks,[160][161] and Youngkin used his comments to create an attack ad.[162][163] Following the election, Newsweek described McAuliffe's remarks as \"a major factor in the race\".[164]\nPredictions\n[edit]| Source | Ranking | As of |\n|---|---|---|\n| The Cook

city)\n- Surry (no municipalities)\n- Virginia Beach (independent city)\nBy region and precinct\n[edit]By congressional district\n[edit]Youngkin won six of 11 congressional districts, including two that were held by Democratic U.S. representatives at the time. He also flipped Virginia's 2nd congressional district which was previously won by Ralph Northam in 2017.[307][308]\n| District | Youngkin | McAuliffe | Blanding | Representative |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1st | 58.6% | 40.7% | 0.7% | Rob Wittman |\n| 2nd | 53.7% | 45.5% | 0.8% | Elaine Luria |\n| 3rd | 37.0% | 61.9% | 1.1% | Bobby Scott |\n| 4th | 42.6% | 55.9% | 1.5% | Donald McEachin |\n| 5th | 59.7% | 39.7% | 0.6% | Bob Good |\n| 6th | 66.0% | 33.3% | 0.7% | Ben Cline |\n| 7th | 55.0% | 44.3% | 0.7% | Abigail Spanberger |\n| 8th | 26.8% | 72.5% | 0.8% | Don Beyer |\n| 9th | 74.6% | 24.8% | 0.8% | Morgan Griffith |\n| 10th | 47.4% | 52.0% | 0.6% | Jennifer Wexton |\n| 11th | 32.6% | 66.6% | 0.8% | Gerry Connolly |\nAnalysis\n[edit]Youngkin won the election, 50.6% to 48.6%.[2][309] The margin of victory was the narrowest margin in a Virginia gubernatorial election since 1989. McAuliffe conceded the day after the election and congratulated Youngkin, saying he was \"proud\" to campaign \"for the values we so deeply believe in\".[310][311] Republicans also flipped the lieutenant governor and attorney general races that were held concurrently,[312] as well as took control of the Virginia House of Delegates. This election, as well as the concurrent elections for lieutenant governor and attorney general, marked the first time since the 1969 gubernatorial election that a Republican won Virginia without Loudoun County, and the first time since the 1960 presidential election that a Republican won statewide without Prince William County. This is the first time Surry County backed the Republican candidate since John Warner's largely uncontested re-election in 2002 and the first time Prince Edward County or Northampton County voted Republican since 2009. This is also the first time any Virginia statewide candidate has won without at least one of the three Northern Virginia counties of Loudoun, Prince William, Fairfax, or the independent cities therein. Over 3.28 million votes were cast, exceeding the 2017 gubernatorial election total by roughly 625,000 and exceeding all other previous Virginia gubernatorial elections by over a million.\nYoungkin's victory is attributed to the \"Youngkin coalition\" of largely Trump supporters and suburbanites which contributed to a Republican victory in the state.[313][314][315] The appeal to suburban voters, who have shifted away from the Republican Party as Donald Trump increasingly influenced it, was attributed to Youngkin's distancing from Trump and hesitancy to openly embrace him.[314] Youngkin's performance in the suburbs near Washington, D.C. were stronger than that of Trump's margins in the 2020 United States presidential election.[17] During the final days preceding the general election held on November 2, Youngkin campaigned in the Washington metropolitan area suburbs of Northern Virginia.[316] Previous similar attempts to combine a coalition of Trump supporters and suburban voters, including Ed Gillespie's run for governor in 2017, were met with failure.[317] Youngkin's victory was consistent with gubernatorial candidates of the opposing party as the incumbent president usually winning in Virginia, with the notable exception of McAuliffe's victory in 2013.\nVoter demographics\n[edit]Voter demographic data was collected by CNN. The voter survey is based on exit polls completed by voters in person as well as by phone.[318]\n| Demographic subgroup | Youngkin | McAuliffe | % of total vote |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Ideology | |||\n| Liberals | 6 | 93 | 23 |\n| Moderates | 39 | 60 | 41 |\n| Conservatives | 93 | 7 | 36 |\n| Party | |||\n| Democrats | 4 | 96 | 36 |\n| Republicans | 97 | 3 | 34 |\n| Independents | 54 | 45 | 30 |\n| Gender | |||\n| Men | 56 | 44 | 48 |\n| Women | 46 | 53 | 52 |\n| Race/ethnicity | |||\n| White | 62 | 38 | 73 |\n| Black | 13 | 86 | 16 |\n| Latino | 32 | 66 | 5 |\n| Asian | 33 | 67 | 3 |\n| Gender by race | |||\n| White men | 66 | 34 | 36 |\n| White women | 57 | 43 | 37 |\n| Black men | 13 | 86 | 7 |\n| Black women | 14 | 86 | 9 |\n| Latino men (of any race) | N/A | N/A | 2 |\n| Latino women (of any race) | 23 | 75 | 3 |\n| Other racial/ethnic groups | 38 | 62 | 5 |\n| Age | |||\n| 18–24 years old | 47 | 52 | 5 |\n| 25–29 years old | 43 | 54 | 5 |\n| 30–39 years old | 47 | 53 | 13 |\n| 40–49 years old | 51 | 48 | 18 |\n| 50–64 years old | 52 | 48 | 34 |\n| 65 and older | 55 | 45 | 26 |\n| 2020 presidential vote | |||\n| Biden | 5 | 95 | 48 |\n| Trump | 98 | 2 | 44 |\n| Education | |||\n| Never attended college | 61 | 38 | 15 |\n| Some college education | 58 | 41 | 24 |\n| Associate degree | 58 | 42 | 12 |\n| Bachelor's degree | 44 | 55 | 25 |\n| Advanced degree | 40 | 60 | 24 |\n| Education by race | |||\n| White college graduates | 47 | 52 | 37 |\n| White no college degree | 76 | 24 | 36 |\n| Non-white college graduates | 25 | 75 | 11 |\n| Non-white no college degree | 20 | 79 | 15 |\n| Education by gender/race | |||\n| White women with college degrees | 39 | 61 | 18 |\n| White women without college degrees | 74 | 25 | 19 |\n| White men with college degrees | 55 | 44 | 19 |\n| White men without college degrees | 78 | 22 | 17 |\n| Non-white | 22 | 77 | 27 |\n| Issue regarded as most important | |||\n| Taxes | 68 | 32 | 15 |\n| Economy | 55 | 44 | 33 |\n| Education | 53 | 47 | 24 |\n| Coronavirus | 16 | 84 | 15 |\n| Abortion | 58 | 41 | 8 |\n| Abortion should be | |||\n| Legal | 26 | 73 | 58 |\n| Illegal | 87 | 13 | 37 |\n| Region | |||\n| DC Suburbs | 36 | 64 | 29 |\n| Central Virginia | 59 | 40 | 18 |\n| Hampton Roads | 46 | 54 | 15 |\n| Richmond/Southside | 50 | 50 | 18 |\n| Mountain | 70 | 30 | 20 |\n| Area type | |||\n| Urban | 32 | 67 | 21 |\n| Suburban | 53 | 46 | 60 |\n| Rural | 63 | 36 | 19 |\nSee also\n[edit]- 2021 United States gubernatorial elections\n- 2021 Virginia Attorney General election\n- 2021 Virginia elections\n- 2021 Virginia House of Delegates election\n- 2021 Virginia lieutenant gubernatorial election\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ a b c d Key:\nA – all adults\nRV – registered voters\nLV – likely voters\nV – unclear - ^ Carter registered as an Independent in 2022, but was a Democrat when making the endorsement.\n- ^ Calculated by taking the difference of 100% and all other candidates combined.\n- ^ a b c d e f Blanding with 2%\n- ^ a b c d e Blanding with 1%\n- ^ Blanding with 3%; \"Would not vote\" and \"None of these\" with 1%\n- ^ \"Neither\" with 2%; \"Would not vote\" with 1%\n- ^ Blanding with 1%; \"Would not vote\" and \"None of these\" with 0%\n- ^ \"Would not vote\" and \"Neither\" with 0%\n- ^ Blanding with 5%\n- ^ a b c Weighted toward more low-propensity voters\n- ^ a b c Weighted toward fewer low-propensity voters\n- ^ Blanding with 1%; Other with 1%\n- ^ Blanding with 2%; \"None/Would not vote\" with 5%; \"other/write-in\" with 1%\n- ^ Blanding with 2%; \"None/Would not vote\" and \"other/write-in\" with 1%\n- ^ a b c d Blanding with 3%\n- ^ Blanding with 2%; Other with 1%\n- ^ Regions defined in The Washington Post.[306]\nPartisan clients\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Carroll Foy's campaign\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by McClellan's campaign\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by the Democratic Governors Association\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Youngkin's campaign\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by WTTG\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Winsome Sears's campaign for Lieutenant Governor\n- ^ a b This poll was sponsored by the Presidential Coalition\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Power for Tomorrow\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Protect Our Care\n- ^ a b c This poll was sponsored by Youngkin's campaign\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by the Virginia League of Conservation Voters\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Crooked Media\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Future Majority\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by Conservatives for Clean Energy – VA\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by the American Principles Project\n- ^ This poll was sponsored by CNalysis\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Republican Glenn Youngkin is leading in Virginia governor race.

But I can tell you with certainty it would have a devastating impact on our economy.\"\nWhile PolitiFact concedes that the senator is right on that former: scientists can't tell us what impact cap and trade would have on climate change; they took a look at what Rubio called it's \"devastating impact\" on the economy. The finding?\n\"We rated his statement 'False' based on that part of it,\" PolitiFact Florida's Josh Gillin said. \"These studies are all over the map really in terms of how they're going to effect the economy - maybe not to the same degree, but there also is no telling how something would work unless you had a specific policy in place.\"\n\"What we found is when we looked at programs in places like California and New England and Europe, the predictions beforehand that the sky would fall if we these cap and trade were put into place really didn't seem to turn out that way,\" Gillin added. \"In these places, there's just a minor effect on those regional economies - a few hundred dollars per family, some analysis say.

Carbon pricing works by charging emitters for the tons of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂) for which they are responsible. CO₂ is emitted largely through the combustion of fossil fuels used for electricity generation, industrial production, transportation, and use of energy in residential and commercial buildings.\n2021 United States Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy Consumption by Sector\nComparing Carbon Taxes and Cap-And-Trade Programs\nCarbon pricing policies traditionally take two forms: carbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs.\nA carbon tax is a price set per ton of carbon or, more commonly, per ton of CO₂ emitted. Because CO₂ emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are proportional to the carbon content of the fuel, a carbon tax is, in effect, a tax on CO₂. A $1 tax per ton of CO₂ is equal to a $3.7 tax per ton of carbon, because carbon constitutes roughly 3/11 of the weight of CO₂.\nA cap-and-trade program limits the total amount of CO₂ that can be emitted by certain facilities. In a cap-and-trade program, the government issues a limited number of emissions allowances (also known as permits), each of which grants the holder the right to emit one ton of CO₂. Allowances can be distributed in a number of ways: they can be directly allocated to firms or facilities (a concept called free allocation of allowances) or sold through auction markets. The limited, government-controlled supply of allowances “caps” the total amount of emissions. Allowances can be traded, and the sales and purchases (supply and demand) of allowances yield a market price for allowances—essentially the price of one ton of CO₂ emissions.\nSome cap-and-trade programs include provisions for the banking and borrowing of allowances over time: permits issued in one year can be submitted to account for emissions in later years (banking), and permits for future years can be issued and used in the current year (borrowing). When banking and borrowing take place, emissions during a specific year may be greater or less than the number of allowances issued in that year, but over time, the emissions and allowances are balanced. Banking and borrowing gives firms more flexibility in methods of compliance and reduce the costs of meeting a cumulative emissions target.\nCarbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs primarily differ by the type of certainty they provide. Carbon taxes provide price certainty, as entities subject to the tax know how much they’ll have to pay per ton emitted—but simply setting a tax rate doesn’t guarantee any particular level of emissions reductions. Cap-and-trade programs, on the other hand, set a cap on emissions and therefore provide quantity certainty—but price fluctuations under the trading market structure can provide a less solid basis for business planning decisions. Hybrid systems, however, can be used to reduce price or emissions uncertainty. Under cap-and-trade programs, price floors and ceilings have been proposed and utilized to prevent prices from being “too low” or “too high.” Carbon taxes can also be designed to automatically adjust if actual emissions miss some predetermined emissions path.\nBenefits of Carbon Pricing\nCarbon pricing policies—carbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs alike—have several attributes that make them generally more efficient, or less costly, than other potential policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (such as technology mandates, direct regulations, subsidies to zero-carbon energy sources, and others). A few of these key attributes are discussed below.\nFlexibility\nCarbon pricing allows firms to choose the most efficient method to reduce (or not to reduce) emissions in response to the carbon price. Under other policies, such as technology mandates, a regulator chooses a single method for a wide set of firms. Such one-size-fits-all approaches may lead to unnecessarily costly reductions for some firms if cheaper methods to reduce emissions exist.\nEqual Marginal Costs of Abatement\nAn economy-wide carbon price applies a uniform price on CO₂ emissions regardless of the source. As a result, the marginal abatement costs (the costs to firms of decreasing their emissions by one unit) are equalized across firms and sectors. This is a necessary condition for minimizing the overall costs of emissions reductions. Regulations often imply different marginal abatement costs across firms and sectors: if one sector has a regulation with very high marginal abatement costs, it may be more cost-effective to remove that regulation and impose more stringent regulations in sectors with lower abatement costs. In practice, it would be very difficult for regulators to accomplish this, but it is an inherent quality of carbon pricing.\nEncouraging Conservation\nA carbon price encourages individuals and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions more than conventional regulations. A conventional regulation (such as a performance standard) sets a strict limit on emissions per unit of output, but does not provide incentives to reduce overall demand. In contrast, carbon pricing provides incentives to reduce emissions per unit of output, but also charges a price for every additional ton of CO₂ that is not reduced through increased efficiency. Therefore, the price of carbon-intensive goods (i.e., electricity or gasoline) will likely be higher under a carbon price than under conventional regulations, which encourages individuals and businesses to reduce their demand (to the extent possible). Thus, a carbon price encourages more conservation than conventional regulations.\nRevenue\nA carbon price creates a new revenue stream that can be used in a number of ways. Revenue use can significantly affect the economic costs and political feasibility of a carbon pricing policy. This is discussed in more depth below.\nOptions for Carbon Pricing Design\nBeyond the choice between a tax and a cap, there are many policy options for how a carbon price would be applied in the economy, all of which have different impacts on overall cost, emissions reductions, revenues raised, and so on.\nPrice\nAccording to economic theory, emissions pricing produces the highest net benefits (environmental, health, and other benefits minus economic costs) when the carbon price is equal to the marginal damage of carbon emissions, or the damage caused by adding one additional ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This would be accomplished either by setting the carbon tax equal to the marginal damage or, under a cap-and-trade program, by capping emissions at a level that leads to an emissions allowance price equal to the marginal damage. This marginal damage is often called the social cost of carbon (SCC).\nNegative Externalities\nWhen private decision makers cause harm to an unrelated third party, that harm is called a negative externality. For example, if a power plant generates electricity and sells it to its customers, the pollution it emits in the process may affect the health of neighboring communities. The health effects of this pollution would be a negative externality of the power plant’s electricity generation and sale.\nArthur Pigou’s seminal 1920 book, The Economics of Welfare, introduced the idea of taxing negative externalities. In his book, Pigou showed that taxing a negative externality at a price equal to the marginal damage internalizes the externality and maximizes overall welfare.\nStringency\nPolicy stringency is determined by the level of the tax rate (under a carbon tax) or the level of the emissions cap (under cap and trade) and how they change over time. A $50 carbon tax is more stringent than a $10 carbon tax: it will lead to lower emissions and higher costs. In determining stringency, policymakers face a tradeoff between environmental goals and the costs of meeting those goals. In the United States, policy stringency is often framed relative to international agreements or temperature goals: policy A will meet the 2025 Paris targets or policy B will limit warming to 2 degrees.\nCoverage\nThe coverage of a carbon pricing policy determines which sectors of the economy and which emission types are covered by the carbon price. For example, the European Union Emissions Trading System cap-and-trade program covers CO₂, nitrous oxide (N₂O), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) emitted by 11,000 energy-intensive plants in the electric power and manufacturing sectors across 31 European countries. Overall, the policy covers about 40 percent of the EU’s greenhouse gases. In comparison, British Columbia’s carbon tax applies to the purchase and use of fossil fuels regardless of end-use sector, covering about 70 percent of provincial greenhouse gas emissions.\nPoint of Regulation\nThe point of regulation of a carbon price determines exactly who is required to submit permits or pay the tax to the government. An upstream carbon tax would tax fossil fuel producers for the carbon content (and hence ultimate CO₂ emissions) of their products. A midstream tax would tax the first purchaser of fossil fuels in the supply chain. For example, a midstream tax would require a refinery to pay for the carbon content of all the crude oil it purchases. A downstream tax applies to the emitter: for example, coal-fired generators, industrial users, or households and businesses that use gasoline in their vehicles or natural gas in their homes and businesses. The administrative cost of a carbon price can vary widely by the point of regulation, but ultimately a carbon price is passed on to consumers regardless of the point of regulation. To learn more about the economics of the point of regulation, see this report by economist Gilbert Metcalf.\nRevenue Use\nWith the exception of cap-and-trade programs that freely allocate allowances to firms, carbon pricing policies raise revenue. Both the overall economic costs and the distribution of those costs across segments of society are significantly determined by how the revenues are used. In this explainer, we take an in-depth look at the question of what to do with the revenues.\nOther\nCarbon pricing policies may include other design elements aimed at mitigating cost uncertainty under a cap-and-trade program or emissions uncertainty under a carbon tax, or reducing potential competitiveness issues under cap-and-trade programs or carbon taxes.\nCarbon Pricing Programs around the Globe\nAs of March 2022, the World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Dashboard highlights 65 carbon pricing initiatives implemented or scheduled for implementation, with 45 national jurisdictions and 34 subnational jurisdictions covered by those initiatives. In 2021, these initiatives would cover 11.65 gigatons of CO₂ equivalent, representing 21.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nAt the moment, the majority of global carbon prices take the form of cap-and-trade programs, the largest of which can be found in the European Union and the state of California. Carbon taxes are growing in popularity, however, and are now in place in the United Kingdom, several Canadian provinces, Sweden, and more.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Carbon Pricing 301: Advanced Topics in Carbon Pricing in the Electricity Sector\nHow can carbon pricing lower emissions in the power sector? This explainer gives an in-depth outline of the central factors.\nIn Carbon Pricing 201, we explore how carbon pricing in the electricity sector reduces emissions and affects generation mix, dispatch, and retail electricity prices. Like economy-wide carbon pricing, carbon pricing can be implemented in the electricity sector through a cap-and-trade program or a tax on carbon emissions. This explainer explores how each of these policies can be implemented, design considerations for policy effectiveness and fairness, and lessons from existing regional programs.\nCap and Trade\nOverview\nA carbon cap-and-trade program for the electricity sector places a mass-based cap on the aggregate carbon emissions from emitting power plants. The cap on carbon emissions gradually declines over time to increase the stringency of the policy. Cap-and-trade programs target a particular level of emissions and are thus a direct approach to achieving specific emission reduction goals.\nTo comply with the policy, plants must possess an allowance (essentially, a permit) for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted. The number of allowances available in the market is equal to the policy’s cap, and they can be traded between plants. In theory, plants with a lower cost of abatement (emissions reduction) relative to the market price for allowances will choose to reduce emissions in order to sell allowances, while those with a higher cost of abatement will choose to procure allowances. Thus, a cap-and-trade program is economically efficient because emissions reductions across the sector will come from plants that can reduce their emissions at the lowest cost.\nWhile the electricity sector is included in most existing cap-and-trade programs, some of those programs cover other sectors as well, including industrial plants and transportation. This is true of the California Cap-and-Trade Program, which covers power plants, industrial sources, and oil and gas distributors. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a regional cap-and-trade program consisting of ten northeastern states in the US (with Virginia joining in January of 2021), is the only program in the United States that exclusively caps emissions from the electricity sector. RGGI provides valuable lessons for designing a cap-and-trade program specifically for the power sector.\nUS Electricity Markets\nIn the United States, how electricity is bought and sold varies by region of the country. Electric utilities can be either regulated and operate as vertically integrated monopolies with oversight from state public utility commissions, or they can operate in deregulated markets where electric energy prices are set by the market with some federal oversight of wholesale market operations. These regulatory constructs determine how retail and wholesale electricity prices are set. To better understand the electricity market–related concepts discussed here in relation to carbon pricing, read “US Electricity Markets 101.”\nDesign Considerations\nAn electricity sector cap-and-trade program functions similarly to economy-wide cap-and-trade programs. However, there are a few key design elements that are particularly relevant for implementing such a policy for the power sector.\nAllowance Allocation\nThe initial distribution of allowances to plants can be done either through an auction (where plants competitively bid for allowances) or through free distribution to certain plants (which can then trade them as they wish). Free distribution of allowances can be done in a number of different ways, but an important choice is whether the free allocation is based on a fixed measure, such as production or emissions at a plant for a specific year in the past, or on a changing metric, such as current or recent generation levels. The impacts of the policy on electricity prices for consumers, costs for producers, and society overall can vary depending on the allowance allocation method used and the regulation of electricity markets in the region. [Note: This explainer refers to several key concepts related to electricity markets. To learn more, please read “US Electricity Markets 101,” as the concepts are not necessarily defined or explained here.]\nFor power plants in a deregulated region with competitive wholesale power markets, a cap-and-trade policy with either auction allocation or free distribution based on a fixed measure leads to similar electricity price effects. The reason for this similarity is that in competitive markets, generators account for the value of allowances in calculating the offers that they bid into wholesale markets, regardless of how they obtained the allowance. Thus, even if they acquired the allowance for free, its value is factored into their bids. Otherwise, it would have made more economic sense to produce less electricity and sell the allowances rather than to use them to cover the emissions from producing electricity. The main difference between free distribution and an auction is that with free allowances, the value of the allowances accrues to generators in the form of potential windfall profits because a key input was obtained for free. With an auction, the value accrues to the government entity that runs the auction.\nIf allowances are allocated for free based on recent output, the effect on electricity prices is reduced. This approach to distributing allowances provides an incentive for generators to produce and sell more electricity to earn a greater share of allowances. As a consequence of this incentive, generators lower their bids in electricity markets to encourage more sales and electricity consumers see smaller electricity rate impacts.\nBy contrast, for power plants in rate-regulated jurisdictions with a cap-and-trade program in place, the value of emissions allowances is not included in the cost basis for plants’ average cost rates if the allowances are given for free because free allowances have a cost of zero to the utility. As a result, the price of allowances is included in the cost of service that forms the basis for average cost prices only if the allowances are auctioned. As a consequence, the price of electricity for consumers tends to increase more under an auction approach than under a free allocation approach.\nCost Containment\nWhile cap-and-trade programs provide certainty for the quantity of emissions reductions, the cost of achieving those reductions can fluctuate because the price for allowances is determined through a market. Mechanisms can be built into an electricity-sector cap-and-trade program in order to prevent program costs from rising too high. One example is a cost containment reserve (CCR) that establishes a soft price ceiling for allowance prices in order to control program costs. If the market price for allowances rises above a certain threshold, the cost containment reserve is triggered, and a limited number of additional allowances is released into the market to keep the price from rising further. A cost containment reserve is a feature of both RGGI and the California Cap-and-Trade Program. Another mechanism, a hard price cap, sets a maximum price for allowances in a market, essentially translating the cap and trade market into a carbon tax at the cap price level. California is implementing a hard price cap starting in 2021.\nPrice-Responsive Allowance Supply\nOne drawback of cap-and-trade programs is that the cap serves as a ceiling for emissions reductions in that area. For instance, a sub-jurisdiction, such as a state or city, within a larger region that has a cap-and-trade program might attempt to impose additional measures to reduce emissions. This additional policy or program can reduce demand for allowances, freeing up allowances to be used elsewhere in the larger regulated region. As a result of this “waterbed effect,” one sub-jurisdiction’s efforts to reduce emissions has no effect on the overall emissions of the entire regulated region.\nOne example of this effect would be if one state within the RGGI region decided to take additional action to reduce emissions beyond the basic requirements of RGGI; for example, it might implement policies that support renewable energy or additional restrictions on emissions from generators within its borders. However, doing so would lead to decreased demand for allowances from generators within the state, and the extra allowances would become available for generators in other states within RGGI to purchase. As a result, these other states would be able to pollute more than they otherwise would have, thereby offsetting the benefits of one state reducing emissions through other policies.\nOne mechanism that helps to mitigate the waterbed effect is a price floor, also known as an auction reserve price, that prevents the allowance price from dropping below a certain price threshold and is a design feature in both RGGI and California’s Cap-and-Trade program. In RGGI and in CA, if the price floor is hit due to low demand for allowances, then the auctioneers withhold allowances from the market until the price rebounds above the floor. This feature can mitigate the waterbed effect by reducing the number of allowances in the market, which thus enables more ambitious emissions reductions from other policy measures when allowance prices are near the floor.\nA natural extension of the price floor and another way to mitigate the waterbed effect and to promote emissions reductions from these additional policy measures is to implement a price-responsive supply of allowances whereby the level of the emissions cap depends on the market price of allowances. In RGGI, this type of price-responsive supply mechanism is called an emissions containment reserve (ECR). This mechanism ties the number of allowances available in the market (and thus, the amount of emissions permitted within the policy’s jurisdiction) to the allowance price. As demand and prices for allowances fall, a certain number of allowances would be withheld from the market. Burtraw and colleagues (2017) modeled the impacts of an ECR in RGGI and found that an ECR can be used to lessen the waterbed effect. Burtraw and colleagues (2020) consider what factors can affect the design of a price responsive supply curve that limits variability in allowance prices and allowance revenues with uncertainty about compliance costs.\nThe effects of the cost containment reserve, price floor, and emissions containment reserve are shown in the figure below. In Figure 1A, a drop in demand for allowances, perhaps resulting from sub-jurisdictional actions to reduce emissions beyond the cap, only lowers the cost of allowances while the emissions remain unchanged. However, as Figure 1B shows, the use of an Emissions Containment Reserve reduces the number of allowances in the market in response to a drop in price, thus enabling additional emissions reductions. The price floor has a similar effect on allowance supply but the quantity of allowances potentially removed from the market is not limited in advance. Instead the auction only removes any allowances necessary to keep the price at the price floor. Lastly, the cost containment reserve is shown in both figures and represents the price at which more allowances would be released into the market in order to contain costs.\nFigure 1. Effects of Cost Containment Reserves, Price Floors, and Emissions Containment Reserves in Power Sector Cap and Trade\nLeakage\nCap-and-trade policies can lead to increased emissions in regions not covered by the policy, which is called emissions leakage. Emissions leakage can reduce the effectiveness of a regional policy by offsetting some emissions reductions in the capped region with increases in emissions outside of the capped region.\nA regional policy can increase wholesale electricity prices in the covered region relative to prices in other neighboring regions. As a result, the capped region may end up importing cheaper power from neighboring regions not subject to an emissions cap, and this power may be generated by carbon-intensive generating resources. Leakage occurs when capped and uncapped regions trade electricity or in wholesale markets where some of the plants are subject to a policy while others are not (e.g. if small generators are exempt from the cap).\nRGGI, for example, has experienced some leakage to non-RGGI states. Since its creation in 2009, total carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation in the RGGI region have dropped by over 35 percent. However, some of these reductions have been offset by emissions increases in non-RGGI states, particularly those that participate in the PJM regional wholesale electricity market. Because RGGI and non-RGGI generators in these states compete in the same wholesale power markets, those subject to the RGGI cap are more likely to have higher costs and operate at a competitive disadvantage, and therefore generators outside of RGGI are more likely to clear the market. In the case of RGGI, leakage to neighboring states Ohio and Pennsylvania resulted in a nearly 50 percent leakage rate, meaning that the policy led to an increase in emissions outside of the RGGI region that was equal to almost half as much of the emissions reductions that the policy achieved.\nDesign mechanisms can mitigate leakage to some extent. One solution is a border adjustment, which requires electricity imports to be subject to the cap. Another solution is a production incentive that distributes free allowances to polluting resources that are subject to a cap. The purpose of this method is to encourage these resources to bid lower in energy markets and thus be more competitive relative to imported electricity from polluting sources. Palmer et al. (2017) found that by providing existing natural gas generators with free allowances based on electricity production, 70 percent of emissions leakage could be avoided.\nA third approach would be to expand the footprint of the cap and trade program, which would reduce the risk of leakage as more areas are covered by the cap. Such an expansion is already underway for RGGI; Virginia will join RGGI in 2021, and efforts are currently underway to develop a cap and trade program for generators in Pennsylvania that will link to the RGGI program.\nUse of Revenue\nA cap-and-trade program that uses an auction design raises revenue, and this revenue can be used to lessen the policy’s burden on lower-income households or improve the emissions performance of the policy. A cap-and-trade program increases electricity prices, which can have a disproportionate impact on lower-income households that spend a higher portion of their income on energy expenditures. Revenue raised from an auction, however, can be used to lessen the burden on lower-income households by offsetting electricity price effects or providing lump sum refunds to households (which is done in California with a portion of the allowance revenue). Revenue can also further the goals of the program if invested in clean technologies or energy efficiency measures, which can lead to lower costs and additional emissions reductions (possible with price-responsive supply) or to less leakage due to lower demand for imported power.\nAs of September 2020, RGGI auctions have raised over $3.7 billion since the program began in 2008. The use of these revenues for energy efficiency improvements, direct bill assistance, investment in renewables and selected other purposes has generated an estimated $4.7 billion in economic value for the RGGI states and has helped further reduce carbon emissions in the region (Hibbard et al, 2018).\nCarbon Tax\nOverview\nA power sector carbon tax places a tax on emissions from the use of carbon-emitting fossil fuels for electricity generation. Unlike a cap-and-trade program, which provides certainty of emissions reductions at a market-determined allowance price, a carbon tax provides price stability but uncertainty regarding the quantity of actual emissions reductions.\nBecause a carbon tax sets an emissions price rather than a quantity, it can avoid some issues associated with cap-and-trade programs. For example, a carbon tax avoids the waterbed effect because all polluting entities are subject to the price, and therefore additional emissions reduction efforts by some entities will not affect the actions of others. However, like a cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax can lead to leakage, though similar solutions (like a border adjustment mechanism) are available for addressing it. The NY Independent System Operator (NYISO) has proposed a carbon tax for electricity generators within its region.\nDesign Considerations\nSetting the Tax\nTheoretically, an efficient carbon tax should be set to reflect the damages caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, more commonly referred to as the social cost of carbon. However, the social cost of carbon can be difficult to estimate and can vary depending on the method used. Additionally, in the United States, the social cost of carbon estimate is determined by a federal interagency working group, so the number has varied with the administration depending on the assumptions used.\nAnother method for setting the tax is to back-calculate a price that will achieve a certain target of emissions reductions. A few studies use this approach of calculating a price based on a specific emissions target (Kaufman et al 2020, Olsen et al 2018). The Olsen et al (2018) study in particular used specific information from ISO New England’s electrical system and fuel price data from the Energy Information Administration to determine the minimum tax rate needed to achieve a given level of emissions reductions and ran several sensitivities with varying assumptions regarding fuel mix. This nuanced approach can be useful for determining a tax rate for the power sector in a specific electricity market as it takes local constraints into account.\nIncreasing Emissions Reduction Certainty\nSimilar to the options available for flexibility in designing a cap-and-trade policy, a carbon tax can also be designed flexibly to accommodate changes in the market. For example, a tax adjustment mechanism is a design option for a carbon tax where the tax automatically adjusts up or down in response to changes in emissions reductions. If the policy is not achieving the intended level of reductions, then the carbon tax would automatically adjust upward to encourage more abatement.\nUse of Revenue\nA carbon tax on power sector emissions raises the price of electricity, and this price increase disproportionately impacts lower-income households since these households spend a larger fraction of their income on electricity than high-income households (Goulder et al., 2019). Whether the overall policy impact is regressive or progressive largely depends on how carbon revenues are used. Returning revenues through lump-sum dividends (either to all households or targeted to low-income households) is a progressive use of revenues and in some cases makes lower income households better off than they would be without the policy (the dividend payments are higher than their increase in costs). RFF’s Carbon Pricing Calculator shows how different proposed economy wide carbon taxes would affect people in different income groups. If revenue is recycled to assist lower-income households, the calculator shows that many households in lower quintiles can actually be better off with a carbon tax than without. While this tool is for economy-wide carbon pricing, effects of revenue targeting would likely be similar for an electricity-only policy.\nFor the electricity sector specifically, one option is to allocate the revenue back to utilities. To some extent, this method mitigates the effect of carbon pricing on consumers because it leads to smaller increases in electricity rates. This is the method that the New York Independent System Operator proposed for its electricity market carbon pricing proposal.\nOther Considerations for a Power Sector–Only Policy\nWhile a carbon pricing policy can significantly reduce carbon emissions from the power sector, efforts to decarbonize other sectors of the economy through electrification could be negatively impacted by a power sector–only policy. For example, if electric vehicles are subject to a carbon price through electricity usage but gasoline vehicles are not, the policy could discourage switching from gasoline to electric cars. If a power sector–only policy is implemented, this effect could be addressed through measures such as by exempting electric vehicles from the carbon tax or using the carbon tax revenue to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. However, on the whole, an economy-wide carbon price (which includes the power sector) would be more effective for addressing total emissions than a power sector–only policy.\nAnother unresolved issue is the role of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in oversight of carbon pricing. To the extent the carbon pricing policies are administered by states, FERC has largely not played a role in direct oversight. As carbon policies get more ambitious and costs increase, the effects of carbon pricing on transactions in multi-state wholesale power markets that include states with and states without carbon pricing will pose challenges to those markets. These differences across states will also challenge the environmental efficacy of the state policies due to emissions leakage. In such situations, FERC may be called upon to address inconsistencies in state policies that impact its markets through imposition of border charges or other mechanisms. In addition, if regional grid operators decide to advance carbon pricing within their wholesale energy markets, as the New York Independent System Operator has proposed, then FERC will have some jurisdiction over these policies and oversight of their design.\nConclusion\nReducing carbon emissions from the power sector is critical for mitigating climate change. Pricing carbon through a tax or cap-and-trade program can efficiently encourage a transition to a cleaner electricity system by promoting the use of cleaner fuels and the conservation of energy.\nRegional cap-and-trade programs have successfully reduced emissions from the US electricity sector, and these programs provide useful lessons for future policies. Some policy proposals, like New York’s proposed carbon price in wholesale energy markets, could also be useful for understanding how a power sector–focused carbon tax could work.\nWhile regions have experimented with carbon prices, national carbon pricing has yet to materialize despite numerous proposals at the federal level. In the absence of a federal policy, another option for reducing carbon emissions from the electricity sector is a power-sector policy called a clean energy standard (CES), which is similar to a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policy that more than half of US states currently use. A CES is a technology-neutral portfolio standard that requires a certain percentage of electricity sales to come from “clean”, or low or zero-carbon, resources, and its crediting system can mimic design features of carbon pricing without directly pricing carbon. More information on a CES can be found here.\nSources\n- Burtraw, D., Palmer, K. L., Bharvirkar, R., & Paul, A. (2001).

We focused on turnover because teacher attrition from the profession comprises about 90% of annual teacher demand, and drives many of the shortages we see today, particularly in high-need schools across the country where turnover can reach 30% or more annually. One of our goals was to point out that solving these shortages cannot rest on recruitment alone, since high rates of turnover quickly undo schools’ efforts to bring in new hires. Another goal was to analyze the conditions associated with turnover to inform policy strategies to reduce the “leaky bucket” plaguing many districts.\nIn a recent blog in The 74, Chad Aldeman questioned our findings and the severity of the problem, suggesting that this emphasis might generate “too many … generic efforts to boost teacher retention, like districtwide pay increases.” A week later, in an opinion piece in The 74 , Mike Antonucci argued that teacher turnover is not a problem because it is, on average, lower than quit rates in some other occupations. He, too, protested what he called “generic solutions” and suggested that focusing on turnover rates is a “frightening” scare tactic.\nAntonucci also pointed to the National Council on Teaching Quality's (NCTQ) efforts to rebut teacher shortages. NCTQ claims the shortages must be a fiction, largely because the size of the teaching force is growing: “How could we have shortages if we’re hiring more teachers?” NCTQ's Kate Walsh argues. Never mind that more than 100,000 vacancies have been filled by substitutes and untrained individuals because qualified teachers cannot be found to work where they are needed. Indeed, in our teacher shortage report last year, we accurately estimated this growth in the teaching force, which was why we predicted growing shortages, given the declines in entry rates to the profession.\nWe find these arguments puzzling at best. Our research on teacher shortages and the turnover that contributes to them has always emphasized that these conditions vary across teaching fields, types of schools, and locations. We document how they are more problematic in some regions, states, and districts than others; more widespread in particular subjects; and most pronounced in schools that serve students of color and those from low-income families.\nWe have highlighted research-based policy strategies that can address different contexts and needs, based on findings comparing recruitment and retention outcomes across places where turnover rates differ. By definition, this means that neither the problems nor the need for policy action are the same across settings. The goal is to help policymakers who care about the plight of all students to make better, more cost-effective investments where they are needed.\n30 percent\nHow much less, on average, U.S. teachers are paid compared to other college graduates.Source: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\nIt seems our focus on teacher turnover and shortages disturbs those who worry that solutions to problems might become “generic” (i.e., widespread)—that states and districts might get carried away and make unwarranted investments in teachers’ training, compensation, or working conditions to create a more qualified and equitably distributed teaching force. Of course, there are some highly stable places with strong salaries and working conditions that don’t need reform. But overall, teaching conditions here compare poorly with those of other nations. Unlike teachers in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries whose salaries are, on average, comparable to those of other college graduates, U.S. teachers are paid 30% less on average than other college graduates.\nU.S. teachers’ wages have declined relative to those of other college-educated workers since the early 1990s, when they were at their most competitive. While salaries vary significantly across and within states, a recent report showed that, in more than 30 states, the average teacher heading a family of four would qualify for several forms of government assistance.\nFurthermore, U.S. teachers teach the greatest number of hours per week of countries in a recent OECD survey and have among the lowest number of hours for planning. They also have above-average class sizes and teach more low-income students than teachers in the other higher-achieving OECD countries.\nIn this response, we address three areas of concern: 1) Whether and how teacher turnover matters, 2) Whether turnover varies in ways that are amenable to policies; and 3) What kinds of policy strategies may make a difference.\nHow Teacher Turnover Matters\nAldeman agrees that teacher turnover matters, noting that “churn, in general, is a problem, particularly for disadvantaged students.” At the same time, he argues that turnover rates may not be all that high, are lower in public schools than private schools, and may not be related to the policies we highlight—arguments we address in the sections below.\nHigh turnover undermines student achievement\nAldeman recognizes, as do we, that the most important reason that teacher turnover matters is its impact on students. Research shows that high teacher turnover rates in schools negatively impact student achievement for all the students in a school, not just those in a new teacher’s classroom.\nThese rates are highest in schools serving low-income students and students of color. Constant churn exacerbates staffing difficulties that lead to shortages. Thus, students in these hard-to-staff schools disproportionately suffer the consequences of both turnover and shortages: substitute teachers, canceled classes, and inexperienced, underprepared teachers. Office for Civil Rights data show that districts serving children of color are about four times more likely to be assigned uncertified teachers.\nTurnover imposes significant financial costs\nTurnover also extracts a significant financial cost. Research shows that teacher replacement costs, including expenses related to separation, recruitment, hiring, and training, can range from an average of $9,000 per teacher in rural districts to more than $20,000 in urban districts. A 2007 study estimated a national cost of over $7 billion a year, a price tag that would exceed $8 billion today. In high turnover settings, it’s important to consider what else these dollars could buy—including teacher mentoring and learning opportunities to increase effectiveness—if they weren’t being spent on filling the leaky bucket each year.\nIn Their Own Words\nAt a recent LPI event, district and state policymakers, students, and researchers described the ways in which teacher turnover affects students, schools, communities, and states, and what must be done to solve it.\nTurnover undermines quality especially when there is an inadequate supply\nIf the supply of highly qualified teachers were plentiful, we might feel no need to worry about turnover, even if it is high and costly. That is not the case currently. In most states, headlines and data about the effects of shortages—especially in the fields of math and science, special education, and teachers of English learners—are commonplace. Data also show that shortages reach to other fields in the highest-need districts.\nIn our 2016 report on teacher shortages, which projected supply and demand trends based on several national databases, we estimated that U.S. schools could be short 100,000 qualified teachers by 2017 if policy trends did not change significantly. This estimate appears close to today’s reality. A recent LPI review of state teacher workforce reports reveals that, in the 36 states that reported such data in 2016 or 2017, at least 87,000 positions were not filled by a fully certified teacher. Assuming the same rates of shortages in the remaining states , the national total of uncertified teachers would be approximately 109,000. This number understates total shortages because some states only report uncertified teachers in core academic areas, and because districts also address shortages by canceling courses, increasing class sizes, or hiring substitute teachers. For example, Florida does not report uncertified teacher counts, but reported 6,628 unfilled vacancies at the start of 2017-18.\nSolving shortages is much more difficult if turnover rates remain high, as roughly 9 of 10 teachers hired each year are replacing colleagues who left teaching, two-thirds of them having quit before retirement. When shortages exist, recruiting costs increase—as districts try to recruit from other states and countries and high-need teachers turn down many job offers to take the best one, usually from the most well-heeled district. In addition, the negative effects on student learning climb, as the band-aids to address vacant classrooms—substitutes, untrained staff, canceled classes, larger class sizes—undermine learning.\nSmall changes in turnover rates can have big effects on the adequacy of supply\nBut does the increase in turnover rates matter? Aldeman notes that attrition rates increased from 5.6% to 7.7% between 1988 and 2012. He characterizes this as an increase of only 2.1 percentage points, suggesting that such an increase is tiny. However, in a workforce of 3.8 million, this seemingly small amount adds 79,000 to the number of teachers needing to be hired each year, leaving a total of about 292,000 teachers to be hired annually. In fact, the swing in attrition rates has been even greater than that. This NCES report shows that, at its lowest point, in 1992, attrition was 5.1% annually. At its highest point, in 2008, it was 8.4%—an increase of about 60%. Although this represents “only” 3.3 percentage points, a return to this lower level of attrition would allow us to hire 125,000 fewer teachers—virtually ending today’s shortage conditions, with the exception of targeted needs in particular content areas. Small changes in the national attrition rate have a large impact on teacher labor markets.\nWhile multiple factors influence attrition rates, a recent analysis of wage trends shows that the lower attrition rates in the late 1980s and 1990s occurred when the gaps between teachers’ wages and those of other college graduates were at their smallest. The gaps have grown significantly since then.\nTeacher Turnover Rates Vary Substantially and Can Be Addressed by Policy\nAldeman suggests that policy may not be a cause or cure for turnover because turnover merely tracks the demographics of the teaching force, and anyway, private school leaving rates are higher than public school rates. But he does not address the policy implications of these observations.\nDemography is not destiny\nAldeman downplays the significance of increased attrition rates, arguing that they are mainly due to demographic patterns—the natural \"greening\" of the profession as newer teachers enter and veteran teachers retire. In 1988, the most common teacher was a veteran with 15 years’ experience; by 2012—the most recent year for which national data are available—the most common teacher was an early-career teacher in her fifth year.\nThis trend Aldeman points to is important, but he stops short of examining the implications of this situation. First, retirement represents only about one-third of overall annual attrition, and less than one-fourth in 30 states. Stemming the attrition of early and mid-career teachers can go a long way to reducing turnover and mitigating teacher shortages.\nSecond, it is not inevitable that beginners leave at high rates: Policies influence turnover. Beginning teacher attrition is higher for teachers who are underprepared and unmentored. Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) data indicate that teachers with little or no training leave at 2 to 3 times the rates of teachers with comprehensive preparation. Another survey—the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study—found that among teachers who entered in 2007-08, only 14.6% of those who were certified to teach left over the first five years, as compared to 30.2% of those who were uncertified when they entered.\nSimilarly, teachers who lack induction supports leave at about twice the rate of those who receive the highest-quality induction. However, the proportions of teachers receiving both sets of supports have been declining in recent years. In 2012, only two-thirds of entering teachers were prepared before they entered, and only 59% received support from a mentor and their principal in their initial year on the job, down from 75% in 2008. The problem feeds on itself. One reason some states and districts have seen heightened turnover in the teaching force is that they have not had policies in place that could retain beginners and stabilize the profession over time.\nPrivate schools have policies too\nAldeman also suggests that higher attrition at private schools \"throws a wrench\" into the idea that policies can influence turnover. However, evidence suggests that private and public school teachers leave for similar reasons. An NCES analysis indicates that private school teachers who left their schools reported less administrative support, lower satisfaction with salary, less control over classroom policies, and less input into school policies—the same issues raised by public school teachers.\nPrivate school teachers also earn significantly lower salaries, on average, than do public school teachers. Furthermore, high leaving rates are most pronounced for beginners, who—like public school teachers—leave more quickly when they are untrained. Our analysis of SASS data found that only about 40% of private school teachers in 2007 had completed the preparation and requirements for full state teaching certifications, as compared to about 90% of public school teachers. Thus, it is not surprising that attrition rates were higher.\nBut if one wanted to lower these rates, similar policy strategies would apply within organizations in that sector: improve administrative supports and/or salaries where they are inadequate, and support training and mentoring that allow teachers to become more competent and efficacious, which reduces attrition.\nVariable attrition indicates how policy matters\nAldeman’s analyses focus on changes in average turnover rates, but these averages mask enormous variations, which are themselves the result of differing policies. Currently, approximately 8% of teachers leave the profession annually and another 8% change schools, creating additional turnover at the school level. But annual teacher turnover rates range from 8% in Utah (where only 3% of teachers leave the profession entirely) to 24% in Arizona (where fully 15% of teachers leave the profession). Attrition is generally highest in the south and southwest, and lowest in the northeast, where several states have leaving rates of under 5%. It is generally higher in shortage fields and in schools serving more students of color and low-income students.\nThese variations are not just a function of chance or demographics. In a regression analysis that controlled for many student, teacher, and school factors—including teaching field and school composition—we found that teacher turnover was significantly higher for those less prepared to teach, in districts with lower salary schedules, and who reported low levels of administrative support.\n(The SASS 2012 data also listed pressures from testing and accountability policies as a reason 25% of teachers said they left. We reported this along with the other SASS findings, but did not include it in our recommendations, because we could not examine the issue further. Aldeman criticized our mention of this fact from the survey, incorrectly suggesting we had flagged it as a policy issue, and linked to a report which he said found otherwise. Although the report he cited found no increase in voluntary turnover associated with the accountability policies, it actually did find an increase in involuntary attrition associated with these policies—probably due to reconstitution and closure of schools—which is consistent with teachers’ reports that accountability policies were a reason that they left. Other research on test-based accountability also found that teachers left low-rated schools at disproportionately high rates. We mention this not to advocate for a policy related to this issue, but to point out the inaccurate treatment of our report and other research.)\nAnother argument Aldeman uses to try to dismiss teacher attrition concerns is that teaching has turnover rates like those of nurses and social workers—two other feminized professions that have long suffered from low wages—and argues, \"if policymakers are worried about teacher turnover and teacher shortages, they should be just as concerned with nursing turnover and nursing shortages.\"\nIndeed, such concerns are widespread among policymakers and have produced legislation focused on funding to build the nurse pipeline and support retention through service scholarships and funding for preparation programs, as well as improving working conditions.\nPolicy Solutions Are Possible\nHigh teacher turnover is not inevitable: U.S. rates were once much lower when salaries were more competitive and working conditions were stronger. Teacher attrition rates are also much lower in high-achieving jurisdictions like Finland, Singapore, and Ontario, Canada, where attrition averages 3% to 4% per year, and where studies show that teachers are well-trained, supported, and compensated. In Toronto, Ontario, where a well-designed teacher induction program extends through the first 4 years of a candidate’s tenure, retention rates for beginning teachers are 98%. Not long ago, before these conditions were in place, Ontario had attrition rates similar to those in the United States. Their efforts to improve succeeded.\nAldeman objects to this comparison to other countries, arguing that there are major cultural differences that would make these kinds of attrition rates impossible to achieve in the United States. He asks, “What if American teachers have higher turnover rates not just because of our education policies, but also as a result of being American?” Several American states, including Massachusetts and other New England states, have attrition rates well below 5%. It is not surprising that, like the countries we noted, these states also have policies and conditions associated with increased retention, such as competitive compensation, high-quality training, few entrants through low-quality backdoor routes, and positive working conditions.\nIn short, lower attrition rates are possible. We have seen them abroad, we have seen them in the United States in past years, and we see them in some states today.\nReducing teacher turnover where it is high is not a pipedream; it’s a policy question. In the many states, districts, and schools where turnover rates are double or triple the national average, progress is possible. If we cut overall attrition from the current levels of 7.7% even to 5% annually, U.S. hiring needs would decrease by more than 100,000 teachers annually, cutting demand by more than one-third immediately. If we did this with high-retention pathways into teaching—like residencies with mentoring—the demand would drop further each year as these teachers stayed rather than cycling through. This reduction would virtually eliminate shortages, with the exception of some fields and locations that may require specific incentives.\nThere is no denying that there is a teacher turnover problem in many communities and that it is harming hundreds of thousands of students daily. Policymakers and practitioners can work together to improve the key factors associated with teacher turnover through stronger teacher preparation and support, competitive and equitable compensation, and supportive teaching conditions.\nIt is hard to understand how building a well-prepared educator workforce that is well-supported and adequately compensated for their work is a “frightening” idea. If we value high quality schools, we must attend to how we can recruit and retain talented, dedicated people who want to stay and do the vital work of educating our children to become informed and productive citizens. If that is indeed a shared goal, it's time to turn from denying the problem to working on the solutions.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It’s true, but there’s less there than meets the eye. Massachusetts has historically been a high-debt state. Massachusetts has ranked either first or second in debt per capita in each of the past 11 years. It was second when Romney took office, not a far leap to first place. One could even argue that Romney slowed the growth rate of long-term debt compared with the four years before he took office.\nWe’re No. 1! Ugh.\nThe ad sets up its punch line with the opening line, “When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts was number one.” The ad then says, “Number one in state debt.”\nAccording to the ad, under Romney, Massachusetts had “$18 billion in debt — more debt per person than any other state in the country.”\nFirst, we should note that this is not the same kind of debt we hear about with the federal government. The Massachusetts debt referred to in the ad is long-term debt for capital improvements, bonds to pay for such things as road or bridge repair, to erect new buildings at the University of Massachusetts or to expand courthouses. That’s not the same as piling up yearly deficits to support operating expenses the way the federal government is. In fact, like most states, Massachusetts requires balanced budgets.\n(Our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post noted that with an asterisk — saying that Massachusetts has historically shifted some operational costs, such as pay for workers on capital projects, to its capital budget. But that practice pre- and post-dates Romney.)\nThat being said, it’s true that the long-term debt went from $16 billion (see A-22) on Jan. 1, 2003, just before Romney took office, to $18.7 billion (see A-22) on Oct. 1, 2006, three months before he left. That’s an increase of $2.7 billion.\nAccording to Moody’s State Debt Medians, in 2007 — the year Romney left office — Massachusetts had the highest debt per capita of any state in the country, $4,153. Connecticut ranked second, with $3,713, and Hawaii third, with $3,630.\nBut Massachusetts didn’t have far to go to reach the No. 1 spot. Massachusetts ranked second in 2003, the year Romney took office, according to Moody’s. And it was first in 2002.\n“Massachusetts has always been a very high-debt state,” Michael Widmer, president of the nonpartisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, told us. “That was the case before Romney was governor and it’s been the case since.” (Indeed, Massachusetts ranked second behind Connecticut in 2010, 2011 and 2012.)\nIn fact, the pace of the state’s rising long-term debt load actually slowed during Romney’s time as governor.\nIn a comparable length of time before Romney took office — from June 30, 1999, to Jan. 1, 2003 — the long-term debt in Massachusetts went from nearly $12 billion to $16 billion (see A-23), a $4 billion increase. That’s a 34 percent increase, compared with the 16.4 percent increase during Romney’s years.\nWidmer put it this way: “He didn’t put his foot on the accelerator any more, or really take it off.”\nA few more pieces of context. In addition to looking at debt per capita, Moody’s provides data on debt as a percentage of personal income. This statistic more closely aligns with residents’ ability to pay. Massachusetts’ debt as a percentage of income rose slightly during Romney’s years in office, from 8.5 percent in 2003 to 9.4 percent in 2007. Still, Massachusetts has consistently ranked second among states with regard to debt as a percentage of income in each of the last 12 years — before, during and after Romney’s term as governor. And last, we should note that Massachusetts has maintained an excellent bond rating. It was Aa2 throughout the 2000s, considered a very low risk for potential investors.\nThere is some irony in the Obama campaign attack on Romney’s debt record. As the Obama campaign pointed out in backup material for the ad, while running for governor in 2002, Romney criticized his Democratic opponent, then state Treasurer Shannon O’Brien, for Massachusetts’ long-term debt. One TV ad from the Romney campaign featured a basset hound to sarcastically depict O’Brien as a failed “watchdog” because “O’Brien’s let her Beacon Hill pals spend so much money our state per capita debt has grown to the highest in the country.” During a debate, Romney ridiculed O’Brien for promising to reduce the state’s debt as treasurer, noting that Massachusetts had “the highest debt per person of any state in the nation.” Never mind that it is the state Legislature and governor, not the state treasurer, that decides how much long-term debt to assume.\nIn other words, this is a shaky tactic Romney himself employed when it suited him.\n47th Out of 50, Again\nThe ad also rehashes the claim that under Romney, “Massachusetts fell to 47th in job creation, one of the worst economic records in the country.”\nBut as we wrote when the same claim was made in an earlier Obama campaign ad, it’s a bit misleading to say Massachusetts “fell” to 47th. The state ranking for job growth went from 50th the year before Romney took office, to 28th in his final year. It was 47th for the whole of his four-year tenure, but the ranking was improving, not declining, when he left.\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Massachusetts added 49,100 net jobs during Romney’s tenure, an increase of about 1.5 percent. That was a far slower pace than the national average of 5.3 percent, however. In fact, looking at the entirety of Romney’s four years, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in percentage of job growth. It had ranked 37th in the four years prior.\nBut as we said, a different picture emerges when one looks at year-by-year figures. In the 12 months before Romney took office, the state ranked 50th in job creation, and for his first 12 months in office, the state remained 50th. But by his final year, the state ranked 28th. That’s still mediocre, but an improvement, and not a decline.\nThe ad will air in the battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n— Robert Farley\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \"As governor, Mitt Romney presided over a historic turnaround of Massachusetts.

Four years later, his supporters often cite \"promises made, promises kept\" as a reason why they're backing him again.\nMany of them made headlines - from banning all Muslims entering the US, to building a border wall paid for by Mexico.\nBut others went a little under the radar, like his pledge to eliminate the national debt.\nSo how has he done in keeping his promises?\nTax cuts\nBefore election: Trump promised to lower the corporate tax rate and bring in huge tax cuts for working Americans.\nAfter: The Republican tax plan passed in December 2017, and it largely ticks the box for the president although its merits are hotly disputed. He has had to compromise on his pledge to bring corporation tax down from 35% to 15% (it will be 21% instead).\nAnd the tax cuts for individuals will expire, although Republicans say future governments will simply renew them. But wealthy Americans are expected to benefit more than poorer ones.\nNot everyone saw their taxes lowered. For some higher earners in urbanised, mostly Democratic states, taxes went up due to a cap on state and local property and income tax deductions.\nParis climate deal\nBefore: As a candidate, Mr Trump derided climate change as a hoax concocted by China, and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth.\nAfter: After three months of hemming and hawing behind the closed doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the president came down decisively on the side near the exits. Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, is unequivocally a promise kept. The exit officially takes effect 4 November, the day after the US election.\nReshaping the judiciary\nBefore: \"I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents.\"\nAfter: He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has appointed two - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\nMr Gorsuch's appointment required a procedural change to Senate rules, but it was Mr Kavanaugh's appointment that was particularly controversial.\nMr Kavanaugh faced sexual assault allegations - which he denied - and was eventually voted through by 50-48 - the tightest nomination vote since 1881.\nWhat's more, his third nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is on course to be confirmed. If approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, she could ensure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades to come.\nIn addition to making his mark on the top court, Mr Trump has appointed nearly 200 conservative judges to lower federal courts.\nRepeal and replace Obamacare\nBefore: One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered.\nIt is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a \"job killer\" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.\nAfter: Republicans have been unable to pass a repeal or reform bill.\nThat said, the Trump administration has managed to dismantle parts of the law - enrolment periods have been shortened, some subsidies have been axed, and the fine for people who did not purchase health insurance has been eliminated as part of the 2017 tax plan.\nAnd in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled that repealing this penalty, an \"essential\" part of the law, meant the entirety of Obamacare is therefore unconstitutional.\nThe law, however, remains in place as an appeal heads to the US Supreme Court, with a ruling expected sometime in 2021.\nA border wall paid for by Mexico\nBefore: His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises. Mr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it.\nAfter: Mexico poured scorn on the claim that it would pay for such a barrier, and even Mr Trump appears to have dropped that idea.\nDemocrats are vociferously opposed to a wall, whereas some Republicans have baulked at a bill that could reach $21.5bn (£17bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report.\nIn December 2018 the US government went into shutdown after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn to fund the wall. He has since redirected defence and some other funds to build or replace sections of the wall, a decision that has faced legal challenges.\nAs of late May, 194 miles of wall system had been built, mostly to shore up dilapidated or outdated designs of the barrier already in place - just three miles construction was part of an entirely new system.\nBombing IS\nBefore: During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb the so-called Islamic State group into obliteration.\nAfter: The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan. He also takes credit for driving IS out of parts of Iraq and Syria, saying the group has been \"largely defeated\", although that process was under way under Obama. Last year, IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos.\nMoving Israel embassy\nBefore: Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim.\nAfter: In 2017, he said he formally recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and approved moving the US embassy. It opened in May 2018 to coincide with Israel's 70th anniversary. The construction of a permanent US embassy building in Jerusalem was approved in 2019.\nMilitary spending\nBefore: \"I'm going to build a military that's going to be much stronger than it is right now. It's going to be so strong, nobody's going to mess with us,\" Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in October 2015.\nHe promised to reverse defence cuts brought in by President Barack Obama in 2013. \"We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military dominance,\" he said.\nAfter: Defence spending has indeed risen steadily throughout the Trump presidency - although overall levels remain below the first years of the Obama administration.\nMilitary spending increased dramatically from 2002 as the US entered protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It peaked in 2010 as a percentage of GDP - the value of all goods and services - after which the US began stepping back from its engagement in the Middle East and Central Asia.\nCutting regulations\nBefore: Just a month before his election win in November 2016, Mr Trump said he could cut as many as 70% of US federal regulations if elected.\n\"It's just stopping businesses from growing,\" he told an audience in New Hampshire.\nThe promise drew him support from large and small businesses, who helped him to victory that year.\nAfter: The president has slashed through regulations on everything from labour to the environment.\nJust days after taking office he signed the Presidential Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which mandated that when government departments asked for a federal regulation, they had to specify two others they would drop.\nThroughout his term he has continued to slash back red tape. In January 2020 he scrapped protections for US wetlands and streams, and in July he announced changes to the National Environmental Protection Act in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects.\n\"We are reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation that gets things done,\" he said.\nBringing troops home\nBefore: Mr Trump has long called for the US to leave the Middle East. On the 2016 campaign trail, he said the region was a \"total and complete mess\" and wished the government had spent the trillions of dollars in the US instead.\nHis talk of an end to US military deployments overseas predates his presidential run. In 2013, he tweeted: \"Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.\" That same year, he said the US should \"stay the hell out\" of the Syrian war.\nAfter: In September 2017, the Trump administration announced the deployment of 3,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Mr Trump said his approach would be based on conditions on the ground. In Syria, the US had led a coalition against IS along with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, with around 2,000 troops on the ground.\nBy December 2018, Mr Trump ordered the withdrawal of all US troops from Syria, though about half the troops, approximately 500, still remain.\nMr Trump recently said he has plans to further cut troops in Afghanistan - after reducing them to 8,600 from 13,000 over the spring and summer - before the 3 November election. In February, US and Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops from the country within 14 months if Taliban militants uphold a new peace agreement.\nThe president's efforts to pull down troops has at times been met with criticism from his own officials. Following Mr Trump's announcement of a Syria withdrawal in part prompted the resignation of US Defence Secretary James Mattis.\nTrade deals\nBefore: Mr Trump called Nafta \"a disaster\" and warned that the TPP \"is going to be worse, so we will stop it\". He also pledged to correct the trade deficit with China.\nAfter: Mr Trump followed through in his first few days on his pledge to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He later said he would consider re-joining the TPP if he got a better deal.\nOn 30 November, after protracted negotiations, the US, Canada and Mexico signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was designed to replace Nafta and recently came into force. However, the US has reimposed aluminium tariffs on Canada, and Ottawa reciprocated with retaliatory tariffs.\nThe US and South Korea also signed a revised trade pact in September 2018.\nThe US and China, meanwhile, became embroiled in an escalating trade battle - with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods.\nDespite ongoing tensions, in August the US and China held talks over their so-called \"phase-one\" trade deal - signed early this year - that is aimed at easing the trade war.\nBan on Muslims\nBefore: Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a \"total and complete\" shutdown should remain until the US authorities \"can figure out what's going on\".\nBut he switched to \"extreme vetting\" after he became the party's presidential candidate.\nAfter: As president, he introduced two travel bans which became ensnarled in the courts - but the third had more luck. The US Supreme Court ruled President Trump's ban on six mainly Muslim countries can go into full effect, pending legal challenges.\nThe current ban restricts travellers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.\nAnd in January, the US has announced it was expanding its curbs on immigration to include six more countries. Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas.\nCuba thaw no more\nBefore: Mr Trump said in September 2016 that he would reverse the deal President Barack Obama had struck to reopen diplomatic relations and improve trade.\nAfter: As president, he told an audience in Miami that he was \"cancelling the Obama administration's one-sided deal.\"\nIn 2017, Mr Trump reimposed some trade and travel restrictions lifted by his predecessor. He kept the embassy open in Havana, although without naming an ambassador to the country.\nLast year, the administration announced a ban on travel to Cuba for American group tours as well as cruise ships journeying to the island\nUntil then, US tourism to Cuba was not permitted, but certain forms of organised group travel, known as \"people-to-people\" travel, had been allowed.\nThis month the US administration announced further restrictions, saying it would suspend all private charter flights between the United States and Cuba, to increase economic pressure on Havana. The suspension comes into force on 13 October.\nChina as currency manipulator\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a \"currency manipulator\" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of \"raping\" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods.\nAfter: In August 2019, the administration officially named China as a \"currency manipulator\". The US Treasury department defines currency manipulation as when countries deliberately influence the exchange rate between their currency and the US dollar to gain \"unfair competitive advantage in international trade\".\nBut in January, the US reversed its decision when China had agreed to refrain from devaluing its currency to make its own goods cheaper for foreign buyers.\nNational debt\nBefore: \"I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them,\" Donald Trump told the Washington Post, external in 2016, and promised to clear the country's then-$19tn national debt \"over a period of eight years\".\nAfter: Halfway through that eight-year promise, the US national debt has ballooned by more than a third, hitting $27tn in October 2020. Mr Trump increased the national debt ceiling in 2017, before suspending it until after the 2020 election in July 2019.\nIt is predicted the debt will rise even further once the full economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic becomes apparent.\nDeporting all illegal immigrants\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are estimated to be more than 11.3 million - \"have to go\".\nAfter: As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who \"are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers\".\nIn fiscal year 2019 deportations were at 267,000, a slight rise on the year before, though not as high as the 2012 peak of 410,000 under the Obama administration.\nMr Trump's plans for immigration reform faced defeat this summer when the Supreme Court ruled against his administration's bid to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), which protects about 650,000 young people who entered the US without documents as children.\nRebuilding infrastructure\nBefore: The country's infrastructure \"will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it\", he said in his victory speech in November.\nAfter: Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but as yet, there is little sign of action. By March 2018 Congress had allocated $21bn for infrastructure spending - far short of the $1.5tn Mr Trump has called for. The money will be spent on a wide range of upgrades and investments, external, according to a congressional graphic.\nIn April 2019, Mr Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to spend $2tn on infrastructure, an agreement that later fell apart. This June there were reports the Trump administration had a $1tn plan in the works, but no announcement has been made.\nDitching Nato\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it \"obsolete\". One issue that irked him was whether members were pulling their weight and \"paying their bills\". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia.\nAfter: But as he hosted Nato's secretary general at the White House in April 2018, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. \"I said it [Nato] was obsolete,\" Mr Trump said. \"It's no longer obsolete.\"\nIn July 2018, Mr Trump reiterated his support at the Nato summit, but suggested the US might still leave if allies did not acquiesce to his budget demands.\nMr Trump has continued to argue that Canada and European members of Nato are not spending enough to support the alliance, and recently said the US will move nearly 12,000 troops out of Germany.\nTorture\nBefore: Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding \"immediately\" and \"make it also much worse\", adding \"torture works\".\nAfter: But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the countervailing belief, espoused by former Defence Secretary James Mattis and then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state.\nMr Pompeo said during his CIA confirmation hearing that he would \"absolutely not\" reinstate such methods.\nProsecuting Hillary Clinton\nBefore: \"Lock her up\" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters.\nThey wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state.\nAnd Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\"\nAfter: The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was \"such a nasty woman\" as someone the country owed \"a debt of gratitude\". Later, he said he \"hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought\" and had other priorities.\nIn November 2016 Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton \"heal\".\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Remarks of President Barack Obama -- Address to Joint Session of Congress\nRemarks of President Barack Obama – As Prepared for Delivery\nAddress to Joint Session of Congress\nTuesday, February 24th, 2009\nMadame Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, and the First Lady of the United States:\nI’ve come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here.\nI know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others. And rightly so. If you haven’t been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has – a friend; a neighbor; a member of your family. You don’t need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day. It’s the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. It’s the job you thought you’d retire from but now have lost; the business you built your dreams upon that’s now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope. The impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere.\nBut while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this:\nWe will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.\nThe weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation. The answers to our problems don’t lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth. Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure. What is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.\nNow, if we’re honest with ourselves, we’ll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities – as a government or as a people. I say this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we’ll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament.\nThe fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight. Nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before.\nIn other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn’t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\nWell that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.\nNow is the time to act boldly and wisely – to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. That is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that’s what I’d like to talk to you about tonight.\nIt’s an agenda that begins with jobs.\nAs soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President’s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets. Not because I believe in bigger government – I don’t. Not because I’m not mindful of the massive debt we’ve inherited – I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships. In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. That’s why I pushed for quick action. And tonight, I am grateful that this Congress delivered, and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.\nOver the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs. More than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector – jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.\nBecause of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids. Health care professionals can continue caring for our sick. There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make.\nBecause of this plan, 95% of the working households in America will receive a tax cut – a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st.\nBecause of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college. And Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm.\nI know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work. I understand that skepticism. Here in Washington, we’ve all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.\nThat is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort – because nobody messes with Joe. I have told each member of my Cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend. I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud. And we have created a new website called recovery.gov so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent.\nSo the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.\nI want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family’s well-being. You should also know that the money you’ve deposited in banks across the country is safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. That is not the source of concern.\nThe concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins.\nYou see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.\nBut credit has stopped flowing the way it should. Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks. With so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or to each other. When there is no lending, families can’t afford to buy homes or cars. So businesses are forced to make layoffs. Our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further.\nThat is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.\nWe will do so in several ways. First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running.\nSecond, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their mortgages. It’s a plan that won’t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values – Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about. In fact, the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage.\nThird, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.\nI understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. But such an approach won’t solve the problem. And our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all.\nI intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This time, CEOs won’t be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over.\nStill, this plan will require significant resources from the federal government – and yes, probably more than we’ve already set aside. But while the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. That would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation. And I refuse to let that happen.\nI understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed. So were the American taxpayers. So was I.\nSo I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. I promise you – I get it.\nBut I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment. My job – our job – is to solve the problem. Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility. I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can’t pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can’t get a mortgage.\nThat’s what this is about. It’s not about helping banks – it’s about helping people. Because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. And then some company will hire workers to build it. And then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they’ll finally buy that car, or open their own business. Investors will return to the market, and American families will see their retirement secured once more. Slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover.\nSo I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary. Because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession. And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse.\nThe recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we’re taking to revive our economy in the short-term. But the only way to fully restore America’s economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren’t preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.\nIn the next few days, I will submit a budget to Congress. So often, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs. I see this document differently. I see it as a vision for America – as a blueprint for our future.\nMy budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. It reflects the stark reality of what we’ve inherited – a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.\nGiven these realities, everyone in this chamber – Democrats and Republicans – will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. And that includes me.\nBut that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges. I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.\nFor history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. In the wake of war and depression, the GI Bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history. And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American on the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world.\nIn each case, government didn’t supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.\nWe are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal. Now we must be that nation again. That is why, even as it cuts back on the programs we don’t need, the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education.\nIt begins with energy.\nWe know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we’ve fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea.\nWell I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders – and I know you don’t either. It is time for America to lead again.\nThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next three years. We have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history – an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and technology.\nWe will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country. And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.\nBut to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. And to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in America.\nAs for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. Scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\nNone of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. But this is America. We don’t do what’s easy. We do what is necessary to move this country forward.\nFor that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care.\nThis is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every thirty seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes. In the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. And in each of these years, one million more Americans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. And it’s one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget.\nGiven these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold.\nAlready, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade. When it was days old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million American children whose parents work full-time. Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives. It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American by seeking a cure for cancer in our time. And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control.\nThis budget builds on these reforms. It includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform – a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every American. It’s a commitment that’s paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue. And it’s a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come.\nNow, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why I’m bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week.\nI suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. It will be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. So let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.\nThe third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America.\nIn a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity – it is a pre-requisite.\nRight now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma. And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education. We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation. And half of the students who begin college never finish.\nThis is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow. That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education – from the day they are born to the day they begin a career.\nAlready, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan. We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. We have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students. And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children’s progress.\nBut we know that our schools don’t just need more resources. They need more reform. That is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. We’ll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. And we will expand our commitment to charter schools.\nIt is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work. But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it. And so tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma. And dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It’s not just quitting on yourself, it’s quitting on your country – and this country needs and values the talents of every American. That is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal: by 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\nI know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country – Senator Edward Kennedy.\nThese education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children. But it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. In the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the TV, put away the video games, and read to their child. I speak to you not just as a President, but as a father when I say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home.\nThere is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down.\nI’m proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities.\nYesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. But we’re starting with the biggest lines. We have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade.\nIn this budget, we will end education programs that don’t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don’t need them. We’ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we’re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don’t use. We will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn’t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\nIn order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of Americans. But let me perfectly clear, because I know you’ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime. In fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut – that’s right, a tax cut – for 95% of working families. And these checks are on the way.\nTo preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come. And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.\nFinally, because we’re also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget. That is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules – and for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For seven years, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price.\nWe are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.\nAnd with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism. Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens half a world away.\nAs we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support. To relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.\nTo overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend – because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America. That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists – because living our values doesn’t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture.\nIn words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America. We cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.\nTo seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To meet the challenges of the 21st century – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty – we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.\nAnd to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe. For the world depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world’s.\nAs we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us – watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for us to lead.\nThose of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. It is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege – one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill.\nI know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth – to become cynical and doubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial.\nBut in my life, I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places; that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of Americans who are anything but ordinary.\nI think about Leonard Abess, the bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him. He didn’t tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, ''I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. I didn't feel right getting the money myself.\"\nI think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community – how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay. \"The tragedy was terrible,\" said one of the men who helped them rebuild. \"But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.\"\nAnd I think about Ty’Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South Carolina – a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. She has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The letter asks us for help, and says, \"We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of South Carolina but also the world. We are not quitters.\"\nWe are not quitters.\nThese words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here. They tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity.\nTheir resolve must be our inspiration. Their concerns must be our cause. And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.\nI know that we haven’t agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways. But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done. That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground.\nAnd if we do – if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity; if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, \"something worthy to be remembered.\" Thank you, God Bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Five minutes in, as we pass between the green and red buoys in the channel, we spot a great blue heron taking wing, and I cut the engine. We float there in silence for a moment, my wife and I, watching that beautiful, awkward bird fly past. Mist rises off the water. Loons call across the lake, one to another: the female shrieking maniacally, the male answering, a melancholy hoo.\nDeedie and I have lived here, in Rome, in the Belgrade Lakes region of central Maine, for almost 30 years now. The Belgrade Lakes chain consists of seven ponds, each with its own character. The biggest is Great Pond — over 8,000 acres and abundant with brown trout, brook trout, landlocked salmon, white perch, and pickerel. Messalonskee Lake — known by Belgravians as Snow Pond — is 3,500 acres; you can find some good northern pike there. Then there’s North Pond and East Pond, Long and Salmon and McGrath: each with its own unique history, each connected to another by tiny streams. But those streams connect more than the lakes. On a good day, they connect the individuals who live here too.\nIt was on Great Pond that E. B. White spent boyhood summers, at Bear Spring Camps. His classic essay “Once More to the Lake” is about Belgrade. Here he is, singing the pleasures of fishing in early morning and remembering fishing in the same place as a child: “I felt the same damp moss covering the worms in the bait can, and saw the dragonfly alight on the tip of my rod as it hovered a few inches from the surface of the water. It was the arrival of this fly that convinced me beyond any doubt that everything was as it always had been, that the years were a mirage and there had been no years.”\nThere are moments, living in Belgrade Lakes, when things still feel this way. I look out my window and see fishermen drifting past in their boats. Sometimes I swear they are the same guys I saw drifting past on a similar morning, some 30 years ago now, when we first looked out on these waters.\nThe lake my wife and I live on, Long Pond, is divided into a northern and a southern half, connected by a channel. In the middle of the channel sits rustic, adorable Castle Island, home since 1929 to a classic fishing camp. When I first moved here, there really was a Horatio Castle running the place. These days, Castle Island Camps is run by the Rice Family, John and Rhonda and their daughters. But in most ways, it is unchanged since the old days: The dozen-odd cabins are still centered around the main lodge, where visitors gather around the stone fireplace. Yes, there is a moose head on the wall. No, there is no television.\nThe southern end of Long Pond narrows to a lovely stream, this one connecting to Messalonskee Lake. At the other end, the northern tip is fed by Whittier Brook, which comes down out of the Kennebec Highlands and makes a merry, clear sound as it rushes over granite boulders. Some people say the fishing is better in the southern half of the lake — Horatio Castle used to tell people how to find “Lucky Point” and its legendary “salmon hole” — but it’s the northern half, which my wife and I are crossing this morning, where you’ll find the village of Belgrade Lakes, a small collection of buildings on a finger of land between Long and Great Ponds.\nToday, we’re off to the summer farmer’s market. On another visit, we might drop in on one of the town’s two longest-tenured restaurants: the homey Sunset Grill or the stone-cold classic Village Inn and Tavern, known for its slow-roasted duck. The Village Inn is flanked by a pair of docks — one for folks coming from Long Pond, another for visitors from Great Pond, by way of a connecting stream. There are a lot of things I love about this town, but going out to dinner by boat, tying up at a dock in front of the Village Inn — how great is that?\nFirst row: Aboard Junebug on Great Pond; sisters Shari Hamilton, Margaret Bartel, and Vena Hamilton at owner Shari’s Hello, Good Pie Bakery & Gourmet Kitchen; cabins at Bear Spring Camps.

Day’s has been run by the same family since 1958 — it’s now on its fourth generation. This is the place for homemade doughnuts and coffee, for your copy of the Kennebec Journal or a six-pack of Sea Dog, for corn on the cob, lobsters, fudge, or a fishing net. There’s a sign out front, proclaiming the hours: “Summer: NEARLY ALL OF THEM. Winter: DAMN FEW.”\nOur town has been a tourist destination since the 1920s. Once, the majestic Belgrade Hotel stood on a small bluff on Long Pond. Summer people from New York and Philadelphia used to come off the steam train to Belgrade Depot — now a Hammond Lumber yard — then settle into the massive inn for the summer. It was an old-school grand hotel, built in 1900, with 75 rooms, gardens, a golf course. But the inn burned to the ground in 1956, putting an end to that era — although some folks will tell you the era had already ended a decade earlier, after the war, when cars replaced trains and small cabins succeeded grand hotels as the vacation options of choice.\nGolf continues here, anyway — boy, does it ever. Built by entrepreneur and philanthropist Harold Alfond in the mid-1990s, the course at the Belgrade Lakes Golf Club is a showstopper, designed by architect Clive Clark to stretch across a dramatic ridge. Alfond said he wanted to build “a country club for the average guy.” I don’t golf, but the course’s 360-degree views of the lakes make me wish I did.\nLife in Belgrade has a seasonal rhythm to it. The ice disappears by mid-April, and the fishermen arrive soon after. In summer, it can be crowded, the golf pilgrims wandering town before their tee times, the lakes filling up with bass boats and water skiers and the dreaded Jet Skis. Things thin out again as the colors change. By late fall, Day’s is on reduced hours; the Village Inn closes after Thanksgiving.\nFirst row: Lunchtime in the lodge at Castle Island Camps; guest Ryan Saucier tosses his daughter at Bear Spring Camps; sailboat in the Commodore’s Cup regatta on Great Pond.

We see snowshoers and cross-country skiers on the mountain paths and on some of the lakes, alongside the shacks of ice fishermen. The “Christmas Stroll” in town is the last celebration before we all turn inward for deep winter. Sometimes, that’s my favorite part of the year — the house warmed by woodstoves, dogs lying on the floor in front of the fireplace, the sound of a neighbor chopping kindling. My wife likes to make stews and chilis and soups in winter; I like to bake hearty loaves of bread — whole wheat, or rye, or pumpernickel brown with molasses. We sit in front of the fire on those long winter nights and drink a cocktail and eat Irish stew from handle bowls and play Scrabble. My wife beats me nearly every time; after 30 years, it no longer surprises me when she makes BLOOPIER on a triple.\nSometimes, in late spring, I’ll get a phone call from someone down south, a friend whose tulips are already out while Deedie and I are still socked in. They always say they’re sorry for us at those times, those friends of mine. I just sit there in the warmth of the fire with our dogs and act like I’m grateful for their pity. But to be honest, I wouldn’t trade places for the world.\nIn 2003, I got to see what this town was made of when I came out as transgender and published a bestselling book about that transition, called She’s Not There. If you would expect people in a small town in Maine to be close-minded and cruel about LGBTQ issues, you would be wrong. Mostly, my wife and I got to see how good people could be. Again and again, we heard variations on one generous refrain: Well, you’ve always been our neighbor. We will have your back.\nThe lakes have always been a good place for artists and writers, free spirits and iconoclasts. A century ago, the Maine Chance Spa, run by Elizabeth Arden, provided a respite for all sorts of women who needed a little solace. Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Edna Ferber, and Lillian Gish were among its visitors. Today, the Arden Estate has been transformed by celebrated hero Travis Mills into a center supporting wounded American veterans.\nErnest Thompson wrote On Golden Pond during Memorial Day weekend at his Great Pond camp in 1978, and his play — as well as the film adaptation — captures what life in Belgrade used to be like (and sometimes still is). Thompson has said that his play is about families who used to spend whole summers at the lake, as he did as a child, in places where there was no television or phone. The Thompson cottage, instead, was filled with books. Now 68, Thompson has continued to visit Great Pond all his life.\nAs our boat makes its way toward the village, Deedie and I see a lot of summer cottages, some of them surely unchanged, or nearly so, from the youths of Ernest Thompson or of E. B. White. And yet there are newer houses too: summer homes without basements, as well as full-season lodges overlooking the water.\nWe arrive at the dock, and Deedie and I step onto the bank in front of the Village Inn. Two doors down is the headquarters of the 7 Lakes Alliance, a nonprofit focused on environmental conservation in Belgrade. Among other things, the group leads efforts to combat nutrient pollution and invasives in the Belgrade Lakes, helping educate homeowners on how to be better stewards of the lakes and of this precious, fragile region. The group also hosts the Sunday farmer’s market in the side yard of its headquarters. Today, we’ll buy some quiche from Hello, Good Pie and maybe some sausages and ice cream and coffee. There will likely be someone there picking a banjo. I know I’ll see at least a few faces that I’ve known for over 30 years now. We’ve all seen changes in each other, and in this town, but there are constants as well — the love we have for each other, the love we have for this place.\nBefore we step off the dock and into town, my wife and I pause and look back in the direction from which we’ve come. There in the distance is Vienna Mountain, atop which is a blueberry farm, and the trees and trails of the Kennebec Highlands, the Maine reserve lands I sometimes explore with my mountain bike. There are loons and herons on the lake and red-winged blackbirds flitting among the trees.\nAnd there, on the far bank, almost invisible to me now, is our home. Music calls to us from the market in the village. My wife and I join hands.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        I finally got a chance to sit down and watch Netflix’s much discussed To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before. I was struck by a number of things about the film, from its goofy charm, to the emotional intimacy, to the fact it made me want to have a big long talk about the cinematography’s problematic use of negative space (you know, the usual things). But the thing that struck me most is that the film showcases a considerate awareness of how we navigate our cultural intersections. It’s not overt, which is to say it’s not the subject of the movie—To All The Boys is much more about the universal nature of young love. But it doesn’t ignore the cultural divisions that play into our everyday lives. Immediately after watching I began reading about the author’s take on representation, just as I began reading criticisms of the nuances of those same representations, and I realized this was a process of cinematic absorption that has become incredibly common in the way we digest modern films.\nRecently, we’ve had an incredible stream of hits like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Sorry To Bother You that display the same kind of awareness. It’s not even really about how these movies are great, nor the fact that they focus on underrepresented figures, it’s the way the dynamics of race, gender and sexuality seem to slip in and out of the narrative with relative ease—as if these films are constantly aware of the thematic implications in these issues, just as they are O.K. with accepting criticism about their handling of them.\nThese films are outright invested in the conversations about diversity and representation. And I think about this a lot, precisely because of how much we never used to think about this at all. I’m not just referring to obviously insensitive films from a hundred years ago like Birth of a Nation. No, that would imply that racist overtones are just part of some antiquated, bygone era. I’m talking about more recent ones. Which means I’ve been thinking about the way recent timelines have played into our current shift within millennial culture.\nWhich means I’ve been thinking about the ’90s.\nThe Kids Aren’t Alright\nWhen I recently interviewed the directors of 2001 release Josie & The Pussycats, we got into a discussion of the particularly weird attitude that defined “The ’90s.” I’m not sure what you think about when you picture this era, or how familiar it it is to you. Maybe you picture radical neon color schemes. Maybe you picture flannel shirts and grunge. Maybe you picture Bart Simpson, Kurt Cobain or Steve Urkel. These were the height of my teenage years, and because of that I’ve come to spend a lot of time thinking about the way my experience with all these Gen X cultural contributions shaped my (now) adult brain.\nIn many ways, the ’90s felt like an incredibly safe time. Vietnam was long in the rear view. The Berlin Wall had fallen and the Cold War was over. The economy was booming. The internet felt like a place of limitless growth. The “big scary things” like AIDS were in steady decline by the mid ’90s, especially as celebrities like Magic Johnson and Princess Diana were normalizing cultural fears about it. Even our action heroes were going from the kill-happy, muscle-bound ’80s figures to (somewhat) more sensitive everymen like Keanu Reeves, Nic Cage and Bruce Willis.\nIt was like the very concept of “safety” and sensitivity was seeping into every facet of life. I remember suddenly seeing every kid younger than me wearing a bike helmet and realizing that back in the ’80s we were basically just fodder for car tragedies. But this new feeling of living in a safe bubble was everywhere. While All In The Family may have endeared the racism of an older Archie Bunker, it at least tried to document the cultural shifts of the ‘70s with sincerity. Meanwhile, the defining ’90s sitcom Friends gave us a New York where everyone lived in an amazing apartment and barely had a real problem in sight. Even popular shows like 90210 that tried to tackle topical issues reverted to melodramatic conflicts along the lines of “Donna almost gets a tattoo.” The media’s subtext of all it, all the time, was that “everything’s great!” And for so many young white Americans, there was an obvious problem with this.\nIt felt too safe.\nWhich highlights the glaring dichotomy of feeling like you’re in a safe bubble. Suddenly, we had a generation of (mostly) young white boys who felt soft and coddled, so what they craved became the hardship sold to them by movies. It basically was the most privileged, teenage reaction you could have; one best characterized by the yearning toxicity of Fight Club, which essentially argues, “Hey, don’t you hate your comfortable job, nice apartment and civilized society? Burn it all down and live like a poor person! It will be very manly of you.” Which might be the biggest slap in the face to poverty imaginable. And this wasn’t just the sneering of an outsider culture, this was the culture.\nWhen ’90s grunge quickly moved from the alternative space to the mainstream of early ’90s, it dominated the media. Kurt Cobain’s deification was for the masses. High schoolers worshipped him. But so did five-year-old kids. MTV literally had a show called Alternative Nation and it wasn’t wrong to call it so. These elements completely dominated the media’s popular lexicon. But when that dominance began to fade in the late ’90s, the pop music phenomenon of Total Request Live came to dominate in turn. As Times Square filled with rabid tweens, the privileged sneer of alternative culture reached a fever pitch of cynicism. Valid political arguments about consumerism ruled contemporary conversation, as our cresting wave of ennui came crashing to the ground. We responded mostly with a fit of ironic snark (a cultural inclination that both drove David Foster Wallace crazy and helped make his career).\nSo how was all this actually seen by older society? Look no further Hollywood’s late ’90s teen films, which featured an obsession with bad kids and their horrible, murderous ways. Not just with the aptly named Cruel Intentions, but an endless slew of films like Scream, The Craft, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Jawbreaker, The Faculty, Idle Hands, The Virgin Suicides, Disturbing Behavior, Teaching Mrs. Tingle, The Basketball Diaries, American Beauty, Heavenly Creatures, Fear and Wild Things. Even with the various degrees of humanization within them, these films are all about how kids are up to no good. Even as I named this section, I swear I forgot that “The Kids Aren’t Alright” is literally the name of an Offspring song released in 1998. What these cultural products capture is an era where teens were seen as cynical, jaded forces of chaos who were meant to be feared by society. Its apex was probably at the height of Jackass’s television debut in 2000. And because we ate it up, you might come to the conclusion that we weren’t just seen as mean, terrifying, ungrateful assholes…we probably were.\nOr at least we were really disaffected. Something that perhaps feels evident in just how little we cared about what was really going on in society and social relevance. I think back to how many parties featured the drama kids singing “Seasons of Love” from Rent with a passionate sense of romantic doom, all while ignoring the devastating reality of this same portrait painted by Angels in America (I love Rent, but you need both). This ignorance was a luxury afforded to us not just because of how we viewed society from our place of safety, but because everyone was so overwhelmingly white within the media landscape.\nFrom Friends, to alternative music, to all the bad teen movies listed above, everything was about white subjects for white audiences. Which means our mainstream conversation about racism from the liberal point of view basically amounted to “don’t be horrifically racist!” We saw black culture as something aspirational and to be usurped (cut to packs of suburban young white kids rapping in school yards). Heck, even as we approached the dawn of the PC culture, we genuinely had the attitude that “this will solve everything.” You can call it all good intentions, but it was all as insanely performative as it was ignorant. And it highlighted the deeper cultural problem of ’90s media: our glaring, crippling myopia.\nThis is perhaps best represented by Pleasantville, a film that is a literal metaphor for woke-ness. The characters in this black-and-white world would find their inner liberalism and sexual awakening and then “come into color.” It actually uses the overt language of ‘50s era racism and segregation to talk about a liberal revolution and yet…there is not a single black person in the entire movie. The hypocritical problems of this are more than evident to the modern eye, but back then? There wasn’t a peep. Because we were unaware. We were privileged. We believed everything was so great. And worst of all, we believed the fact that everything was great was something to be sneered at.\nThen things changed.\nPost-September\nIt’s weird to realize you’re now the middle generation.\nWhen I was young, generations were talked about in very strict terms. Our grandparents, who became known as “The Greatest Generation,” were best embodied in people like my grandfather. He was an enormously kind man who survived the horrors of World War II, then helped create the robust economy that made room for the Baby Boomers, the young generation of kids that went on to become radicalized hippies. A.K.A. my parents, who, in the ’90s, were doing their best raising us kids. We were the new generation. I remember reading article after article about why Generation X was made up of a bunch of soft, ungrateful babies, and I can’t tell you how much that idea is still hardwired into my stupid brain. I still think we were the first part of a generational slide. But now I’m well into the age my parents were during the era in question, and the big realizations keep hitting me. Not just the simple lessons that come with change and getting older, but the way you can see how big events shaped these generational shifts. And in looking at how we’ve gotten to the horrific social climate of 2018, I realize there’s something we really don’t talk about enough at all…\nThe social impact of 9/11.\nIt was a subject that was always on our lips in the immediate fallout of the early 2000s. There was the trauma of the attack itself. The growing sense of fear. The rabid Islamophobia. The way it fueled two grueling, horrendous wars. The feeling of it was more than just in the air; it directly affected social policy for years after. But when I talk to younger Millennials I realize just how many of them were too young to really understand this time period—to see how it was such a sudden and immediate shift that shook the myopic culture of the ’90s. I was now out of my glaringly white hometown, now at a diverse college, learning about the broader world. A lot of my friends were already out in the world, working. I can’t explain how much the new reality of that day shook everyone. For ten years, privileged white males were talking about “too safe” and all of sudden shit got real. Friends went to war. Civil liberties were revoked. And our baby boomer hippy parents? They got scared, man.\nLook at the rapid increase of Fox News ratings after 9/11. They stoked the fires of fear while the neocon movement’s growing inclusion of religion helped drag the country to the right. Even my hippy ass dad, who spent the days after 9/11 seeing the racist rhetoric being spouted and told me “I feel I’m in The Twilight Zone,” would, just three short years later, tell me how he believed Colin Powell’s justification for invading Iraq (don’t worry he quickly regained his sanity). I witnessed drug dealing stoners who didn’t give a shit about anything in politics (because it was for squares) suddenly get terrified their dorm would be targeted next for a terrorist strike (for some reason). The point is that the impact of 9/11 on the fearful psyche of our nation was overwhelming, as was the ugly friction that it created.\nEverything got really bad, really quickly. And like everything, there was more to the story in how we got there, from our horrible history of meddling in Mideast politics, to the disastrous 2000 election, to the formation of media empires, to the way the Dot Com burst crippled the economy. In just a few short years, we went from a myopic white media culture that thought of ourselves as “too safe” to having a massive clusterfuck to deal with, for which we were completely unprepared. But outside of the news, what was the larger media response?\nWe often believe that the artistic response to trying times is to make great art. But hardship mostly just fuels escapism. The films of the ’30s helped people escape the Great Depression with sweeping romances and comedies (a subject best explored in Preston Sturges masterpiece Sullivan’s Travels). And post 9/11? We did the same thing. Not just with schlocky reality TV, but in the way that superhero movies exploded. Seriously, have you ever seen the first Spider-Man teaser?\nHe literally traps the helicopter between the twin towers. When the movie was released, those wouldn’t exist. It’s no accident that we went from blockbusters about destructive disasters to witnessing a real-life disaster to craving that very same impossible figure who could have stopped it. And people needed heroism, simplicity and the self-suppressing escape belief. Which brings us to the haunting reason that superhero movies are largely still important to our notoriously fickle audience.\nBecause things are still awful. The Obama era marked a lot of meaningful social progress and staved off of economic doom, but it did little to stop the growing damage of capitalism run amok (most of which goes back to the telecommunications act of 1996). Young adults have come into a laughable job market, one where stock market success represents an increasingly vile lie about the well-being of our actual economy. Sure, companies can do well, but not while employees are. Jobs dwindle ever downward with outsourcing and the increasing automation of service industries, while most accept wage stagnation in this unstable “gig economy.” Never mind the idea that college debt has now soared into un-payable, indentured levels. Compare the differences of cost of living, inflation, and prospects and the simple point is that things are objectively a lot harder now than when I was a teen.\nBut young adults are acutely aware of this. While print media institutions have largely been writing articles that are the equivalent of “LOL u can’t buy a house because you like avocado toast,” young adults have been writing the real story. For as much as we can look at the horrifying effects of social media, they’ve created a public space to share, connect and tell stories about this reality. And as for me? Someone whose age has always made them feel like a daywalker between Gen X and Millennials? It’s been incredible to read those voices. Not in the way it used to work in the ’90s where I’d take a class and then pick up something like The Bluest Eye at the library afterward, but in an immediate way.\nIt’s all now in the organic, daily act of life itself. This is a place where I hear criticism when I fuck up. And I can’t tell you how much that has changed my mind, gotten me to evolve and radically shifted my day-to-day myopia. This has been the positive side of the technological shift: It has illuminated truth. Like how camera phones now document the streams of racist police abuse that black people have been telling stories about for decades. And it makes you realize the way our cultural myopia has really shaped things. When it comes to the ’90s, there’s a lot that white America was remembering wrong. Because there were always real problems.\nThey just weren’t our problems.\nBut We Were Cheerleaders\nIt’s probably sentimentality, but I always feel like Spike Lee was the one who busted open the door of the ’90s. From the groundbreaking, incendiary work of 1989’s Do The Right Thing, he went on to make a host of the decade’s most complex, uncompromised films. Not just with historical masterpieces like Malcolm X, but smaller films like Get On the Bus which painted a portrait of the many variant kinds of “black male” experiences that existed far beyond society’s stereotypes. It’s no surprise he went on to make the emotionally relevant film about New York and the aftermath of 9/11 in The 25th Hour. Spike’s work, while certainly open to criticism just like any filmmaker (specifically with regard to gender and sexuality) still feels urgent and vital to our national conversation. But what was the larger, immediate effect back in the ’90s?\nThe truth is that Spike was largely regarded as an outlier. And the same can be said for a lot of the LGBTQ voices of the era. In the past, films like Dog Day Afternoon had given some kind of credence to queer personhood, but they can’t help but feel more like they came from a place of eerie fascination (this was true all the way up through The Crying Game). But in the ’90s, most of the Hollywood entries framed gay issues from the view of straight white protagonists who were looking from a place of intense homophobia. Philadelphia used this for tension. The Birdcage used that same tension for laughs. They were subject matter we were looking at, but not representative of the way the queer community looked back at us. And sadly the ’90s boom of independent films didn’t really mean too much for characters and people who wanted to tell their own stories. For every blip like The Incredibly True Story of Two Girls In Love or Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together, there were also two dozen “outsider” films that were just more content from the white male majority.\nThe film I think about most in terms of being ahead of its time is Jamie Babbit’s But I’m A Cheerleader (1999), which wasn’t just about representation, but actually criticized the stereotypes of who we think gay people even “are.” The film chronicles the journey of a young blonde cheerleader (the great Natasha Lyonne) who doesn’t understand how she can be gay, and is thus sent to conversion therapy. This strikes me as prescient, not just because the film constantly uses so much social language that is popular now, but because there are two films out this year about the very same subject, Boy Erased and The Miseducation of Cameron Post. The fact that Hollywood is just coming around to conversion therapy narratives 20 years later raises a key point about the media landscape. Not just that the same dire issues are still going on, but that systematic change is fucking hard.\nBecause the pioneering outliers of the ’90s were telling us about the same exact things we’re dealing with now. They were artists trying to punch through a diamond wall of myopia. To make some dent. And hopefully inspire young people to do better in turn. You could find most of the best critical responses to their efforts in academia, especially as it started to change and foster the language of understanding that so many use now. But back in ’90s mainstream criticism? Forget about it. Most social issue movies were dealt with the same dismissive hand wave.\nTake the early work of John Singleton, where the intersectional aims of Higher Learning were regarded as “heavy handed.” And I specifically remember a teacher saying how he didn’t like how Boyz n the Hood stopped to talk about gentrification because it was “didactic.” Ironically, that moment was the first time someone actually taught me the meaning gentrification. The importance of these messages were getting lost on people. Just like countless films like Julie Dash’s haunting, beautiful masterpiece Daughters of the Dust was lost to people, too. Nothing that truly mattered was being supported.\nMostly because everyone was too busy getting caught up in the myopic sneer of white bro superiority. The first popular mainstream way PC culture was portrayed was 1994’s PCU, where everything about it was “lampooned,” which is to say it was treated with disgust. Our frat brother heroes were out to take down all these unfunny minorities who cared about stupid things like representation and their civil rights. Looking back, it obviously feels insipid, but at the time it was absolutely the white status quo that paved the way for shows like South Park.\nWe can say we didn’t know better, but it’s all right there, up on screen. The non-white male population was trying to talk to us and we weren’t listening. Some of it was the knee-jerk myopia, but perhaps some of it was that inner willful desire to keep the status quo. I always think about the moment in 1995’s Goldeneye, where Moneypenny chastises Bond for being a socially-irrelevant dinosaur, but in the end it’s only lip service. The movie, and the society watching it, still wanted Bond to be Bond. We were making a choice about the present and what was being told to us.\nAnd it’s still happening.\nThis Must Be the Place\nYou might be wondering how in the fuck I ended up talking about all this from watching a popular romantic comedy that lightly deals with the intersections of the Asian-American experience. But that’s the whole point. The best cinematic work in today’s society—from romantic comedies, to superhero movies, to nuanced dramas—comes at us from this more inclusive place. And when you’re coming into this growing culture of intersectionalism, particularly if you are a white male trying to understand it, you’re required to digest many aspects of our culture at all once. This is the only real way to understand the here and now.\nBecause we are irrevocably connected to the history of what’s come before and how it has fostered a divide. At the hearing for Brett Kavanaugh—a dark look into the country’s soul that has left an ugly stain—I see the story of that same myopia. Only this one can be credited to the decade earlier, to a white man who is as much a product of the ’80s as I’ve ever seen. And that was something that a random reference from his friend Tom Kane made clear when he said their exploits were harmless jokes in the vein of Revenge of the Nerds. I watched this film as a kid; it’s positioned as an anthem of nerd empowerment, but it was largely empowering them to commit sexual assault against women. The fact that Kane makes this comparison is so damn telling. It’s the hypocrisy of ’80s ignorance in a nutshell.\nYou could argue this moment will be a flashpoint in time precisely because the truth—and what was always the truth—is coming out. And thus, those in power are rallying against it with ardent passion because they want to stay in power. This would be true if you were looking at it all from some grand timeline. But the grand timeline has to account for the fact that all these problems have existed in perpetuity. Because we were having these exact arguments twenty years ago with Clarence Thomas and Bill Clinton. We’ve been talking in endless cultural cycles. Just as all the arguments about millennials being lazy were thrown at Gen X for being slackers, just as they were thrown at the baby boomers before us. Just as we conveniently don’t mention the abject racism of the “greatest” generation while we talk about Charlotesville. Just, just, just…\nSure, I look back at the ’90s and marvel at how far we’ve come, but maybe I’m remembering it all wrong. Maybe what I remember of the ’90s is just part of being young and seeing the world with new, untainted eyes. Maybe our movies haven’t changed. Maybe I’ve simply changed. Maybe I haven’t. Maybe all the language we have to talk about intersectionalism won’t make the difference we hope. Maybe it will save people’s lives in the way it helps them come to understand their sexuality and struggles. Maybe things will get better. Maybe they will get worse. I don’t say all this to disappear into some hole of postmodern relativism. I say all this to make a simple point.\nThere is no such thing as curing myopia.\nIt’s just a constant choice that takes constant fighting and constant presence of mind. People still look at what’s happening in the news, astonished at our division, while I can’t help but wonder what country they thought they lived in. Just as I look at so many responses to the news and see bold declarations of support coming from men in the form of performative tweets. It’s not that this isn’t helpful. It’s just I think about how much ultimate growth I’ve gone through not because I was constantly trying to align with the “correct” opinion, but by having an honest look at my entire life, my failings, and my complicity with toxic masculinity. And it’s not a eureka moment, it’s still going. It’s an endless process involving willingness to be accountable.\nThat’s why I think about the fucking ’90s so much. Because it’s where my understanding of all this was born. And it created shadows that still haunt us. As much as we marvel at what has changed, the power structures still need radical change in turn. Because Jenny Han still has to fight against producers who wanted her to change her character’s race because it “doesn’t matter” to the story. But it is what matters the most. The narratives and subjects we put on display are what shape our grander cultural reflection. Not just because they are part of the innate journey of taking a character and bringing them from person to personhood. But because it is part of crafting a world that doesn’t look like our most myopic assumptions.\nAnd shows us how the world really looks in turn.\n< 3 HULK\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

This chapter reviews one of the most reliable sources of information about cross-national health differences, vital statistics on deaths. Unlike measures obtained from survey data, these data pertain to an unambiguous indicator of health. High-quality vital statistics are available for nearly all deaths in high-income countries. Their continuous coverage permits the construction of accurate time series, and the data can be converted into meaningful popular indicators, such as life expectancy at birth, which is an intuitively appealing summary measure that is often used as the basis for evaluating overall health status. Data on mortality by cause of death can also provide important clues about the social and epidemiologic pathways that affect population health.\nThis chapter examines mortality from multiple perspectives to present a comprehensive picture of the evidence: we examine mortality rates (the number of deaths from particular causes per 100,000 persons), life expectancy at various ages, the probability of living to age 50, and years of life lost from particular causes. We present both the data and the United States’ ranking on these data relative to other high-income countries.1 In\n_________________\n1We report rankings to simplify comparisons across countries, but it is important to recognize that this is an ordinal measure that does not reflect the size of the difference between one rank and the next. Rankings can change when small differences in rates shift a country’s rank.\nthis chapter we focus on 17 high-income countries:2 Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nFor many years, global health statistics compiled by the OECD3 and the World Health Organization (WHO) have documented higher mortality rates in the United States relative to other high-income countries. Among the 17 peer countries examined by the panel, Americans faced the second highest risk of dying from noncommunicable diseases in 2008 (418 per 100,000 persons) and the fourth highest risk of dying from communicable (infectious) diseases in 2008 (World Health Organization, 2011a) (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2).\nDeath rates from noncommunicable diseases, notably cardiovascular diseases, have declined everywhere but less so in the United States. As of 2009, ischemic heart disease mortality among males in the United States was 129 per 100,000, higher than the other 16 peer countries except Finland (OECD, 2011b).4 Table 1-1 provides cause-specific mortality rates\n_________________\n2The panel selected these 17 as “peer countries” because they are most comparable to the United States. We set three criteria for designating peer countries: (1) high levels of development for a long period of time, (2) sufficient population size to ensure stability of estimates, and (3) data from the Human Mortality Database (2012) of suitable quality and availability for the time period used in our analysis, 2006-2008. Excluded countries did not meet one or more of these criteria. For example, data quality has been a problem in Belgium, and its latest year of available data was 2005; Greece and Korea were not included in the Human Mortality Database at the time of our analysis; and several other high-income countries are former Soviet satellites with atypical mortality experiences. For consistency, this report’s documentation of the U.S. health disadvantage is based on comparisons with these 16 peer countries. The panel uses a more general term, “high-income countries,” to refer to other groups of high-income countries. On occasion, we make comparisons with these other high-income countries and even emerging economies (e.g., Mexico, Russia) because data were available for this larger comparison group, because we cited studies that included these countries, and because for certain conditions (e.g., mortality rates, child poverty) comparisons with emerging economies underscore the United States’ relative position.\n3The OECD is a membership organization of 34 member countries that share a commitment to democratic government and the market economy. Well known for its publications and statistics, the work of the OECD covers both economic and social issues, including macroeconomics, trade, employment, education, health, and social welfare. The organization was established in 1961 when the United States and Canada joined the 18 former members of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (established in 1947 for postwar reconstruction) to work together on shared economic development. The OECD’s 34 members now include countries from North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, and it includes not only most advanced economies, but also such emerging economies as Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.\n4U.S. mortality rates from ischemic heart disease are even higher than those of some emerging economies, such as Mexico and Slovenia (OECD, 2011b).\nFIGURE 1-1 Mortality

age-adjusted data are examined separately by sex. However, for some conditions, cross-national patterns change slightly. For example, although the mortality rate for overall injuries (and unintentional injuries) is higher in aggregate in Finland than in the United States, among females only the United States has a higher rate. Similarly, among females, the U.S. mortality rate for infectious and parasitic diseases is higher than that of Portugal, the mortality rate for respiratory diseases is higher than that of the United Kingdom, and the mortality rate for musculoskeletal diseases is higher than that of Spain. Austrian females have a higher mortality rate for cardiovascular diseases, and Swedish and Swiss females have higher rates of mortality for intentional injuries. Among males, the U.S. mortality rate for communicable diseases is higher than that of the United Kingdom; Portugal has a higher mortality rate for noncommunicable diseases in general and genitourinary diseases in particular; Denmark has a higher mortality rate for neuropyshicatric disorders; both Denmark and Austria have higher mortality rates for congenital anomalies; Sweden has a slightly higher mortality rate for cardiovascular diseases; Spain has a higher mortality rate for respiratory diseases; and France and Switzerland have higher mortality rates for musculoskeletal diseases. Not listed here are conditions with relatively low mortality rates (e.g., less than 2 per 100,000), for which the standing of the United States compared with peer countries may differ more substantially by sex.\naPrimarily includes ischemic heart disease but also includes higher death rates from hypertensive and inflammatory heart disease. U.S. death rates from cerebrovascular disease and rheumatic heart disease are at or below average.\nbIncludes cancers of the mouth and oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, trachea, bronchus, lung, skin, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri, ovary, prostate, and bladder; lymphomas; multiple myeloma; and leukemia.\ncIncludes Alzheimer and other dementias, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and drug use disorders, for which the United States has above-average mortality rates, and the following neuropsychiatric disorders for which the United States has average or below-average mortality rates: unipolar depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, alcohol use disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, insomnia, and migraine.\ndIncludes peptic ulcer disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and appendicitis.\nePrimarily nephritis and nephrosis. U.S. death rates from benign prostatic hypertrophy are at or below average.\nfIncludes rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but U.S. death rates from the latter are at or below average.\ngIncludes upper and lower respiratory infections and otitis media.\nhIncludes HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, childhood-cluster diseases (e.g., pertussis, poliomyelitis), meningitis, hepatitis B and C, malaria, tropical-cluster diseases (e.g., schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis), leprosy, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, trachoma, and intestinal nematode infections.\niIncludes protein-energy malnutrition, iodine deficiency, Vitamin A deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia.\nSOURCE: Adapted from World Health Organization (2011a, Table 3).\nfor the 17 peer countries and shows that the United States also experiences relatively high mortality rates for neuropsychiatric conditions, respiratory diseases, diabetes and other endocrine disorders, genitourinary disease, congenital anomalies, infectious diseases, and perinatal conditions. This pattern differs little when the data are examined separately by sex (see Notes in Table 1-1). An interactive graph, which allows a more thorough examination of the data in Table 1-1, is located at http://nationalacademies.org/IntlMortalityRates.\nFigure 1-3 shows that in 2008 the United States had the second highest death rate from injuries among the 17 peer countries, exceeded only by Finland (World Health Organization, 2011a, Table 3). Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among Americans, from ages 1-44 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012).\nAn important contributor has been deaths related to transportation. In 2009, the United States had the highest death rate from transportation-related accidents among the 17 peer countries (and the third highest in the OECD, exceeded only by Mexico and the Russian Federation). The death rate from transportation-related accidents decreased by 42 percent in OECD countries between 1995 and 2009, but by only 11 percent in the United States (OECD, 2011b). Although there are more motorists and miles driven in the United States, calculations of fatality rates per vehicle-kilometer, which correct for this confounding variable, also show that the United States\nFIGURE 1-3 Mortality from injuries in 17 peer countries, 2008.\nSOURCE: Data from World Health Organization (2011a, Table 3).\nFIGURE 1-4 Motor vehicle fatalities in the United States and 15 other high-income countries, 1975-2008.\nNOTE: The comparison set of countries in this analysis are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nSOURCE: Transportation Research Board (2011, Figure 2-2c).\nhas lost the advantage it once held over other countries. Figure 1-4 shows the trend over three decades. As the Transportation Research Board (2011, p. 40) explains:\nFatality rates per vehicle kilometer have declined greatly in every high-income country in the past several decades, and the absolute disparity of rates among countries has lessened. A comparison of the U.S. experience with that of 15 other high-income countries for which 1975–2008 data are available shows that the U.S. fatality rate was less than half the aggregate rate in the other countries in 1975 but has been higher since 2005. Consequently, total annual traffic deaths in the 15 countries fell by 66 percent in the period, while U.S. deaths fell by only 16 percent. The U.S. fatality rate was among the best before 1990 but has been below the median rate of the group every year since 2001.\nThe United States also has dramatically higher rates of death from violent injuries, especially from firearms. In a study that compared 23 OECD\ncountries in 2003, the U.S. homicide rate was 6.9 times higher than the other high-income countries and the rate of firearm homicides was 19.5 times higher. Although overall suicide rates were lower in the United States than in those countries, firearm suicide rates were 5.8 times higher than in other countries. Across the 23 countries in the study, 80 percent of all firearm deaths occurred in the United States (Richardson and Hemenway, 2011). This pattern is not new; data from the early 1990s showed similar results (Krug et al., 1998).\nAlthough the incidence of AIDS has fallen since the early 1990s, the United States still has the highest incidence of AIDS among the 17 peer countries (and the third highest in the OECD, exceeded only by Brazil and South Africa) (OECD, 2011b). The incidence of AIDS in the United States (122 per million) is almost nine times the OECD average (14 per million).5\nHigh mortality rates in the United States relative to other rich nations have been the subject of numerous research studies. A 2005 study reported that U.S. adults aged 15-59 had higher mortality rates than those in nine economically comparable nations: “Compared with other nations in the WHO’s mortality database, in the United States 15-year-old girls rank 38th and 15-year-old boys rank 34th in their likelihood of reaching age 60” (Jenkins and Runyan, 2005, p. 291). These researchers noted that the higher mortality was true for both sexes and throughout the first five decades of life (Jenkins and Runyan, 2005).\nThe U.S. health disadvantage is not limited to death rates; the United States also has relatively high prevalence rates for disease and disability. Chapter 2 details this morbidity disadvantage by age group, but in Box 1-1 we briefly note the key findings that apply across the entire U.S. population.\nThe United States does enjoy some health advantages compared with other countries. In 2009, the United States had the third lowest mortality rate from stroke among the 17 peer countries (OECD, 2011b), despite its above-average mortality for ischemic heart disease.6 As of 2009, the U.S. suicide rate (10.5 per 100,000 persons) was also below the average of the 16 peer countries (OECD, 2011b). Finally, although the U.S. incidence rate for cancer is the fourth highest of the 17 peer countries (OECD, 2011b),7 mortality rates for certain cancers (e.g., cervical and colorectal cancer) are lower than most peer countries (World Health Organization, 2011a).\n_________________\n5The United States has the fifth highest prevalence of HIV infection among 40 OECD countries, exceeded only by Portugal, the Russian Federation, Estonia, and South Africa (OECD, 2011b), and the highest prevalence of HIV infection (for ages 15-49) among the 17 peer countries (World Health Organization, 2010).\n6The reasons for this differential pattern are not entirely clear, but they may relate to cross-national differences in risk factors and treatment for cerebrovascular disease.\n7The incidence of cancer may be skewed by the intensity of screening programs in the United States and may not accurately reflect the prevalence of the disease.\nTable 1-2 lists other conditions for which the U.S. mortality rate is at or below the average of the 16 other peer countries.\nCROSS-NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN LIFE EXPECTANCY\nNot surprisingly, higher mortality rates affect life expectancy in the United States. Perhaps the single most impressive achievement of the past century is the striking increase in longevity in nearly all parts of the world. At the turn of the 20th century, North American and Western European countries experienced life expectancies at birth of 40-50 years (Preston and Haines, 1991): 100 years later (in 2007), no country in these regions had a life expectancy of less than 75 years, and most had levels of more than 80 years (Human Mortality Database, 2012).\nHowever, as shown in Table 1-3, there remain large differences in life expectancy at birth among high-income peer countries. In 2007, men in Switzerland and women in Japan enjoyed the longest life expectancies for their sexes. In contrast, the United States ranked last among males and next to last among females.8 These differences with the top-performing countries amount to approximately 3.7 years for males and 5.2 years for females (Ho and Preston, 2011).9\nWe emphasize that these large cross-national differences are often eclipsed by even larger within-country disparities in life expectancy. As discussed in Box 1-2, such disparities are substantial in the United States (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2011; Bleich et al., 2012; Braveman et al., 2011a; Satcher et al., 2005; Woolf et al., 2004), and they may be part of the reason that the United States compares so unfavorably with its peers.\nThe U.S. disadvantage in life expectancy relative to other high-income countries is not a recent phenomenon (although the gap has grown over time), nor is this the first report to call attention to the problem. Jenkins and Runyan (2005) reported that U.S. survival rates for each of the five decades\n_________________\n8The life expectancy of females was lower in Denmark than in the United States in 2007. Life expectancy in aggregate (for males and females) has historically been lower in Denmark than in the United States, but not since 2005. These findings are from the Human Mortality Database (2012), which provides regularly updated detailed mortality and population data to researchers, students, and others interested in the history of human longevity. It is available at http://www.mortality.org.\n9Ho and Preston’s analysis for this panel is modeled on a similar analysis of mortality above age 50 that they conducted for the National Research Council (2011) panel and also published in Ho and Preston (2010). The current analysis draws on data from three sources: the Human Mortality Database, the WHO Mortality Database, and Statistics Canada. The data were downloaded July 2011, and, for each country, the latest year of data available between 2006 and 2008 was extracted. Dana Glei of Georgetown University provided the panel with a focused mid-project technical review of this analysis.\nBOX 1-1\nThe U.S. Morbidity Disadvantage\nAs of 2010, the United States had the highest prevalence of diabetes (for adults aged 20-79) among the 17 peer countries (and among all OECD countries except Mexico). The U.S. obesity epidemic probably plays a major role in the prevalence of diabetes. The United States has the highest prevalence of adult obesity among the 17 peer countries (and all other OECD countries), a position it has held for decades. As of 2009, the prevalence of obesity in the United States (33.8 percent) was twice the OECD average (16.9 percent) (OECD, 2011b).\nIn a comparison of the health of Americans and the English across the life span, from birth to age 80, the United States had a higher prevalence of obesity, lipid disorders, diabetes, and asthma (Martinson et al., 2011a). Among females, the United States also had a higher prevalence of hypertension, heart attack and angina, and stroke. The differences were as large for young people as for old people. The researchers found that the English advantage persisted even when the samples were restricted to whites, people with health insurance, nonsmokers, nondrinkers, individuals of normal weight, or those in specific income categories (Martinson et al., 2011a, 2011b).\nStudies of risk factors, rather than diseases, have yielded more mixed results. For example, some studies find that hypertension is less common in the United States than in other countries (Danaei et al., 2011a; Wolf-Maier et al., 2003), while others report the opposite (Banks et al., 2006; Martinson et al., 2011a). Similarly, some studies report that serum lipid levels are lower in the United States than in other countries (Farzadfar et al., 2011; Martinson et al., 2011a), but another study that compared biological risk factors in American and Japanese adults over age 20\nbetween ages 15 and 59 were lower than those in nine economically comparable nations. Kunitz and Pesis-Katz (2005) reported that Americans have a shorter life expectancy than their neighbors in Canada. Meslé and Vallin (2006) and Rau et al. (2008) reported that, from 1980 to 2006, life expectancy in the United States grew more slowly than in almost every other high-income country.\nThe most extensive and recent analysis was a report by the National Research Council (2011). As noted in the Introduction of this report, that earlier report analyzed how life expectancy at age 50 had changed between 1980 and 2007, noting that it had increased by only 2.5 years in the United States compared with increases of 6.4 years in Japan, 5.2 years in Italy, and an average of 3.9 years in nine high-income countries other than the United\nfound that Americans had a higher summary risk score, including higher levels of serum lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, and obesity, especially before age 50 (Crimmins et al., 2008).*\nThe percentage of American adults who describe their health as “good” or “very good” is the highest among people in high-income countries (OECD, 2011b), but this metric is subject to some limitations. Questions about self-rated health may be answered differently across countries due to cultural differences—such as differences in the likelihood or threshold for reporting good health—and may not always track well with objective health indicators. Danish residents, for example, are known to have shorter life expectancy than people in many other countries, but they are more likely to report their health as good or excellent (Oksuzyan et al., 2010). To some extent, this paradox may reflect attitudinal differences across cultures about the relative importance of physical health for a satisfying life. Self-rated health is influenced by mental health, which may differ in the United States from other countries. Finally, questions have been raised about the statistical validity of questions about self-rated health when presented to subjects of varied nationalities. The significance of the high self-rated health of Americans is therefore not entirely clear.\n_______________________\n*Some of these inconsistencies may reflect cross-national differences in treatment patterns. Americans with hypertension and hyperlipidemia may be more likely than others to receive medication for these conditions (see Chapter 4), and this may account for lower levels of blood pressure and serum lipids observed in some studies.\nStates. As a result, the U.S. ranking in life expectancy at age 50 fell from the middle of the distribution for peer countries in 1980 to the bottom quartile by 2007. The drop was especially sharp for U.S. women (National Research Council, 2011).\nData on life expectancy at birth reveal an even more alarming pattern. Figure 1-5 shows that, among peer countries, male life expectancy at birth in the United States ranked near the bottom in 1980 and at the bottom in 2006. Figure 1-6 shows that female life expectancy, which had been near the median in 1979, ranked at the bottom in 2006. As documented in Box 1-3, the U.S. ranking on life expectancy has been deteriorating for decades and is now decades behind many peer countries.\nA notable exception to this unfavorable pattern is the higher life expectancy\nTABLE 1-2 U.S. Death Rates Relative to 16 Peer Countries, 2008\n| Cause of Death | Mortality Rate (per 100,000) | ||\n| United States | Peer Countries (N = 16) | ||\n| Unweighted Mean | Range | ||\n| Death Rates Above Average | |||\n| Cardiovascular diseasesa | 155.7 | 133.6 | 97.4–174.9 |\n| Neuropsychiatry conditionsb | 39.2 | 28.1 | 7.2–48.4 |\n| Respiratory disease | 34.3 | 21.0 | 12.7–34.4 |\n| Infectious and parasitic diseases | 15.4 | 7.7 | 4.4–17.5 |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 15.2 | 10.2 | 4.5–19.3 |\n| Genitourinary diseasesc | 12.3 | 7.2 | 3.0–12.2 |\n| Endocrine disorders | 7.1 | 4.2 | 1.6–8.1 |\n| Congenital anomalies | 4.3 | 3.3 | 2.6–4.0 |\n| Musculoskeletal diseasesd | 2.9 | 2.4 | 1.2–3.5 |\n| Nutritional deficiencies | 1.0 | 0.7 | 0.1–2.0 |\n| Skin diseases | 0.8 | 0.6 | 0.1–1.5 |\n| Maternal conditions | 0.4 | 0.1 | 0.0–0.2 |\n| Perinatal conditions | 7.1 | 3.7 | 1.3–5.9 |\n| Unintentional injuriese | 35.5 | 20.4 | 13.7–38.6 |\n| Intentional injuries | 17.3 | 11.4 | 5.6–20.2 |\n| Death Rates at or Below Average | |||\n| Malignant neoplasmsf | 123.8 | 127.3 | 106.5–157.7 |\n| Digestive diseasesg | 19.8 | 19.8 | 13.0–29.5 |\n| Respiratory infections | 9.7 | 12.3 | 4.0–29.7 |\n| Other neoplasms | 2.9 | 3.3 | 2.1–5.3 |\n| Oral conditionsg | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0–0.1 |\n| Sense organ diseasesh | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\nNOTE: Higher death rates shown in bold.\naPrimarily ischemic heart disease but also includes higher death rates from hypertensive and inflammatory heart disease.

Manton and Vaupel (1995) demonstrated that life expectancy from ages 80-95 was higher in the United States than in England, France, Japan, and Sweden.10 Fifteen years later, Ho and Preston (2010) observed the same pattern for adults over age 65. U.S. older adults had among the lowest age-specific mortality rates of 17 peer countries: this pattern has been observed in every decade since 1960, suggesting that the underlying cause is not a recent phenomenon. Researchers are unclear whether this phenomenon reflects unusually aggressive efforts in the United States to identify and treat chronic diseases or a selection process, that is, healthier adults surviving to old age (Finch and Crimmins, 2004; Ho and Preston, 2010; Janssen et al., 2005a).\n_________________\n10The one exception was for males in Japan, but the difference was not statistically significant.\nBOX 1-2\nDisparities in Life Expectancy in the United States\nThe range of life expectancies across U.S. states, which is 7.0 years for males and 6.7 years for females, exceeds the cross-national range between the United States and peer countries, which is 3.7 years for males and 5.2 years for females (see Table 1-3). Although life expectancy is very low in Appalachia and the Deep South, some states in the northern Plains and along the Pacific coast and Eastern seaboard easily outrank many peer countries. For example, males in Minnesota and Hawaii have a higher life expectancy than those in nine peer countries. Females in Hawaii have a life expectancy of 84.8 years, higher than that of every peer country except Japan (Measure of America, 2012).\nEven greater disparities are found at the county level. For example, a recent study estimated that life expectancy in 2007 varied dramatically across U.S. counties for both males (from 65.9 to 81.1 years) and females (from 73.5 to 86.0 years), although most U.S. counties still compared unfavorably with the best-performing high-income countries. Merging 3,147 counties into 2,357 county clusters suitable for statistical analysis, researchers found that only 33 counties had a male life expectancy that exceeded the average of 10 leading countries, and only 8 counties had a higher female life expectancy (Kulkarni et al., 2011).\nOf course, small geographic areas that compare unfavorably with the best countries can be found anywhere, but this may occur more often in the United States than in other high-income countries. For example, in a comparison of U.S. counties with small geographic units in three peer countries—Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom—researchers found that 17 percent of U.S. counties had a male life expectancy that was more than 30 years behind that of the top 10 countries, whereas the same was only true for 2 percent of Canadian health areas, for 0.2 percent of British local authorities, and for no Japanese municipalities (Kulkarni et al., 2011).\nThe large geographic health disparities in the United States, which have been documented to the level of census tracts and neighborhoods (Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative, 2008; Center on Human Needs, 2012b; Ezzati et al., 2008; Krieger et al., 2008), are less about geography than the characteristics of the local population and environment (Hans, 2009): see Chapters 6 and 7. For example, black infants in the United States are more than twice as likely as white infants to die before their first birthday (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012). Among black males with less than 12 years of education, life expectancy in 2008 was 14.2 years shorter than for white males with 16 or more\nyears of education (Olshansky et al., 2012). Many other poignant examples of major health disparities by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status in the United States have been documented (see, e.g., Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2011; Braveman and Egerter, 2008; Institute of Medicine, 2003d; Murray et al., 2006; National Center for Health Statistics, 2012). Disadvantaged Americans living in disadvantaged regions of the United States have very unfavorable health outcomes when compared with other countries. One study found that black and Native Americans in some regions had mortality rates that were almost twice that of the OECD countries with the highest mortality rates (Murray et al., 2006).\nLarge within-country health disparities in the United States may contribute in important ways to the nation’s overall health disadvantage relative to other high-income countries. Although studies reviewed in this report suggest that the health disadvantage relative to peer countries persists even when the U.S. data are limited to non-Hispanic whites or upper-income populations, the U.S. health disadvantage is clearly far greater among the large proportion of Americans who live amid unfavorable health conditions. And as discussed in Chapters 6 and 7, the health of the entire population may be affected by the conditions that more severely compromise the health of disadvantaged groups.\nThe National Research Council (2011) study explored potential explanations for the relatively poor U.S. performance at age 50 and older and concluded that the long history of heavy cigarette smoking in the United States accounted for a substantial share of the shortfall. Other contributors to the U.S. disadvantage included a rapid growth in obesity, significant socioeconomic inequalities, and a lack of health insurance for large segments of the population (National Research Council, 2011). These (and other) explanations are examined in Part II of this report.\nThe panel was charged with looking at “health and disability over the life-cycle” and therefore extended the prior report’s analysis of U.S. health conditions (above age 50) to younger Americans, from birth to age 50, to\nFIGURE 1-5 U.S. male life expectancy at birth relative to 21 other high-income countries, 1980-2006.\nNOTES: Red circles depict newborn life expectancy in the United States.

The United States has clearly fallen far behind its peer countries in life expectancy—both under and over age 50.\nIs higher mortality in the United States concentrated at specific ages or is it more general? Figure 1-9 displays the rank order of U.S. mortality relative to the 16 peer countries listed in Table 1-3, stratified by age group. Remarkably, the U.S. rank for either sex is never better than 15th at any age below 75. The United States has the worst ranking in most age groups, especially in the long span that stretches between birth and age 55. In short, in terms of sheer physical survival, people living in the United States fare\n_________________\n11Chapter 2 examines the U.S. disadvantage on health measures other than life expectancy, including the prevalence of diseases and injuries across the life course.\nFIGURE 1-6 U.S. female life expectancy at birth relative to 21 other high-income countries, 1980-2006.\nNOTES: Red circles depict newborn life expectancy in the United States.

When the analysis was limited to non-Hispanic whites in the United States, the poor U.S. ranking hardly changed (see Figure 1-10). At no age below 55 do U.S. non-Hispanic whites rank better than 16th out of 17 countries (for either sex). Therefore, the overall poor position of the United States cannot be attributed to any particular minority group because the disadvantage is observed even among non-Hispanic whites.\nAnother distinct aspect of the United States is the shape of its survival curve: higher mortality rates among young Americans and the increased survival of the elderly have produced a wider spread12 in the age of death\n_________________\n12The U.S. survival curve is less “rectangular” (Wilmoth and Horiuchi, 1999) than in other countries. In most peer countries, mortality is declining at a faster rate among younger ages than older ages. This phenomenon appears to be more pronounced in other countries than in the United States.\nBOX 1-3\nHow Many Years Behind Is the United States?\nOne focus of this report is the U.S. health disadvantage among younger adults. One summary measure of mortality in this age group is the probability that a 15-year-old will die before reaching age 50 (given current age-specific mortality rates). Demographers refer to this measure as 35q15, or the probability of dying in the 35 years following one’s 15th birthday. For females in the 16 peer countries, 35q15 was around 2 percent in 2007 but was approximately twice as high—4 percent—in the United States. This means that the probability of a 15-year-old U.S. female dying within 35 years was double the average for 16 peer high-income countries.\nIn all high-income countries, including the United States, 35q15 has been declining for more than half a century. But the relative position of the United States has deteriorated since the late 1950s, when it was near the average of its peers. These countries, on average, had reduced their 35q15 for females to the U.S. 2007 level of 4 percent almost 40 years earlier. In this sense, one can say that, in 2007, the United States was 40 years behind the average of its peers (and 50 years behind the leading peer country).\nFIGURE 1-3a Number of years behind the leading peer country for the probability of dying between ages 15 and 50 among females, 1958-2007.\nNOTES: The figure plots 35q15, or the probability that a 15-year-old female will die before age 50. The y-axis measures how many years earlier the 35q15 values of the 17 peer countries had been achieved by the country with the lowest 35q15 value for that year.\nSOURCE: Verguet and Jamison (2011, Figure 6).\nThis concept of “years behind” provides a useful indicator of how well a given country is keeping pace with other countries. Figure 1-3a, from Verguet and Jamison (2011), plots years behind the leader for both the United States and the average of its peers for the period 1958-2007. It shows that the United States has fallen further behind the leader, while its peer countries began to “catch up” with the leader (albeit at an uneven pace) beginning in the mid-1970s. The net result of these uneven trends has been a steady decline of the U.S. position from near average to far below average.\nFigure 1-3b also plots “years behind the leader” for both the United States and the average of its peers, but in this case it shows female mortality rates, by 5-year age groups, for a single year, 2007. These results confirm a U.S. mortality gap for females across the life span. It is most pronounced between the ages of 15 and 50 and diminishes somewhat for women above age 60.\nFIGURE 1-3b Number of years behind the leading peer country for female mortality by 5-year age group, 2007.\nNOTE: The figure shows how many years earlier female mortality in the 17 peer countries had been achieved by the country with the lowest age-specific mortality for that year.\nSOURCE: Verguet and Jamison (2011, Figure 7).\nFIGURE 1-7 Probability of survival to age 50 for males in 21 high-income countries, 1980-2006.\nNOTES: Red circles show the probability a newborn male in the United States will live to age 50.

As a result, Americans lose more years of life than do those in other high-income countries (Shkolnikov et al., 2011), a topic we address in the next section.\nYEARS OF LIFE LOST BEFORE AGE 50\nAt the turn of the 20th century, an individual born in Western Europe or North America could expect to live no more than 34 years between birth and age 50 (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1990), a loss of 16 years of life. In many countries today, a newborn can expect to live more than 49 of the first 50 years of life.13 These remarkable gains are the result of major reductions in infectious diseases among infants and young children, as well as declines\n_________________\n13Data are from the Human Mortality Database (2012).\nFIGURE 1-8 Probability of survival to age 50 for females in 21 high-income countries, 1980-2006.\nNOTES: Red circles show the probability a newborn female in the United States will live to age 50.

Figures 1-11 and 1-12 show the number of years lost before age 50 by males and females, respectively, in the 17 peer countries. U.S. male and female newborns can expect to lose about 1.4 years and 0.8 years of life, respectively, before age 50. In the best performing country, Sweden, the corresponding losses are only 0.7 and 0.4 years, respectively. This mortality gap has also grown significantly over time. In 1990, U.S. females and males lost approximately 35 percent more years of life before age 50 than did those in other high-\nFIGURE 1-9 Ranking of U.S. mortality rates, by age group, among 17 peer countries, 2006-2008.\nNOTES: The top rank is number 1, indicating the lowest death rate, and the bottom rank is number 17, indicating the highest death rate.

Because deaths in high-income countries are assigned to various causes of death by medical certifiers using internationally accepted criteria, it is possible to examine how life expectancy varies cross-nationally by cause.

It indicates how many potential years of life below age 50 are claimed by a particular cause of death—that is, how many additional years would be lived before age 50 if deaths from a particular cause were eliminated.\nTo facilitate comparisons with the United States, Ho and Preston (2011) created a composite of the other 16 peer countries by calculating an unweighted average of the age- and cause-specific death rates across these countries and grouping causes of death into the major categories used in the\n_________________\n14For deaths by cause after age 50, see National Research Council (2011).\nFIGURE 1-11 Years of life lost before age 50 by males in 17 peer countries, 2006-2008.\nNOTE: Data for this figure come from the Human Mortality Database (downloaded July 18, 2011, last updated July 13, 2011); the WHO Mortality Database (downloaded July 18, 2011, last updated March 25, 2011); and Statistics Canada (downloaded July 22, 2011, data released February 23, 2010).\nSOURCE: Adapted from Ho and Preston (2011, Figure 3).\nGlobal Burden of Disease Study (Mathers et al., 2006).

Although communicable diseases and nutritional conditions are no longer a leading cause of premature deaths in most high-income countries, the United States still fares poorly in this category. The gap in years of life lost from noncommunicable diseases—which includes heart disease, cancer, and other conditions not caused by infections—is also large. For both males and females, cardiovascular disease and congenital anomalies together account for more than half of the U.S. excess mortality from noncommunicable diseases. Diabetes, digestive diseases, and respiratory diseases also contribute to the gap.\nIntentional and unintentional injuries are also major contributors to the excess years of life lost by Americans before age 50. Intentional injuries—homicide and suicide—are particularly important causes of early deaths among U.S. males. Ho and Preston (2011) found that 69 percent of all U.S. homicide deaths in 2007 (73 percent of homicides before age 50) involved firearms (for both sexes combined), compared with a mean of 26 percent\nFIGURE 1-12 Years of life lost before age 50 by females in 17 peer countries, 2006-2008.\nNOTE: Data for this figure come from the Human Mortality Database (downloaded July 18, 2011, last updated July 13, 2011); the WHO Mortality Database (downloaded July 18, 2011, last updated March 25, 2011); and Statistics Canada (downloaded July 22, 2011, data released February 23, 2010).\nSOURCE: Adapted from Ho and Preston (2011, Figure 4).\nin the other countries. Both males and females in the United States lose an equivalent number of years of life to unintentional injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, poisonings, fires, and drowning. Unintentional poisonings are the largest contributor to nontransportation-related accidents: in 2007, they accounted for 64 percent and 72 percent of nontransportation-related U.S. deaths under age 50 among males and females, respectively.\nDrug-related deaths are another category in which the United States loses more years of life than other countries. Drug-related deaths include both drug- and alcohol-induced deaths, which account for 76 percent and 24 percent, respectively, of all drug-related deaths before age 50. This category includes deaths from medical conditions or complications induced by alcohol or drugs, selected mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol or the use of psychoactive substances, accidental or intentional alcohol or drug poisonings or overdoses, and deaths with measurable blood levels of alcohol or other addictive drugs (e.g., opiates, cocaine, hallucinogens, psychotropic drugs). This category does not include deaths from drunk driving or other accidents, homicides, or other deaths that may be indirectly related to alcohol or drug use.\nFIGURE 1-13 Years of life lost before age 50 due to specific causes of death among males in 17 peer countries, 2006-2008.\nNOTES: Drug-related and other causes are not always mutually exclusive. The largest areas of overlap occur between drug-related causes and noncommunicable diseases and injuries. For example, drug-related digestive diseases (e.g., alcoholic liver disease) and drug-related neuropsychiatric disorders are also included in the noncommunicable disease category. Suicide and homicide by drugs fall under both drug-related causes and intentional injuries, and accidental drug overdoses fall under both drugrelated causes and unintentional injuries. The drug-related causes category is included to illustrate the excess years of life lost from drug-related causes of death in the United States relative to other countries.

Three causes—homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and nontransportation-related injuries—each contribute between 16 and 19 percent of the U.S. shortfall for males, and suicide contributes another 4 percent. Thus, deaths from injury of one form or another contribute the majority, 57 percent, of the excess mortality among American males under age 50. This is especially noteworthy given that mortality below age 50 accounts for the bulk of the U.S. male disadvantage in longevity. Noncommunicable diseases among men are also not trivial, accounting for 18 percent of the U.S. excess in years of life lost, with 8 percent coming from cardiovascular disease and 10 percent from all other noncommunicable diseases.\nFIGURE 1-14 Years of life lost before age 50 due to specific causes of death among females in 17 peer countries, 2006-2008.\nNOTES: Drug-related and other causes are not always mutually exclusive.

Homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and nontransportation-related accidents also play an important role, contributing a total of 37 percent of the excess years of life lost in the United States. For intentional injuries, the excess comes from homicide alone, because U.S. women lose fewer years of life to suicide than women in other peer countries. Noncommunicable diseases are more important for women, contributing 29 percent of the U.S. excess in years of life lost compared with 18 percent for men. Of this 29 percent, 9 percent comes from cardiovascular disease and the remaining 20 percent from all other noncommunicable diseases. Perinatal conditions also affect females more than males: they contribute 19 percent to the U.S. excess in years of life lost among females and 13 percent among males (Ho and Preston, 2011).\nFIGURE 1-15 Contribution of cause-of-death categories to difference in years of life lost before age 50 between the United States and the mean of 16 peer countries, males, 2006-2008.\nNOTES: Because of the overlap with other cause-of-death categories, drug-related causes are not included as a separate category in this figure, which shows mutually exclusive contributions of specific causes of death (see NOTES in Figure 1-13).

That is: does the average American newborn have a shorter life expectancy than peers in other countries because of the diseases of old age or because of threats to health earlier in life? Answering this question involves a calculation that combines the actual years of life lost before age 50 (as shown in Figures 1-11 and 1-12) with the probability of surviving to age 50 (as shown in Figures 1-7 and 1-8). The latter is included because individuals who die before age 50 obviously forfeit all years of life beyond that age, but the forfeiture\nFIGURE 1-16 Contribution of cause-of-death categories to difference in years of life lost before age 50 between the United States and the mean of 16 peer countries, females, 2006-2008.\nNOTES: Because of the overlap with other cause-of-death categories, drug-related causes are not included as a separate category in this figure, which shows mutually exclusive contributions of specific causes of death (see NOTES in Figure 1-14).

The calculation reveals that about two-thirds of the U.S. shortfall in life expectancy in 2007 relative to France and Japan—two very high-performing countries—were attributable to high U.S. mortality after age 50 (Ho and Preston, 2011).\nA somewhat different picture emerges when the results are separated by sex and the comparison is made with the composite of the other 16 peer countries. Deaths after age 50 contributed to 58 percent of the U.S. shortfall in newborn life expectancy among females but only to 32 percent of the shortfall among newborn males (Ho and Preston, 2011). That is, most of the life expectancy difference among males is attributable to high U.S. mortality before age 50. This finding also implicates intentional and unintentional\ninjuries, discussed above, which together account for a majority of the excess in U.S. male mortality before age 50.\nVital statistics paint a definitive and vivid portrait of the relative position of the United States in cross-national health comparisons. On nearly all indicators of mortality, survival, and life expectancy, the United States ranks at or near the bottom among high-income countries. Its poor performance pertains to both sexes, to all ages below 75, to white non-Hispanics as well as to the population as a whole, and to the most important causes of death.\nAlthough the poor ranking of U.S. life expectancy at birth is partly attributable to relatively higher mortality rates after age 50, that is not the entire story: the United States compares unfavorably on mortality rates up to age 75. U.S. performance is particularly poor from birth to age 50, ranking near the bottom among peer countries. These findings and those from previous research, including the prior National Research Council (2011) report, suggest that throughout the life course people living in the United States fare worse than their peers, except at the oldest ages.\nThe data reported here highlight specific threats to health early in life, beginning in infancy: the United States has the lowest life expectancy at birth of the 17 peer countries the panel examined. Accidents (unintentional injuries), many of which involve adolescents and young adults, claim about 30 percent of the years lost before age 50, and suicides and violence also contribute to deaths in this age group. Noncommunicable diseases become more of a factor after age 30.\nIn summary, there is a growing mortality gap between the United States and comparable high-income countries. If the United States experienced the same rates of mortality due to unintentional injuries and noncommunicable diseases as do other peer countries, then almost two-thirds of the excess losses in years of life lost before age 50 would be eliminated (Palloni and Yonker, 2012). To add to the analysis in this chapter, which focuses on life expectancy, the next chapter examines how the United States compares with other countries in terms of quality of life, specifically, health status, the prevalence of disease, and the incidence of injuries.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Reducing Suicides by Firearms\n- 20184\nAbstract\nSuicide by firearm is a public health problem. In 2016, firearm suicides accounted for half of all suicide deaths in the United States. Access to a firearm, particularly during a time of increased risk for suicide (e.g., divorce, job loss), has been identified as a key factor increasing one’s risk for completing suicide. States with higher rates of gun ownership have higher suicide rates than states with low gun ownership, whereas non–firearm suicide rates are comparable, indicating that firearm access drives overall suicide rates. The most promising evidence-based strategies to reduce access to firearms during a period of high risk are (1) temporary relocation of household firearms away from home when a family member is at risk for suicide, (2) safe storage at home if relocation is not possible, (3) working with leaders in the gun community to develop and implement messaging about the preceding two strategies that will be acceptable to gun owners, and (4) increasing screening for and counseling about access to guns by health professionals and other gatekeepers. Working with gun owners, industry, law enforcement, physical and mental health professionals, and researchers is important in decreasing firearm suicides via evidence-based strategies. Declines in firearm suicides do not require decreased gun ownership rates. A concerted social marketing approach can incorporate firearm suicide prevention into standard firearm safety messaging. Moreover, the entertainment industry can model firearm suicide prevention behaviors. Through these efforts, firearm safety can include suicide prevention in a manner fully consistent with the Second Amendment.\nRelationship to Existing APHA Policy Statements\nThe following APHA policy statements are relevant to the current statement:\n- APHA Policy Statement 7524(PP): Suicide Prevention\n- APHA Policy Statement 9818: Handgun Injury Reduction\nThis statement supplements 7524 regarding the role of firearms in suicide. Statement 9818 is replaced by this statement.\nProblem Statement\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide rates in the United States have increased by nearly one third over the past 20 years, with half of U.S. states experiencing an increase above 30% during this period.[1] Rates have risen among both sexes, all racial/ethnic groups, and all age groups under 75 years, as well as in rural, suburban, and urban settings.[2,3] There were 44,965 suicide deaths in the United States in 2016, with an age-adjusted rate of 15.6 per 100,000.[4] Suicide was the second-leading cause of death among individuals 10–14, 15–24, and 25–34 years of age.[5] It was the 10th-leading cause of death among all age groups combined and is one of only three leading causes that are increasing in prevalence.[5,6]\nWhile suicide affects all individuals, males are four times more likely than females to die by suicide,[4] and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts, planning, and attempts is significantly higher among younger age groups (18–29 years) than older age groups.[7] Racial/ethnic and other groups with high suicide rates include American Indians and Alaska Natives, rural populations, and active or retired military personnel.[8] Suicide also affects the health of others; when people die by suicide, their family, friends, and community often experience shock, anger, guilt, and depression.\nSuicide is a public health problem both economically and physically. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, the estimated average cost of a single suicide is $1,329,553.[9] Nearly all of this cost (97%) is attributed to lost productivity, with the remaining 3% due to medical treatment. It has been reported that the total cost of suicides and suicide attempts is $70 billion per year.[10]\nMultiple risk factors for suicide exist, including a previous suicide attempt (the strongest predictor), a history of depression or other mental illness, alcohol or drug abuse, a family history of suicide or violence, physical illness, and a feeling of being alone.[11,12] However, as evidenced by the far greater prevalence of these factors than of suicide deaths, most people with one or more such risk factors do not go on to die by suicide.[13] While individuals with these risk factors are encouraged to obtain mental health treatment, many of those who die by suicide have no known record of such treatment,[1] indicating a need for additional strategies to increase the safety of people at risk. Reducing access to lethal means is one such strategy.\nThere is ample evidence that suicidality is transitory. Should a person survive a suicidal impulse, his or her prognosis is quite good. The results of a meta-analysis of nearly 100 studies of suicide attempters showed that 90% of attempters who survive do not go on to die by suicide.[14] In fact, many suicide attempts occur with little planning,[15,16] often in response to a short-term crisis.[17,18] However, if a person attempts suicide through a means that is highly lethal, such as a firearm, the odds of survival are quite low.[19]\nOne must not opt to make a suicide attempt using a highly lethal means such as a firearm if there is to be any opportunity to obtain mental health treatment or endure a painful short-term crisis. In 2016, 51% of all suicide deaths in the United States (a total of 22,936 deaths) involved firearms, with an age-adjusted rate of 7.8 per 100,000.[4] In nearly every age group, firearms were the leading mechanism for suicide deaths (among 10- to 14-year-olds, they were the second-leading mechanism).[4] Access to firearms is a key risk factor for suicide.[20–23] Several studies have shown that rates of suicide are higher in states with higher levels of gun ownership (but not higher rates of suicide attempts) and that these heightened rates are driven by increases in firearm suicides.[21,22,24] Suicides by methods other than firearms are not significantly different in states with lower or higher overall suicide rates.[24] Multiple reviews offer strong evidence that rises in gun ownership prevalence are associated with increases in firearm suicides, which in turn lead to increases in the overall suicide rate.[25–27] Studies of gun prevalence and suicide rates typically control for multiple potential confounders such as psychological distress, substance use, poverty, education, and unemployment.[22,28,29] They also typically reveal that the relationship between household gun ownership and suicide rates holds for men, women, children 5 to 14 years old, and those in nearly every other age group.[30–32] Decreasing the number of firearm suicides would yield a significant reduction in the overall suicide rate in the United States.[20–22]\nA note on terminology: It is recognized in this policy statement that the terms “firearm” and “gun” are not identical in the weapons they cover. Precisely speaking, this statement addresses suicide by firearm. However, in much of the scientific literature, mass media, and common speech, the term gun is used when firearm would be more accurate. Here the term firearm is primarily used; however, in some cases the term gun is used when quoting the literature or referring to programs that use similar language (e.g., gun violence restraining order).\nEvidence-Based Strategies to Address the Problem\nA number of international studies have indicated that when lethal means are made less available or less deadly, suicide rates by the method in question decline, and often (when the method is commonly used) suicide rates overall decline.[27,33] This has been demonstrated in multiple countries and with a variety of suicide methods: bridges, domestic gas, pesticides, medications, and firearms.[34–38] Decreasing access to firearms is likely to reduce suicide in the United States overall because firearms are the most commonly used method,[4] consistent with their ubiquity in certain regions of the country (personal gun ownership is estimated to be as high as 25% in the South)[39] and high case fatality rate (92% versus 78% for hanging and lower percentages for other methods).[19] In addition, the speed with which one can carry out suicide by firearm increases the odds of a fatal outcome during an unplanned attempt or one involving minimal planning: 25% of attempters make an attempt within 5 minutes of deciding to end their lives.[16] Creating safer environments for those at risk of suicide by reducing their access to highly lethal means is emphasized in the CDC’s technical guidelines for preventing suicide.[8] Numerous U.S.-based studies indicate that the most promising evidence-based strategies to decrease firearm suicides involve reducing access to guns in the following ways: (1) relocation of household firearms away from the home when a family member is at risk for suicide, (2) safe storage at home if relocation is not possible, (3) working with leaders in the gun community to develop and implement messaging about the preceding two strategies that will be favorable to most gun owners, and (4) increasing screening for access to firearms by health professionals and other gatekeepers.\nRelocation of household firearms away from home when a family member is at risk for suicide: Between 2003 and 2005, about 90% of all suicides in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), a mandatory population-based army drafting all youths 18–21 years of age, were firearm suicides. Since many IDF soldiers go home on the weekends, the IDF changed its weapons policy in 2006 to require that firearms remain on base when soldiers take a weekend leave. After this policy change, the overall IDF suicide rate decreased by 40% in 2007–2008. Most of this decrease was due to a reduction in weekend firearm suicides; there was no significant change in weekday suicide rates.[38] A study of suicides in Switzerland showed that when the army halved the number of soldiers from 2003 to 2004 (leading to a decrease in gun availability nationwide), both firearm suicide and overall suicide (but not non-firearm suicide) rates dropped among military-aged men but not military-aged women or older men.[40]\nThese IDF and Switzerland data support nationwide research indicating that restricting firearm access is effective in decreasing overall suicide rates. Over a 3-year period (2000–2002), the 15 states with the highest household firearm ownership rate (47%) had almost twice as many suicides (14,809) as the six states with the lowest ownership rate (15%; 8,052 suicides). This difference in overall suicides was largely accounted for by the difference in firearm suicides (9,749 versus 2,606). Non-firearm suicides and the total populations of the two sets of states were comparable.[22] During a more recent 2-year period (2008–2009), these findings persisted.[24] If the relationship is causal, these results suggest that a 1% decrease in household firearm ownership could reduce the firearm suicide rate by 3.5% and the overall suicide rate by 1.5%, with even greater effects for adolescents.[22] By extrapolation, reducing household firearm ownership by 5% could prevent about 3,000 suicides per year in the United States.[4] This is not to say, however, that gun owners must sell their firearms in order to reduce firearm suicides. Suicide prevention professionals are having success working with gun owners to help them identify offsite storage options (e.g., firearm retailers, shooting ranges, pawn shops, law enforcement facilities, storage facilities, and family members and friends authorized to store firearms) that will keep loved ones safe while preserving gun ownership rights.[41,42] These options could be temporary or permanent depending on the gun owner and his or her family’s assessment of the benefits and risks of bringing firearms back into the home.\nSafe storage of firearms at home: A gun owner may not find temporary relocation of firearms outside the home to be feasible. Gun owners may wish to talk over tenable storage options with loved ones as well as with mental health clinicians or other health professionals. In the event firearms cannot be relocated, numerous studies indicate a reduced risk of firearm suicide when household guns are stored locked and unloaded, with ammunition locked separately.[23,43,44] Having a locked gun closet, keeping firearms unloaded, and locking ammunition or storing it in a different part of the house each reduces the risk of suicide by 55% to 73%.[23] One study revealed that the risk of suicide was three times greater among individuals in households with loaded firearms than among those in homes with unloaded guns. Households with guns stored in unlocked places were associated with more than twice the risk of suicide than households in which firearms were kept in a locked place, and homes with one or more handguns were associated with a risk of suicide almost twice as high as that in homes containing only long guns.[43] An evaluation of a community-based giveaway of gun storage devices indicated a 13% increase in safe storage of firearms.[45] Also, a review of firearm safe storage interventions showed that providing owners with a safety device such as a lock box significantly improved storage practices.[46] Safe storage of firearms in the home is a critical component of reducing firearm suicide.\nEducation of gun owners on the relationship between firearms and suicide: Since 2009, gun rights advocates and suicide prevention experts have been working together to develop and test messages for gun owners on the importance of temporarily relocating firearms outside the home when a household member is struggling with a mental health or substance abuse problem or going through a painful crisis such as a divorce or job loss. A study of firearm retailers in New Hampshire showed that 48% of retailers that received intervention materials were still using at least one of the materials several months later. Retailers who believed that there was a relationship between firearm accessibility and risk of suicide were more likely to be using intervention materials.[41] Changing social norms related to firearms and safety is critical in intervention efforts and requires spreading accurate information via trusted messengers. Success in changing norms has been shown elsewhere in the public health literature, illustrating the role of advocacy and grassroots efforts, especially when combined with a multicomponent strategy.\nFor example, campaigns have been effective in spreading messages about the physical dangers and legal consequences of drunk driving.[47] An especially successful organization is Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Through its widespread programs, services, and legislative efforts, MADD has influenced social norms related to drinking and driving such that the number of U.S. alcohol-related auto fatalities fell from 25,000 to 17,000 between 1982 and 2003, while the number of auto fatalities from crashes unrelated to alcohol increased from 18,000 to 25,000.[48,49] During that time, the entertainment industry worked with public health experts to promote the “designated driver” campaign on popular television shows.[50] The industry has also worked with public health experts to promote the use of checklists during surgery, educate the public about human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV, reduce the occurrence of smoking in youth-rated movies, and publicize countless other public health issues.[51–53] The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s recent partnership with the National Shooting Sports Foundation is an important step toward communicating effectively with gun owners about preventing firearm suicides.[54]\nIncreasing screening for access to firearms: Doctors, nurses, mental health providers, and other health professionals have a critical opportunity to increase awareness about the link between firearms and suicide among those living in homes with firearms. Many people considering suicide do not seek mental health services, so it is important for primary care providers, emergency department (ED) doctors, and other health providers to screen for access to firearms, even among patients without mental health concerns.[55,56] One study showed a threefold increase in actions intended to limit access to household firearms among parents who brought their children to an ED for mental health treatment and received counseling on firearm access relative to those who did not receive counseling in the ED.[57] A more recent study revealed an increase in safe storage of firearms after ED-based counseling.[58] In spite of this, another recent study showed that only 18% of suicidal patients presenting at an ED received a lethal means assessment, with only 8% of these individuals receiving actual counseling on how to reduce access to lethal means.[59] Surveys of providers have shown that only 50% usually screen for access to firearms among suicidal patients, even though most think it is important to do so.[60] There are resources available to educate providers on the importance of conducting lethal means counseling and how to do so in a way that is respectful of the right to own guns.[61]\nEach of these four strategies would benefit greatly from funding to further examine effective methods of implementation, but suicide prevention research is woefully underfunded. Alcoholism receives five times more research funding for 50% more deaths, and breast cancer receives nearly seven times more funding for fewer annual deaths.[62]\nOpposing Arguments/Evidence\nFirearm suicide is a public health issue wrought with assumptions and misinformation. While suicide is a subject familiar to Americans, guns as a suicidal determinant are underestimated. A common assumption is that suicide is premeditated, giving a person ample time to obtain access to a highly lethal means such as a firearm. While some suicides are planned, many suicide attempts occur within less than an hour of thinking about them.[15,16] Depression and substance abuse are risk factors for suicide that a person may be managing long term, but the elevated risk of a suicidal attempt is often short and fleeting.[16,63] A person experiencing an acutely distressing incident may respond impulsively to suicidal thoughts.[63] If this person does not have access to a highly lethal means such as a firearm during this crisis, she or he is more likely to survive the crisis either by attempting suicide with a less lethal means and surviving or by opting not to make an attempt at all.[27]\nIt is often argued that someone suicidal cannot be stopped, regardless of what methods are readily available. This implies that someone who survives a suicide attempt will simply die by suicide in a subsequent attempt. While there are certainly some suicides that cannot be prevented, as previously mentioned, a review of nearly 100 studies determined that 90% of people who attempted suicide and survived did not go on to die by suicide later.[14] One is more likely to survive a suicide attempt if one does not use the most highly lethal means available to make that attempt. Firearm suicide is the suicide method with the highest case fatality rate, with over 90% of attempts resulting in death.[19] By contrast, case fatality rates for hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning, and drug poisoning are 61%, 42%, and 2%, respectively.[19] Most people who die by suicide have not made an earlier attempt.[64,65] Their choice of method does not leave room for a change of heart later, whereas other methods do, and we see the change of heart in the literature on those who survive suicide attempts. Unfortunately, a firearm typically results in death after only one attempt.[66]\nThose opposed to reducing firearm access have pointed out that some countries have high suicide rates but low firearm ownership rates. The effectiveness of means restriction in suicide reduction is well documented across a variety of means. Australian suicide rates decreased as barbiturate access was restricted.[67] Suicide in Asia dropped once access to pesticide, the most common means of suicide in the region, was limited.[36] In the United Kingdom in the 1960s, carbon monoxide levels in domestic gas were reduced from 20% to nearly 0%, corresponding with a 30% decrease in the suicide rate.[35] Countries seeking to reduce their suicide rate should contemplate means reduction strategies for the methods most likely to effect a sizeable reduction in suicides among their population. In the United States, firearms are the most common method of suicide.[20,27,63]\nWhen asked about offering gun storage, some retailers have expressed concern about liability risks should a death occur once the firearm has been returned to the owner.[68] Having discussed this issue with lawyers familiar with relevant case law, the authors are unaware of any evidence of legal liability for events that might occur when a gun is returned.[69]\nSome would oppose reducing access to lethal means because this would make a firearm unavailable for self-defense. Each household must weigh the likelihood of needing a firearm for self-defense against the likelihood of that firearm being used in a suicide or other gun death. These odds may well change repeatedly over time and can be reassessed regularly.\nThere have also been challenges to the professional autonomy of doctors involving the powers of the state to limit the topics that physicians can discuss with patients. In Florida, an act that prohibited physicians from asking patients about firearm ownership and storage was ruled invalid by the courts.[70] While there is the possibility of additional attempts to gag medical professionals, this ruling supports the rights of physicians.\nAlternative Strategies\nIn popular media regarding firearm violence, both self-directed and outward, mental health care is often raised as the most important method for preventing shooting deaths.[71] The importance of access to mental health treatment cannot be denied. However, a recent CDC report noted that 54% of suicide decedents in 27 states in 2015 did not have a known mental health condition.[1] If, for the sake of argument, it is assumed that those decedents had an undiagnosed mental illness, it must be acknowledged that a lethal suicide attempt cut short the available time for persuading them to seek help. The pervasive stigma against acknowledging mental health struggles, as well as the lack of a cure for mental illnesses, must also be noted. The mental health field cannot be solely responsible for the universe of people at risk for suicide. Support from public health can be offered around how to talk about firearms with patients and their loved ones, as well as around information about local storage options for families seeking alternatives to storing firearms at home. Furthermore, the majority of people living with mental illness will not attempt suicide, and predicting who among them will is a very inexact science.[71] It is important not to reduce their propensity to seek treatment by categorically infringing upon their rights (e.g., by prohibiting anyone who has ever been diagnosed with a mental illness from owning a firearm).[72,73] Moreover, research into the impact of mental health on suicide has demonstrated that firearm access has independent effects on risk above and beyond other covarying risk factors, including mental illness. [24]\nThere are two other ways to reduce access to guns among those at risk for suicide that are more controversial and lack sufficient evidence to currently promote their implementation as firearm suicide prevention strategies: gun violence restraining orders (or other legislative approaches) and smart gun technology.\nGun violence restraining orders allow family members, intimate partners, and law enforcement personnel to formally request confiscation of firearms that belong to someone at risk of hurting him- or herself or others. These orders are fairly new, and their efficacy is as yet undetermined regarding firearm suicide prevention.[74] It is worth noting that 30% to 40% of firearm sales take place in the secondary market, where sellers are unlicensed, meaning that law enforcement cannot rely on a database to know what guns are in the home to confiscate.[75] Furthermore, a detailed discussion of legislative approaches in general was left out of this policy statement for several reasons. First, studies of firearm legislation and suicide, even those controlling for gun ownership rates, have been unable to demonstrate an actual reduction in firearm availability stemming from such legislation.[27] Second, the U.S. gun stock is so large relative to the marginal firearm likely to be affected by a given piece of legislation that, similar to Azrael and Miller,[27] the authors of this statement are unwilling to assume that firearm exposures have changed sufficiently to impact suicide rates as a result of said legislation. Finally, legislating gun access stands to further deepen the divide between gun owners and non–gun owners. Instead, health professionals can support innovative work being done within suicide prevention to regard gun owners as part of the solution rather than part of the problem.[76–78] With more research, strategies to reduce firearm suicide deaths may involve contemplating a legislative agenda; however, gun owners may not be receptive. This would be counterproductive to efforts regarding the present policy.\nSmart gun technology prevents unauthorized use of a firearm by rendering it inoperable for anyone other than the owner. This could potentially prevent many suicidal individuals from obtaining quick access to a firearm, especially in the home (e.g., adolescents). However, this technology is not sufficiently widespread to evaluate its impact on firearm suicide,[26] and support for such an approach among gun owners is limited.[79]\nAction Steps\n- Mental health advocates and governing associations for mental health professionals should adopt and promote available guidelines for mental health providers on screening for guns in the home if a client/patient is having a psychiatric crisis or has a chronic mental illness.[58,61] State-level professional associations should equip mental health providers with information about local offsite storage options when available for families that need to temporarily or permanently relocate their firearms outside the home.\n- State associations affiliated with national organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, or accreditors such as the Joint Commission and the American College of Surgeons, should adopt and promote guidelines promulgated by their parent organizations advocating screening for firearms in the home along with counseling so that lethal means reduction awareness can be spread in general office appointments and emergency departments and safe storage strategies can be discussed, in addition to provision of firearm safety devices when possible.\n- State public health agencies should collaborate with public safety and mental health agencies to advocate for an increase in the availability of temporary firearm storage outside the home. Law enforcement personnel, firearm retailers, range owners, instructors, and other leaders in the firearms community are important partners, as they can provide low-cost gun storage for clients and normalize the inclusion of suicide prevention in gun safety education.\n- Public safety agencies should work with the legal community to educate law enforcement personnel and retailers/range owners about their rights and protections should they offer firearm storage.\n- Public health and mental health agencies should collaborate with firearm owners to increase awareness of the importance of lethal means reduction when a loved one is at risk for suicide. It is important to include gun owners as part of the solution instead of assuming that they are opposed to safety measures when it comes to firearm suicides.\n- Public health agencies and advocates should collaborate with the entertainment industry as well as the news media and communications firms to support safe storage practices. Films, television shows, news stories, and so forth should provide venues to normalize messaging on gun access in instances in which there is concern about someone’s risk for suicide (whether on the part of a parent, spouse, health provider, teacher, or other concerned stakeholder).\n- Public health agencies should collaborate with gun owners and suicide prevention professionals to advocate for increased public and private funding of firearm suicide research. A small number of private foundations and funders have shouldered an undue portion of the responsibility to fund firearm research efforts, as support from the federal government and large foundations is minimal. Public agencies should work with foundations and private funders to develop funding opportunities that support firearm suicide prevention.[78] Such efforts should include development and evaluation of firearm safety education that incorporates suicide prevention and development of social marketing campaigns around firearm suicide prevention.\nReferences\n1.
