During the primary, Obama vowed to renegotiate NAFTA - and opt-out of the agreement if Canada and Mexico refused to join in doing so - but his plans, as they now stand, do not represent a significant overhaul of the agreement.\nThe primary change would be the addition of environmental and labor provisions, similar to those included in a recent trade agreement with Peru, that many economists say will not have much impact on the U.S. job market.\n\"Mexico and Canada could accept the same deal that Peru accepted and it wouldn't cause a big problem internationally, nor would it make much of a difference for U.S. workers or create any new jobs in the United States,\" said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nObama also appears to be backing off somewhat from his heated rhetoric from the primary campaign. He suggested in an interview with Fortune this week that he doesn't want to unilaterally renegotiate NAFTA, adding that \"[s]ometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified.\"\nObama has made clear in speeches that he does not oppose global trade: In a speech Monday in Flint, Michigan, he said he disagrees with those who believe \"that the only chance to maintain our living standards is to build a fortress around America [and] to stop trading with other countries.\"\nBut the campaign of presumptive GOP nominee John McCain has seized on Obama's NAFTA rhetoric, as well as his opposition to trade deals with South Korea and Columbia, to suggest that the presumptive nominee could be considered \"the most protectionist candidate that the Democratic Party has ever fielded,\" in the words of McCain adviser Carly Fiorina.\nDuring a speech in Ottawa, Canada today on free trade, the Arizona senator, who supports the Korea and Columbia trade deals, did not mention Obama by name. But the target of his comments was clear.\n\"...even now, for all the successes of NAFTA, we have to defend it without equivocation in political debate, because it is critical to the future of so many Canadian and American workers and businesses,\" McCain said, according to his remarks as prepared for delivery. \"Demanding unilateral changes and threatening to abrogate an agreement that has increased trade and prosperity is nothing more than retreating behind protectionist walls.\"\nObama economic advisor economic advisor Daniel Tarullo sharply disputes the characterization of Obama as protectionist. He suggests that the candidate wants a trade policy that shifts the benefits of globalization more in favor of labor, and argues that there are both economic and ethical considerations behind renegotiating NAFTA. Doing so, he argues, would help level the playing field by making it easier to eliminate practices like child labor and lax environmental regulation in foreign countries, both of which put American workers at a disadvantage.\n\"Senator Obama recognizes the impact of trade upon all Americans and wants a trade policy that works for all Americans, as opposed to Senator McCain who appears to never having seen a trade agreement he doesn't like,\" said Tarullo. \"Senator McCain, like President Bush, appears to embrace these agreements across the board without an assessment of their impact on U.S. workers and on standards around the world.\"\nNot all of Obama's free trade critics see the Illinois senator as protectionist: Some suggest that his rhetoric on the issue amounts to pandering, since the impact of his proposed new labor and environmental standards would be relatively minor while \"the risks of renegotiation are huge,\" in the words of the Washington Post editorial board.\nObama's strong rhetoric on NAFTA, which most economists believe has been beneficial to U.S. interests, has also left him open to charges that he was overplaying how significant his proposed changes will be - an impression stoked by (disputed) reports that one of his economic advisors used back channels to assure the Canadian government that Obama's NAFTA rhetoric was more about politics than policy.\n\"He shouldn't make any promises to the Michigan worker that it's going to bring back their jobs,\" said one liberal economist who spoke on background.\nObama is surrounded by economic advisors who are largely supportive of free trade, and protectionist rhetoric won't enhance his stated plan to improve U.S. relations around the world. But he also covets the support of working-class voters in states like Ohio with whom such rhetoric can play well, leaving him walking a fine line as he addresses the issue in the run-up to the general election. (In an AP-Yahoo News conducted earlier this year, 64 percent of those polled said increasing international trade has hurt the economy.) Like many Democrats, Obama recently supported a Farm Bill that critics consider effectively anti-trade.\nConsider the Korea deal: Obama's objections are tied, in part, to opposition to the agreement from the United Auto Workers Union and Ford Motor Company, who say unfair barriers are keeping them from selling American cars in the country.\n\"If South Korea is selling hundreds of thousands of cars to the United States and we can only sell less than 5,000 in South Korea, something is wrong,\" Obama said last week. He also objects to restrictions on South Korean imports of U.S. beef, which are tied to U.S. safety standards and concerns about mad cow disease. (Koreans have protested over the issue.)\nAccording to Schott, Obama's opposition to the deal is grounded in politics.\n\"We're going to have a large trade deficit with autos whether we have this deal or not,\" he said, arguing that there would be a political cost, as well as an economic one, should the deal fail.\nBut Tarullo says that Obama believes the deal, as negotiated by the Bush administration, simply does not do a good enough job of ensuring that U.S. products have effective access to the Korean market.\n\"American negotiators should drive a hard bargain to get what's in the best interests of American workers,\" he said.\nBy Brian Montopoli\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR.\nToday’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.\nWe are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards.\nSo, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it.\nI thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production?\nKISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you.\nSo, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world.\nAnd it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize.\nSo, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds.\nFASKIANOS: Fantastic.\nI thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic.\nKISSANE: Sure.\nSo, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil.\nYou know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day.\nSo, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand.\nAnd you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation.\nSo, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers.\nAnd again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision.\nNow, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+.\nAnd these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves.\nAnd then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand.\nBut again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies.\nAnd so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas.\nAnd then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand.\nAnd I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil.\nAnd again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day.\nAnd then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies.\nBut again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil.\nAnd again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less.\nSo, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great.\nSo now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments.\n(Gives queuing instructions.)\nAll right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself.\n(Pause.)\nYou are still muted.\n(Pause.)\nOK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK.\nLet’s go to Morton Holbrook.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon.\nDr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market?\nThank you.\nKISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question.\nYeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency.\nSo, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil.\nI think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system.\nOne of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten.\nSo, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand.\nNow, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil.\nAnd I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil.\nSo, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles.\nBut there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia?\nKISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one.\nSo, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done.\nAnd again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil.\nSo, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted.\nSo, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting.\nBut I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship.\nThat’s a great question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.\nQ: Hello?\nFASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open.\nQ: Can you hear me now?\nFASKIANOS: Yes.\nQ: That’s better. OK.\nFASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nQ: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is.\nQ: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn.\nMy question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund?\nAnd thank you to Mrs. Irina.\nKISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar.\nSo, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question.\nQ: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund?\nKISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question.\nYou know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well.\nYou know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world.\nSo, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil.\nBut I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean.\nBut again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil.\nAnd you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR.\nBut thank you for the question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil?\nKISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question.\nSo, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located?\nSo you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity.\nYou know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States.\nSo, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?\nKISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.\nYeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron.\nBut I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential.\nSo, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue.\nAnd another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself.\nQ: Can you hear me, please?\nFASKIANOS: Yes, we can.\nQ: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University.\nAnd my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent?\nKISSANE: Thank you.\nQ: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that.\nKISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question.\nYeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure.\nI think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based.\nAnd that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal.\nAnd I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important.\nAnd again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa.\nSo again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach.\nSo, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that.\nKISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question.\nYeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent.\nSo, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies.\nAnd so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition.\nSo, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition.\nSo, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change.\nSo you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program.\nJust to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries?\nFASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct?\nQ: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nKISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?\nCan I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but—\nQ: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)?\nKISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries.\nYou know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there.\nSomeone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it.\nI think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward.\nFASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this?\nKISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.\nYou know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil.\nAnd one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia.\nAnd we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to.\nAnd again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions.\nAnd you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it.\nA really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel.\nSo, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?\nKISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference.\nYeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open.\nSo, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system.\nSweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero.\nWe also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy.\nSo, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear.\nSo, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system.\nFASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all.\nSo, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina.\nSo, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy?\nKISSANE: Great question.\nI think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play.\nI think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe.\nThat said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition.\nFASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for?\nKISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like.\nI think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical.\nSo, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex.\nSo, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.\nFASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

Nevertheless, as you’d expect, I combine my grim view of politicians’ overall character with an equally grim assessment of their personal honesty. Imagine my surprise, then, to see PolitiFact confirm my suspicious. Fact-checker Angie Holan in the NYT:\nWe don’t check absolutely everything a candidate says, but focus on what catches our eye\nas significant, newsworthy or potentially influential. Our ratings are\nalso not intended to be statistically representative but to show trends\nover time.[…]\n[J]ournalists regularly tell me their media organizations have started\nhighlighting fact-checking in their reporting because so many people\nclick on fact-checking stories after a debate or high-profile news\nevent. Many readers now want fact-checking as part of traditional news\nstories as well; they will vocally complain to ombudsmen and readers’ representatives when they see news stories repeating discredited factual claims.That’s\nnot to say that fact-checking is a cure-all. Partisan audiences will\nsavage fact-checks that contradict their views, and that’s true of both the right and the left. But “truthiness” can’t survive indefinitely in a fact-free vacuum.\nHere’s what they find for today’s presidential hopefuls, plus Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n“What I have done — and this is unprecedented … is I’ve said to each\nagency … ‘look at regulations that are already on the books and if\nthey don’t make sense, let’s get rid of them.'”\n(Obama, 2011)\nPolitifact scores this as “Pants on Fire” because Bush I and Clinton also took this “unprecedented” move.\nDean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for\nEconomic and Policy Research, called Obama’s comment a “nonsense claim.”“I would question whether President Obama has done more in re-examining\nexisting regulations than prior presidents, and if he has I would ask\nwhy he wasted the resources,” Baker told us via e-mail. “Whatever it is\ncalled, presidents are always reviewing regulations to eliminate ones\nthat impose unnecessary burdens.”In fact, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report\non July 16, 2007, states that, “Every president since President Carter\nhas directed agencies to evaluate or reconsider existing regulations.”\nWhile I agree that Obama’s pants are indeed on fire here, it’s not because previous presidents have also tried to eliminate the regulations that “don’t make sense.” It’s because no president has ever earnestly done so. To eliminate senseless regulations, regulators would have to go through existing regs one-by-one, abolishing everything without a solid argument behind it. In legalese, regulations would at minimum have to survive “intermediate scrutiny” in order to stay on the books:\nIn order for a law to pass intermediate scrutiny, it must:\n- Serve an important government objective, and\n- Be substantially related to achieving the objective.\nStill, I don’t want to make the best the enemy of the good. Though PolitFact’s standards strike me as lax, leading politicians still fall very short of honesty. And that’s a fact.\nREADER COMMENTS\nE. Harding\nDec 17 2015 at 12:45am\nCome on. I largely agree with the words of this post, but that chart is as misleading as heck. Martin O’Malley and Bernie don’t lie? I agree with you that all politicians lie, but you must admit that PolitiFact must be heavily skewing its investigations of politicians’ statements, and that due to this highly selective coverage, conservative Republicans systemically come out worse here than liberal Democrats. No politician’s set of statements in PolitiFact is directly comparable to some other’s.\n“Though partisans will predictably cry foul, I trust Politifact more than partisans.”\n-I don’t.\nJohn Thacker\nDec 17 2015 at 7:10am\nUnfortunately, I’ve looked at too many Politifact ratings to consider them anything other than partisans. Most politicians (and other people, certainly including op-ed writers) make a lot of “technically true, but said in a way that will certainly give many people a false impression.” Politifact typically scores this as anywhere between “Mostly False” and “Mostly True,” depending upon how their partisan leanings color their view of the underlying issue. A second type of judgment call comes with the “factual statement that is an approximation.” Again, when it comes time to decide what is “Mostly” true or false, Politifact has no real guide to what is considered a significant error. (There’s a more meta issue of simply what statements they decide to analyze as well.)\nIt’s precisely upon this kind of “truthiness” that the bias comes in; outside of Donald Trump who prefers to go in for simply amazing lies, most politicians stick to statements calculated to be difficult to prove or with saving explanations.\nIt’s much easier to simply state something true, leave out countervailing facts, and let voters’ natural bias do the work for you.\nJohn Thacker\nDec 17 2015 at 7:15am\nAnother typical politician statement is to say something that is true, but doesn’t necessarily imply the conclusion that people will naturally draw from it. One case of this is in stating various numbers; without context, it is difficult to say whether numbers are large or small, good or bad. Comparing absolute numbers to percentages of a current distribution to growth rates, etc.\nI sympathize with Politifact in that these rhetorical tricks are used to mislead, but when Politifact uses this understandable judgment to say that “this number cited is 100% correct, but since it’s largely irrelevant to the bigger issue, we’re going to rate this statement Mostly False” you can see the difficulty.\nBrett Champion\nDec 17 2015 at 7:22am\nAll people lie. All politicians are people. Therefore, all politicians lie.\nHugh\nDec 17 2015 at 7:43am\nBill Clinton’s “didn’t inhale” is obviously truthy enough for Politifacts, and Monica’s dress was most probably lying too.\nSeriously, he’s the most truthful pol?

It’d be interesting to see these stats complied among multiple fact-checkers. See if there is some kind of pattern.\nDaublin\nDec 17 2015 at 9:28am\nI’ve had the same reaction as John Thacker. I’ve looked at politifact 2-3 times and it’s always been heavily skewed to the left. Aggregating up this data to an overall percentage isn’t going to fix it. Garbage in, garbage out.\nThe one that really turned me off was “You didn’t build that”. If you read Obama’s speech, he was clearly discrediting the role of business owners. Romney disagreed; he said that the individual business owners are quite important and should be cherished. Somehow this turned into Romney “lying” about what Obama meant.\nIf you look at the text of the speech, the rest of it supports the same general idea, and it really is a defining position of Obama more broadly than this one speech. Here are five separate quotes from thespeech in question.\n– “You didn’t get there on your own.”\n– “I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there.”\n– “If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.”\n– “If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”\n– “The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.”\nObama’s perspective is a popular one on the left. He really seems to feel that CEOs and other economic leaders are replaceable, that if you remove a CEO and replace them by just about anyone else, the replacement will also do very well.\n(It’s also a popular view on the left that one’s own boss is incompetent and should be replaced. But I digress.)\nSo what is it that Romney was “False” about? Here’s an example, straight from Politifact, of what Romney was “False” about:\n“In one fundraising e-mail, Matt Rhoades, Romney’s campaign manager, decried Obama’s ‘naïve view that government, and not the hard work, talent, and initiative of people, is the center of society and the economy.’ In another campaign e-mail, Amanda Henneberg, a Romney spokeswoman, said Obama had ‘denigrated Americans who built their own businesses.'”\nHow is that not true? How is “There are a lot of smart people” anything but denigrating?\nSieben\nDec 17 2015 at 10:23am\nI don’t know. Politifact has a strong incentive to find “lies” because it makes their product more entertaining to consume. You can imagine a lot of liberals were very happy to see Trump at the top.\nIt is extremely easy to find “lies” if you apply a strict definition of “truth”. Obama’s quote is clearly rhetoric and outside of the “unprecedented” part, impossible to falsify. Many many statements have these properties. Is the “World’s Strongest Man” competition false advertising? Except there’s no public interest in ranking the veracity of advertising campaigns. People just want to see political drama, and “fact checking” provides this function.\nPhil\nDec 17 2015 at 10:54am\nI fail to see the logic of using a constitutional standard for laws that discriminate when evaluating whether a regulation “makes sense.” But if you think those standards are appropriate, then the rational basis test is the bar for simply making sense:\n“The government has no legitimate interest in the law or policy; or there is no reasonable, rational link between that interest and the challenged law.”\nanomdebus\nDec 17 2015 at 11:13am\nNext, can you prove that all politicians are human?\ndanyzn\nDec 17 2015 at 11:50am\nDon’t blame me.

They’re fact checking the claim that “In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans.” It’s rated as “mostly false” because it’s “actually something of a rough guess based on back-of-the envelope math” and it lacks “important context.”\nThe whole point of the quote, of course, is to show how much more common black-on-black crime is than white-on-black killing. So they decided to “fact check” in the narrowest way possible, in order to arrive at the conclusion they want. Let’s see if the number 11,106 holds up!\nThe “fact checkers” get to choose what facts are worthy of being checked, how to frame the question, and what the relevant context is. Amazingly, a liberal press finds that liberals lie less!\nJay\nDec 17 2015 at 1:09pm\nI agree with others, how could you not see this list as anything but partisan? I’m willing to accept that some lie more than others but do we really think one side lies by a 4 to 1 margin than ALL the other side?\nRichard\nDec 17 2015 at 1:16pm\nLet me add that it’s not just the partisan split, it’s that the biggest liars are all the people disliked by the media the most: Trump, Cruz, Carson, Cheney, Santorum. Then come Republicans the media finds more palatable, followed by the Democrats.\nAvraham Rosenblum\nDec 17 2015 at 1:35pm\nThis is just a way to slander people the media does not like. And think of any story that you know personally and was also reported in the media. Was there a strong connection between what the media says and what actually happened? For everything that I was involved with personally and later saw a media report, there was only a very vague relationship between the facts and what was reported.\nMartin\nDec 17 2015 at 2:49pm\nI’m surprised that no one has yet pointed out how politifact might appear to have objective results but how selection bias may indeed be driving partisan results. First question is how many times each politician has been fact checked? Second question: is one party fact checked more often? While not an infallible test, I think that would either raise or eliminate much doubt.\nSFG\nDec 17 2015 at 8:47pm\nSerious question: how would we test this?\nI mean, nobody here has the time to fact-check every statement in Politifact’s database. (Or does someone?) And there are so many judgment calls (Mostly True? Mostly False?), as people here have pointed out, it’s hard to say.\nThomas Sewell\nDec 17 2015 at 9:20pm\nIt appears the blog commentators rating for Politifact’s Falsehood Face-Off chart is “Pants on Fire”.\nThey’re a known highly partisan opinion source.

I’d prefer to see a scientific study.\nJohn Fembup\nDec 18 2015 at 5:17pm\nI winced when I saw the table headings “mostly false” and “half false, half true”.\nThere is good reason court witnesses are sworn to tell “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth”. Because a statement that is “half false, half true” falls short of the truth, and can be a lie.\nRecently Mrs. Clinton was interviewed by George Stephanopolous who mentioned her Benghazi Congressional testimony. She claimed “I answered all the questions.”\nYes she did answer all the questions. But did she answer with the whole truth?\nI wonder how PolitiFact scored Mrs Clinton’s claim.\nI also wonder why so many people accept “half false, half true” as simply politics as usual?\nPerhaps it’s because so much of what appears in our media is half false, half truth and most people can no longer tell the difference.\nMalcolm Kirkpatrick\nDec 20 2015 at 1:40am\n(Caplan): “… politicians are evil …”\nCompared to what? You have to compare something to something.\nLibertarians are moralistic, posturing, delusional children.\nHumans are social animals. They form dominance hierarchies. Experts beat amateurs.

Perhaps robbers and thieves reduce cognitive dissonance by convincing themselves that their victims deserve victimization. Something similar, perhaps, applies to welfare recipients’ and public sector workers’ (looking at –you–, NEA) disdain for capitalism. Do Austrian economists differ systematically, by sector (private versus government university), in their attacks on politicians. Do Austrians at government schools spend more words attacking politicians than do Austrians at private schools?\nComments are closed.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        We’re celebrating the end of the year with our most read posts from 2013.\nToday a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. It is widely argued that Florida’s stand your ground statute, which was considered by the defense, and which Zimmerman previously studied in a criminal litigation course, was at play. The statute allows people to use proportionate force in the face of an attack without first trying to retreat or escape. More than 20 other states have such laws.\nAt MetroTrends, John Roman and Mitchell Downey report their analysis of 4,650 FBI records of homicides in which a person killed a stranger with a handgun. They conclude that stand your ground “tilts the odds in favor of the shooter.” In SYG states, 13.6% of homicides were ruled justifiable; in non-SYG states, only 7.2% were deemed such. This is strong evidence that rulings of justifiable homicide are more likely under stand your ground.\nBut which homicides?\nOnes similar to the one decided in favor of George Zimmerman today. A finding of “justifiable homicide” is much more common in the case of a white-on-black killing than any other kind including a white and a black person. At PBS’s request, Roman compared the likelihood of a favorable finding for the defendant in SYG and non SYG cases, consider the races of the people involved. The data is clear, compared to white-on-white crimes, stand your ground increases the likelihood of a not-guilty finding, but only when a person is accused of killing a black person.\nNotice, however, that white people who kill black people are far more likely to be found not-guilty even in states without SYG and black people who kill whites are less likely to be found not-guilty regardless of state law.\nIt’s simple: We are already biased in favor of the white defendant and against the black victim. Stand your ground laws give jurors more leeway to give defendants the benefit of the doubt. This increase even further the chances that a white-on-black homicide will be considered justifiable because jurors will likely give that benefit of the doubt to certain kinds of defendants and not others. Stand your ground may or may not be a good law in theory but, in practice, it increases racial bias in legal outcomes.\nIt is contested whether stand your ground played a role in this case, Media Matters offers strong evidence to suggest that it did.

Is the problem with this bias that too many white people are getting way with murder, or that too many black people are being convicted for justified self defense? If the latter, then we need broader, more consistent application of the SYG principle. If the former, then getting rid of SYG entirely might be the better solution.\nEven when analyzing the bias on its own, we have to ask, is this biased in the sense that the original Grandfather clause was biased, or is it biased only in the sense that the law against murder itself is biased, which is to say, because it is applied within a racially biased society?\nJared — July 14, 2013\nFYI, you contradict yourself.

Another thing you need to factor in is most of the violent crimes are committed by blacks. Sorry, there's more to it that that. You've got 5,000 cases of a black guy robbing a white guy, 1,000 where the white kills the black, 900 found justifiable. 1,000 blacks rob blacks, 300 kill the other (blacks are more violent towards whites than blacks, so it's often less likely the need to kill the aggressor). 200 found justifiable. so, 900/1000=90%justifiable. 200/300=66% justifiable.\nIt's not racial profiling to suspect a black person of being a criminal. it's generalizing. we generalize and stereotype for a reason. 90%+ of crime is committed by non-white, with the greatest portion being black. I'm sorry, if you don't like this fact, stop blaming the whites, and teach the blacks right from wrong.\nblacks people are not bad, and it's probable that there are more good blacks than bad blacks. but, if one black robs 300 people/places, well, that's 300 black on white crimes, and if 10 whites each rob 20 people, well, who still looks worse? 300 black crimes, or 200 white crimes.... in that instance, black people would be better, but still perceived as worse. and that's typically the way it is. the few bad blacks are very bad. straighten them out, and the problem is fixed!\n“Stand Your Ground” Increases Racial Bias — July 14, 2013\n[...] Crossposted from Sociological Images [...]\nDuane Day — July 14, 2013\nWhat does the blue \"All\" bar represent?

If that is the case, then doesn't this mean more than all murders like this are deemed justified?\nAlso, how does the data reflect cases dealing with people of multi-racial backgrounds?\nZimmerman Trial: It’s Not About Race, It’s About Gun Laws (Which Are Racist) [Op-Ed] — July 14, 2013\n[...] with controversial “Stand Your Ground” laws, which, as The Society Pages points out, increases an already troubling pattern of racial bias in the US criminal justice [...]\nihavereverb — July 14, 2013\nThis analysis assumes no systemic difference between black-on-white shootings and white-on-black shootings. There may be a reason for the bias that correlated with race but is not causal, i.e., black individuals are more likely to perpetrate crimes that are objectively more violent/dangerous than the other way around. Given the make up of our prison system, this point bears consideration.\nI'm not necessarily saying that it's true, I'm just saying that automatically assuming it's not true is bad analysis and bad statistics. The fact that we'd rather it not be true for the sake of race relations is really not a good enough reason to discard the possibility.\nadamsbja — July 14, 2013\nThat's a correlation study, not a causation one. To show causation you'd want to collect data from the states being studied both before and after SYG laws were created, to show that the spike occurred after the laws came into effect. Even then that would be a strong correlation but causation's a nasty beast to pin down.\nwjgreen314 — July 14, 2013\nThe meme \"unarmed ...child who committed no crime\" was totally vitiated at trial with the presentation of eye-witness testimony, forensics, and photos. Trayvon Martin, old enough to join the military at 6'1\" tall with sneaks and a hoodie on, armed himself with a concrete slab and committed the 1st and ONLY crime of the evening when he assault and battered George Zimmerman and REFUSED to STOP when George Zimmerman repeatedly yelled \"HELP,\" and when John Good came out of his home to yelled \"STOP, I'm calling 911.\" Facts Matter and only those either too ignorant to know them or too in denial to claim them repeat this false meme.\nGeorge Zimmerman is as much a White Hispanic as Barack Hussein Obama is a Black Caucasian (first daddy, then mommy).\nBrutus — July 14, 2013\nBad data: In SYG states, the white-on-black acquittal rate is 3.6 times the white-on-white acquittal rate; in other states, it is 2.5 times. In all states combined, it is 2.4 times.\nIf you don't know what state you are in, you should conclude that white-on-black accused shooters will be acquitted 2.4 times as often as white-on-white shooters.

You obviously wanted to support your predetermined perception rather than facts. Using the latest crime statistics from the FBI, which is 2011, you would see that statistically the aggressor in violent crime is African American. Roughly 50% of violent crime is committed by Black Males which account for less than 10% of the population. ( I can hear liberals screaming racism for stating a fact ). The numbers speak for themselves. Also a white person is more likely to have carry permit.\nThe only thing your data proves is that in non SYG states people are twice as likely to be convicted for defending themselves regardless of race.\nI guess I should not have expected too much from a PHD who incorrectly posted that this was even a Stand Your Ground case. Don't let your emotions over rule logic.\nI am saddened that you sheeple have let such a tragedy define race relations. From the beginning the media intentionally twisted this tragedy to stoke the deepest darkest fears people have. Race is still a problem in this country. It is something we must deal with.

That's the overall rate we're comparing to. So, out of the 160 white on black homicides, we're expecting 16 of them to be justifiable. This chart tells us that the rate is actually 225% higher, so actually 36 homicides were ruled justifiable.\nThe conclusion is that out of 4650 homicides, we have roughly 20 more\njustifiable homicides where white guys kill black guys and aren't convicted. This is a swing of about 0.5% of the overall rate - hardly evidence of systematic bias, and much less impressive than the chart shown.\nd1stewart — July 14, 2013\nThe reason that the authors do not give numbers, but rather pretty incomprehensibly presented percentages, is that the number of white-killing-black killings is so small. (In known cases of murder-victim, the great majority of murders are intraracial; in the low number of interracial cases, blacks kill more than twice as many whites as whites kill blacks. Year 2011 data, e.g., are available at: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.)\nBetween 2005 and 2009, there were 1148 justifiable homicides in the US (about 1.5% of all homicides in those five years). And then the number of cases in which a Stand Your Ground law was invoked is smaller still. We're talking in at most low double digits, possibly single digits.\nIn other words, these data are being stated in percentages in order to conceal the fact that there is no significant difference because the data are insufficient to justify any inference, and that the authors are making an accusation of racism where the data don't support that accusation. In addition, their claim about what the data illustrate is itself an invalid inference, even if they were dealing with data in the hundreds.\nBarry — July 14, 2013\nHow many incidents of white on black killing are there in a given year?

As an earlier comment pointed out, the number of white on black and black on white killings is small, so one wonders about statistical significance of the results. There is also the question of other factors which might be at play. For example, juries in states which have SYG laws may be more inclined to approve of gun use and self defense rationales. One could also argue, hopefully without being accused of racism, that the statistical profile of crimes committed by black persons could be different from that of white persons, as a result of the well-known economic and social deprivation suffered by african-American populations, which could affect the credibility of a self defense argument. Finally, there is the question of the quality of legal defense. Whatever you might think of Zimmerman's culpability, he had a first-class defense. Not many lower income African-Americans get that advantage.\nTrayvon Martin: On Being Call A 'Racist' (For Calling Out Racism) - Not the Singularity — July 16, 2013\n[...] Zimmerman may have been freed according to the tenets of Florida law (Stand Your Ground laws that disproportionately favour white people over black; gun laws that allow concealed-carry among would-be vigilantes), but that [...]\nQuick check — July 16, 2013\nHow come is the white-on-black ALL effect smaller than both non-SYG and SYG white-on-black effects?

I would think blacks killing blacks and whites killing whites FAR OUT NUMBER blacks and whites killing each other. I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T POST THE RAW NUMBERS FOR YOUR \"GRAPH\" OR A LINK TO THE RAW NUMBERS. since there could be major difference in the sample, that could lead to an abnormality in the data. however, maybe there is racist things going on. For example, maybe more innocent white people have to go to trial because the courts are scared that people will think they are racist. Remember a man was fired because he didn't bring charges up on Zimmerman even though there was no case on Zimmerman.

As a preliminary, I want to call for a return to the values that made this country great. If Fate desired that poor graph design make a correct application of what it had read about sensationalism it would have to indicate title and page number since the pompous, verbally incontinent varmint would otherwise never in all its existence find the correct place. But since Fate does not do this, poor graph design thinks there should be a law prohibiting people from saying any harsh or unkind things against it. Am I aware of how poor graph design will react when it reads that last sentence? Yes. Do I care? No, because if you've read this far then you probably either agree with me or are on the way to agreeing with me.\nAs far back as I can remember, poor graph design has pitted voluptuaries against jerks and sandbaggers against twaddlers. For all intents and purposes, if poor graph design makes fun of me or insults me I hear it, and it hurts. But I take solace in the fact that I am still able to oppose poor graph design and all it stands for. If I try really, really hard, I can almost see why poor graph design would want to purge the land of every non-lackadaisical person, gene, idea, and influence. When a political condition of greed, massive corruption, and diversity of objective is coupled to a social condition of drugs, violence, and discontent, therein exists the perfect environment for poor graph design to portray volage-brained psychotic-types as busybodies. Shame on poor graph design for thinking that people like you and me are gin-swilling! While there's no use crying over spilled milk, a day of reckoning is coming, and poor graph design will be called to account. I'll say that again because I want it to sink in: We must stick to our guns and not let poor graph design convince us that two wrongs make a right.\nPoor graph design attributes the most distorted, bizarre, and ludicrous \"meanings\" to ordinary personality characteristics. For example, if you're shy, it calls you \"fearful and withdrawn\". If, instead, you're the outgoing and active type, poor graph design says you're \"acting out due to trauma\". Why does it say such things? The answer is quite simple. I already listed several possibilities, but because poor graph design lacks the ability to remember beyond the last two seconds of its existence I will restate what I said before for its sake: If it had even a shred of intellectual integrity, it'd admit that as soon as the time is ripe I will shine a bright light on its politics, which flourish mainly in the darkness of negativism. This isn't just a public-relations move. It's a real move to get people to see that we are at a crossroads. One road leads into the light of a bright, shining future in which blathering-to-the-core slimeballs like poor graph design are completely absent. The other road leads into the darkness of blackguardism. The question, therefore, is: Who's driving the bus? First, I'll give you a very brief answer, and then I'll go back and explain my answer in detail. As for the brief answer, if we foreground the cognitive and emotional palette of poor graph design's insane jibes rather than their pathology we can enter vitally into its world. Why do we want to do that? Because we must work together to call your attention to the problem of politically incorrect, wrongheaded hermits. What can you do to help? For starters, you might want to challenge poor graph design to defend its prognoses or else to change them. I personally derive great satisfaction in doing that sort of thing because poor graph design sees no reason why it shouldn't alter, amend, abridge, and censor the record to point the finger of responsibility at others. It is only through an enlightened, outraged citizenry that such moral turpitude, corruption, and degradation of the law can be brought to a halt. So, let me enlighten and outrage you by stating that poor graph design tries to make us think the way it wants us to think, not by showing us evidence and reasoning with us but by understanding how to push our emotional buttons.\nI know very few offensive drug lords personally, but I know them well enough to surmise that poor graph design may have access to weapons of mass destruction. Then again, I consider it to be a weapon of mass destruction itself. Poor graph design gets a lot of perks from the system. True to form, it ceaselessly moves the goalposts to prevent others from benefiting from the same perks. This suggests that I am not predicting anything specific. I just have a feeling, an intuition, based on several things that are happening now that poor graph design will stir up trouble in a lustrum or two.\nPoor graph design offers two principal reasons as to why scapegoatism is the catholicon for all the world's ills. It argues that (1) mediocrity and normalcy are ideal virtues, and (2) clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking. These arguments are invalid for the following reasons: First, it is pointless to fret about the damage already caused by its temerarious, spineless manifestos. The past cannot be changed. We must cope with the present if we hope to affect our future and prevent its ultra-antisocial prank phone calls from spreading like a malignant tumor. There are two things about poor graph design's vituperations that I find personally offensive, utterly unethical, and quite sad. One is that after enduring a barrage of poor graph design's damnable ideologies, one normally experiences intense levels of stress, difficulty sleeping, and anxiety about one's physical safety as well as one's career. And the other is that we must be uncompromising and unequivocal when it comes to showing poor graph design how it is as wrong as wrong can be. And I can say that with a clear conscience because I will stop at nothing to tamp down any doubts that poor graph design gives new meaning to the word \"iscariotic\". My resolve cannot fully be articulated, but it is unyielding. As evidence, consider that poor graph design's appalling misjudgment and obstinacy in depressurizing the frail vessel of human hopes are already being discussed quite widely—so much so, in fact, that poor graph design's equally staggering misjudgments regarding yahooism are escaping well-merited ridicule and rebuke. To rectify that pretermission, allow me to observe that I don't see how poor graph design can build a workable policy around wishful thinking draped over a morass of confusion (and also, as we'll see below, historical illiteracy), then impose it willy-nilly on a population by force. I'm not saying that it can't possibly be done but rather that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, poor graph design is drunk with power, which is why we must name and shame its votaries for their snarky acts of Comstockism.\nTrapped by the cognitive dissonance engendered by hard evidence and common sense, poor graph design feels obligated to convince people that their peers are already riding the poor graph design bandwagon and will think ill of them if they don't climb aboard, too, in a nocuous, morally crippled attempt to justify its nostrums. Poor graph design keeps telling everyone within earshot that everyone who doesn't share its beliefs is an insidious, bilious ninnyhammer deserving of death and damnation. I'm guessing that poor graph design read that on some Web site of dubious validity. More reliable sources generally indicate that it argues that human beings should be appraised by the number of things and the amount of money they possess instead of by their internal value and achievements. This is an entertaining statement, perhaps, except that when taken at face value it presages a likely attempt by poor graph design to corrupt our youth.\nThough tactless ethnocentrism is not discussed in this letter, much of what I've written applies to that as well. If I seem a bit mean-spirited, it's only because I'm trying to communicate with poor graph design on its own level. I'll repeat what I've already said: Poor graph design likes tricks that infringe upon our most important constitutional rights. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that it is more than merely thrasonical. It's über-thrasonical. In fact, poor graph design is so thrasonical that it is unconstrained by conscience. Poor graph design will almost certainly tiptoe around that glaringly evident fact because if it didn't, you might come to realize that the justification it gave for defying the rules of logic was one of the most nettlesome justifications I've ever heard. It was so nettlesome, in fact, that I will not repeat it here. Even without hearing the details you can still see my point quite clearly: Given the amount of misinformation that poor graph design is circulating, I must point out that it accuses me of being a liar. The only proven liar around here, however, is poor graph design. Only a die-hard liar like poor graph design could claim that drug money is being used to pay for the construction of huge underground cities intended to house both humans and aliens who serve a secret, transnational shadow government. The truth, in case you haven't already figured it out, is that it demands that we make a choice. Either we let it deny citizens the ability to become informed about the destruction that it is capable of or it'll bring feudalism to this country in the name of anti-feudalism. This \"choice\" exemplifies what is commonly known as a \"false dichotomy\" or \"the fallacy of the excluded middle\" because it denies other alternatives, such as that poor graph design contends that sexism is a noble cause and that, therefore, it is beyond reproach. This bizarre pattern of thinking leads to strange conclusions. For example, it convinces violent troublemakers (as distinct from the abominable luftmenschen who prefer to chirrup while hopping from cloud to cloud in Nephelococcygia) that poor graph design is a saintly figure—philanthropic, noble, and wise. In reality, contrariwise, poor graph design thinks it would be a great idea to blame our societal problems on handy scapegoats. Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such an idea, the underlying premise is still flawed.\nDon't be intimidated by poor graph design's threat to set up dissident groups and individuals for conspiracy charges and then carry out searches and seizures on flimsy pretexts. We mustn't be content to patch and darn, to piece and cobble at the worn and rotten fabric of poor graph design's biased opuscula. Instead we must make an impartial and well-informed evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of its beliefs. Poor graph design's claim that undiscoverable, unmeasurable, magical forces from another plane of existence have given it superhuman wisdom is not only an attack on the concept of objectivity but an assault on the human mind. This is nothing new. Its lieutenants probably don't realize that because it's not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless, poor graph design decidedly believes that its faith in cynicism gives it an uncanny ability to detect astral energy and cosmic vibrations. Unfortunately for it, that's all in its imagination. Poor graph design needs to get out of that fictional world and get back to reality, where people can see that courage is what we need to foster mutual understanding—not politeness, not intellectual flair, not cleverness with words, just courage. And it sometimes takes a lot of courage to look a belligerent flimflammer in the eye and tell him that over time, poor graph design's smears have progressed from being merely conscienceless to being superconscienceless, hyperconscienceless, and recently ultraconscienceless. In fact, I'd say that now they're even megaconscienceless.\nI recently received quite a bit of flak from the local commentariat for reporting that whenever poor graph design gives a speech, it is always careful to sidestep the issue of how it is not afraid to use violence, ruse, shot and shell, poison, or the dagger to sell otherwise perfectly reasonable people the idée fixe that power, politics, and privilege should prevail over the rule of law. The criticism I received is surprising because I was merely pointing out what is generally accepted, that if we briefly prescind from the main point of this letter we can focus on how on a television program last night I heard one of this country's top scientists conclude that, \"The core ethic of poor graph design's coterie has been its brash, unyielding nature, its unquestioning loyalty to poor graph design, and its eternal war footing constantly spoiling for a fight.\" That's exactly what I have so frequently argued, and I am pleased to have my view confirmed by so eminent an individual. I don't have a high opinion of sneaky, postmodernist nupsons, as evidenced by the way that poor graph design says that it needs a little more time to clean up its act. As far as I'm concerned, poor graph design's time has run out. Poor graph design is afflicted with what I call Mysticism Addiction Disorder. Symptoms include loss of control, craving and withdrawal symptoms, social isolation, excessive financial debt, and an insatiable desire to mulct us out of our lives' savings. The only known cure is for poor graph design to admit that I wish I didn't have to be the one to break the news that it has long had a hand in various efforts to sap people's moral stamina. Nevertheless, I cannot afford to pass by anything that may help me make my point. So let me just state that there is a format poor graph design should follow for its next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts.\nThe next time poor graph design decides to instill a general ennui, it should think to itself, cui bono?—who benefits? Poor graph design is not as ugly or ungrateful as you might think. It's more so. In closing, I ask that you swear in the holy sanctuary of your soul that you will never stop straightening out our thinking and changing the path we're on. That's how I live my life, and that's how you should consider living yours.\nDoherty for Social Issues | Week 7: What evidence supports and refutes gun control? — October 17, 2013\n[...] SYG is race biased: [...]\nWordPress â?º Support Â» online casinoCasino | Casino — January 4, 2014\n[…] online casinos, you don't have to worry about unknowingly dropping your money or chips on the ground and walking off only to …See all stories on this […]\nIs Jordan Davis another Trayvon Martin? | theGrio — February 4, 2014\n[…] charge the law is rife with racial bias, and it is no accident that stand your ground increases the likelihood of a not-guilty verdict in white-on-black […]\nBlack Current Events | Black News Authority | African American News - WeUsINews.com — February 4, 2014\n[…] the law is rife with racial bias, and it is no accident that “stand your ground” increases the likelihood of a not-guilty verdict in white-on-black […]\nMilwaukee Community Journal » WISCONSIN'S LARGEST AFRICAN AMERICAN NEWSPAPER » Is Jordan Davis another Trayvon Martin? — February 4, 2014\n[…] charge the law is rife with racial bias, and it is no accident that “stand your ground” increases the likelihood of a not-guilty verdict in white-on-black […]\nIs Jordan Davis another Trayvon Martin? | CE Marketing & Promotions — February 4, 2014\n[…] charge the law is rife with racial bias, and it is no accident that “stand your ground” increases the likelihood of a not-guilty verdict in white-on-black […]\nco-sign.it » Is Jordan Davis another Trayvon Martin? — February 12, 2014\n[…] charge the law is rife with racial bias, and it is no accident that stand your ground increases the likelihood of a not-guilty verdict in white-on-black […]\nWhite Men’s Freedoms and Black Men (Sociological Images) | The Alternate — February 17, 2014\n[…] George Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin, I put up a post reviewing a study on stand your ground laws.

These facts are not in dispute by anyone. Still, if the white cop can't PROVE his innocence, he will be convicted because of the STRONG current of reverse racism. The disparity in the graph is probably caused by the disparities of the facts in each individual cases.\nMasseyTom247 — August 17, 2014\nThere are no female NFL wide receivers because of.....sexism? 80% of professional basketball players are black because of.....racism?

And, if an answer runs long, candidates and everyone else will hear this sound.\nHUME: We ask our large, and as you can tell enthusiastic, audience to please limit applause during the question and answer portion of the debate so we can devote as much time as possible to the candidates themselves.\nLet's get started.\nChris, you are up.\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, good evening. You have all been arguing at long distance over the last week or two about who was the real Republican, who was the true conservative. I hope you will all be willing to discuss this directly with each other tonight.\nMayor Giuliani, Senator Thompson says that you're soft on abortion, that you're soft on gun control, and that you've never claimed to be a conservative.\nWho is more conservative: you or Fred Thompson?\nGIULIANI: I can't comment on Fred. I can tell you that George Will wrote a couple of years back, toward the end of my time of being mayor of New York City, that I ran the most conservative government in the United States in the last 50 or 60 years. So I would think that was a pretty good indication of the things that he was drawing on. I brought down crime more than anyone in this country -- maybe in the history of this country -- while I was mayor of New York City.\nGIULIANI: I brought down taxes, $9 billion, cut them 23 times. I balanced the budget that was perennially out of balance; removed $2.3 billion surpluses -- deficits and replaced them with surpluses.\nSo there were many -- I drove pornography out of Times Square. There were many, many things about my governing of New York that particularly in that environment -- one of the most liberal cities in the country -- I had more success than anyone ever thought I could have with a city council that was 45 Democrats and, I think it was, six Republicans -- then it went down to five at one point.\nGIULIANI: So I think that was a pretty darn good conservative record. I think, in every case, you can always find one exception or two to someone being absolutely conservative or absolutely this or absolutely that, but I think I had a heck of a lot of conservative results.\nWALLACE: Governor Romney, Senator Thompson says that you run to the left of Teddy Kennedy in 1994, that you were proudly pro-choice, as recently as 2005, and that his philosophy doesn't depend on geography.\nWho is more conservative: you or Fred Thompson?\nROMNEY: You know, this is a critical time for our nation and fore our party. We have to decide which direction we're going to head. And, in my view, we're going to have to bring together the same coalition that Ronald Reagan put together; conservatives fiscally, conservatives from a military standpoint and conservatives socially.\nROMNEY: And I believe that a candidate -- and all of us here are Republicans, all of us are trying to put together that same coalition, but it's essential that the strength of the house Ronald Reagan built is going to lead us to become the successful nation that we've always been, and our party to be successful.\nBecause we're not going to -- we're not going to keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House by acting like Hillary Clinton.\nNow, I'm proud of my record. Not just of the words, but of the record of the governor of Massachusetts. Like Mayor Giuliani I had a tough state to be running in. I was a conservative Republican in a very Democrat state. My legislature, 85 percent Democrat. We face a $3 billion budget gap. We solved it without raising taxes, without adding debt.\nWe solved the problem in health care in our state not by having government take it over, the way Hillary Clinton would -- with private free-enterprise approaches.\nMy approach, I believe, is best for our nation.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Senator -- Senator Thompson, have these two guys convinced you that you're wrong and that, in fact, they are both consistent conservatives?\nTHOMPSON: Well, we've got an hour and a half.\nMaybe they can work on it.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut, they...\n(APPLAUSE)\nActually, Mitt, I didn't know there was any room to the left of Ted Kennedy, but maybe there...\n(LAUGHTER)\nIn fact, I didn't know there was any room to the right of him, either, but maybe...\n(LAUGHTER)\nI was conservative as soon as I put down Conscience of a Conservative when I was in the college.\nI came back to a little home town of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, started the first Young Republicans Club.\nIn eight years -- in eight years in the United States Senate, I fought for tax cuts, a balanced budget, and welfare reform, all of which we achieved, and I also fought for judges who would abide by the Constitution and the law and not make it up as they went along.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAll that time, I compiled a 100 percent pro-life voting record. Now, both of...\n(APPLAUSE)\nThey're only giving me a minute here. So both of these gentlemen have done some good things in their respective jobs they've had.\nBut you mentioned Mayor Giuliani first. Mayor Giuliani believes in federal funding for abortion. He believes in sanctuary cities. He's for gun control. He supported Mario Cuomo, a liberal Democrat, against a Republican who was running for governor; then opposed the governor's tax cuts when he was there.\nSo I simply disagree with him those issues. And he sides with Hillary Clinton on each of those issues I just mentioned.\nWALLACE: Mayor Giuliani...\nGIULIANI: Well, look, you know...\nWALLACE: ... why don't you respond to Senator Thompson?\nGIULIANI: ... well, first of all, you know, you do one of those things and -- you know, Fred has his problems, too.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI mean, Fred was the single biggest obstacle to tort reform in the United States Senate. He stood with Democrats over and over again.\nHe voted against $250,000 caps on damages, which they have in Texas. He voted against almost anything that would make our legal system fairer: loser pays rules, things that would prevent lawsuits like that $54 million lawsuit by that guy who lost his pants -- you know?\n(LAUGHTER)\nGIULIANI: That cost that family $100,000 in legal fees. I think the man should have to pay the family for the $100,000 that he took from them in the abusive lawsuit.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFred Thompson, along with very few Republicans, blocked tort reform over and over and over again. That is not a conservative position.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Mayor, if I may -- Senator, you can have a minute to respond to Mayor Giuliani and also tell us what your beef is with Governor Romney.\nTHOMPSON: You've just go a minute?\nWALLACE: That's right.\nTHOMPSON: OK.\nWALLACE: Talk fast.\nTHOMPSON: As far as tort reform is concerned, I supported tort reform with regard to securities legislation. I supported tort reform with regard to product liability legislation, things that have to do with interstate commerce. I think it appropriately passed. I supported and worked for those things.\nLocal issues belong at the state level. Most states have passed tort reform.\n(APPLAUSE)\nTHOMPSON: That's our system. It's not all federalized.\nYou know, I'd point out, as far as lawsuits are concerned, I voted for and we passed anti-sanctuary city build, outlawed them. Mayor Giuliani went to court, filed suit himself to overturn our abolition of sanctuary cities. And, fortunately, he lost.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Mr. Mayor, you want to respond, 30 seconds on the sanctuary city issue?\nGIULIANI: Oh, the simple fact is that New York City had a policy of allowing people who are illegal immigrants to report crime and to put their children in school. Otherwise, we reported every single illegal immigrant that committed a crime.\nThe results had to be pretty darn good. I brought down crime by over 60 percent in New York City. I brought down homicide by 67 percent. I had the most legal city in the country. And I took the crime capital of America and I turned it into the safest large city in the country.\nThe senator has never had executive responsibility. He's never had the weight of people's safety and security on his shoulders.\nI have. And I think I out-performed any expectations.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Senator McCain, if I may -- Senator McCain, you didn't like it much when Governor Romney said recently that he spoke for the Republican wing of the Republican party.\nWho's more conservative: you or Mitt Romney?\nMCCAIN: I think it's pretty obvious that that statement was a paraphrase of Howard Dean's statement about the Democrat party.\nThe fact is, I'm running on my record as a reliable conservative of 24 years. And the indicators of that, obviously, is that I've fought wasteful spending, I have had a strong and a long relationship on national security, I've been involved in every national crisis that this nation has faced since Beirut, I understand the issues, I understand and appreciate the enormity of the challenge we face from radical Islamic extremism.\nI am prepared. I am prepared. I need no on-the-job training.\nI wasn't a mayor for a short period of time. I wasn't a governor for a short period of time. For 20-some years, including leading the largest squadron in the United States Navy, I led. I didn't manage for profit, I led for patriotism.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Governor Romney, Senator McCain suggests that you're conning people -- he has used that phrase -- with your conversions on a number of issues during this campaign.\nWhy is Senator McCain wrong?\nROMNEY: Well, Senator McCain is an American hero, and I respect his service. I respect his service in government as well.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd we have some differences on some issues. But when I ran against Ted Kennedy in 1994, I knew that was going to be a big uphill climb. But let me tell you, I was fighting for issues like making sure that we would have the death penalty in our state, fighting to keep our taxes down.\nROMNEY: I fought, as well, to secure our borders. I fought to keep the welfare bills from the 1960s that have created such a havoc in our nation, to try and get those changed.\nSo I was fighting against the liberal lion in perhaps the toughest state in America. And I'm pretty proud of what I was able to accomplish in that race, but nothing compares to the pride I have with the work that I was able to do as a governor.\nI served for four years. My legislature was 85 percent Democrat. I fought to get English in our schools, to make sure we had English immersion. I fought to make sure we kept our taxes down. I fought for pro-growth strategies. I cut taxes.\nAll of us on the stage are Republican. But the question is, who will be able to build the house that Ronald Reagan built -- who will be able to strengthen that house, because that's the house that's going to build the house that Clinton, Hillary, wants to build.\nWALLACE: Senator McCain, you didn't think much of the answer of Governor Romney in the last debate, when he said that he would ask his lawyers whether he needed congressional authorization to use military force against Iran. Why not? t.\nMCCAIN: Because I don't think that's the time to call in the lawyers, when we're in a national security crisis. Those are the last people I'd call in.\nThe people I'd call in, I'd call in my wisdom, my knowledge, my background, my experience, and my ability to lead this nation.\nGovernor Romney, you've been spending the last year trying to fool people about your record. You can't – I don't want you to start fooling them about mine. I stand on my record. I stand on my record of a conservative – of a conservative, and I don't think you can fool the American people. I think the first thing you need is their respect, and I intend to earn their respect because they may not agree with me on a couple of issues, but they'll know I'm telling the truth, and what I believe and my steadfast positions on these issues for more than 20 years, and I know that the transcendent challenge I have the qualifications to lead, to grapple with and to emerge victorious.\nI have those qualifications and I'm proud of them.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Senator Romney -- Governor Romney?\nROMNEY: Don't demote me. I want to make one thing very, very clear, and that is if there were ever a question of a security threat to this country, I would act immediately to protect the interests of America and our citizens. No question about that.\n(APPLAUSE)\nLet me also note, the question is -- you properly asked it, Chris -- was: What involvement would Congress have to have? Every president from the beginning of time who has had that issue has of course met with White House counsel and the attorney general and they have written opinions about the involvement of Congress. I can imagine every person on this stage would likewise apprise themselves of Congress' perspective -- excuse me, of Congress' role with those individuals.\nBut the decision to take our men and women to war is the most grave decision and I would do that on a very deliberate and careful basis, not a half-cocked basis. This president went to Congress.\nROMNEY: Hillary Clinton is trying to rewrite history, that somehow he did this all by himself, going to Iraq. He went to Congress and got their support. Let's not forget that.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Governor, thank you very much.\nThanks you, Chris.\nCarl Cameron has the second round of questions.\nCarl?\nCAMERON: Thanks very much, Brit.\nCongressman Paul, to you, on the subject of one of the core debates in the party, over social issues: gay marriage.\nYou've been quoted as saying, Any association that's voluntary should be permissible in a free society. And you've expressed your opposition to a constitutional ban on gay marriage.\nMany of your rivals on that stage disagree. Why are they wrong?\nPAUL: I'm afraid I haven't been able to get most of your question. I know you brought up the subject of gay marriage, but I didn't get the point of what you're saying. I can't hear it that well.\nCAMERON: Why are on those stage who support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage wrong?\nPAUL: OK. Well, if you believe in federalism, it's better that we allow these things to be left to the state. My personal belief is that marriage is a religious ceremony.\nPAUL: And it should be dealt with religiously. The state really shouldn't be involved. The state, both federal and state-wise, got involved mostly for health reasons 100 years or so ago.\nBut this should be a religious matter. All voluntary associations, whether they're economic or social, should be protected by the law. But to amend the Constitution is totally unnecessary to define something that's already in the dictionary.\nWe do know what marriage is about. We don't need a new definition or argue over a definition and have an amendment to the Constitution. To me, it just seems so unnecessary to do that. It's very simply that the states should be out of that business, and the states -- I mean, the states should be able to handle this. The federal government should be out of it.\nThere's no need for the federal government to be involved in this. You can accomplish this without waiting five or ten or 15 years. The authority can be put in the states by mere voting in the Congress.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Governor Romney, among the so-called top tier candidates, you support the ban on gay marriage. What does it say that Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Ron Paul all don't?\nROMNEY: Well, they have a different point of view. But I've been in a state that has gay marriage, and I recognize that the consequences of gay marriage fall far beyond just the relationship between a man and a woman.\nThey also relate to our kids and the right of religion to be practiced freely in a society.\nSo, for instance, I want to make sure that our kids have a mom and a dad. I want to make sure the Catholic Church in our state, that's been banned from doing adoptions because they want the kids to go into home where there's a mom and a dad, that they can do adoptions again.\nThe status of marriage, if it's allowed among the same sex individuals in one state is going to spread to the entire nation. And that's why it's important to have a national standard for marriage.\nAnd I'm committed to making sure that we reinforce the institution of marriage in this country by insisting that all states have a right to have marriage as defined as between a man and a woman; and we don't have unelected judges, liberals, standing up and saying we're going to impose same-sex marriage where it was clearly not in their state constitution.\nROMNEY: My state's constitution was written by John Adams. It isn't there. I've looked. And in Iowa as well you've got a court saying they have to have same-sex marriage.\nThe people need to speak on this issue and make sure that marriage is preserved as between a man and a woman.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Mayor Giuliani, your opposition to the constitutional amendment banning gay marriage has been fairly well known. I had an opportunity to talk to Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council this afternoon who said that in a discussion with you just in the last couple of days you informed him that if, in fact, the Defense of Marriage Act were to fail, or states began -- or states began to legalize gay marriage, you would oppose a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.\nGIULIANI: I think you said that opposite, and the first part is wrong also, Carl. I have always -- I've always had...\nCAMERON: You're right; my mistake.\nGIULIANI: I've always had the same position.\nGIULIANI: I do not believe under the state that we presently exist, with the Defense of Marriage Act and basically one state that has by judicial fiat created same-sex marriage -- and they're wrong, by the way; I think the governor is absolutely right -- I don't think we need a constitutional amendment at this point.\nWhat I said to Mr. Perkins -- which I also said five years ago and have consistently said -- is if a lot of states start to do that, three, four, five, six states, where we have that kind of judicial activism, and the kind of situation the governor is talking about actually occurs, if we're dealing with a real problem, then we should have a constitutional amendment.\nI did 210 weddings when I was mayor of New York City. So I have experience doing this. They were all men and women.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI hope.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nGIULIANI: You got to give me a little slack here. It was New York City, you know, but...\n(LAUGHTER)\nGIULAINI: It is a religious institution, but Congressman Paul is wrong; it's a civil institution as well. That's why I did those 210 weddings, because it's also a civil institution.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Governor Huckabee, Mayor Giuliani has argued that he is, in his private life, opposed to abortion. But as a matter of public policy, would do nothing to change the laws that keep it legal right now.\nWhat are your views on that type of a position and as it relates both to public policy and the future of the Republican Party?\nHUCKABEE: Let me begin by saying, for the first time in about nine debates, I'm kind of glad I wasn't in on the first few minutes because it was all about these guys fighting each other.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd I am more than content to let you let them fight all they want tonight, shed each other's blood and then I'll be ready to run for president because...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... I'm not interested in fighting these guys.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWhat I'm interested in is fighting for the American people, and I think they're looking for a presidential candidate who's not so interested in a demolition derby against the other people in his own party.\nHUCKABEE: There are some real issues out there in this country we need to be fighting for on behalf of the people. Now, one of them, quite frankly, I do believe, is the sanctity of human life...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... because I do believe that it is one of the defining issues of our culture and civilization in that it expresses our understanding that every single human being in this society has intrinsic value and worth.\nWhen our founding fathers put their signatures on the Declaration of Independence, those 56 brave people, most of whom, by the way, were clergymen, they said that we have certain inalienable rights given to us by our creator, and among these life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, life being one of them. I still believe that.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Senator Thompson, earlier this week, you were asked about your lobbying, years ago, for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. And you were quoted as saying, That was private life, as if to dismiss the question.\nCAMERON: Can you explain to us what you meant by that and why...\nTHOMPSON: No, I...\nCAMERON: ... it would make a difference?\nTHOMPSON: No, what I said -- what I hope I said was that it was my private law practice, as opposed to my public service. I was a member of a firm, of counsel to a large firm. And it was their client. They asked me to do a little work on it. I made a few calls. And that was that.\nFrankly, I'd forgotten about it. But they've come forward now, because I'm their worst nightmare.\nAfter that happened, I went to the United States Senate and voted consistently against them on every bill that came up. Now they're trying to defeat me.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Senator McCain, in recent months and years, you've described as trying to reach out and mend fences with the evangelical right (ph) and religious conservatives across the country, having criticized them in years past, particularly their leaders.\nCAMERON: And there's some skepticism. Many want to know today whether or not you are now reaching out and truly trying to mend those fences, or if you remain the maverick, and which is the straight talk they should believe.\nMCCAIN: Well, I don't change. I haven't changed. I think that anybody who is going to receive the nomination of their party obviously needs to appeal to and make their case to, but not pander to, all parts of the Republican Party.\nI'm proud that in my life I have engaged in reconciliation with former enemies. I did that with the Vietnamese, who killed many of my friends. I did that with other adversaries from time to time. And when Rev. Falwell came to my office and said he wanted to put our differences behind us, I was more than glad to.\nAnd I'm even more glad today that I did. I believe in reconciliation. I believe that they're an important part of our party.\nMCCAIN: I think we need to move together. We need all of us to win this election, and I think it's going to take a united party to do so.\nAnd I hope that all elements of our party will respect the process and support the nominee of our party.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Congressman Tancredo, recently you complained that the party had become hyphenated, that where were neo-conservatives, paleo- conservatives, compassionate-conservatives, common-sense conservatives.\nIs that just a good line meant to say that a lot of the folks on this stage aren't the type of complete conservatives you think the party needs?\nTANCREDO: Well, you know, one thing, by being a bookend to every one of these debates you get a chance to listen...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... for a long time to everybody else talk about their positions on issues.\nAnd every single person on this stage, certainly everyone of my colleagues, I believe, bring something very unique, very special, and certainly enormous capabilities to this whole debate and to the office that they are seeking.\nTANCREDO: But I must tell you, they also bring differences. And those -- it is not, I think, a sin to discuss them. I don't believe it should be something that we hold back on when we talk to the American people about what it is that actually distinguishes us.\nAnd, yes, I do think that there are organizations that should be looked at that actually rate people for their conservative history.\nAnd the American Taxpayers Union, for one, gives me the highest rating; the American Conservative Union, highest rating of anybody running for president of the United States; an A rating from the National Right to Life; an A rating from every organization -- every conservative organization that gives ratings to those of us who are here on this stage.\nNow, those are objective. You know, there's somebody else that looks at us and says: How conservative are these people really? And what we do notice is that in a primary everybody in the Republican Party, everybody runs to the right.\nTANCREDO: But, as time goes on, they all move to the left. And that's why people are so cynical about this process.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Congressman Hunter?\nSome pretty sensitive issues: gay marriage, abortion. And Tom Tancredo with the highest rankings. Is he the right conservative? And are these issues that are -- the Republican Party is in danger of not being conservative enough and losing track and losing connection with its principles?\nHUNTER: Well, Carl, you've been dividing the party for the last 10 minutes, so let me -- let me say something that I think unites them.\nThis is a historic venue.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYou know, 300 miles off this coast is a place where another party, once a great party, the Democrat Party, lost its identity. And that's when, in 1961, the Cuban freedom fighters were struggling with a toehold on the beach, trying to take back Cuba from Castro and a Democrat president with an aircraft carrier sitting a few miles offshore said we will not help the freedom fighters.\nAnd a thousand miles away from there is El Salvador, where a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, hung tough, brought freedom to El Salvador.\nHUNTER: And you know something? Today, they are fighting side by side with our guys in Iraq.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe're the party of freedom.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: I'm not so sure I shouldn't get 30 seconds to rebut as to whether I'm dividing their party...\nHUME: Well, thank you very much, Congressman Hunter.\nCarl, thank you.\nWendell Goler has the next round.\nWendell?\nGOLER: Gentlemen, I want to ask you some questions about health care and education, which are always important issues in every presidential election.\nI want to ask you to be specific and, in deference to Governor Huckabee, you don't have to beat up on each other.\nSenator McCain, your plan for lowering health care costs involves switching people from employer-provided health care to policies they buy on their own. There's concern that could lead insurance companies to cherry-pick their clients.\nGOLER: You also want to limit the amount doctors can charge for chronic diseases, which skeptics worry could make it difficult for people with diabetes, for example, to find doctors to take care of them.\nHow would you deal with these two problems?\nMCCAIN: First of all, I think it is important that that will be one of the defining issues of this campaign, because we know that there will be Hillary-care resurrected. There will be efforts to raise your taxes. There will be efforts to have a single-payer big government solution by the Democrats. They've already espoused those causes. If you believe them, please take a trip to Canada or England before you decide to support such a thing.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAmerica has the highest quality health care in the world. Our job is to preserve it. Our job is to keep the costs down. Last year, the Medicaid inflation was 10 percent. No, no program in the world can survive under that. So of course we want to remove the employer (OOTC:EPLI) tax, and tax incentives, and move it to the individual. Give the individual a $2,500 refundable tax credit, a family a $5,000 tax credit.\nMCCAIN: If you need to have people in special categories such as congenital diseases, we may have to set up a fund to care for those. But the key is, make health care in America affordable and available. Don't destroy it, as the Democrats want to do.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Congressman Paul, you say that insurance companies and government programs have made health care simply unafforable. You objected so strongly to Medicaid that, as a doctor, I'm told, you simply treated patients on your own, at your own expense.\nIs charity the way we should provide health care for the poor right now?\nAnd how are you going to encourage doctors to do that -- primary care doctors to do that, when their salaries have been declining for more than a decade?\nPAUL: Well, we've had managed care, now, for about 35 years. It's not working, and nobody's happy with it. The doctors aren't happy. The patients aren't happy.\nPAUL: Nobody seems to be happy -- except the corporations, the drug companies and the HMOs.\nYou take care of poor people by turning the medical care back into the system, where people have some choices.\nNow, we have a mess because we have -- a lot of people are very dependent on health care. But I have the only way we can afford to take care of people now, because we're going broke, with $500 billion going to debt every single year. And we have a foreign policy that is draining us.\nI say, take care of these poor people. I'm not against that. But save the money someplace. The only place available for us to save it is to change our attitude about running a world empire and bankrupting this country. We can take care of the poor people, save money and actually cut some of our deficit.\nSo you don't have to throw anybody out in the street, but long term you have move toward the marketplace. You cannot expect socialized medicine of the Hillary brand to work.\nAnd you can't expect the managed care system that we have today, which promotes and benefits and rewards the corporations -- because it's the drug companies and the HMOs and even the AMA that comes to us and lobbies us for this managed care, and that's why the prices are high.\nPAUL: It's only in medicine that technology has raised prices rather than lowering prices.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Governor Romney, we have an e-mailed question from Kendrick of Oakland, California, who says the health care plan you left in Massachusetts, which required people to get their own insurance, amounts to Hillary Care. You say it was the result of a Democratic legislature.\nI want to ask you: If a Democratic Congress placed such a plan on your desk in the Oval Office, would you sign it? And why was the plan good for Massachusetts and not good for the nation?\nROMNEY: First of all, I'm not going to give the Democratic legislature credit for the plan that I helped build. So, I want to let you know I'm very proud of what we did in Massachusetts, and I think it's a model that other states can adopt in some respects.\nBut let me tell you something about our plan. It's different than Hillary Clinton's in a lot of important ways. But one thing that I'm happy about is that Republicans are talking about health care. This isn't a Democrat issue. It's a Republican issue.\nROMNEY: For Democrats, they want to have government take it over. And I don't want to have the guys who did the cleanup at Katrina taking responsibility for health care in this country.\nThe right answer...\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe right answer is to get people insured, all of our citizens insured so they don't have to worry about losing their insurance if they change jobs or have a preexisting condition.\nBut Hillary says the federal government's going to tell you what kind of insurance, and it's all government insurance. And I say no, let the states create their own plans, and instead of government insurance, private, market-based insurance.\nHillary's plan costs an extra $110 billion. My plan doesn't cost any additional money. We use the money we're already speaking, we just use it a good deal more wisely.\nAnd the real question here is, are we going to talk about health care and get everybody insured with private insurance? Absolutely. Because the alternative is unthinkable. As P.J. O'Rourke said, if you think health care's expensive now, just wait until it's free. We're not going Hillary's way.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Governor, I think one of the aspects of your plan required individuals to provide their own health insurance, and I think Congressman Hunter wants to talk to you about that.\nHUNTER: Yes. Wendell, I think the governor's plan goes in exactly the wrong direction, because while it allows for private health insurance, it has lots of mandates.\nHe has a good piece of those 1,000 or so mandates that drive up the cost of health care. That means that every single plan in the governor's state has to have certain things.\nHUNTER: It's got to have, for example, fertility coverage. Well, what if you're 90 years old? We may appreciate Governor Romney's optimism...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... but you may not need fertility coverage.\nThose 1,000 mandates that we have throughout the States, where we do have mandated health insurance plans, is driving up the cost of health care by about 35 percent. We need freedom. We need to allow people to buy their health care across state lines. That will bring down the cost of health care.\n(APPLAUSE)\nROMNEY: Oh, I've got to respond to that.\nGOLER: Briefly, Governor.\nROMNEY: We took as many mandates out as we could in our policies. And the legislature kept some there. I tried to take them all out; they put some back in. It was a compromise. They put some mandates there.\nBut, let me tell you how many we got out. The price of the premium for an individual, 42 years old, in Boston, used to $350 a month. Now, it's $180. We basically cut it in half by deregulating.\nROMNEY: Congressman, you're absolutely right that taking regulation out of insurance brings the price down, and that's why my plan would go state by state, deregulate them so we can get the cost of premiums down. But it is unacceptable to keep talking about this and still have 47 million people without health insurance. We got the job done. This is the first state in America that is on track to have everybody insured. Half of my uninsured are now insured, and I am proud of what we've done.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Governor Huckabee has wanted to say something for a couple of minutes now, and I get the sense he doesn't think you got enough regulations removed.\nGovernor?\nHUCKABEE: First of all, we don't have a health care system. We have a health care maze. And we don't have a health care crisis. We have a health crisis. Eighty percent of the $2 trillion we spend on health care in this country is spent on chronic disease. If we don't change the health of this nation by focusing on prevention, we're never going to catch up with the costs no matter what plan we have.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUCKABEE: The reality is it's a health crisis, and I would further say that one of the challenges we face is that a lot of the Democrats want to turn it over to the government, while the Republicans want to turn it over completely to the private insurance companies.\nI think the better idea is to turn it over to each individual consumer and let him or her make that choice. I trust me a lot more than I trust government or a lot more than I trust the insurance companies.\nAnd we've got a situation with 10,000 baby boomers a day signing up for Social Security, going into the Medicare system. And I just want to remind everybody when all the old hippies find out that they get free drugs, just wait until what that's going to cost out there.\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Congressman Tancredo, your health care plans seems intended to show how tough you would be on illegal immigration.\nYour concerns involve the illegal immigrants using our hospital emergency rooms. The RAND Corporation says that illegal immigrants account for about 1.5 percent of the nation's health care costs.\nYou also want to import cheaper drugs, prescription drugs from Canada, though the president says there would be no way to regulate them.\nWhere is your help for the nearly 50 million Americans who don't have health insurance?\nTANCREDO: One of the most interesting parts of this debate about health care is the fact that we continually talk about the federal government's role in it.\nWe should actually be debating that specific point, not what kind of government program. You know, Michael Moore went to Cuba not too long ago, and wrote this documentary about the greatness of the system, how wonderful it was to be in Cuba and have a socialized medical system.\nYou notice, however, that Michael Moore came back to the United States.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nNow, there's a reason that he did that, of course. It's because we have the best system in the world. And why? It's because we do rely more on individuals than not.\nTANCREDO: Really and truly, it's a fascinating thing to think about this, that we have moved all the way to the point of simply debating what kind of federal plan we might have rather than debating what's the constitutional right of the federal government to get involved in this particular issue. That's a challenge I think we all have to accept.\n(APPLAUSE)\nNow, if there's a federal role, I completely accept the idea of giving people the greater opportunity -- individual opportunity to use health savings accounts. Why? Because that takes individuals. They become the consumer in the marketplace dealing directly with the provider.\nThat's called a marketplace. That will drive down the costs. Get the federal government -- don't even talk about our responsibilities, because they always -- gives people the option to think that there is -- naturally the federal government should be involved. It shouldn't.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Senator Thompson, you voted in favor of the No Child Left Behind law, though critics warned that it was too intrusive, too bureaucratic. They also warned that teachers would teach to the test.\nTHOMPSON: Yes.\nGOLER: Now you say all those things are true.\nGOLER: Was your vote a mistake, and how would you change No Child to correct those problems?\nTHOMPSON: Yeah. I did vote for it, and some of those critics were right. And some of us were wrong. What has happened is that, indeed, states have taught to the test. We've not gotten the transparency and the accountability that we thought we were getting.\nI like the idea of testing. (inaudible) it can't be like Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average, you know. Everybody's, you know, making 90 on the test, you're not learning very much.\nI think what we need to do is realize the proper role of the federal government. The federal government only is responsible for about 8 percent of what is spent. We need to concentrate on helping the states, making sure that 8 percent is spent wisely.\nTHOMPSON: But there are a lot of good things going on at the state level, you know, in terms of free markets, in terms of competition, and the things that work in the rest of our society, vouchers, charter schools, things of that nature.\nStates ought to be allowed to experiment and do the things that they know best at the state and local level.\nAnd we can't lay all this at the feet of any government. We have to accept some hard truths. Part of the problem in our education system and with our children has to do with the societal breakdown that's going on in this country. We need more fathers to stay and raise their kids.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Mayor Giuliani, most people agree that you helped New York's crime problem and its economy, but you met your match with the schools.\nGIULIANI: I couldn't get that. I'm sorry, Wendell.\nGOLER: You met your match with the city school system.\nYou said that the school system was, quote, No good and beyond redemption ; that it was, quote, dysfunctional and should be blown up.\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: A lot of teachers, frankly, hated you, sir.\nThe No Child Bill has already alienated a lot of the nation's teachers. Why are you the person to bring them back in the fold and how would you do it?\nGIULIANI: Well, I mean, because what we need is choice. I'll give you a -- probably...\nGOLER: That's going to bring back public school teachers?\nGIULIANI: Well, I'm actually -- I love teachers. I think teachers are wonderful. There are great ones, there are average ones and there are bad ones, but I really care about the kids more. Sorry, Wendell.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd I just want to tell you a little story, because this is the thing that made me feel very strongly about choice. There was a school scholarship program about 1996, '97 -- they offered 2,500 scholarships to parents of public school children in New York City if they wanted to send their child to a private school, a parochial school, a charter school.\nGIULIANI: We had 168,000 applications by those parents. We had to turn most of them down. We had to tell them because they don't have enough money, they couldn't put the child in the school of their choice.\nIt seems to me the thing that's wrong right at the core of No Child Left Behind is the enforcer of standards should not be the bureaucrat in Washington or on the board of education. It should be the parent. We should have choice. We should empower parents. They should decide -- private school, parochial school, public school, charter school, home school.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThat will give the parents the kind of control over their children's education. They understand their children better. Why should a government bureaucrat be sending 168,000 children to failing schools when parents think they can do better for their children? I think it's the single biggest civil rights issue that we face in the 21st century.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Mr. Mayor, thank you very much.\nCandidates, it is time for a break. Coming up, how will these candidates run against the Democrats' front-running Senator Hillary Clinton? We will find out live from the Shingle Creek Resort in Orlando, Florida, right after these messages.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nHUME: And we're back in Orlando with the Republicans running for their party's presidential nomination. Our debates continues with more questions from Chris Wallace.\nChris?\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, you all have a couple of things in common. You all seem to be planning to run against Hillary Clinton in the general election and at this point all of you -- I repeat all of you -- are losing to her in the polls. So let's talk about how you intend to beat her.\nGovernor Romney, you trail Clinton by 12 points in the latest Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll. You have compared Clinton to Karl Marx. You say when Clinton...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... when Clinton hears about private sector, she thinks that that's a new recruit in the Army.\n(LAUGHTER)\nIs Hillary Clinton fit to be commander in chief?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nROMNEY: The audience -- the audience is telling you the answer.\nYou know, look at the challenges that America faces right now.\nROMNEY: And not only do we face global jihad, with all of the implications of a group of people who want to bring down our nation and free nations around the world, but you also face an emerging economic superpower in China. It's the new Asian tiger.\nAnd China and India are coming in a remarkable way to compete for our jobs.\nThe idea that someone wants to be president who's never worked in the private sector is really a big question mark. I've spent 25 years in the business world, running a small business that became a large one. I've worked in 20 countries around the world, working on investments and helping manage a business and so forth.\nThat skill, that experience is essential. Hillary Clinton wants to run the largest enterprise in the world, the government of the United States. It employs millions of people, trillions of dollars in revenue.\nROMNEY: She hasn't run a corner store. She hasn't run a state. She hasn't run a city. She has never run anything. And the idea that she could learn to be president, you know, as an internship just doesn't make any sense.\nI have spent my life running things. I've learned how to run a business. I've learned how to run a state. I ran the Olympics. In each case, I brought change.\nAnd if there's ever been a time we needed change in Washington to bring strength to America, it's now.\nWALLACE: Governor, I'm going to give you...\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Governor, I'm going to give you 30 more seconds. I asked you specifically is she fit to be commander in chief?\nROMNEY: Well, I'd vote no. I'd vote no. I don't want her as commander in chief. I don't believe she has the experience in leadership and running something of the scale of our military to be the commander in chief of this nation.\nIf you asked me, if the ballot is put in front of anybody in this room, I think you heard what they said. The answer is, absolute -- anyone here want to vote for Hillary?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nROMNEY: I agree with them.\nWALLACE: Mayor Giuliani, you trail Clinton by four points in our latest Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll.\nGovernor Romney says the Republicans aren't going to beat Hillary Clinton by acting like Hillary Clinton. And the point seems to be that on a lot of the social issues, like abortion and gay rights and gun control, that there's not much difference between you and Clinton. Is there?\nGIULIANI: You got to be kidding.\n(LAUGHTER)\nYou have got to be kidding.\nWait a second. There is -- there are two things I agree with Hillary Clinton on. First of all, we're both Yankee fans.\n(LAUGHTER)\nWell, wait a second. I became a Yankee fan growing up in New York. She became a Yankee fan growing up in Chicago.\n(LAUGHTER)\nDo you believe that?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSecond, she made a statement last week -- and I've been very critical of her, but I want to tell her I agree with this one. Quote, Hillary Clinton, I have a million ideas; America cannot afford them all.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI'm not making it up. I am not making it up.\nThe transcription contains a gap at this point.\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nGIULIANI: Thank you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYou saved us in 2000. That was a big one.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI'd also like to note, on behalf of all my Republican colleagues, we're not going to boycott Florida the way the Democrats are.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe're going to be here, campaigning for your vote.\nWALLACE: Senator McCain, you're running the closest to Clinton, but you still trail her by three points in our latest poll. The biggest issue between the two of you clearly is the war in Iraq.\nYou strongly support the troop surge. She wants to start pulling the troops out. Is that a winner for Republicans in 2008?\nMCCAIN: I don't know. And I can't be concerned. Because I know too many brave young Americans that are serving and sacrificing in Iraq, as we speak.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI would much rather lose a campaign than lose a war. And now I'm...\n(APPLAUSE)\nLet me just say that I know and respect Senator Clinton.\nMCCAIN: The debate that I have between me and her will be based on national security, on fiscal conservatism, and on social conservatism. It will be a respectful debate. That is what the American people want.\nNow, one of them will be spending. I have fought against out-of- control and disgraceful spending that's been going on and I have saved the American people as much as $2 billion at one stroke.\nIn case you missed it, a few days ago, Senator Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum. Now, my friends, I wasn't there. I'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI was tied up at the time.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut the fact is...\n(APPLAUSE)\nMCCAIN: My friends, no one can be president of the United States that supports projects such as these. And I believe that wasteful spending has got to be eliminated. And I will have this debate and win because she is a liberal Democrat and I am a proud, reliable, consistent conservative Republican. That's why I'll win.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Governor Huckabee, I'm sorry to say we didn't call the horse race between you and Senator Clinton, but you say that she will win next November if the Republican Party doesn't do a better job of reaching out to minorities.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWas it a mistake for some of your colleagues on this stage to skip those minority-sponsored debates?\nHUCKABEE: I think it was a mistake. We need to be making sure that the Republican Party is the most inclusive party for the simple reason that our message touches more Americans and helps more people from the bottom get to the next rung on the ladder than anybody.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYou know, it's interesting, the most, I guess, wonderful reaction we've had in this entire room is when Hillary's name is mentioned. It gets louder than an Aerosmith concert.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBut I want to say this -- you've asked: What's the difference? No matter which one of us is on this stage -- and, look, I like to be funny, let me be real honest with you. There's nothing funny about Hillary Clinton being president. Let me tell you why.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIf she's president, taxes go up, health care becomes the domain of the government, spending goes out of control, our military loses its morale, and I'm not sure we'll have the courage and the will and the resolve to fight the greatest threat this country's ever faced in Islamofascism.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe've got an enemy that wants to kill every last one of us. We cannot be soft. We must be strong.\nWe'll sign crazy bills like the Law of the Sea Treaty and give away our sovereignty.\nAnd that's why, with all of the fun we're going to have talking about it, there's nothing funny about Hillary being president.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Senator Thompson, you trail Clinton by 12 points in our latest poll.\nYou said the other day that Republicans don't need to worry so much about Clinton as much as they need to worry about themselves.\nWhat do you mean by that?\nTHOMPSON: Well, just what I said. Hillary is always a good applause line and almost everything everybody has said has been accurate.\nIf we go down that road, we're going to go down the road of higher taxes. Hillary basically says that, you know, 40 percent of the people pay about 99 percent of the taxes. Why not 30 percent of the people? Why not 20 percent of the people?\nWe're going to have a windfall when the tax cuts expire at the end of 2010. Let's use that money our way. We'll go down the road of power spending, where people are told, Don't worry about your kids, don't worry about the next generation, although we're clearly bankrupting them, with regard to their Social Security and Medicare expenditures.\nTHOMPSON: We can't sustain it. But don't worry about that. We'll make it all up out of the rich.\nThe only problem with Democrats is that everybody who works for a living is rich, according to them.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThey say that all we've got to do is bring the troops home, and the world will leave us alone. They're the party that insults our generals and tries our troops in the newspaper. And when they're exonerated, they're on page 15 or 20.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSo what I meant was, if we stick to our basic principles, we will win next November. But we've got to remember our first principles -- the fact that what the founding fathers told us a long, long time ago, that our basic rights come from God, not from government; that we have a system of divided government, both state and local and state and federal level.\nWe believe in free markets. We believe in free people. We believe in free enterprise. And Americans who work hard and play by the rules have a decent chance of living the American Dream, just like I have and so many others have.\nThat's the things that we have to keep in mind. Let's don't get diverted onto some single individual, whoever their nominee is. They're going to lead us down the road to a comfortable mediocrity. And that's not the United States of America I grew up in.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Congressman Paul...\n(APPLAUSE)\nWALLACE: Congressman Paul, you're against the Iraq war. So is Senator Clinton. So what are the differences between you?\nPAUL: Well, there's a very big difference, and I think the American people, if we as a party realize this and understand it, 70- some percent of the people in America want the war over with. They're sick and tired of it and they want our troops to come home.\nNow, Senator Clinton has nothing new to offer. She's endorsing the same policy. She said that the troops would be there for another five years, continue to build this embassy that's going to be bigger than the Vatican, continue to build 14 air bases as are going on there, these private bases going on there, and never change.\nPAUL: We in this party have to realize the American people are sick and tired of big government, big government overseas, an empire we can't maintain, the bankruptcy of this country, and also the attack on our personal civil liberties. We don't have privacy left anymore, and Hillary Clinton offers no solution to that, and neither does any of the Democrats. And we are not doing a very good job either.\nIf we don't recognize that, we don't have a chance because we need to get back to the basics, believe in the Constitution, believe in the rule of law, and not allow our government to spend endlessly and bankrupt this country.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Congressman Paul, thank you.\nSenator Thompson, I want to go to the issue that you mentioned in passing just a couple of minutes ago, the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. You said those programs were threatened with bankruptcy. They indeed are, as countless economists have advised us. If they were to be kept in their present form, it is argued that they could swamp the private economy with unacceptable levels of taxation or would force severe benefit cuts.\nHUME: You have stepped out on this, suggesting that we could change the indexing method for the growth of benefits in Social Security. You have said that we couldn't really afford the prescription drug bill that was passed under President Bush.\nYou have talked about the possibility that high-income Medicare beneficiaries would have to accept less benefits.\nThis is a hard area, as the president's adventure on this has shown. Are you prepared to say, tonight, that you would propose these things and make them part of your campaign?\nTHOMPSON: Yes. As I think that you have stated them, yes. I don't want to be bound to your exact words, but the principles that you've outlined are absolutely...\nHUME: Me either...\nTHOMPSON: ... are absolutely correct.\nIt's based on the notion that there's no reason to run for the presidency of the United States if you can't tell the truth. It's a difficult thing politically...\n(APPLAUSE)\nTHOMPSON: ... but the fact of the matter is we're bankrupting the next generation. We're spending the money of our grandkids and those yet to be born. They don't have a seat at the table.\nOur present mandatory spending cycle leaves us in an unsustainable position. The comptroller tells us that, the Government Accountability Office -- everybody that looks at it says it's unsustainable.\nCan you imagine something that's unsustainable and threatens our economy for our grandchildren and those yet to be born not being discussed more on the campaign trail?\nI've just set out a couple of things that I think will avoid future generational warfare, where we have to fight over a lot higher taxes or big benefit cuts. If we do some responsible things now we don't have to do that.\nAnd the indexing of benefits in the future, from wages to prices, is one way to do that. Current retirees -- or for those near retirement wouldn't be affected. And those retiring in the future would get the same benefits in real dollars as those retiring now, but not more.\nHUME: All right.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWhat Senator Thompson said, Mayor Giuliani, will open him to accusations that he's trying to cut Social Security benefits. He will be accused of being willing to diminish or take away the prescription drug benefit that many now have come to depend on.\nHe has suggested that Medicare beneficiaries might have to suffer loss of benefits (inaudible) high income. He's out on a limb on that.\nAre you prepared to be as bold?\nGIULIANI: Was that question for me?\nHUME: Yes it is.\nGIULIANI: OK. I think the reality is that we have to deal with Social Security.\nThe first thing we have to do is get a consensus behind private accounts if we're going to change it.\n(APPLAUSE)\nIt doesn't make much sense to figure out what the compromises are going to be if you can't get the big thing that you need to really change Social Security. And the fact is, Medicare and Medicaid and presently more expensive than Social Security.\nGIULIANI: And within 10 years, they'll be twice as expensive. So they're going to go bankrupt a lot faster. And they need a private solution as well.\nWhat we need to do if we're going to bring down the cost of Medicare and Medicaid is bring down the cost of the entire health insurance market.\nAnd in the discussion you were having about health insurance before, the point that I think was missed -- we only have 17 million people in America who buy their own health insurance. If we have 50 million or 60 million people who bought their own health insurance, the price of health insurance would be cut in more than half.\nAnd the way you cover the people that aren't presently covered -- the people who aren't presently covered with health insurance are not the poorest people; they're covered with Medicaid.\nThe people who are presently not covered are all buying something -- they're consumers. They may be buying a television, they may be buying -- I hate to mention a cellphone, but they may be buying a cellphone.\nBut in any event, they have -- they have consumer power. They have to start getting into that market. It's the only way in which you bring down costs.\nSo I think in both cases, if you start to establish a private market, you're going to be able to figure out how to solve these things within costs that are sustainable.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: How about it, Governor Romney? Are you prepared to be as bold as Senator Thompson has been in making an -- in addressing these extremely politically sensitive entitlement programs?\nROMNEY: I'm prepared to be entirely bold, but I'm not prepared to cut benefits for low-income Americans.\nWe're going to make sure that we protect these programs for our seniors. That's number one.\nNumber two...\nHUME: How?\nROMNEY: Well, our current seniors. Currently, we're taking more money into Social Security that we actually send out. So our current seniors, their benefits are not going to change.\nFor people 20 and 30 and 40 years old, we have four major options, for instance, for Social Security. One is the one Democrats want: raise taxes. It's the wrong way to go.\nNumber two, the president said let's have private accounts and take that surplus money that's being gathered now in Social Security and put that into private accounts. That works.\nOther people said, well, extend the retirement age.\nROMNEY: That mathematically works. It's not as attractive. And the last is to index the Social Security benefits, the first benefit, to something other than wages, which is what it has always been.\nBut, in my view, that's the wrong way to go. That's the wrong way to go other than for higher-income Americans. Higher-income Americans -- that is the Posen plan -- yes, let's consider doing that. That is indexing based on prices rather than wages.\nBut the others, Medicaid and Medicare, we can solve those. I know that. We did it in our state. We are on track to have everybody in our state insured. These problems are not impossible to solve.\nGood, effective leadership that brings people from both sides of the aisle together can get this job done. I have done it in business. I did it at the Olympics. I did it as a governor. I will do it as president.\nHUME: You spoke well of private accounts. President Bush tried very hard. He came into office with a reputation of being able to bring people together in Texas. He tried very hard to bring people together around his proposal. You saw what happened to it.\nROMNEY: Yes.\nHUME: How could you do better?\nROMNEY: Well, you know, I will learn from his experience and from my own, because it took us about a couple of years to get find a way to get everybody in our state insured.\nROMNEY: We wanted them insured, but we didn't want government to have to pick up a new bill. And so we spent a lot of time working on it.\nWe didn't just have a bunch of bureaucrats. We had a professor from MIT, an investment banker, a head of a consulting firm. We all worked on it, came up with an idea, and then we met with Democrats and said: Can we find common ground here?\nAnd, you know, Democrats also love America. As Ronald Reagan used to say, it's not that liberals are ignorant. It's just that what they know is wrong.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSo, you've got to -- you can educate each other. We've got some things to learn from time to time, too. And you find common ground. we will do that, and we will solve these entitlement problems.\nHUME: Governor Huckabee?\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUCKABEE: The president had the right idea, but he used the wrong word. When he used the word privatization, it scared the daylights out of a lot of people because it was right in the middle...\nHUME: Well, he didn't. He used the word private accounts.\nHUCKABEE: Well, but it scared the daylights out of people because they're thinking Enron and WorldCom, and that that's where their money would go. The right word is personalization. Empower individuals to have a greater say over their money.\nAnd that's what it is. Keep the government from robbing the trust funds, which is something that, if it was done in the private sector, would get a guy in jail.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd that's been going on. And then another thing is to come up with some creative solutions. You asked: Are we willing to be bold?\nYes. We have to be bold. It's a big problem. It needs a big solution. One thing, when people reach retirement age, if they really have enough retirement benefits, they don't need Social Security for the long term, give them the option of one-time buyout, or the opportunity to purchase an annuity, with their funds, tax-free, that frees up the long-term obligation of the government.\nBecause the problem is the actuarial tables were designed so that people would retire at 65 and die at 67.\n(LAUGHTER)\nWell, I'm sorry, but folks aren't dying that early. And short of taking them out, which is not a good idea...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... we're going to have to make the benefits work better. And that's one way to get it done.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Congressman Paul, your thoughts on these issues?\nPAUL: it's a mess. And it proves that the government is not very good at central economic planning, even for retirement.\nPAUL: The money was taken from the people with good intention. We should do our best to return it to those that have taken it.\nBut we need to allow the young people to just flat out get out of the system. Because, I tell you what...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... if you have the government managing these accounts, it's not going to work.\nAnd the other thing that you have to consider if you're really serious about protecting people's incomes, each and every one of us, is how you're going to protect the dollar. If you don't have the dollar maintaining its value, no matter where you put the money you're not going to have any value. That's where the crisis is coming.\nYou're going to go up with all these cost of living increases but you'll never keep up with the cost of living because the dollar's going down, the cost of living is going up.\nOur dollar today is worth 4 cents compared to the dollar of 1913, when the Federal Reserve took charge of it. And if you don't deal with the dollar there will be no retirement for anybody. We're going to have chaos.\nAnd that is why you have to cut spending. That's why we need a new foreign policy. We need to tie it to people over here in this country, the people who are dependent, but we need to let the people get out, whether it's Social Security or medical care or education. The Constitution doesn't advise that we do any of that anyway.\nPAUL: That's the only way we can solve the problem.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Senator McCain, you've grappled with this issue as long as anybody here. You've heard all the proposals and you heard what Senator Thompson offered.\nYour thoughts?\nMCCAIN: First of all, I'm glad they're not dying at 67, Governor.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nPleased to know that.\nLook, what Americans need is some straight talk. They need to know -- every man, woman and child in America needs to know that both of these are going broke. They're going broke and we've got to do the hard things.\nWe've got to fix it for the future generations of Americans. Don't we owe that to young Americans today? I say we do.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd you can do it with a couple of charts. One of them, on Social Security, is you can show them how much money is going out, how much is going in and when there's no money left.\nAnd then you look at a model for that, and that took place in 1983 The last time Social Security was in serious trouble, a liberal Democrat named Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan stood together in the Rose Garden and they fixed Social Security.\nTANCREDO: And that is exactly right. It is because the present leadership of the House of Representatives brought up this bill, agreed to bring up a bill, a resolution, that we knew would in fact, if they did that, would cause Turkey to do exactly what they did.\nNow, that goes to show you that pandering for votes, which was what this was partly based upon, and a complete ignorance of the foreign policy implications of doing such a thing, are the reasons why we are here now.\nAnd we should take away from this some very important lessons, not the least of which is that Nancy Pelosi is not a very good speaker of the House, and she is an even lousier secretary of state.\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Governor, I saw that you -- do you want to weigh in on this, Governor?\nHUCKABEE: When, four days ago, the parliament of Turkey indicated that they would amass those troops, it's a clear signal -- not just saber-rattling, they're serious about defending themselves.\nIt would seem to me that we should dispatch the secretary of state immediately to do two things. First of all, we need to train and equip the Kurds to fight the terrorists in their midst.\nThe PKK is a terrorist organization. Those 3,500 terrorists can best be dealt with by trained and armed Kurds. We don't have to put our military in harm's way. The Kurds have the capacity to do it against those in the PKK -- but also to try to get Turkey to realize that there's nothing to be gained by crossing into that border and creating yet another hostile situation. None of us need it. None of us want it.\nAnd I would hope that maybe the base in Irbil that was shut down earlier could become the base in which those operations could be staged.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCAMERON: Mr. Paul?\nPAUL: This is a -- this is a result of a foreign policy of interventionism. The founders advised non-interventionism. And even our president won the election in the year 2000 to have a more humble foreign policy, not to go into nation-building, and not get involved in the internal affairs of other nations.\nAnd we won an election on that.\nBut here we are. We're over there and we've invaded this country and this is just another unintended consequence. The war is spreading, the war is likely to go into Iran, nobody's willing to take anything off the table.\nWhat would it be like if somebody came in here into Mexico and did some of these things -- say, like, putting missiles in Europe? We're just looking for trouble. It's so unnecessary. And we jeopardize ourselves. And, quite frankly, we're not able to afford this.\nSo we don't need to go looking for trouble. We don't need another Cold War. And all we have to do is start talking to people and trading with people.\nWe don't need to assume that the world is going to blow up. Just think of...\n(AUDIENCE BOOING)\nPAUL: When I was drafted into the military, and I served five years in the military, the Soviets had 40,000 nuclear weapons.\nAnd here, we're now learning about agitating and putting missiles in Europe.\nPAUL: It's the Turks' business. It's not our business.\n(AUDIENCE BOOS)\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Governor Romney, I assume you're eager to get into this. Go ahead.\nROMNEY: Yes, we spoke -- about Russia, we've spoken about what's happening in Turkey and, obviously, Iraq. As you look around the world, you recognize that it's still a dangerous place.\nDuring the Clinton years, the president said we're going to take a peace dividend. We got the dividend. We didn't get the peace.\nHe reduced the scale of our military dramatically, took 500,000 troops out, cut back our Navy by 80 ships, knocked our Air Force down 25 percent. Our aircraft fleet today are 28 years old.\nThe U.N. is failing in its mission to protect the world and to prevent genocide.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThe strategy for America's safety is not to live in what Charles Krauthammer called a holiday from history, but to realize America must be strong.\nROMNEY: We need a strong military to protect us with more troops, more equipment and better care when our troops come home.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe also need a strong economy so we can have a strong military, and we need strong families and values to teach our kids to build a strong economy and a strong military.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Thank you, Governor.\nLast round, Wendell Goler.\nWendell?\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Gentlemen, I want to ask you a series of questions on no particular subject. These are simply questions I haven't had a chance to ask yet.\nCongressman Paul, I want to start with you. You have drawn some of the strongest reactions of any person on the stage, both pro and con, sir. When Ronald Reagan became a Republican, he said he hadn't left the Democratic Party, the Democrats had left him.\nGiven your differences with the other gentlemen on the stage, has the Republican Party left you? Have these gentlemen left the Republican Party?\nPAUL: I think in many ways they haven't followed our platform and they don't follow the Constitution. So they're really not following (inaudible). I think in many ways we have become big spenders. Republicans are the big spenders. Our big-government conservatives, they're part of the neo-conservative movement. They've lost their traditions about traditional conservatism and the Constitution.\nWe have benefited for so many years and decades by having a position of less use of force. Eisenhower won his election in 1952 by trying to clean up the mess that Democrats created in Korea. Nixon won in '68. We continuously won in taking this position of a more commonsensical foreign policy.\nLike I said, even George Bush won criticizing this interventionism, and now all of a sudden, just in this short period of time, we have accepted the Democrats' position on foreign policy, on entitlements, on deficits. I mean, we have lost our way.\nNo, I think that the position of the Republican Party today has not fulfilled their traditions.\nAnd that's why we lost last year. And if we don't go back to our traditions and believe in the Constitution, limited government, personal liberties, and a foreign policy that's noninterventionist, that won't bankrupt us, so that we can defend this country -- we can't even defend our own cities while we're prancing around the entire world.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGOLER: Mayor Giuliani, given our experience in Iraq, does the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iraq worry you more than the prospect of going to war with Iran?\nGIULIANI: There's no question that the idea of going to war with Iran, or even taking military action against Iran would be very dangerous. It would be something you would not want to do. It would be a last resort.\nBut if you're asking me the question, which is more dangerous, a nuclear-armed Iran is more dangerous.\nAnd it should be the clear position of the United States government that we will not allow them to become -- to become nuclear.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd I honestly believe -- and, again, I think this comes from the wisdom of Ronald Reagan -- if we can be clear about this, and our allies can understand this, and China and Russia can understand that we would take action to stop them from becoming nuclear, in our judgment, you know, when that has to happen, if they thought we were very serious about that, I think the chance of the sanctions working -- direct, indirect, disinvestment from Iran, I think the sanctions working would work much more effectively.\nChina and Russia have, obviously, economic interests in dealing with Iran. What they have to see is that America would act. And if America acted, that would be inconsistent with what would be good for them.\nYou've got to understand, in foreign affairs, just like in the affairs of people, self-interest is enormously important. You've got to figure out the other person's self-interest, and then you have to deal with that.\nAnd I think our taking a strong position here would be similar to the difference between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, when he was dealing with Iran.\n(APPLAUSE)\nJimmy Carter had hostages for 444 days. In one hour, the Iranians released the hostages. And they saw something different in Ronald Reagan's eyes than in Jimmy Carter's eyes.\nGOLER: Thank you, Mayor.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSenator Thompson, reporters on your campaign say your stumbles on the Terry Schiavo case and on the issue of oil drilling in the Everglades show that you don't do your homework.\nThe week after, though -- you took a week off after the last debate. Speech yesterday was about five minutes long. Some people say you're lazy, sir.\nHow do you deal with that?\n(LAUGHTER)\nTHOMPSON: Well -- no, it's OK. Let me answer that.\nI was a father at the age of 17 and a husband at the age of 17. I got started working in a factory. I borrowed and worked my way through. My folks did what they could to help. They were country folks -- came in off the farm.\nI was able to be an assistant U.S. attorney when I was 28, prosecuting most of the major federal crimes in middle Tennessee -- most of the major ones.\nTHOMPSON: Howard Baker selected me to go to Washington and be his counsel on the Watergate Committee at the age of 30.\nI came back, took on a corrupt state administration, and won against them. I went to the United States Senate, got elected twice by 20 points in a state that Bill Clinton carried twice.\nCondoleezza Rice called upon me to head up an international security advisory board to advise her on international security matters. President Bush called me to help shepherd Chief Justice -- now-Chief Justice John Roberts' nomination through the Judiciary Committee.\nIf a man can do all that and be lazy, I recommend it to everybody.\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nHUME: And that is it for us tonight. Our thanks to the candidates.\nTHOMPSON: And I should add, the most important -- the most important part is I'm a proud father of five; two of them are under the age of four. So let me add that to the list.\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\nHUME: Our thanks to the candidates and their staffs, to our debate partner, the Republican Party of Florida, and also to all the great people here at the Shingle Creek Resort.\nCandidates, please note our next debate is in Iowa, Tuesday, December 4th. That's just less than a month before the caucus themselves.\nWe'll see you there.\nPresidential Candidate Debates, Republican Presidential Candidates Debate at the Shingle Creek Resort in Orlando Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

If you have questions that are not answered in the blog below related to base access, commissary privileges and MWR, please call Military One Source at 1-800-342-9647.]\nThe Defense Department has announced expanded Commissary, Military Service Exchange and MWR access Jan. 1 and established a standard for physical access to military installations.\nVeterans who are eligible and want to take advantage of in-person benefits must have a Veterans Health Identification Card, or VHIC. Primary Family Caregivers must have an eligibility letter from VA’s Office of Community Care.\nVeterans use VHICs for identification and check-in at VA appointments, but will also use them for base access under the new program.\nVeterans eligible solely under this act who are eligible to obtain a Veteran Health Identification Card must use this credential for in-person installation and privilege access. The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).\nVeterans eligible solely under this act who are not enrolled in or are not eligible to enroll in VA health care, or who are enrolled in VA health care, but do not possess a Veteran Health Identification Card will not have access to DoD and Coast Guard installations for in-person commissary, exchange, and MWR retail privileges, but will have full access to online exchanges and American Forces Travel.\nMedal of Honor recipients and Veterans with 100% service-connected disability ratings are eligible for DoD credentials under DoD policy.\nHow to get a VHIC\nVeterans must be enrolled in the VA health care system to receive a VHIC. To enroll, you can complete an application for enrollment in VA health care by telephone without the need for a signed paper application. Just call 1-877-222-8387 Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. Eastern. You can also apply for VA healthcare benefits online at www.va.gov/healthbenefits/enroll, or in person at your local VA medical facility. Once your enrollment is verified, you can have your picture taken at your local VA medical center, and VA will mail you a VHIC.\nID needed to get VHIC\nTo ensure a Veteran’s identity, enrollees must provide one form of primary identification when requesting a VHIC. Acceptable forms of primary identification are:\nPrimary Identification (Unexpired)\nState-Issued Driver’s License\nUnited States Passport or Passport Card\nOther Government ID\nThis ID can be issued by federal, state or local government agencies provided it contains a photograph, name, date of birth and address. If the address is not on the proofing document, Veterans can provide separate documentation to confirm their address. Acceptable address documents include:\n- Electric bill\n- Cable bill\n- Other mailing document\n- Voters Registration card\nHow long does it take?\nOnce you have your picture taken, you should receive your VHIC within 10 days. If you have questions about the status of your VHIC, you may call your local VA medical facility where you receive your care or contact us at 1-877-222-VETS (8387).\nThe VHIC provides:\nIncreased security for your personal information – no personally identifiable information contained on the magnetic stripe or barcode.\nUnique Member Identifier — Department of Defense assigns an electronic data interchange personal identifier (EDIPI) that allows VA to retrieve the Veteran’s health record.\nA salute to your military service – The emblem of your latest branch of service is displayed on your card. Several special awards will also be listed.\nAccessibility – Braille “VA” helps visually impaired Veterans to recognize and use the card\nAnti-Counterfeiting – Microtext helps prevent reproductions\nLost or stolen?\nIf your VHIC is lost or stolen, contact the VA medical facility where your picture was taken to request a new card be re-issued, or call 1-877-222-VETS (8387). Veterans will need to provide identification information, when reporting lost or stolen cards.\nCaregivers\nEligible caregivers will receive an eligibility letter from VA’s Office of Community Care.\nIf you are a primary family caregiver under the PCAFC and lose your eligibility letter, please call 1-877-733-7927 to request a replacement. Please allow two weeks for processing.\nFor installation access, entry to some commissary stores and at point of sale at commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities, eligible caregivers will need to show an acceptable credential along with their eligibility letter. Acceptable credentials may include:\n- DoD common access card (CAC) (when otherwise eligible)\n- DoD uniformed services identification card (when otherwise eligible)\n- REAL ID-compliant driver’s license issued by a State, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia\n- REAL ID-compliant non-driver’s identification card issued by a State, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia\n- Enhanced driver’s license issued by a State, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia\n- U.S. passport or passport card\n- Foreign passport bearing an unexpired immigrant or non-immigrant visa or entry stamp\n- Federal personal identity verification card (when otherwise eligible)\n- VHIC\n- Transportation Worker Identification Card\nFirst visit\nUpon the first visit to an installation, these eligible Veterans and caregivers must stop at the visitor control center. Depending on the type of installation, Veterans may enroll for recurring access, which would allow them to proceed to the gate for entry upon subsequent visits without having to stop again at the visitor control center.\nAs with all other individuals seeking access to DoD installations, all eligible Veterans must pass a basic on-the-spot background check prior to enrolling, and an automated check each time they enter the installation. Veterans with felony convictions, felony arrest warrants, or other types of derogatory information related to criminal history or terrorism will not be permitted entry.\nFind out more about military resale privileges.\nArmy and Air Force Exchange Service (https://www.shopmyexchange.com/vets)\nCoast Guard Exchange (https://shopCGX.com)\nDefense Commissary Agency (https://www.commissaries.com/)\nNavy Exchange (https://www.mynavyexchange.com/)\nMarine Corps Exchange (http://www.mymcx.com/)\nMILITARY STAR Card (https://www.myecp.com/)\nAmerican Forces Travel (https://www.americanforcestravel.com)\nBased on the hundreds of comments below, here are answers to the most-asked:\nQ: Can I bring a spouse/friend/guest?\nA. Yes, but all guests must go through the required vetting at the visitor control center and must remain with the sponsor at all times.\nVeterans and caregivers should know that while they can bring guests onto the installation and into the facilities, those guests will have to stop at visitor control and go through the required access steps, which includes providing acceptable proof of identity (e.g., REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or U.S. passport) and undergoing a quick basic background check. If the guest shows up without the proper ID, they will not be able to accompany the veteran or caregiver onto the installation.\nQ. Does this includes bases overseas?\nA. It includes installations in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the participating U.S. territories and possessions. Access at installations overseas in foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host countries. So, for now, the answer is not all.\nQ.

Can I go another facility close to me like New Orleans LA or Mobile AL to get my VHIC since I am already enrolled in the Healthcare system.\njust as an FYI, I went to pre-register at a base that’s not far from me. I am service-connected and my VHIC states this under my picture as the requirements state…however, I have an older VHIC card, and the Visitor Control center informed me that they cannot register it. I have to have the newer card. So I ended up having to go to the VA to get the newly issued cards. Apparently this has been happening a lot at this particular installation. He handed me some info they’ve been passing out to veterans.\nI’ve read through all the comments and no answer yet about Japan. I was just told in an email by a high level MWR official that Japan’s SOFA agreement does not allow disabled vets the privileges under the new law. Here is what he wrote:\nTHE HOST-NATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW U.S. CITIZENS RESIDING IN JAPAN TO ACCESS THESE PRIVILEGES UNLESS THEY ARE ACCOMPANYING THE U.S. MILITARY FORCE, OR ARE UNIFORMED SERVICES RETIREES. BECAUSE YOU ARE NEITHER, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COMMISSARIES, EXCHANGES, AND MWR FACILITIES IN JAPAN.\nWE HOPE YOU WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PRIVILEGES WHENEVER YOU ARE BACK IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN A U.S. TERRITORY OR POSSESSION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.\nHowever this is what the law states; “(d) Eligibility Of Veterans With Service-Connected Disabilities.—A veteran with a service-connected disability shall be permitted to use commissary stores and MWR facilities on the same basis as a member of the armed forces entitled to retired or retainer pay.”\nMy reading is that disabled vets are placed in the same category as retired military, therefore they should be eligible under SOFA. I have a DoD ID card since I have over 21 years DoD service, including my Navy service. My pension is deposited in Navy Federal, so I really need base access and am thankful for the DoD ID card. Unfortunately, it looks like the official position is that those of us in Japan are out of luck with the current interpretation of the law and SOFA . I’m hoping that the senior MWR official is mistaken, but at this point-who knows?\nIt sounds like the high level MWR official doesn’t understand the law is the law. If retirees have access you have access.\nVHIC=Retired ID. Plain and simple.\nI would argue that point with them.\nI hate it when these “host” (read defeated) countries can dictate what OUR military can and can’t do.\nThis is what the VA wrote in the article above (scroll up to see it).\nQ. Does this includes bases overseas?\nA: It includes installations in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the participating U.S. territories and possessions. Access at installations overseas in foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host countries. So, for now, the answer is not all.\nCan the DoD/VA/Exchange/Commissary please be more responsible here? Who is working on this issue?\nThe actual answer is YES IT DOES APPLY WORLDWIDE AND UNLESS THE COUNTRY SOFA PROHIBITS RETIRED MILITARY WITH PAY THEN PERHAPS THERE IS NO ACCESS. THE NEW LAW IS CLEAR, EQUAL ACCESS ON THE EQUAL BASIS AS RETIRED WITH PAY. AND EVEN IF THE SOFA PREVENTS ACCESS ON THE SAME BASIS AS RETIRED WITH PAY OR 100% DAV, ISNT THIS A GOOD TIME TO REVIEW THESE ISSUES? WE PAID THE PRICE AND THE USG HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS US THE DISABLED VETERAN MORE THAN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WE PROTECT. THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THE SACRIFICES OF VETERANS MADE TO PROTECT THEIR COUNTRIES, NOT TREAT US LIKE A PILE OF GARBAGE.WHY DOESN’T START A REVIEW TO IMPROVE OTHERWISE POOR ACCESS IN CERTAIN EU COUNTRIES FOR VETERANS OVERSEAS?\nWhat is so difficult about this issue? This law has been passed for almost 2 years now. So with the half answer to this question, come next week, disabled veterans are expected by the DoD to show up at visitors center and request access, then what? Then what about the Exchange/commissary employees overseas, any training? Since the information regarding overseas access at the NEX/PX is not updated yet, what is happening and what is the update, thank you.\nIt needs to say “SERVICE CONNECTED” under VA Healthcare Enrollee. It will only say service connected if you have a service connected disability.\nmy I D has V A health.care enrollee ,will this work\nHello George, “VA Health Enrollee” I was told that will get you on military post after you have register the card through the MP’s main control center but it will not give you access to shop in the commissary or main PX. You must do the leg work and get one of these three identifiers printed on your card. 1. service connect, 2. pow, 3. purple heart, if you don’t see one of these three you will not be able to purchase in person in the commissary and PX. This is what I was told by the managers who work for Afees who had to take the class about this new service to veterans so they and employees would know what to look for on the card. Go see your VA Rep for instructions on how to obtain. Hope this helped you\nWhere can I find the guidance on whether VHIC Card holders will be able to sponsor or utilize trusted traveler for families/friends?\nI have a current Choose VA card. Do I need to get this card as well\nCan a VHIC card holder with a service connected disability be a sponsor for his wife to go on base and also use military lodging?\nI have a friend who is in his 90’s and is an honorably discharged Army Korean War vet. Does he actually have to register with the VA and get a VHIC card if he’s on Medicare?\nyes .. He has to have at least a 0 % service connected or higher .. It will be noted on his new card.\nMy Drivers License has specified Veteran on it and I did need my DD214 to obtain this action. Do I still need to cary my VHAC card in order to in-store shop or will my DL allow me access?\nRead the mission act again.. You have to have the new VHIC card. It has to have the minimum .. 0% service connected on the front of the card… Just having a new VHIC card will not qualify you for access…\nIf 0% or higher…then you do NOT need a service-connected disability to gain access, correct?\nSerious, if a little odd question.\nWith MWR access listed, does that include being able to purchase things like Disney Parks Military Salute tickets?\nonce you and you spouse, guest or significant other goes through the background check as requested do you have to do this everytime you enter that same base you did your initial check at? and further more do you have to get a check for every base you enter, for instance I live in San Diego area which has several bases. is it one background check apply to all bases?\nThink it’s worth mentioning that I think the VA needs to put clarification out because from my base. CAC holders are not authorized the the “trusted traveler” status. Which means, no you cannot bring a spouse, or a friend. Caregivers who are registered yes but just the Vet not others in the car.\nFar as I can tell each state is different\nAs far as I can tell each state is different\n4 Years USMC.

I do have a va health card but it says temp. no idea what that means. i don’t go to the VA. private doctors. this is all to confusing for me. will go to the food banks to make ends meet.\nAs a veteran with physical disability I was using the gyms to continue to strengthen my injury due to my service connected disability by keeping me exercising. Why would I be discontinued to access the gyms that I was accessed before?\nAs an honorable discharged veteran with service disability and never a threat in any way to the facilities, why now am I not allowed to partake in the benefits of a veteran?\nWow – I see a lot of whining from retirees.. Just because you served longer doesn’t make your service any more honorable. Many of us would have served longer but were injured on duty and have been getting screwed for 30 + years by the VA denying benefits for life altering injuries incurred while serving.\nGet off your high horse and realize your area vet just like the us are vets.. So much for the brotherhood I guess.\nI think any vet who served honorably should be eligible. As for the moron who thinks it would lead to “black market” sales.. the PX prices aren’t that friggin great in the first place, there are much easier ways to make money in resale… SMDH\nI have a V.A. ID card for syr. n. y. hospital do I need another\nYou need a new VHIC .. You have to me a minimum of 0% service connected. That is the card you need to access a facility..\nI’m seeing a lot of complaining about giving these deserving vets an added benefit. I’m an Air Force Retiree, 4 years active service (1972-76) and 26 years Active Reserve (1988-2014)–wore the uniform for 30 years. I wouldn’t deny any vet benefits they’re entitled to and there are vets who get benefits I don’t. But, as we all know, getting the government to extend any new benefits to those who served our country faithfully, whether or not they saw combat, has always been a long, rough road. It’s all about the money. I think this is a great new benefit that I hope will help some vets who can use the help. I saw one comment regarding the exclusion of Coast Guard vets, and I’m inclined to research that one a little further. It doesn’t seem fair to treat the Coasties any different–they ARE brothers and sisters in arms. The Coast Guard was my first choice, but the waiting list was longer back in the day. I have nothing but respect for all of our vets! Have a problem with this program? Write your Senators and Congress members–especially those who are vets themselves!\nAs a person who is much more grateful for what I have than resentful about the lack thereof, I’m content to have the privilege of shopping online at AAFES (even though I signed up a few years ago but have yet to make purchase #1). The “luxury” garbage sold by them doesn’t interest me, and the prosaic items are cheaper at Costco. Thank you all for your service.\nRef: to Calvin Rodney Ford, Dec. 5th, 2019 response:\nHe mentions ” you can be 100% and only get paid for 50% it’s the VA way of keeping more of the money.” Is this accurate or true? If so how can a veteran find out his/her status to this claim?\nTypical…and one of the reasons I didn’t want to stay in the military anymore . . .because of assh*le troops like the guys bitching above because someone is getting a benefit they don’t want others to have.\nANOTHER ISSUE …. is that in virtually every Military Era, there are those who served, are Honorably Discharged, and years or decades LATER, it is determined that they have medical issues that appeared later. AGENT ORANGE for example. How many VETS served in Vietnam and it was later determined that they have conditions that become more sever over time. AGENT ORANGE has been found to be PRESUMPTIVE for cancers, diabetes, heart diseases, etc. Their life expectancy has been shortened … their earning capability has been shortened. This small benefit will be valuable to some. ALSO …. not that many even live close to an active installation now with all the closings and consolidations.\nFINALLY … why would anyone begrudge the extension of a benefit to others who have served and are found to be in need. They also paid TAXES that fund retirement and benefits for all who served.\n20% disabled when I left the military …. 80% disabled today from AGENT ORANGE exposure.\ni am an 82 year old service connected vet and there must be a short cut to get this card.I am not as sharp as i used to be ! thanks!\nMr. Rodgers,\nIf you’re anywhere close to Arkansas, I will personally come help you get this card. It’s not hard at all. Or, you could ask your local VA rep in your town to help you out. Basically, all you need is to take your proof of service (DD214 or whatever) and get to your VA hospital. They’ll make the card for you. I’ll answer any questions I can for ya. I like to do all I can to help my service brothers & sisters out.\nI have a vhic card. I was honorably discharged USMC after 3 years service In 1978.\nI have a felony conviction for growing 5 marijuana plants in my back yard in 1981, 38 years ago.\nRegarding the “quick backround check”,I read if you have a felony conviction I will be denied access.\nMy question is will I be denied access to exchange for a 38 year old felony?\nI had an felonious assault conviction 6 years ago and had it expunged. Have yours expunged. I now own guns again.\nAs of now you need a service connected disability for this ‘benny’ . So unless you are concerned about being a guest to get on, you aren’t affected anyways.\nThis updated info?\nFirst visit\nUpon the first visit to an installation, these eligible Veterans and caregivers must stop at the visitor control center. Depending on the type of installation, Veterans may enroll for recurring access, which would allow them to proceed to the gate for entry upon subsequent visits without having to stop again at the visitor control center.\nAs with all other individuals seeking access to DoD installations, all eligible Veterans must pass a basic on-the-spot background check prior to enrolling, and an automated check each time they enter the installation. Veterans with felony convictions, felony arrest warrants, or other types of derogatory information related to criminal history or terrorism will not be permitted entry.\nLots of comments on this one… Not sure why, haven’t read them yet. Why is it no one wants to address all the radiation in VA treatment areas. Even my nurse & nurse practitioner were wearing smart watches. I have health benefits I cant use because I’m EHS. I’m reading about some military bases now getting 5G. Things are going in the wrong direction.\nIt states MWR retail and includes golf courses. How about Famcamps?\nUnder the new program will qualified members access to,shades of Green, Halekoa, Dragon Hill?\nI’m a vet with an honorable discharge and don’t get any of these new benefits even though I have spent a lifetime in our military on active duty, national guard, inactive reserves, and service academy grad. Count your blessings if you have these benefits. Our government does not recognize all veterans having “equal service” when it comes to qualifying for entitlements!\nDid you retire? If so , you already get this benny. I did 10 years active and some delayed enlistment, and till now have gotten nothing for it!\nI think gave the wrong name of who added benefits on defense appropriation bill that was Late senator John McCain .\nRIP. His funeral was Sep 1, 2018.\nI served and was honorably discharged from the Air Force but was told when I tried to obtain a VHIC I was not eligible due to the income restrictions associated with the VA. Was this new program designed to exclude me and other fellow military veterans from access to BX/Commissary privileges solely because our income exceeds enrollment limitations. I’m not trying to utilize other VA benefits; just gain access to these facilities.\nI was told the same thing. I am an Honorably discharged US Army Veteran, and I was denied a VHIC because of my current salary. Had I applied years ago when I was at the poverty level, I would have been eligible. As you said, I am not trying to obtain Veteran’s health care, I would just like to shop at the PX and commissary.\nFrom my understanding, they are working on a resolution for those of you who fall into this category\nJust because you qualify for VA Health benefits, and obtain an ID card, DOSE NOT mean you have to use the VA for your healthcare. You can go see a prime care dr once a year to remain active in the system, if you want, but you don’t HAVE to be seen at the VA.\nDid you retire? If so , you already get this benny. I did 10 years active and some delayed enlistment, and till now have gotten nothing for it!\nAbove reply was for a different post. Current requirements are service connected or purple heart or POW.\nSo not all vets get this yet.\nAs of Nov 11, 2017 any honorably discharged veteran of the 5 branches are eligible to shop the Exchanges online-only. The new rule effective Jan 01, 2020 is for physical base access to visit an Exchange in person. The new benefit does require special qualifications as noted on a VHIC card. Many people will not be eligible for the new base access privileges.\nYou will need to file a disability claim. You might get zero percentage for compensation but you will get “service connected” printed on your VHIC\nHi everyone,\nI was very pleased to find out about the commissary privileges given to veterans like me, however I was disappointed when I found out that these privileges do not extend to the US Coast Guard because they’re part of the department of Homeland Security not the DOD….I think it should be extended to DHS as well since we’re all brothers and sisters who have protected and served our nation during war and peace and it shouldn’t be a barrier to access the commissaries across the network.\nPresident Trump can actually sign an order to make this happen.\nSemper Fi\nGlad to say you’ve been misinformed Jorge. I’m a 27 yr CG retiree with 60% service connected disability from injuries while deployed serving Iraq and at sea in the Northern Arabian Gulf in 2003-2004 as well as cumulative injuries sustained doing counternarcotic patrols in the Caribbean and off the Columbian coast. Coasties are treated exactly like any other Military service regarding VA care, commissary privileges, etc. And for that I am super grateful, thankful and blessed.\nBut you say you are a ‘retiree’ , that fact gives you access already. How about a CC who didn’t retire? That is the point in question. Is CC like any other veteran?\nHi Jorge, I would suggest calling to be sure. The article specifically lists the Coast Guard Exchange. The new rule effective Jan 01, 2020 requires special status (e.g. Purple Heart) for physical base access for in-person shopping. You can already shop the CG Exchange online as of Nov 11, 2017 as a veteran with an Honorable discharge.\nI don’t understand why everyone retired is so mad about this. Less than one percent of the US population has served, and you all are acting like as soon as other veterans have access to base its going to be a constant black Friday rush. Calm down, Johnny Awesome, you’ll still have your golf courses. Change happens, get over it, or at least we were told to “Suck it up and drive on.” Furthermore, it would also behoove you to maybe NOT treat us all like bottom-feeders. #KTHXBAI\nThis is great and all, but it would be much easier for base personnel if they gave eligible vets a CAC. I wouldn’t mind bringing my VHIC to the nearest ID Card Office and getting a CAC. It just feels like this wasn’t well thought out.\nAre the old VA. Service connected i.d. ok\nOr do you need the new one.. i serviced 1964 to 1967. 10% disability. My car had large flag on it\nyou need the new ID\nI do not know if this info is in all the above text messages. I talked with an official at the Ft Benning commissary and was told all Vets using their VA health care card would be charged 1.8% for using their credit or debit card each time you use the store. I thought this info would have been told during the news , good news, regarding the Vets ability to use the ( well most of the) post, base, or what ever each Branch calls their amenities.\nThe commissary charges everyone that fee.\nHaving worked with the main commissary facility in Ft. Lee VA, that fee provides the necessary resources to keep AFEES running, but new scanners for inventory, purchase services like new and more robust data centers across the globe. I’ll vlady pat the small amount rather than the 5-8% state taxes. This money goes directly into a fund that the managers take very seriously. It’s for the enlisted and officers and keeps costs down.\nI guess 13 years in the Navy means nothing , was a E6 that did my job everyday ,but had a E8 that was by the book , when I put in the paperwork to reenlist ,was told it was denied .said that I couldn’t adapt , just another way of saying that I didn’t kiss ass , the same thing I still do to this day , if I have to taste s–t ,I will do without\nI’ve met your type before. Refuse to do things because you think it’s “kissing ass” or beneath you yet blame everyone else like your E8 for your problems. Life is about adapting and as long as you refuse to you’ll always be “denied” and blocked from advancing. Try not thinking everyone is out to get you and just follow the rules because I can tell you I’ve only met one type of person that is “denied” reenlistment.\nThere are two sides to every comment. Hopefully you aren’t saying ‘politics’ aren’t in affect in the armed forces! It is my way or the highway attitude. In the 10 years I was in i saw it frequently. A chief who said I reminded him of his worthless son ordered those under him to write me poor annual reviews affecting my promotions. Another installation I was taken out of a supervisor job for no other apparent reason but skin color. When I discovered I outranked the other individual they had me working under then, I was moved to another position that didn’t even exist.\nSo the kiss but, good ol boys club , etc I am sure still exists today!\nI was able to find the following at the below website:\n“This means that they will not be able to use the gyms, since these are subsidized by the DoD. However, they can patronize MWR-run on base restaurants, movie theaters and golf courses. On base hotels, bowling alleys and other for-profit enterprises are also going to be opened to identified categories of veterans and caregivers”.\nhttps://militaryshoppers.com/exchanges-and-mwr-opening-up-for-more-veterans-in-2020/\nAlso:\n“That includes the PX, commissary, and other retail stores on base, in addition to morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) facilities, such as golf courses, bowling areas, campgrounds, and lodging facilities, per Military.com”.\nopps forgot how about MAC flights on space A?\nAre you joking? That is for retirees and 100% service connected veterans.\nwill lodging, billeting be authorized as they are MWR programs?\nAny clarity on SOFA in the United Kingdom? I would shop at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, if permitted by UK law, as I am rated at 90% Service Connected.\nThe large response to this article is due in part to its misleading TITLE: “Veterans need Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) to access bases for commissary/BX/MWR privileges.”\nI,like many others, thought that this was referring to me. I am a vet, honorably discharged, with a VHIC card! Why not me, and millions of others like me, who served over the decades (1962 – 1965), but never had to go “down range!”\nThat Commissary benefit would be an appropriate “Thank You,” even though a bit delayed.\nBut there are RESTRICTIONS to who is eligible for this privilege: those with active duty, “service-connected,” injuries…as the article goes on to lay out. Sort of a clumsy, thoughtless, “bait and switch” scheme, if you ask me! You piqued the hopes and desires of millions of ordinary vets, and their families, with VHIC cards, only to quickly squelch those hopes, sending us back with our heads bowed in disappointment! Shame on you, and shame on those who under fund these important and beneficial programs, then restrict them to a tiny (though deserving) minority. Expand these MWR benefits at least to the honorably discharged (with income restrictions, if necessary). Now that would be a Merry Christmas!!\nVeterans Department, I am a disabled veteran. Who do I contact and what is the office postal address and telephone number at the military barracks canteen exchange to order the mail order house. Can they arrange locomotive engine to trasnport the house to Nye, County, NV? Entire house wanted, furnishing, table, chair, bedding, linen, lumber, window casings, doors, flooring, sink, toilet, cast iron back tub, roofing, brick, and mortor.\nAs my Father’s Caregiver and Plenary Guardian I applied for and received a DBIDS Smart Card. As I am sure you are aware this allows me the same privileges as a VHIC. My issue is that I work full time and also take care of my Father. I attempted to make purchases online through my Father’s “Shop My Exchange” account and my order was canceled. When I contacted Customer Service I was told that “Caregivers” are not allowed to Shop on Line for the Sponsor. Why would this be the case?\nIf you could just wait till January 1st, and attempt to make another purchase, this will clarify if the VA is not confusing your purchase for your dad as part of the rollout starting January 1st. If you still get a cancellation then that will tell you there is something wrong, because everyone and including caregivers will be allowed to make purchases. Even though you have your caregiver card on you sometimes things just fall through the cracks.\nI cannot believe the condescending “my service was better than yours“ comments. The fact of the matter is that any of us that took the oath and wore the uniform served our great country.\nThe VA card does not have to say “service connected,” it has to say “health care enrollee” and which branch of service, I.e., Army, Air Force… I will always hold respect for those who served in country during conflict, WWII, Korean, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom and so forth, but those that stayed stateside, we’re never deployed served support roles. As a Vietnam Era WAC, I’ve endured harassment, discrimination, and sexual trauma, and I was not allowed to see conflict. We are all veterans! Be kind to each other as we are a brotherhood and sisterhood that anyone who has never served would not understand.\nYes, I agree with you 100 percent. My card says “Health Care Enrollee,” and there shouldn’t be an issue with using it as proof of honorable service.\nIf you see the actual photo of the ID above, it does list “VA Healthcare Enrollee” under our photos, among the other listed classifications that were discussed, so it is acceptable. I have used mine many times with no issues, the only better thing now is the fact that we can utilize an array of services now. It’s about time\nIt has to be the new style VHIC .. 0 % service connected as a minimum.\n“for in-person installation and privilege access. The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).“\nVeterans eligible who are enrolled in VA health care, “but do not possess a Veteran Health Identification Card will not have access to DoD and Coast Guard installations for in-person commissary,” exchange, and MWR retail privileges, but will have full access to online exchanges and American Forces Travel.\nI believe that the term “service connected” refers to classification for disabilities resulting from injuries sustained during qualified active duty service. This has to do with the veteran’s eventual VA Disability Rating; it has nothing to do with his/her branch of service.\nVeterans eligible solely under this act who are eligible to obtain a Veteran Health Identification Card must use this credential for in-person installation and privilege access. The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED)..\nJust having health care enrolled wont cut it.\nDoes this include military billeting?\nYes! I have a buddy still in and he verified for me that you can stay in lodging on base under this new law. Made me very happy as well!!\nI am veteran but did not retire from the military and i do have veteran benefits With a VA valid card can i use the military commissary\nWhat a bunch of f(redacted)n whiners\nYou need the new VHIC and you have to be a minimum of 0 % service connected on the front right of the card..\nTo ensure this isn’t a slap in the face to retired veterans, I believe those that are retired shouldn’t be required to pay the commissary surcharge and those that are now receiving the privilege should pay the surcharge. That way the retirees are still being honored for there service.\nA veteran is a veteran. We all have sacrificed. What makes a retiree more important than a veteran who had to separate for other reasons. The veteran community has always been more selfless than what you are requesting. Everyone’s story is different. Be blessed.\nI will preface my answer with the fact that this is only my opinion; however, I believe that your retirement pension/benefits is already providing you that same honor. To state that people who served as little as 4 or as much as 18 years did not fulfill honorable service to the country I believe is disingenuous. Also, for individuals like me who have worked as a federal civilian employee for 12 years since my six years of active military service this is the first time they are allowing us to access it and it’s not like we’re not serving honorably either. Just my thought.\nMy comment to you is, “Wow,” so if someone did not retire like yourself, then we should not be honored for our service? As long as you served and were Honorably Discharged, then you should be honored for your service, despite the amount of years you served. What would make you anymore special? we all served with some staying in longer and some not for perhaps other reasons; however, they should not be shamed and considered not to be honored for their service.\nRetirees are honored once a month with their retirement checks.\nNo I don’t go along with your comments…retirees get a monthly retirement pay and Tricare because they chose to stay in for 20 years or more. Should you be thought of as less because you got out and pursued other avenues? These are benefits that should had been in place decades before now.\nPeople asking about OCONUS I know in South Korea it will be OK.\nAnyplace retirees are able to shop you will have access.\nPart of the new law:\n1065. Use of commissary stores and MWR facilities: certain\nveterans and caregivers for veterans\n‘‘(a) ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS AWARDED THE PURPLE HEART.—\nA veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart shall be permitted\nto use commissary stores and MWR facilities on the same basis\nas a member of the armed forces entitled to retired or retainer\npay.\n‘‘(b) ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS WHO ARE MEDAL OF HONOR\nRECIPIENTS.—A veteran who is a Medal of Honor recipient shall\nbe permitted to use commissary stores and MWR facilities on the\nsame basis as a member of the armed forces entitled to retired\nor retainer pay.\n‘‘(c) ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS WHO ARE FORMER PRISONERS\nOF WAR.—A veteran who is a former prisoner of war shall be\npermitted to use commissary stores and MWR facilities on the\nsame basis as a member of the armed forces entitled to retired\nor retainer pay.\n‘‘(d) ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS WITH SERVICE-CONNECTED\nDISABILITIES.—A veteran with a service-connected disability shall\nbe permitted to use commissary stores and MWR facilities on the\nsame basis as a member of the armed forces entitled to retired\nor retainer pay.\n‘‘(e) ELIGIBILITY OF CAREGIVERS FOR VETERANS.—A caregiver\nor family caregiver shall be permitted to use commissary stores\nand MWR facilities on the same basis as a member of the armed\nforces entitled to retired or retainer pay.\n‘‘(f) USER FEE AUTHORITY.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall\nprescribe regulations that impose a user fee on individuals who\nare eligible solely under this section to purchase merchandise at\na commissary store or MWR retail facility.\nRegards paragraph (d) – I am an honorably discharged vet with a service connected disability. Since I am being treated by a non-VA doctor I am not enrolled the VA health system and my care is paid for by non-VA insurance. A couple of years ago the VA started issuing a new Veterans Identification Card so the thousands of people out there in the same situation had proper identification for discounts from stores, etc. Why is this card not being updated to include “SERVICE CONNECTED” so it can be used for this additional access? I am sure that there are thousands of guys out there in the same situation.\nThis is for those who keep asking this (unintelligent) question after this info was posted in the article:\nQ: Can I bring a spouse/friend/guest?\nA. Yes, but all guests must go through the required vetting at the visitor control center and must remain with the sponsor at all times.\nVeterans and caregivers should know that while they can bring guests onto the installation and into the facilities, those guests will have to stop at visitor control and go through the required access steps, which includes providing acceptable proof of identity (e.g., REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or U.S. passport) and undergoing a quick basic background check. If the guest shows up without the proper ID, they will not be able to accompany the veteran or caregiver onto the installation.\nQ. Does this includes bases overseas?\nA. It includes installations in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the participating U.S. territories and possessions. Access at installations overseas in foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host countries. SO, FOR NOW THE ANSWER IS NOT ALL INSTALLATIONS OVERSEAS WILL HONOR THIS PRIVILEGE!!!\nQ. Does this include Class Six, gyms, golf courses?\nA. Yes to Class Six, no to gyms, yes to golf\nwhich is the minimum % for a service connected to obtain this privilege, or the veteran have to have 100% compensation\nHaving a “Service Connected” injury is what makes this available to you. Whether it’s 0% or 100%, your still allowed this benefit.\n0% service connected qualifies\nVets need transportation not silly cards.\nThis is sensational news. I tried to go on a base one time because l thought we already had this privilege. Got embarrassed. Had to pull out of line and u-turn it off the base.\nPeople are going to be mad at me for this, but this new policy sucks. I served 20 years and base privileges were an entitlement I earned through retirement. Giving everyone who served with a rating base privileges takes away from what I earned. You want base privileges do 20 years. I wonder if this was done to bring in more business to base. Anyway, I’m disappointed with this new policy.\nNavy Seal who served 14 years and 364 days, was injured in Afghanistan seriously with head injury. He did several tours in the Middle East and is fluent in Farsi, and Tagalog for his embedded tours in the Philippines. Navy would not give him the one extra day he needed for retirement. This man served his country under the most adverse conditions and sacrificed more than just his blood, sweat and tears. His father (also a Navy veteran) died while he was serving his country. His 2 grandfathers, one grandmother, both parents, and several uncles served in the US military.\nPlease don’t be “disappointed” with this policy. Many, many veterans made sacrifices regardless of years served.\nCouldn’t agree with you more!\nWhat will happen when the disabled homeless vets start pan handling, setting up tent cities. Refuse to leave the base ect.\nHas base Security received training on dealing with drug addicted, mentally ill homeless disabled VETS that refuse to leave the facility?\nTo KN Klein. Absolutely. Some retirees have not sacrificed as much as others/Vets who had served shorter terms…We ALL served and “honorably” need to be the only criteria. As a retiree, I have no problem with benefits to Vets.\nare you serious?\nI was hurt and was discharged. I fought to stay in and retrain but the ruling of 5 officers said no. So I did not have the chance to do 20 years. So you are saying you are better than those of us who were discharged due to our being hurt. Glad you had a long and safe time in the military.\nI am very disappointed in my fellow retired Vets. Mr. Eric Hughes, if you only retired to keep your commissary/Exchange benefits, that would explain your comment. As a retired vet, this should be for all honorable Vets, period. I retired for a pension personally, like most realistic people. I don’t really shop at the exchanges because I have found cheaper prices as most companies price match.\nIt’s because the commissary is losing money to the stores on the outside of the base\nAnyone that’s enrolled in the VA Health System, but, does not have a card, needs to get there card immediately, it’s a new method of tracking all veterans now, they the Gov’t want to keep an accurate count of how many Vets are out of circulation/underground etc.. Upon getting the card you should be able to have access to all military facilities/benefits.\nJust having a VA healthcare card doesn’t make you qualify for these benefits. The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).for you to be eligible for base privileges, etc.\nThe sense of entitlement is overwhelming here..you were lucky enough to leave the military with your health…enjoy it!\nI am a 30 year retired CSM, In the late 30’s the Veterans Hospital were set up for Retired Military, and those that were injured while on active duty. Those veterans that did their two or three years and went back to their families and friends were not authorized these privileges! Most veterans lived on a substandard pay, civilians workforce made two or three times the money military received for the same work, civilians did not have to pick up and move every few years relocating their families. Those that sacrificed their lives and families, to serve and protect our Great Nation were awarded these privileges. In the mid 90’s there were not enough veterans utilizing these VA hospitals and there was a push to close many facilities, Someone made a decision to allow anyone with an honorable discharge access to VA health care system, utilizing a co-pay amount, depending on your yearly income. Then Obama care came to be, the veterans healthcare system was swamped by people taking advantage of VA Hospital. Now the retired of injured veterans who were previously authorized the healthcare are having to wait for treatment because the health system is overwhelmed with new patients, Big failure! Now another dumb change, allowing anyone with a Honorable discharge access to our military facilities is another big mistake! All military facilities are tax exempt, there will be a lot of resale (Black Marketing) of items purchased on base. Lifers sacrifice family and friends spending years away from loved ones. not counting the years spent in combat. I personally spent twenty three (23) years over seas. These are some of the sacrifices retired veterans do to earn these privileges. Why should they be given to non retired individuals?\nAgain, please remember those who sacrificed so much, were riffed at 18 years served, or were afflicted with PTSD, who lost marriages, who worked 84-96+ grueling hours/week for 8 years in the Army (equivalent to 16 years for a civilian) plus 4 years reserves, etc. Or the injured Navy Seal mentioned above whose injuries and related issues prevented a 20 year career…and someone higher up in command literally discharged him one day before he would have met retirement criteria.\nSuggestions: 1. Full retirees and disabled vets SHOULD be given TOP priority for apptmts.\n2. Your insight regarding black marketing is valid. State and federal taxes could be charged for non-retirees non-disabled; however that could be difficult to implement and possibly more costly and onerous to administer. You have a very good point. Possibly a set amount, example 10% could be added for non-retired/non-disabled veterans. This could then go back to funding services particularly for disabled vets.\n3. Maybe a special checkout for retirees/disabled making purchases if an area is crowded or there are long lines. Possibly a max dollar amount per month which would cap the newly eligible folks; to prevent misuse of the system.\nSomething flakey here. A service member who is wounded, and forcibly retired because of injuries, wouldn’t be summarily discharged. He/she would be medically retired. Big difference there. And no officer or panel can “give” a dash of service. No process to allow that. It’s bad enough that we will now allow non-serving/retired service members at exchanges, gyms, etc. Those facilities are over-stretched as it is. No facility can absorb the massive impact if everyone decided to use them. Today, it is veery difficult to use things like auto shops and especially campgrounds. Add a huge influx, and today’s authorized users are screwed. I respect all veterans, but this is ridiculous. AAFES and such merely want to increase profits….which is sensible. But the impact will be like when USAA insurance opened to enlisted and just relatives of service members. Service will be impacted for everyone.\nGood point on USAA, thought I was the only one that noticed. Used to love them but had to switch to progressive actually.\nAs far as I can see, the new regulations are not allowing every veteran to have access. They must be classified as having a service connected disability. There is nothing funny about being disabled. Also, there were a few comments about veterans using VA hospitals. That’s only in very restricted ways, not something every veteran can take advantage of. Finally, others are too incensed about this benefit for an additional group of service members and veterans. Frankly, with all the online sales places like Amazon, Cot o and Walmart, finding and driving on to a military installation for shopping isn’t much of a benefit to most veterans.\nDear CSM You are wrong and you respect your fellow vets. So don’t thick you for better than the rest of us that did not do 20 years\nhow about those of us who were hurt while serving our country and not given the chance to do the 20 or more years? Or are we to be just under your foot as dirt? You talk like you are better than those of us that got hurt.\nKim Stone: Thank you for your service. I was hurt and was discharged. I fought to stay in and retrain but the ruling of 5 officers said no. So I did not have the chance to do 20 years. So you are saying you are better than those of us who were discharged due to our being hurt. Glad you had a long and safe time in the military.\nSo what you’re saying is people that served longer deserve more privileges than those who haven’t. A regular old grunt could hit an IED causing life altering brain injury’s in his first year; and you say he’s not deserving because he didn’t do 20 years. F*** YOU. Come on man you should be wiser by now. Think about it, each members situation is different but there must be a minimum qualification and a Service connected disability is a good one. Some served only a few years but have sacrificed more than all your years. It could be reversed also I recognize. Regardless if someone served honorably and was injured due to their service that member deserves benefits. End of story!!!\nMy nephew is ready to go golfing. He only served 1 month in Navy bootcamp, hurt his leg, and got an honorable discharge. The VA gave him 0% service connected and he got his VHIC. He said that when he goes golfing in 2020, a retired Admiral has to wait in line behind him and can’t golf if he got last spot and if he uses hotel lodging and gets the last room, Admiral has to sleep in his car. We laughed a lot. Now all sc veterans with just a month served are equal to retired officers. I bet that soon all sc can fly free Space A. Bye, see y’all at the commissary.\nThat’s the dumbest comment I’ve read on here so far. If you think that your nephew or any other vet who is allowed these new privileges will take precedence over an active duty vet or retire of any rank you’re not that damn intelligent.\nIn countless cases the only reason one person was able to retire and another left service prior to retirement or lies dead in the ground is dumb luck. There should be some privilege, and that privilege should be extended to all those in Active Duty, because they may not come home tomorrow.\nALL others to the back of the line.\nOnly Disabled veterans with a service connected disability 0 TO 90 percent. Honorably discharged veterans ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROGRAM..\nI served as an MP for 10 years. My K9 partner got service connected for having ticks and has a VA Vet (veterinarian) Services card. Can I shop with my K9?\nI read through the questions and if they had comprehend the intro text the answers world of been answered.\nMy service connected disability is 10% and will use the on base facilities. The late John McFall added our new benefits\ninto the defense appropriation bill so thank him for leaving a legacy.\nI have said for years that vets need these added benefits and will increase the sales in Commentary and exchange etc.\nBeing a retired civil service employee get to use the MILITARY VACATION CLUB and have a retired base pass.\nOnce again most Vets are on the outside looking in. We served at a great cost and some gave more than others and we honor them but we’re all honorably discharged Vets. Don’t leave doing the right thing for all Vets to the civilian business community. We need their help but we are yours. We followed our leaders and lead with honor for our country. As a Vet with base access and only the standard issue Vet ID, I would think much more could be done for all honorably discharge Vets.\nAll honorably/ under honorable conditions vets can get these benefits but you have to file a disability claim in which case you will be giving a rating of 0-90% with service connected, former pow, or purple heart printed on the card\nWhat other medals qualifies for this benefit besides purple heart and Medal of Honor? Since these two medals were the only examples, is there a list somewhere of all qualified medals for this benefit?\nAny veteran that served honorably should have access to commissary bx what ever store on base…I was in the infantry went to battle didn’t get wounded thank god didn’t get a medal vid honor and did not get captured by the enemy I did my service and would do it again if allowed why not allow m to shop on base…\ni did not see anywhere that we could use hotel inside base can we\nI’m confused… and didn’t read through all the comments but, at this time is the benefit only extended to PH and 100% SC vets?\nPurple Hearts, Former POWs, and vets with service connected disabilities (VHIC must state one of these). Medal of Honor recipients and retirees already had this privilege.\nI’ve been trying to get my AF medical records for quite sometime now. I went to the VA and the VA says we don’t have them and to go to St. Louis….St. Louis says no we don’t have them and to go back to the VA…..and that’s where I’m stuck in the mud. I separated from the AF in 1984. Any suggestions or advice…..\nWork with a Veteran organization like DAV and they may be able to help with this.\nI served from 1959 to 1967. Assigned a 0% disability by the VA in 1963. Continued to be blown off by the VA until 2015 when I contacted my U.S. Congressman (Dan Webster (R) FL) who was able to mysteriously locate my missing service/medical records & was finally assigned a 10% service connected disability. Put your representatives & senators to work for you instead of them wasting our money & their time being unproductive in DC.\nTry your local Veteran representative in your community. The one in Coldwater, Michigan has been tremendously helpful.\nRecords may exist in obscure places. The VA and St. Louis could not find any record of a one week hospitalization in Landstuhl Germany, but there was an entry in an outpatient progress note that showed that one medication was refilled later related to that diagnosis.\nI would put your concerns in writing, and persist in the search. Possibly check again if it has been awhile since you tried.\nIf there happen to be any medications related to your diagnosis, any notation that it was prescribed while in the military could get the ball rolling.\nSelwyn Garner: I got discharged in 1985 after being hurt. My records are also gone, and according to a letter I got back around 1991, there is a national search looking for my records (LOL). Still do not have them. Keep bugging everyone you can and maybe (I hope they do) they will find them. Good luck and Thank You for your service.\nI was drafted then did another 14 yrs in the reserves. last time I went to re-up in ’85 they couldn’t find my records, either. (2) congressional investigations and 1 senatorial inquiry (McCain) later…nothing.\nFinally, (5) yrs ago they determined that some other (unknown) federal agency requested my records, as I had been telling them all along, and they haven’t been seen since. Fortunately, my DD-214 was all I needed for eligibility.\nGood luck! I was US Amy 1967 to 1975 with Vietnam service 1970 and 1971. In 1991, without keeping copies, St Louis Records Center sent the ORIGINALS of my eight years of Army medical records to the Albuquerque, New Mexico VARO. The VARO acknowledged receiving the records, but they have never been seen again. Despite decades of Congressional complaints, nobody at VA will even talk about what happened to my records. The VA is a crime syndicate\nCommon people, read the article!\nNOW read it again.\nSee there now all your questions are answered.\n“Common people”? If someone has a comprehension problem, you are not superior to them. Some veterans with head injuries and/or PTSD deserve your respect, even if they may not fully comprehend what they read as well as you do.\nThere is no harm asking a question, even if it is repetitive or redundant. Are you truly that invested in correcting “common” people? You certainly seem to feel that way. Let the questions happen, the more the merrier!\nuh duh, KN; he meant c’mon (lol)\nI already have a CAC for base access as a DoD employee. Do I need a VHIC to shop in person? I already have online access\nYers you will need the VHIC with one of the 3 identifiers printed on the front of the card\nIf you were awarded 0%, it will say “Service Connected” on the VHIC. 0% means that you have a service related condition, but the VA doesn’t consider it to be compensatible with a monthly disability check, You can still treatment at a VA facility. For instance hearing loss might be rated at 0% which means the VA will provide you with hearing aids.\nFrom HUNDREDS of comments you came of with 3 questions??…… and use of the gym or golf course made that list? Man it would seem that 24 hr fitness and the local Country Club are going to see a plunge in their bottom line for 2020!!\nDo you have to be 100% disables to enter the commissary even if you have the card and are service connected?\nSame question, i.e. are the “old” VHIC cards, one with the US flag across it, bar code on the end, and states “Service Connected” under my picture, usable at the bases?\nsame question. my id has flag across with no branch of service identified and “va healthcare enrollee”\nunder my picture. I am 40% disabled and receive monthly checks but none of that is reflected on the\ncard.\nVA please clarify this new policy.\nSounds like me and many others need a new updated card.\nSigned\nCONFUSED\nGood info. I have a VHIC card with 80% disabled. You mentioned military golf courses are eligible. Does this include the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO?\nThank you\nI have a service connected disability and so does my husband. Are we allowed to bring our small children on base with us. There is info on this article but I says nothing about dependants. Children Dont have i.d.\nThere’s no way they would make you leave your children at the gate.\nI have a VA medical card due to being exposed to chemicals in the Camp Lejeune water supply. That seems service connected. The VA is paying the out-of-pocket for my daughter’s cancer treatments.\nDoes this benefit includes staying at Military campsites … FamCamp?\nThat would be a useful benefit!\nContact MWR on March AFB\nI had a fellow soldier who in a drunken rage punched a window. He damaged some nerves in his hand and lost some mobility to his ring finger and pinky. He is now service connected I believe 10 % . He did 8 mos service before receiving a general discharged (unable to adapt).\nI did 20 years, honorable discharge. 12 surgeries while in, also 2 deployments. I now share the same benefits minus TRICARE as everyone? Time, quality of service or even completing your first enlistment means nothing? So now the quality of my benefits goes down.\nFeel free to jump on my a$$ for my opinion. I don’t care I will not reply said all I need to say.\nI had a fellow soldier who in a drunken rage punched a window.

That’s gotta be almost as bad as having to put up with seeing those sorry part time Reservists like myself walking around on post like they have actually earned the right to be there, lol. Kiss my a**.\nThis should have happened years ago!\nSad / selfish statement.\nWe in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. When entering our zip code at\nhttps://www.commissaries.com/shopping/store-locations/find-a-store\nwe were given Camp Pendleton as our nearest commissary at:\nBldg 20850 Vandergrift Blvd., Camp Pendleton MCB, CA 92055-5212\nThis is a 12 to 24 hour round trip drive from where we live. Not Good!\nLos Angeles AFB is a two to three hour drive depending on the traffic.\nIs there any military commissary near Van Nuys or Burbank, California?\nMarch Air Reserve bade has a decent size commissary and a small BX — both in riverside CA\nDoD base overseas should be included. We have veterans there aswell.\nI lived in Chatsworth, which is in the northwest portion of the San Fernando Valley a number of years ago and I am aware that things do change but I also know for a fact that the Navy has a test facility and a Naval Air Station in the Oxnard/Ventura area and the Air Force has Edwards Air Force base located in the Riverside area. I also believe that there are a couple Air Force facilities in the Palmdale area but these might be secret high-security test facilities. In addition, if you drove a little further northeast to the China Lake Naval Weapons Center located in China Lake California. Be sure to stop to eat at the Golden Frog restaurant if you visit this Naval base and town. The main Air Force Command Center is located close to LAX but I would call each of these and Google them. Oh, Van Nuys Air National Guard station at Van Nuys offers various services such as issuing Veteran IDs and offering military veteran discounts on all sorts of things, including travel.\nGood Luck,\nSteve Brenot\nThe last time I checked, driving from the San Fernando Valley to Oceanside aka Camp Pendleton is not a 12 to 24 hour roundtrip. I live outside the base and yes, it would take a couple of hours, but that is all – so at the most you might have a 5 hour round trip, make it a day of fun going and coming, but again it is not 12 to 24 hours round trip unless you decide to stay in a hotel, then of course, but you might want to check your Google Maps again.\nIf your getting the benefits, then use them. I used to live in camp Pendleton and drove to van nuys every weekened for liberty. Are you taking a horse carriage to say that it takes 12-24 hrs HAHAHAHA to say the least i would understand 3 hrs max. Stop complaining use the benefit and live life. What a fu@%&^ shame…\nWill the access to MWR include the ability to purchase discounted tickets?\nI can’t answer your question, but Vet Tix is a source for discounted tickets for veterans.\nShort answer is YES!\nThis assess has nothing to do with the current administration or the VA fighting for the rights of non-retired veterans. It has to do with money. With Walmart, Target, Publix and big box stores on every corner the military commissary is losing money and they are expanding usage. The allure of shopping at commissaries is not as it was too much competition other places. The only reason I shop there is because I work close to one. On the weekend or holidays I go to Walmart like everyone else. I spent over 20 years in the Navy so I have had assess for 45 years.\nYour message is not at all clear. Are touting having had the privilege of using on base facilities for 40 years or are you saying veterans should be using public stores like Walmart instead? Money spent in on-base facilities generates money for the MWR services which some services stopped funding out of their DOD budget buckets about 35 years ago. Those MWR funds are needed and valued by the existing service personnel. Money makes the world go round and in this regard you can choose to spend your money when and if you want to spend it. You can look at it as a money issue, but the former members who live near to the more remote basis may find this offer very worthwhile. The constructive, positive view would be that this benefit is better than no benefit. It’s a win-win.\nMy husband is 100% disabled vet and was medically retired from Vietnam. He has a permanent ID card since Vietnam. We were full time RVers for 7 years and stayed mostly at Military RV Parks. This addition and inclusion of new people who are able to obtain ID cards and use the services on bases is gonna REALLY affect availability at Military RV Parks. It was already almost impossible to get RV spaces at some of them. This doesn’t affect us because we no longer RV but I feel bad for those who still do unless the bases are going to work on enlarging the RV parks to accommodate more people and I can hardly see THAT happening.\nMy late husband was 100 percent totally disabled service connected due to PANCREATIC CANCER!! Died in 1998 at age 41 I didn’t remarry until 2015. I have all my benefits EXCEPT my ID card. I have a ChampVa card for my health coverage.I loved shopping the commissary and was there two three times a week. I was devastated when they made me give it up in 2015. In 1998 I was told if I remarried I would be allowed to keep it due to my late husbands 100 percent service connected disability. When I married my current husband who is at 90 percent (still fighting for his 100 percent). has already said he’s not using it!! Not allowing the spouse to have Commissary privileges UNLESS he is present is going to deeply affect Commissary sales and the Exchange with your decision as to how many will actually use the commissary. NOT allowing us an VHIC card for commissary is just plain stupid. Whoever made this rule is not thinking smart! Must have been a man to make this rule!!\nI found this on a clearer blog (https://news.va.gov/67974/commissary-military-service-exchange-mwr-access-extended-veterans-beginning-january/):\nWho is eligible Jan. 1, 2020?\nVeterans\nPurple Heart recipients\nformer prisoners of war\nVeterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings\nMedal of Honor recipients and Veterans with 100% service-connected disability ratings are already eligible under existing DOD policy.\nCaregivers\nOn Jan. 1, individuals approved and designated as the primary family caregiver of an eligible veteran under the PCAFC will be eligible for these privileges.\nFor information about primary family caregivers in the PCAFC, visit https://www.caregiver.va.gov/.\nMark,\nI spoke to VA health care person who clarified a couple of points in the article. Having a VHIC alone is insufficient for base access on Jan 1. It must list a priority category. So a Category 8 VHIC card holder would not have access according to this employee. He did confirm access to online services, and one additional one not in your blog: shopvcs.va.gov\nQuestion- I’m 80% disabled, and enrolled in VA- my card doesnt list a category or say “service connected”- am I to get a new card?\nTotal complete BS! All Veterans should have access not just those fortunate enough to get through bureaucratic red tape of getting a service connected disability. Serve 10 years active, Honorably discharged and still don’t qualify for this ID card and now I’m denied for income level exceeding the max allowed, just more bureaucratic BS. Thanks VA\nI agree totally, this policy is discriminatory on its face and an insult to all veterans. Purple Hearts and other awards were handed out very suspiciously in a number of cases I witnessed.\nI totally agree with your statement. My income also is above the $75K annual limit so I’m denied the V.A. Health Care and other privileges. I served 8.5 years in the Air Force, Honorably Discharged and when I got out a whole host of “privileges” had been changed. When I joined, I had G.I.Bill for life. That got changed 1 year before I got out. Then I find out because I make more than that allowed income, I was disqualified for V.A. Benefits. I feel our government like to me and others. And to top it off, the Community College of the Air Force said I was never enrolled. Funny, I have two transcripts, which are way shorter than my original one as there was a fire and my original one got destroyed. So I think no problem, the CCAF will have it. So when I applied for it years later, I got this letter saying “How dare you as you were never in the A.F.! ” But they ended up sending me a transcript with minimum credits, not the Associated Degree I had with my original. Then when I asked them about it later, they said I was never enrolled. Go figure.\nWilliam, I’m with you. This is BS. This should definitely be extended to at least all VFWs that were fortunate enough not to get a Purple Heart or MOH. But, it should be extended to all who served, regardless of where or when. At least give out specially marked cards just for the purposes of using the Commissary and not for medical purposes.\nI’m a Gulf War Vet with VHIC card. I have no service connected. Am I eligible?\nAccording to the info above, no. The VHIC card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).\nI agree. I have a dd-214, I have a choiceva card, I’ve been denied benefits for the va so I won’t be able to get a card. It’s damn sad that my own government doesn’t recognize my veteran status as an honerably discharged. So this does nothing for me, thank you very much Congress of the 80’s to make my uniform, honor, and my code less than what it should be.\nI think the access to the exchanges and facilities should be extended to ALL honorably discharged veterans, not just those with injuries. I completely understand that the degree of sacrifices varies extensively, some by choice (length of service and MOS selection) and some by chance. Some veterans were unfortunate enough to get a disability or worse and others who served equally or for a longer time were lucky enough not to get injured. I think they ALL deserve the privileges. I enlisted to active duty at 17 years old as a combat engineer and served in the regular army, MOS 12B. I was lucky enough to not get injured. It would be nice to be able to access some of these facilities once in a while…\nI got out of the military in 1973. I have an honorable discharge and finally qualified for 100% disability 10 years ago. Perhaps that does not mean much to some of you, but I would have much rather did my 20 and retired without the nightmares and hell that I have gone through. It would have saved a lot of pain and I would be done with it. I do not begrudge benefits to anyone who earns them, but now being in a position to hear some cases, I don’t see how jumping down and breaking an ankle while you were under the influence or hanging out in the psych ward because “you think you can convince someone that you deserve disability because a drill instructor didn’t hold your hand and tuck you in at night. So while we are airing it all, air this. Be grateful if you do not qualify for disability, because unless it has changed, you must walk to the gates of hell before you qualify. My brother in law was sent as a remote radio man during Viet Nam he has 50%. My husband was a platoon leader during Viet Nam and had to call artillery on his own position because he was surrounded . He died at 34 with no disability. I have talked to vets that could not drive because they had flash backs, loud noises that sent them to cover, The military for thousands is a job just like any other, office workers, cooks, dental assistants, they never see action and like any other job if you quit before retirement you get nothing. For those that see action, they deserve our respect, there is something about someone that is willing to face fire and risk life to protect what they hold dear. Unless you are in that group then be grateful, show respect to those that were, and stop your whining. Blessed day\nThank you, Pat.\nBless you and your family too.\nPat, there is no change. In 1991 I received a 10% disability rating. In 2006 I submitted an application to have that rating increased. It wasn’t until May of this year my rating was increased to 60%. 13 years, and countless phone calls, hearings and the “oh wait we need additional informations” for it to be approved. In the mean time it took me only 8 months after requesting social security disability to get it approved for the same thing I was discharged for in the Army. Go figure.\nThank You Pat, my feelings entirely! I’d give back these benefits in a heartbeat to be a whole person again.\nAre spouses able to come with us on base?\nYou didn’t read about this? Its one of the first questions asked\nWent to the VA clinic yesterday and was told my VHIC doesn’t need to state Service Connected because the Commissaries will be updating their computer systems. So when they scan the card it will show the eligibility. I see this being a huge CLUSTER F$CK come January. Guess I will be bringing my disability paperwork with me when I shop!!\nI contacted the VA hotline and they mailed me a new card with the word service connected disability right on the card… It only took about a week to get one… Phone nmbr is 1-877-222-VETS (8387)\nLol well said!\nThis “comment” section typifies one of the many things that are wrong with the VA health care system. These are not comments. These are pathetic cries for the help some of you so desperately need.\nIs your ass that tight that you only see your view of things?? walk a mile in your brother and/or sisters shoes before spewing crap like that!! A helping hand goes a lot further than stepping on people when they are down.\nI already see there being a huge issue with this. Even though this particular article clearly states that on the veterans health card it must state service-connected or Purple Heart recipient, I have already gone to the local VA clinic and when I explain to them the new standards and even showed them this particular article , The VA clinic told me yesterday that it does not have to say that on our card because the commissaries are updating their computer system so when they scan our card it will show that we’re eligible. So who is right this VA article about the change or the VA clinic? So it looks like as a veteran with 80% service connected disability I will need to bring in my paperwork because my card does not say service-connected and the VA told me yesterday that it will not update it and does not need to be updated! HELP!\nare the Fam Camps part of MWR?\nParks and recreation are part of MWR (Morale, Welfare and Recreation) https://militarybenefits.info/morale-welfare-and-recreation-mwr-benefits/\nI served in the Army & have a Service Connected Disability…Can I access any Commissary/Exchange, NAVY-MARINES, etc-etc?\nDid you not read the article? It literally contains all the information you need to know to gain access to these installations…\nIt doesn’t say that you have to be 100%, is that true or not?\nDoes this apply for Army bases in OCONUS like Germany?\nI have my service connected VHIC – does this allow access to Military RV Camp Grounds?\nI have the same question.\nYou cannot shop in the commissary or the px in most oconus, especially Germany\nYes it does\nIt depends on that country’s status of forces agreement\nMy card says VA Healthcare Enrollee, that’s all. Does that allow me privileges as stated in this article, i.e. commissary, PX.?\nFrom what I’m comprehending you need a service connected disability.\nI hope so\nI have the same question\nCan my spouse accompany me? She’s not a primary care giver. Thank you\nUh yes..its in the article!\nIf you are the primary card holder, yes she may accompany you. During service you were able to escort non military guest on base but they had to check in at the Visitors Center and you took full responsibility for them,\nAt my separation physical, I was told I was given a 0% compensable service-connected disability for issues with my back. Looking at my account at the VA, it shows no service-connected disability. How can I get this corrected?\nAfter serving 12 years in the U.S. Army, I departed honorably as a Sergeant First Class (E-7) to use my Vietnam Era G.I. Bill educational benefits before they expired to complete my undergraduate degree, some graduate school and law school. While I do have a VHIC and have utilized the many VA Medical Center benefits afforded to me over the years (including a quadruple by-pass surgery 4+ years ago), my card does not denote Purple Heart, POW or Service Connected; I am pleased with what I have received from our federal government as a military veteran and do not bemoan the fact that others who contributed more than me receive more benefits than me. They earned it and I am grateful for their service, contributions and sacrifices. And so I say to all those eligible, enjoy your new benefits!\nAre we eligible to stay at on base lodging? Is that included under MWR?\nYes you can stay on base lodging 6 months if you want. If anyone is travelling in Florida, you can visit Patrick AFB in Cocoa Beach and buy some I Dream of Jeanie souvenirs. I heard that sometime in summer of 2020, while there you and your wife or caretaker can take a shuttle over to Cape Canaveral and go in a Space X Falcon 9 Rocket and buy souvenirs. Only 100%ers and retirees with proper ID can take free Space A flights to wherever it is scheduled to go at that time.\nMy son served for 4 years and then was discharged with a Less than honorable discharge. Four years later he applied to have his discharge upgraded to Honorable and got it.\nMy question is does he qualify for this card/access?\nHe is eligible if he has the VA ID and has a service connected disability\nI do not think he qualifies for this benefit since he did not have a service connected disability. This is just for disabled vets and the people who earned certain medals.\nI am thinking that a clear document as to who can enter with the disabled Veteran would be nice. IE, friend, daughter, brother ect. ect.\nI have 20% service related disability. Do I get this access?\nI also have access to military bases due to working gov contract. Do I still need the VHIC?\nIs overseas base access allowed to the commissary and exchange such as in Germany?\nNot at this time..Just stateside.\nI’m a qualified caregiver, a mother of a SM. Due to the catastrophic injuries suffered by my SM, I had to leave my civilian job (actually let go b/c there were no job protection laws applicable). I was placed on military orders and took care of my SM for three years at the military hospital. My SM and I were sent back to a community that didn’t care one bit. I never recovered from the job loss. I think the government needs to reconsider what happened to some Caregivers whose lives and careers were destroyed by no fault of their own. This gesture hardly scratches the surface.\ni have the old VA picture ID card—-will i need to get it replaced with a new card like one pictured at start of article ? Thanks\nI went to a VA Hospital for a checkup on my service connected injury and at admissions they issued me a new card, took about 15 minutes, got the card in 4 days in the mail. No problems.\nContact the Base/Post and see what they wish you to carry in the form of ID.\nThis is amazing and I am so glad that they are finally opening this up. I always felt that my 12 years meant nothing and I was pushed out and could never look back. I am excited and so thankful they finally agreed to do this.\nIf I met someone that’s a veteran and they had green eyes and red hair, did not have a service disability but a wooden leg could I access the commissary and only buy Cat Food? That is only on Wednesdays and if it’s raining?\nThat’s how ridiculous some of the questions posted here sound. It’s embarrassing people. READ THE ARTICLE IT’S COMPLETELY SELF-EXPLANATORY! WTF OVER! BTW… Do I solve the math equation at the bottom of the comment section using Common Core Math or Old School Math. I only ask because I need to know if I should put down the number 7 or 7 bananas because I ate 2 of the 9 bananas I had before I met the red headed green-eyed veteran.\nI’m thinking you still get credit for the 2 you ate and check Red’s pineapple and papaya count. They’ll go good with your 7 leftover ‘Nanners’, Sir!\nThese replies actually made me laugh so hard my chest hurt! We can tell from the questions/replies/comments if they were made by an Officer or Enlisted as well as if you were combat arms or a POAG! Please keep the replies coming!!\nYou are correct. When I tried to enlist in the U.S. Navy I was underweight. So my father went out and bought me 7 pounds of bananas and made me eat them. That was in 1963 and I have not eaten a damn banana since. But I did get into the Navy, best move I ever made. I do have green eyes and red hair but no wooden leg at least not yet. I tried the cat food yuk!\nI served as an MP for 10 years. My K9 partner got service connected for having ticks and has a VA Vet (veterinarian) Services card. Can I shop with my K9?\nThe veteran serves as the military member. As long as your guest has a REAL ID Government issued, and can pass the background check you should be good. I am happy to see these benefits extended to other veterans.\nTHANK YOU Rodney, this is exactly how I feel about many of these questions. I’ve always known, but never had it so graphically illustrated. Must share with my man, a 20 year USAF Veteran, we met at the DLIFLC in 1979.\nThank you President Trump and the VA for this benefit. I am a 90% disabled Vietnam Veteran.\nChuck\nAre you having a bad day? lol\nYup\nThank you for your response\nTrump didn’t have a thing to do with it, he’s too busy chasing shadows, ghosts, and conspiracy theories so he can make up fake crap about joe Biden. He doesn’t care about you or any vet or active duty personnel anyway, only his own fat ass. This was approved by congress and the pentagon so why don’t you just wise up and get better informed so you won’t possibly look stupid.\nPresident bone spurs.\ntotally agree !\nThank you Tom for that true statement. Trump doesn’t give a flying @%# about vets or active duty. If he loved this country so much he would have been in the jungle with you and not getting deferments.\nWell… Did happen during his watch so… Thank you DT!\nThank you Chuck for giving credit where credit is due.\nSo to be clear, MWR (and specifically access to Fam Camps, aka on-base RV parks) has always been offered to active, retirees, reservists, and their families, but NOT to 4-year disabled (service-connected) vets (like me). That’s what the link above still states. Are you saying this recent change does nothing to make access to Fam Camps on military installations to non-retired, non-active vets? I’m just seeking clarification.\nAlso, as has been stated elsewhere in this thread, one reason such a change makes a lot of sense from a business perspective: with civilian competition, demand for on-base facilities has dropped, causing these to be under-utilized assets. That’s why opening up ALL base facilities to a broader set of customers makes good biz sense. Just one grunt’s humble opinion.\nThanks.\nI am an Army vet and Ex-pat. I am a legal resident of Japan and would be happy to visit a base here for shopping. Anyone know how to get info on if this pertains to OCONUS locations too???\nHi David! First I’d like to thank you for your service to our nation. There are so many nasty, mean, condescending and rude comments to our fellow veterans in this thread so I just wanted to say I appreciate you before answering your question. I don’t understand why there are so many negative Nancy’s in this thread. It’s quite appalling considering we’re are all veterans and that mean a lot in my eyes.\nEach overseas base has an individual Status of Forces Agreement with the host nation that will dictate who they allow on base and what the protocol is for requesting access. Based one my personal experience I’ll share an example of how extremely difficult it is to access a base. The base I’m referring to is in Rota Spain. Access is managed by the Spanish government and the base is secure by the Spanish Marines. It took several months of advanced planning to request a certificato from the Spanish government and your request can be denied at their discretion. It was always a pain going to that base when our military hospital on base requested our assistance.\nI would start with reaching out to the local JAG office on the base as they’re very knowledgeable of the SOFA with Japan and can guide you through the process or at least refer you to the correct office who can assist you. Good luck to you. I hope you’re able to get it all figured out as soon as possible.\nI’m a disabled vet with my va card will I be allowed to shop at the Air Force base exchange and commissary? Thank you\nUuuhhhh that is what they article stated , multiple times, in clear plain English. That was basically the whole point of said article. Geesh!!\nOmygoodness!!! Lmao these comments tho\nFor god’s sake! How stupid of me read this much BS. bye\nThis “comment” section typifies one of the many things that are wrong with the VA health care system. These are not comments. These are pathetic cries for the help some of you so desperately need.\nI have one of the old style VA ID cards. It looks different than the one pictured above, my old one does have the barcode and the words “Service Connected” on it. Do I need to get the new style card to use the new benefits?\nNo, the older cards with “Service Connected” will not be accepted\nI don’t believe it matters. I have the same as you. Just says that it has to state service-connected.\nYou are good. Service Connected are the two magic passwords.\nI understand from the above comments that my wife can come on base with me…Can she also play golf with me as my guest\nI don’t believe it matters. I have the same as you. Just says that it has to state service-connected.\nDoes this include the use of any Military campground and can I bring my wife and kids? If they can come what is the process for getting them on base?\nCan I buy like a sears house by the mail at the Military Commissary and Exchnage. I want to build my own house like the Sears mail order house. Where can I ask about how I am supposed to order it?\nIf it is for sale, why not. I have not seen a house kit from Sears since the 1950’s.\nI think this is a great program. I am calling the number listed above and am unable to get through; I am on eternal hold.\nYou need to tell VA to renew your medications\nWelcome to the VA!\n“Veterans with felony convictions, felony arrest warrants, or other types of derogatory information related to criminal history or terrorism will not be permitted entry.” This statement was nowhere on the bill that was signed. This dose create a problem causing a double standard. So Veterans with a 100 % and do have previous felony records can access base. Also veterans with less that 100 % and court martial records can access base. Isn’t this a double standard. Everyone who is eligible should be able to gain access to utilize what the original intent of the bill was and if anyone should misuse or do anything on base that is illegal privileges will then be suspended. Everyone makes mistakes in life it is what they do after that counts. The Word says there is no one good not one that anyone should boast.\nSome of us learned to behave at an early age. Felony conviction restrict you from many other things than base access. No HUD, no employment in medical, no employment in LE and the list goes on. Can’t complain now that you lost due to your actions, your the only on to blame.\nFYI, retired and 100%, with felonies that were not O6 and above are now denied access to the bases. 06 and above have their own things going to allow them to continue to access the bases. Please trust me on this as I worked in Law Enforcement after the military and have direct knowledge of this Secret Squirrel arrangement.\n“Presuming the individual in question has served their time for the felony and is currently not on a felony want or warrant list, DoD physical access policy (Directive-type Memorandum 09-012) does not prohibit a convicted felon from accessing the base, escorted or unescorted,” officials with the Office of the Secretary of Defense told us in a statement.”\nhttps://www.military.com/spouse/military-benefits/can-i-get-a-military-id-with-a-felony-conviction-qb.html\nSo Albert as long as there’s not a felony warrant, and the time has been served, a veteran with a felony CAN get a base access. Veterans with 100% and a DOD ID card can bypass the visitors center and go right on base. There’s no background check, all they do is show their DOD Card to the MP.\nCheck that article…\nThanks for the update!\nQuit whining already!\nyou act as having a service connected disability is some kind of benefit, Its not, Im sure you could trade your health with someone who has gone through the pain and suffering requiring medical treatment. We all volunteered, some made it back ok others didn’t..\nIm %50 disabled, I will give you all my benefits if you take on my health issues I have suffered from since the 1980s\nNo, we did not all volunteer. Some were drafted and lost their lives or were disabled. Most draftees during the Viet Nam era and somewhat earlier were forced to do two years active duty, two years of active reserve, and two years of inactive reserve for a total of six years before they got their discharge. The lives of draftees were just as disrupted and the long-term effects of those disruptions, including service-connected disabilities, just as profound as those who volunteered.\n.A couple of other minor points: (1) Most VA hospitals have small retail stores where any veteran can shop, though prices tend to be slightly higher [or, at best, no better] than big box stores. But they are still handy and a benefit for people stuck in the facilities. (2) From the stories I hear, VA medical care and the quality of other benefits can vary widely depending on where you are in the U.S. In the San Francisco Bay Area, medical care is very good, with the major VA hospitals in San Francisco and Palo Alto are connected to a couple of the best few university medical schools in the U.S. Whatever, it serves no purpose to make derogatory comments about VA physicians, nurses, and other staff who are probably trying to do their best to serve patients under whatever bureaucratic circumstances prevail locally.\nThank you Michael, You, I, and others here feel the same.\nTake my disability I will gladly give up the benefits.\nI have a VID card issued by the VA, how does this work in the new regulation? I do not have a VHIC as I have been denied VA Health Benefits because I do not meet the means threshold.\nI will too.\nCkinzner\nI’ve recently submitted my disability paperwork and am still waiting to hear back from the VA. Does submitting my Disability package automatically enroll me into the VA healthcare system?\n[Editor: No, but you can enroll, here: https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/%5D\nAll honorably discharged Veterans should have access to facilities. Here in Puerto Rico the civilian security rent-a-cops of the Coast Guard have access to purchase but I as a USCG veteran am not allowed. Homeland Security employees and their dependents have exchange privileges. It would make good business sense to allow all honorably discharged veterans access. Its not like it would cost the system any money to open for all veterans.\nI am a retired navy veteran with my DOD ID card. I cannot currently use the commissary or exchanges over in Europe. Will I be able to utilize those facilities with this card? Why would this card be acceptable and not my retired ID card?\nThank you in advance for your answer to this question.\nRegards,\nTom\nExample….. me and buddy go to war but my buddy gets injured and I’m the only one around to carry him back to the unit. He gets disability and gets privledges like commissary exchange and all that good stuff. But me who had to sacrafice my own life to carry him off to safety disregarding my life that didnt get any disability gets no such privledges. Not even a mention of saving a life while in combat. Isnt that just wrong? A VETERAN IS STILL A VETERAN DISABLED OR NOT. WE ALL JOINED THE US MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY. But those who are not disabled just gets a pat on the back while those who are disabled get all the luxuries of US military. And get paid too.\nWhen I received my card it said enrolled, but now I got my 10% Rating do I need to have that added to my card?\nGene\nSi, oui, yes !!!\nI’m a service connected veteran (not 100% connected/not retired), living overseas in Germany. Living as a Local National. Remember leave the local\nAre overseas Commissaries still available? I’m presuming the same local tax rules apply, like for the retirees over here.\nIt says that The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED). So is this exclusive only for disabled veterans purple heart and former POW? Or is this for all veterans disabled or not?\nDoesn’t your question really answer itself? Must means must.\nI’m still in the process of getting my disability. The doctor who checked me out and said that I do have a disability but the VA is the only ones who can say you’re disabled or not.and how much percentage you get. Whether or not I do get my disability approved am I still able to go the commissary exchange and MWR? I already have my VETERANS ID CARD.\nIf your card says SERVICE CONNECTED, you can.\nHello, I received my VA Status before they started issuing the cards. I live Overseas in Germany. How can I get an ID and can I use to go on the bases here in Germany too?\nI have a ID but mine doesn’t say service connected will that be issuing new card for those who already have them becuase I know for a fact I have service connected injury my card just doesn’t say it\nI don’t understand why I had to go through all the trouble to get a Veterans Identification card and they won’t accept that for this new service, (to shop in the Exchange). They need to include this ID card instead of putting us all through the extra trouble to get “another card”. The Veterans Identification card has my photo and my branch of service and is used instead of my DD Form 214.\nThat card was created to make it easier for veterans to access the many Veteran Discounts offered by civilian businesses.\nA WOMAN IN THE MILITARY, IF MARRIED WHO HAD A DEPENDENT, COULD, NOT SERVE AFTER CHILD BORN, AND THEREFORE COULD NOT DO HER 20. IT WAS FINE FOR A MAN TO HAVE A CHILD HOWEVER. ALSO A MARRIED WOMAN COULD NOT GET A HOUSING ALLOWANCE FOR A HUSBAND.\nWE COULD NOT RETIRE LIKE THE MEN BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS. WE HAD TO RESIGN OUR COMMISSIONS IF WE HAD A CHILD…PRIOR TO CIRCA 1972. AND COULD NOT REGAIN OUR COMMISSIONS AS WELL.\nSo, I’m only guessing here, the military forced you to get pregnant? It’s unfortunate that during that time period women weren’t allowed to have a child and stay in the military but you knew the rules. There was a time when seeking mental health care was taboo in the military and would likely get you kicked out. Now, it’s encouraged. Times change.\nCHAZ WILSON, Read through Astrid’s post very slowly, THIS was NOT ONLY about having a child or not. Married Military Women sacrificed everything that a Married Military Men were NEVER forced to sacrifice.\nTHEY HAD NO CHOICE AT ALL.\nAnd please tell me when Military Men were ever forced to give up their benefits in order to have children?!\nThank you!\nSimple answer, sex doesn’t physically change men…biology and logic wins again\nOk so what are the restrictions on what to buy at the Exchange and Commissary? I was informed that we would not be able to purchase Alcohol or Tobacco products. Is this True? Which to me makes so sense, if you are giving service connected veterans the same access as everyone else, but I will not be able to shop and pick up a nice bottle of wine for dinner, is just ridiculous.\nI’m being told the same thing by the exchange customer service personnel in Biloxi\nMy husband has a card and is 70% service connected, will he be able to use the facilities at bases?\nYes. He should apply for TDIU and get paid at the 100% rate. Then get a tan DOD ID card/2765 so he can fly free Space A military flights.\nI have a card and I am at 60% disability, I go to the VA for treatments, Am I entitled to use these privileges,,\nI am 50% disabled and have a vhic. Can I bring a civilian (girlfriend) on base with me to go shopping as well?\nGo back to your VA facility and have them retake your picture and issue a new card with “service connected” located on the right side of the card just below your picture. Someone must have missed that when the card was issued. They will verify your status and update your card.\nThanks for the information\nSo, the real benefit is only saving on taxes? I don’t see that as good reason to bypass 15 grocery stores etc to go on a base to shop. Are there other benefits i’m not seeing that might give me reason to spend money on a base instead of off base?\nI have not been on a military base for a long time. I would enjoy going to the base to shop sometime.\nLMAO. And this is more than likely the reason for the change. So many people thought like you, that the commissary and exchange are losing money. They have been for years. Indeed this new change is something to celebrate, but don’t think for once that the veteran was thought of first with this solution. But at the end of the day does it matter?\nI hadn’t shopped in a commissary in about 20 years. We went a month ago and compared to Walmart, we estimated that we saved over 25% .. now some things that we knew were cheaper at Walmart such as laundry detergent, we didn’t get at the commissary.\nso if im right im a veteran and i get medical threw the va have a card but no purple heart or none of the other all tho i am on disability but not service connected or va disability i get ssi so this means i can not use com or none of it right\nI agree. Money was the first and foremost thought. Benefits to veterans was just a very nice side effect…probably why things weren’t as well thought out as they should have been.\nThis is my 2nd try, I’m not the most computer adept.\nAll the men and women who honorably served in defense of our nation and essentially put their lives on the line for the good of ol’ USoA deserve to be furnished all benefits afforded some of our discreet few who are entitled to military base priviledges.\nWho are we to discriminate?\nDo the right thing!\nRetired Vietnam Era USAF\n100% Disabled\nYou’re right, Paul, IMHO. We all took the same oath to protect our Constitution and the interests of the country as a whole. The thing that differentiates all of us were the orders that we received; nothing more and nothing less. None of us had a say in what those orders might be. We were assigned where needed and there was nothing in the world that was able to change that fact. We all had the same commitment to military service, regardless of circumstances. In essence, the Veterans’ Administration is highly discriminatory. We all served. Period. Should one’s unit or in-service assignment be deemed more important over those who may have served in an active theater of war? Again, one’s VA eligibility and classification is a function of one’s military orders, not of one’s unwillingness to accept this or that assignment of duty. Maybe the Veterans’ Administration should re-read the oath that all service people took when they turned over their lives for Uncle Sam’s Department of Defense and for the betterment of a free republic.B\nFor many years, all veterans could shop at the Exchange on the internet. Go to “www.shopmyexchange.com” and provide the required information (DD214, etc.) when you sign up for the first time. Takes a week or so to get approved and then you can shop online at the exchange.\nPaul I agree with you. One of the things that make our military so amazing is the fact that it’s not a government requirement to serve. Our service members volunteer to serve this nation and that speaks volumes. No one ever has the same experience in the military as someone else but that doesn’t make anyone better than everyone else. We all volunteered, knew we were getting ourselves into and still chose to make the sacrifice and serve this nation.\nI reside in Japan. Will my veteran’s medical ID and the reserve ID card I still carry allow me access to all US Military facilities?\nOn order to take my wife with me to shop she has to have a prostate exam at the gate. No way to get a long term pass for her. While i am working she cannot go shopping on post for me. A woman that stood by my side the entire military life, nurses me back to health after the surgeries or injuries, and she is treated like a criminal that needs an escort. Why would i put her thru this to save money. Someone needs to seriously look at how they treat our damn spouses.\nDoes anyone read? Sometimes if you scroll through the questions 79% of the time someone asked what you want to ask. A lot of the OX’s and commissary’s don’t require ID to walk in anymore, they require ID at the register to purchase. I can’t read anymore comments, the same reading skills you needed in the military are the same skills required for this article.\nSo why stay 20 years anymore. You make a career of the military with promises of certain benefits when you serve for 20 plus years. Now you have to get behind the thousands of vets who served even less than one enlistment, but were able to get a VA disability. SMH\nYou can bring anyone in that you like. The issue is at checkout at most bases. If she is making the purchase she will not be allowed to do so because she is not a dependent with a dependent’s ID card. You would have to make the purchase using your ID card (as she smiles through check out) for her and that applies to anyone who is not a dependent, active duty, Guard, retired, or Vet. everyone needs some kind of ID to check out of a Commissary or Exchange. Some bases that are contractor type bases allow the use of a VIP card at the small BX locations but not the main BX or Commissary. I was in New Mexico a month ago and tried to use my VET ID because I had left my Retired ID home thinking I could use the VET ID inplace of my retired ID. At that time they would not let me check out with my VET ID. Now after Jan 1, 2020 I should be able to leave my retired ID home and just carry my VET ID. Good Luck!\nDo you honestly believe people stay in so they can have access to exchanges and the commissary?\nIf the 5% savings and no tax is such a hard sell, why do I constantly see uniformed sailors and marines at COSTCO and Sam’s?\nSometimes it’s a whole group shopping huge amounts of food for picnics and BBQ’s.\nYou should be happy your brothers and sisters get such a small reward for putting their life on the line like you.\nShame on you!\nYour first line says it all…smh at these comments!\nWould you like to trade? I was seriously injured while I was deployed doing things Clinton said was not happening (TS Crap). 85 troops 650 needed. If you were hurt you were considered a POS. We took care of ourselves as we had access to all the medical supplies. No medical records were kept. I had to get letters from officers and others about my injuries, then have the statements reviewed by MI and modified so no TS. info was released. It has been a fight to get compensation. Want to trade your 20 for the rest of my life of injuries and my broken dreams???\nVeterans who served 3 months with a 0% service connected disability have the same base privileges as veterans who served 20 years and retired. Bases are going to be crowded. I bet all the guards are dreading Jan 1, 2020. Probably on Jan 1, 2021, everybody will be eligible for Space A flights. A tan DOD ID card/2765 is almost worthless anymore.\nPlease confirm if Vetarans without service connected but that served bravely have access to this new program.\nNope…only mailbox money veterans with disability get the benefit. Sooo…if a person served three years as a clerk and got 10% disability for sleep apnea because they drove the VA crazy and spent a large portion of their time on medical appts….. they get the privilege….the person who served 12 years, worked harder and deployed more than most but was a little too proud to lie about ailments….gets nothing.\nOnly if you have a VHIC that states “Served Bravely”\nThat’s a big NO!!!\nI have base access to the base because I work on base. So do I still need VHIC to shop at the exchange.\nI’m a service connected Veteran can my spouse obtain an ID and enter without me?\nWith the new process and the ability for me to go to a post commissary, will my wife be able to have a card to go shopping without me?\nSadly you will still need to follow the criteria posted in the article. If you did not retire and or have an appropriate ID or are not a “service connected” veteran or a Purple Heart recipient, you won’t have access to the Exchange or Commissary. Some bases like Hill AFB allow base contracted personnel or Fed employees to use the small BX or the food court but none of the actual base amenities without proper ID. My son in law sometimes gets away with using a DD214 at these locations but not always. He served 6 years in the Air Force. Good Luck!\nContacted MWR about using their campgrounds. No response from them.\nI am currently 90% service connected disabled. I have the old VA Photo ID Card. It does not say that I am service connected.

Is there any way I can get the card so I can visit the VA clinic after I retire. I will retire from my regular job and want access to the VA clinic in my home town?\nI am a 100% service connected Veteran, USMC-Vietnam 66/67, living in Thailand. While I applied in Texas for VA care in 2010. I moved before any appointments were set up. All my claims have been handled by the VA Foreign Affairs Office and Foreign Medical Program. I have never received any ID of any kind. How do I get VA ID and this necessary ID? We do have a military facility in Bangkok, JUSTMAG, would I be able to use their commissary etc. if they have? I know the Embassy has but I doubt the card would be good for there. Keep in mind, the VA has no system in their 2 step verification for foreign phone numbers.\nIf you’re 100% you already qualify for the military ID and commissary.\nAre the overseas military bases included in this program to access the Commissary and Exchanges with a valid VHIC?\nSo service connected veterans with any type of felony conviction will not be permitted? I have a felony DUI.\n“Presuming the individual in question has served their time for the felony and is currently not on a felony want or warrant list, DoD physical access policy (Directive-type Memorandum 09-012) does not prohibit a convicted felon from accessing the base, escorted or unescorted,” officials with the Office of the Secretary of Defense told us in a statement.\nRead this article:\nhttps://www.military.com/spouse/military-benefits/can-i-get-a-military-id-with-a-felony-conviction-qb.html\nI am a widow of a service connected disabled veteran, am I able to get access to the exchange and commissary privileges?\nI’m a service connected Veteran can my spouse obtain an ID and enter without me?\nNo.\nDoes this mean the RV park at bases are available for “service connected”veterans?\nI am wondering i am service connected and I have a VHIC card. Is this going to be available to people that are retired and living in Germany. I am civilian retired not military, but I am dod retired. I asked at the base entrance where I must get signed into by the bank representative to do my monthly banking and they have no idea what this is. I also have a government dod retired id.

I have always been able to access the base with my blue retired military member ID card. How do I get a VA photo if I live in Japan where there is no VA facility? Since I will now be required to have a VA ID to access the base, does that mean that I will now be able to receive VA treatment at the medical facilities on the US bases throughout Japan?\nIf you are retired military all you need is your retired ID card. This doesn’t change anything for retirees. This just adds access for service connected disabled veterans.\nYou don’t need a VA ID if you already have a military ID. The VA medical system is separate from the military.\nwill Authorized Disabled Veterans be able to purchase event and entertainment tickets at the base MWR ticket offices.\nHeaded to Philippines this coming Jan , they said that there’s a VA facilities in the country , Can I use my VA card to get access there?\nWhat about a base overseas like in Germany?\nI took care of my husband who passed away from a service connected disability so that makes me a caregiver…so why wouldn’t I be eligible?\nYou are not currently a care giver if your husband has passed away.\neither this article is incomplete or it’s misunderstood. nowhere does it state that one has to have a service-connected disability but that one needs to have a veterans healthcare identification card (updated cards have more printed info as to veteran status) for commissary/bx/px privileges. service-connected disability or purple heart is approved under a specific dod policy but there was no explanation as to the additional benefits so it was a moot point since bottomline these base shopping priviledges is for all vets with a vhic. also, all veterans that have either a general or honorable discharge have access to va healthcare and identification card. please be more clear.\nIt’s incomplete..I had the same concerns as you..hence the comment I left above. For those who think all info was included in the article, I just assumed they already have access to the facilities (retirees, or svc connected at a rate to have the privilege).\nIf there is not a designation on the VHIC because there is no disability who would we talk to at the VA Medical facility to get that put on the ID to have access to base facilities?\nAre we eligible to fly on a hop?\nSo if i am fully retired with 24 years of service and have an ID, do i still need an ID from the VA hospital?\nNo\nWhere on your card does it state that you are service connected?

And I heard that the wording “Service Connected” needs to be printed on the VHIC (VA Healthcare Identification Card). All veterans should have access regardless if a service connected disability exists or not. Hopefully, all veterans will have access soon.\nMust say SERVICE CONNECTED !!!\nOMG people please read the darn article! All VIC cards specify is Service Connected……….if you have one or are 0-100 Percent then you are good! Go get your card and go shopping!\nOMG people please read the darn article! All VIC cards specify is Service Connected……….if you have one or are 0-100 Percent then you are good! Go get your card and go shopping!\nFantastic. Will homeless Veterans with Mental illness be allowed to pan handle outside of the commissary and Exchange? Will homeless veterans be allowed to construct tent cities on base? How will base Security handle mentally ill veterans that are homeless and refuse to leave the facility?\nThank you for addressing this. Curious minds want to know. I’m taking it only if it happened while they were serving. And is on their ID card.\nThank you for addressing this. Curious minds want to know. I’m taking it only if it happened while they were serving. And is on their ID card.\n@Tim – Do they do that now at VA facilities? Such as hospitals and clinics. I live in Tampa, and I have never seen anything like you just described. Also, we should have a bit more respect for those with mental disabilities. I’m one myself. I’m sure security will have everything under control.\nAccording to this article, you only need the VA med card to access the exchanges. It doesn’t say you must have a service connected disability – or did I misunderstand it?\nYou misunderstood it…\n“Veterans eligible solely under this act who are eligible to obtain a Veteran Health Identification Card must use this credential for in-person installation and privilege access. The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).”\nCan you please repeat this entire post again, in hopes that some of us will not feel the need to rack ‘n’ stack our entitlements..smh\nYou didn’t misunderstand it. As as example it lists (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).” As written, that indicates you could have those things in parenthesis OR NOT. You do need at least 0% svc connectin though. Read the article at va.gov…it was written better. https://news.va.gov/67974/commissary-military-service-exchange-mwr-access-extended-veterans-beginning-january/\nI just hope that we will be able to use the class six and lodging.\nI have a VHIC card, but under the pic it only says “VA Health care enrollee”. Is this sufficient for access to the exchange and commissary?\nNo\nI have a 10% service related but am not on VA healthcare (my employers insurance is better). Can I get a VIHC, even though I’m not on VA healthcare? Last time I called (5 yrs ago) they told me (rudely, btw) that I made too much at my employer to qualify.\nSeems to be another VA “benefit” given to only a very select few, not even -close- to being -all-, honorably discharged vets..Such a shame that the VA does not support -all- “discharged for other than dishonorable” vets equally. But congrats for patting yourselves on the back! Spin this story like it’s for all, then expect the vet to drill down to the details, only to find out, once again, good luck to you.\nSo I have service connected I’d card. When traveling to a base to use the PX or commissary can my wife go with me?\nDoes this also open the use of the military resorts, base/post hotels, and or rv camping locations? If so I am assuming that spouses and immediate family would be able to join? MWR use include movie theaters, pools, bowling, rentals? NCO club?\nI was tried and convicted in a court of law for involuntary manslaughter in a road rage incident I did not start, and just finished serving nine months in prison in New Mexico. BUT I DIDN’T DO IT! I’m 67, broken down and harmless. Are you sure it’s in the US Air Force is the singer in the band. Is it still mean I can’t get on base to go to the commissary Here in Enid, Oklahoma?\nI am a surviving spouse of a veteran who passed away from a service connected illness and had 100% disability status. I currently receive a monthly benefit and also have ChampVA. Do I qualify for this? I have also recently remarried. Would my current husband also have access if accompanied by me if I qualify? Thank you.\nI have a VHIC card and a 60% service related disability but the car does not say that. Should t ask at my next VA hospital visit for a new card? Would they have a record or do I need to take paperwork? Thanks\nYes, get a new card. They have your info in the computer.\nI enlisted in 1972 a served for 4 years. Honorably Discharged after the Vietnam war.\nRaised a family, all my sons are active duty now.Their families live on bases, when I go and visit them and my grandchildren I CANNOT get on base unless they meet me at the gate and sponsor me.\nHow disrespectful and embarrassing\nIt’s great that our disabled vets get better benefits, also retired vets, but I think the rest of us are a bit left out. Any vet who has served, and volunteered, should be able to at least use the on base services, we are not civilians, no matter how long we served the fact is we did, especially those with an honorable discharge. All who served should get benefits, and as I do agree cost needs to be controlled the benefits should be scaled, those who fully retired or are injured should get more but the vets who have served and departed service without injury should not be neglected.\nI think many of these people have a brain disease. He keeps answering the same question over and over and over.\nI guess I just get frustrated because I spent two tours in Viet Nam and wrecked my knees climbing out on ropes in the ship yards to take down the radio antennas, but did not have major knee problems until I was out two months. My pay was $259 a month for an E5 over 4. So I don’t think I got much pay either. We would sit in Danang Harbor and shell around the city every night for months so the Viet Cong would not attack the city. Then go out on gunnery duty for the troops during the day. Since I was not killed or hit on the ship (although the ship was hit) and have not died of cancer, guess I am just one of the lucky ones. But the VA would not even give me a flu shot.\nIf you are a contractor of Government civilian with base privileges and have a veterans mark on your driver’s license, can you still use the Commissary with those credentials? Just curious.\nNo\nI have a proper ID card showing service related disability. Will I be allowed to use campgrounds on bases?\n100%? That’s ridiculous, stop pretending to gaf about veterans. You already don’t give anyone 100% rating who clearly deserves it, and instead keep them at 90%.\nNeither should veterans need to have been wounded or disabled to be recognized and respected by the DoD. It’s pathetic. Neither does this little token gesture make up for lack of real benefits and care for the disabled veterans. We all served. We all deserve a DoD who treats us properly and recognizes our sacrifices and service, even after discharged without being disabled. Commisary isn’t a charity, it operates at cost, meaning it doesn’t matter how many people have access, stop trying to make it an elitist activity for the deadbeats who never get a real job in life.\nI have a va health ID card with a 10% disability, do I have access to the commissary and px and shoppete?\nStarting on Jan 1st\nWhat about access to Commisary and BX/NEX overseas? In Rota, Spain there was a special card/ID you had to have in order to even go into the stores.\nSeems to me like Medal of Honor recipients should be on this list.\nThey already have this benefit as do 100% disabled veterans. This announcement is about newly eligible veterans.\nMy VA card doesn’t show my eligibility status. Does that hinder me from getting into an exchange?\nI’m going to need everyone to just pay attention to the fourth and fifth paragraphs. It explains everything. As long as you are eligible and obtain a VHIC then you have access as a veteran. I.e means in example, that is not limiting your status to what is listed. If you have not committed any crimes that interfere with your benefits then you should be good to go.\nI have a VHIC Purple Heart card, and just tried to book a flight on AFT for late January, 2021; they don’t have me in their database yet. Will I have to wait until Jan 1 to book…or later? How long will it be before these organizations update their information?\nI see the americanforcestravel website in the post but I don’t see anywhere on their website that says that it’s coming soon. They do talk about DoD civilians getting access soon but not disabled vets. Any idea if this is going to be a thing? Thanks\nI have my VA Medical card and it has all of the information mentioned except there is nothing on there about disability or Purple Heart, etc. I do not have a service-connected disability so is that why there is nothing there? Am I still eligible for this program?\nCorrect, you are not currently eligible.\nDo I, a service connected veteran, have to be present for my wife to shop at the commissary or exchange?\nYes.\nI have a 60% rating and was medically discharged after 14 years, not medically retired. I am so happy this book was passed. Thank you to every organization that lobbied on our behalf. And thanks VA for spreading the word.\nAlso- fellow vets if you need the updated VA ID card to show your service-connected, you can quickly call 1-877-222-VETS (8387) and order one for free. I received mine in the mail within a week.\nWhat installations will not honor disabled vets under this new DOD order? The closes to me is Kings Bay, GA. Will they be open to allow us into the installation?\nCan we buy beer, liquor, and cigarettes with this new benefit?\nThank you VA and President Trump. I have had VA medical care for a Service Connected Disability now for more than six years and I have nothing but praise for the care that I have received. I appreciate all the benefits that I have received.\nThank you VA and President Trump. I have had VA medical care for a Service Connected Disability now for more than six years and I have nothing but praise for the care that I have received. I appreciate all the benefits that I have received.522\nTrump had nothing to do with this.\nI’m a service-connected disabled vet but I live overseas and am in the Foreign Medical Program rather than VA Health. I called the VA and asked how I could get a VHIC and their answer was: “Go to your local VA hospital.”\nI live in the UK. The nearest VA hospital is over 3,000 miles away.\nPlease tell me this is NOT the best the VA can do!\nWill I be able to utilize on post/base hotels?\nhow do I get a DOD creds being 100% rated?\nWhat about eligibility to Class VI\nI’m 100% how can I get a FOR card?\nWhen will the health card be authorized to enter the USO at airports?\nI’m am a surviving spouse off 100% disabled veteran service connected. I have a spouse military ID card. Am I included in this change?\nYou are fine. You don’t need this card.\nCan I get access to the Exchange and commissary if I’m a protected veteran without any disability, no POW status, or Purple Heart? I was going to look into getting a VHIC, but now I’m not sure if I’m eligible. I do however have my Armed Force’s Service Metal and protected Veteran status.\nWhat is a protected veteran? If no PH, POW or SC then no.\nShort answer, no. Protected Veteran Status is governed by Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (VEVRAA). This act protects veterans from workplace discrimination by employers affiliated with the US government.\nDon’t hesitate to enroll in the VA healthcare system; call the number listed above in the blog or apply online. If you’re determined to be eligible, you will be able to receive a VHIC.\nI have a VHIC emblazoned with a “Service-Connected” legend. I’m already making use of online access to AAFES, NEX, MCX, CGX and VCS.\nWhen the new law goes into effect on 1 Jan 2020, will my status on DEERS be automatically updated or must I do something proactively to gain access to MWR and commissary privileges?\nI have a VHIC emblazoned with a “Service-Connected” legend. I’m already making use of online access to AAFES, NEX, MCX, CGX and VCS.\nWhen the new law goes into effect on 1 Jan 2020, will my status on DEERS be automatically updated or must I do something proactively to gain access to MWR and commissary privileges?\nYour DEERS eligibility doesn’t change as you aren’t using an ID card issued by them, i.e CAC or DoD retirement card. You are instead using your VA card to access commissary and exchange privileges.\nNo. You should (redacted).\nI live in Germany. Do overseas bases provide the same access privileges?\nIt’s my understanding as long as you have signed up for the Veterans health care it’s the same card correct?\nYou have to be enrolled in the VA system. Did you apply for your VA access within three years of getting out? If not, you have to apply for VA access under a service related disability.\nWhat is a protected veteran?\nBest Christmas Present Ever!!! I miss my commissary privilege. I can’t wait!\nI’m pretty sure I’m in same boat, and I’m pretty sure I’ll be able get vhic card\ni spent 4 years in AF 1966 to 1970..i do use VA but no disabilities.its not fare i and others like me cant use the commissary..my neighbor just joined the national guard can use NOT RIGHTm FAIR..i was in Philippines.that was like war zone\nThe future is to purchase online using a credit or debit type card, have your items home-delivered. Kinda like a resupply mission.\nI have a VHIC card n doesn’t state my status n I’m new n I don’t have ‘Service Connected’…n I read that Veteran disability from 0 – 90% qualifies? Do I qualify or not?\nI’m 10% service connected and it does say “Service Connected” on my card. If you are service connected you probably need another trip to the service office at you nearest VA medical center to get it clarified.\nYes you qualify as long as you have your VHIC\nI went in and got it updates to say service connected. Got my card on 5 days.\nNope.\nIf just Honorable Discharge but have no PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED, then cannot get on base access to exchange or commissary ?\nCorrect.\nno\nThere are many questions asked about “service connected”. My card states under my photo, “VA health Care Enrollee”. Is that sufficient or does my disability need to be listed? Thank you in advance.\nThey don’t put your disability or percentage on the card. If you have a rating it will say service- connected.\nI have my VHIC indicating “Service Connected”. Will I be permitted to go fishing in the lakes on the East Reservation of Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana?\nYes, make sure you have your fishing lic.\nI live about an hour and a half from a base. When I’m in that town, my family is with me. Will I be able to take my spouse and children on base with me?\nYes\nI doubt it. I am a contractor on base and already have a VIC card and I cannot escort anyone on base at all.\nVA ID are not eligible until January 1, 2020\ncall the base and ask….\nOur VA hospital takes a photo and issues the card immediately. Maybe you could try your VA hospital. I didn’t get one automatically, either.\nCan my wife come on base with me shopping? I am service-connected, with ID.\nYes\nMark A. Merrick, I had the same question. Can you point us to a reg that authorizes spouse visit? Can they access post with just a state-issued ID (driver’s license)? I like that you say spouses can accompany, but I don’t want to try until I see it in formal announcement. Can you point to one?\nMany thanks.\nJonathan, installation access regulations allow individuals authorized access to installations to bring guests on with them. Because the type of identification newly eligible veterans and caregivers will be using is not DoD-issued, your guests will have to stop at the visitor control center to undergo the standard visitor vetting before they are cleared to accompany you (just like newly eligible veterans and caregivers will have to undergo upon their first visit to an installation). If the state-issued driver’s license or non-driver’s identification card is REAL ID-compliant, they can use that as proof of identity. If it is not REAL ID-compliant, they will not be able to use it and will have to use another type of identification listed on the acceptable credentials list (a U.S. passport is probably the next most common type). Once identity is verified and purpose is established (to accompany you to the XXX), they will run an on-the-spot background check. As long as the background check doesn’t come back showing derogatory criminal or terrorism activity, she will be able to accompany you onto the installation. If the installation you are visiting has credential enrollment capabilities and the credentials are enrollable, they can be enrolled for recurring access, which means you won’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time they accompany you to the installation.\nI have a service connected disability of 50 percent and have my va health care card am i eligible to us commissary at local air force base\nAfter January 1, 2020 you can use your VA ID to get on base and shop.\nCG, not everyone with a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) will be authorized in-person shopping privileges after January 1, 2020. If your VHIC displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card, you will have installation and in-person privilege access.\nJames, if your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front of the card below your photo, then you will be able to access your local Air Force base beginning January 1, 2020, to use the commissary, exchange, or MWR retail facilities.\nDaniel, your wife certainly may accompany you; however, she cannot make any purchases. Keep in mind, also, that you will have to stop at the visitor control center on your way onto the installation and she will have to be vetted for entry. She will need to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport to prove her identity. Accompanying you to the XXX is her purpose. Then they will run a basic on-the-spot background check. As long as the background check doesn’t come back showing derogatory criminal or terrorism activity, she will be able to accompany you onto the installation. (BTW, you will also have to stop at visitor control on your first visit for the same vetting). If the installation you are visiting has credential enrollment capabilities and the credentials you and your guest use are enrollable, you can have them enrolled for recurring access, which means you won’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time you want to go to the installation.\nIf a person is eligible for this new benefit, and you go to the commissary, does you wife have to have a letter for her to get in with me?\nNo\nStanley, your wife will not have to have a letter to accompany you into the commissary; however, she cannot make any purchases. Keep in mind, though, that you will have to stop at the visitor control center on your way onto the installation and she will have to be vetted for entry. She will need to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport to prove her identity. Accompanying you to the commissary is her purpose. Then they will run a basic on-the-spot background check. As long as the background check doesn’t come back showing derogatory criminal or terrorism activity, she will be able to accompany you onto the installation. (BTW, you will also have to stop at visitor control on your first visit for the same vetting). If the installation you are visiting has credential enrollment capabilities and the credentials you and your guest use are enrollable, you can have them enrolled for recurring access, which means you won’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time you want to go to the base.\nSo once again I get the hachet for going in when women only seen the gas chamber as far as combat. 1973 to 1974.\nI was the first gal through computer repair and setup. I was to smart and was made an instructor of the first 18 weeks of the class. I taught guys who ended up with some disability from thier job. I feel for those who were hurt or killed in combat duty. I know I trained a few who are disabled now. I became disabled but from a non service connected disability and yet I cant have benifits of those who are service connected. If I had not taught those men who are disabled they would not have been hurt.\nSorry for rambleing but we all are vets. Why cant the goverment give us all use and benefits just for being part of the service system.\nThe line has to be drawn somewhere, or civilians having never served would want equal benefits.\nThat’a a lousy reply. Are you saying that a civilian has the same status as someone who would have gone to battle if called upon has. Try again please, because your response makes no sense.\nAmen. I agree, that makes no sense At All!!\nWhat he’s saying is non service related is non service related. It didn’t happen in the service. It has nothing to do with battle but if it happened in the service or not. She is whining because she did not get hurt in the service, she is getting the hatchet for nothing. If she gets hurt in service it’s the same service related as someone that went to battle.\nI am 100% with some non service related stuff also\nThe primary benefit of shopping at the exchange or commissary is no TAX. Other than that, most prices and quality rank with Target and Wal-mart stores. The exchange and commissary operations are not the same operations as the military had during and immediately after the Vietnam War. The real truth is that the benefit has been taken away from service members because of increased military pay. Look at some of the old pay tables from 1972-1982.\nDitto Jim,\nI remember when purchases on base beat local retailers. With the advent of WalMart, Amazon and the rest the Echanges/Commissaries cannot compete. Eventually the only thing that will survive is the overseas Commissary. The overseas Exchanges cannot compete with online sales delivered to APO/FPO. They are probably hoping that VHIC sales will boost revenue.\nHere, I will say it, the line has to be drawn. It makes no sense to give a SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY BENEFIT to a Veteran who DOES NOT HAVE a SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY.\nThe VA Disability Benefits are to help those of us who were harmed DURING OUR SERVICE TO COUNTRY and thus became less employable or unemployable.\nIf a Civilian becomes disabled he/she has Local, State, and Federal Programs, ie: Workman’s Comp, Social Security Disability. Civilians may also apply for private coverage. Las but not least, there are some places that apply discounts for the disabled, you only need to do a search.\nI will also say this, Kathleen is allowed her opinion, and she can be angry all she wants, but for her to literally sht on all women with a service connected disability like she did, is just plain wrong. Be pissed at the system, that’s fine, we all do that from time to time.\nTo Jim Young. Thanks for your info comment on the benefit of the Veterans for 2020 bx/px commissary usage. I kind of thought that the Big Box stores would be just about as good as going on Base/Post for shopping. Especially now a days with Veterans 10% discount at a lot of stores. Yes, base pay for E-1 $300 month(1974). Only If I could buy my cigarettes cheaper, would I even want/need to go near a Military Installation. What info on tobacco purchase? Tax free with a limit of cartons? USAF 40% In Service(Non-Combat) (DEP 12-27-73) Active Jun 74/Jun 80. 60th – 4787th Air Base Groups\nYou know, I really feel good that the current level of respect for Veterans is at the level it is now.\nFor the youngsters here crying about “how come all veterans” can’t be included. Well, this was reserved for Retired Personnel, who served a life time. Now it has been extended to combat troops, and I welcome that and salute all combat troops, with service connected injuries and awards. I salute all combat troops. They have my upmost respect.\nI also agree with Kathleen. I served in the USMC but did not retire from USMC . We should at least commissary privileges.\nYou are correct, No real good buys at the Commissary or Exchange or any other Base facility. You can thank your Congress Representative for that. Many years ago they protested that any Tax money was used to subsidize anything for Military people. So they brought in Outside contractors to manage the Exchange and Commissary along with other services that benefited Military members. Now they set the prices and skim their profits off the top before giving a little back to the base services for families.Basically they stripped away any good deals for the Military families. Thanks a lot Congress.You can guess which political party was behind this. Certainly not the party that cares about our Military.\nCommunity retailers got upset at exchange prices so DoD agreed to keep them within 10% of local retail prices.\nSo 22 years and my Army ID card gets me squat? The pay argument doesn’t work either. In the 70’s when pay was low prices on goods and services were also way lower. Can’t buy a house for 40K anymore. Apparently you don’t remember when gas was only 35 cents. And at the PX I could purchase cigarettes for $3 a carton, and that was in the 80’s. Know what the cheapest ones cost now? $57. So this is just another way to mess with Vet’s. Should I just toss my military ID? Doesn’t seem to be worth much anymore.\nI agree that the Exchanges aren’t what they used to be. My experience with Fort Jackson is “jacked-up” prices equal to and greater than prices that you’d get from Walmart, even with the sales tax. Most electronics are out of date or lower end, and choices in general are very limited.\nYou definitely have more options with better deals between Sam’s, Costco, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, etc\nExactly!…very good.\nOn top of that Jim, “No Tax” is not true, we pay a 5% Surcharge on the total of the purchase at the Commissary (Hidden Tax!), but No Tax or Surcharge at the PX/Exchange. I also find that the overall price comparison at the Exchange is on par with Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. Gas on most bases is higher than at the Costco and Sam’s Club stations here in Southern California…\nV/R Master Chief USN Retired\nNot only do you pay a surcharge at the commissary, baggers work off of tips. So savings are negated by these fees.\nCivilians have never served and wouldn’t have a VHIC either, nor could they get one. So why isn’t this being offered to all veterans again?\n“Why is this benefit not being offered to all Veterans?” you ask, let me see if I can write this as simply as possible so that you and others might understand.\nAble bodied Veterans are discharged from the military ready and able to work.\nAble bodied Veterans will earn income at the same rate to better than when they entered the military.\nDisabled Veterans are not ready to work after discharge, and have been rendered less employable to completely unemployable due to to harm they were subjected to while serving.\nDisabled Veterans will earn LESS income to ZERO income because of the Disability they have incurred during their service. Thus the VA is compensating them for the loss of income.\nI hope this answers your question and makes things more clear for everyone.\nPlease understand that I and every disabled Veteran would trade every single benefit over for a Whole Body and Sound Mind, In a New York F-ING MINUTE!! I never once asked to be disabled.\nGT, the law specified the particular groups of veterans and DoD is simply implementing the law. DoD infrastructure is not equipped to handle an influx of over 15 million additional veterans to these types of facilities without severely impacting its ability to provide these critical services to active duty personnel and their families, which is why they exist.\nWhile not all veterans are eligible for in-person privileges, all honorably discharged veterans are eligible for online military exchange shopping privileges through the Veterans Online Shopping Benefit that went into effect on November 11, 2017.\nYou need to have them update your card like i did recently after getting my rating a year ago. You can do it her maybe or at your med facility and thy will mail it to you in a couple of weeks. It will say service connected under your pic..\nWhat are you even saying? That ramble didn’t even make much sense. Did you serve? Did you get an honorable discharge? Did you get a rating though the VA? Do you have a VHIC? If your answers are anything but yes to all of the above then NO you do not get nor deserve access. You sound like military spouses that say they “serve too”.\nYeah, this Mark dude is pretty much an a** on all his replies. WTF.\nSo veterans that are not disabled dont really have benefits like those who are disabled, right? Then why even bother calling us veterans? Why not give us another name like former military service. That would help distinguish veteran privledges and we wouldnt have to look at every topic that deals with veterans. This really hurts to be called a veteran but can use privledges like this because we are not disabled. Some disabilities are faked just to get the pension. But yet they still get to use the base privledges. WE ARE STILL VETERANS AND SHOULD BE GIVEN THE PRIVLEDGES AS THOSE WHO ARE DISABLED.\nAre you kidding me? That response is not an acceptable answer. Veterans who were not deployed, for whatever reasons, were there and ready to go at a moments notice. All veterans deserve the respect of this country. Civilians are great and I love them but a veteran said I will give my life for my country and countrymen. Civilians did not do that. Veterans of our great military are special and should be treated as such.\nRead her comment again, she served or did you not understand that?\nKathleen, go to your local VA and file for a 0% disability claim. That labels you as service connected.\nYou literally only served for a year. You think you deserve the same benefits as a COMBAT Veteran having served AT LEAST 3 years? Minimum 4 if you were a Marine. Shame on you.\nWhat they need to do is gives us ACTUAL healthcare not this BS they call the VA.\nYou seem to be confused on how it works. If you were hurt on the job or even while you were in YOU would be service connected. Non service connected means it happened after you were out, or no proof it happened while in.\nGoing to battle does not assure you of service related. Only if it happened while in.\nOne can go to battle and STILL have non service related injuries. It has nothing to do with being a woman or what your job was so stop whining.\nIf you served for more than 30days in a combat zone your a vet. Inquirer at your local DAV, or department of veteran services, or VA hospital. They advise you about your preveliges.\nJim I work for the Federal Government and after speaking with staff they advised me they have that in the plans for all Veterans that served get commissary access but, they had to redo all the cash registered, train staff etc.. and start with disabled veterans it everything ironed out.\nDarrell, are you saying that future plans would include all veterans?\nDarrell, I don’t know who your source is, but based on your comment, what they relayed to you is not correct.\nShe already disqualified herself by stating that her disabilities are not related to her time in service. Therefore, she can’t get certain benefits merely for serving for 2 years as an instructor. Yes, she’s a vet. The issue here is that it sounds like she’s looking for a hand-out.\nI signed the dotted line for an 8 year contract right off the bat so that I’d be guaranteed the training program that I desired. I got banged around pretty bad a few times, enough to put an end to any hope of a 20 year military career yet I still managed to separate with an Honorable discharge. Now I’m P&T 100% service connected for a bunch of different mild to moderately sever physical conditions…I earned it. This lady did not.\nThank you for your service This may not solve your wishes, but definitely is recognized by me in your sacrifices. May God Bless You today and always ❤️\nYou can shop online with them.. just not the food side…\nHave you applied for a VA card? VAs were started for service connected veterans only, BUT now many VAs will allow access to honorable discharged Vets. Each VA is different because of their ability to handle more patients. Please apply. I worked for the VA for 12 years.\nYou are getting the hatchet for nothing. You get the same benefits as a male the went to battle, so stop feeling sorry for yourself.\nLook again at Service related and non service related and you will see it is self explanatory. Service related means you were injured or started a medical condition in service. Period. It has nothing whatsoever to do with going into battle. Clearly going into battle is service related, but so is falling off a ladder, out of a chair, or getting hit by a car off base. Non service related means……..it did not happen in the service. Duh.\nSo you are complaining about not getting hurt in service. You have never gotten the hatchet, you have a national defense ribbon (Vietnam era), many male and female service members were in when you were and are service related not because of going to battle but getting hurt in service.\nI am 100% service related and also have some non service related stuff. Getting hurt while in (battle or not) is a roll of the dice and I bet plenty of injured people wish they were in your shoes and had all of their limbs, etc. I, for one, am embarrassed at your post.\nFrom what I’ve ‘seen’, you don’t sound ‘to’ smart to me…\nMy question is what exactly are the veteran’s that are 100% service connected disability eligible for regarding DOD credentials under DoD policy?\nI believe 90-100 were already eligible.\n100% and MoH were already eligible\nJim, 90 percent is NOT correct. Veterans with a 100 percent service-connected disability or unemployability rating are already authorized DoD privileges and a DoD identification card.\nA lifetime of pain and suffering in my case and I have a card issued by the VA hospital that I am assigned to. If you are asking what I use to get on base with, I use my driver’s license with the VA ID. I don’t get what you are trying to say with your reference to DOD credentials under DID policy.\nYou and your dependents would receive an actual DOD ID card. Similar to a retiree card, but Tan and your dependents get dependent cards. It gives you privileges to Exchange, Commissary and MWR. No Tricare, but you get covered by the VA Health Care System. There’s also quite a few state benefits for being a 100% so look into contacting a state veterans representative. And there’s also a student loan forgiveness program for those with 100%. It’s a complete payoff that many have take advantage of. Lastly, and most importantly for many, it’s the monthly monetary compensation for a 100% rating. There might be more, but that’s all I can think of at the top of my head.\nI understand your question, I wondered the same thing but probably nothing. Took a lot to get the 100% and gain those benefits and now 100% doesn’t give you any special benefits over someone who has 0% or 10% service connected. That kinda craps all over those who got hurt a good bit worse than someone who hurt their small to and got 2%. Hats off to you because getting 100% ain’t easy at all!(well at least my didn’t, I had to lose the use of parts of my body).\nCommissary has a tax. It’s called a “surcharge” and equals the sales tax in most states, who usually don’t tax food.\nEddie, actually, the commissary surcharge is always 5 percent. It has nothing to do with state tax. It’s required by law and it pays for commissary construction and maintenance projects. Even with the surcharge, the commissary delivers a worldwide average savings of 23.7 percent over commercial grocery stores.\nAs far I know and I have a neighbor who’s 100%. As a 100% disable veteran you will get the blue ID card which entitles you to the same as a retiree. Therefore this new thing doesn’t even apply to them.\nThe 100% disabled Vet card is tan not blue. The blue retiree card affords the holder commissary, BX/PX/NeX/CGEx, MWR, medical care on base, and Space A flight for eligible family members who also hold a DoD issued card. The 100% tan card holders get the same benefits, minus base medical care for themselves and family members. Plus no Space A flight privileges for tan card holding family members.\nAbsolutely right Leo.\n100% does qualify family members for champva and Delta dental through the va. Plus some school benefits, etc.\nI enrolled in VA Healthcare in Baltimore, Maryland on June 21 2012 and have still not been sent an ID card from them. In August 2018 I went to the VA in Mansfield, Ohio to have my membership transferred to there. I have not received a VA ID card from them either Do you have a reason that you may explain to me as to why I am having so much difficulty in receiving a VA ID card? I would appreciate receiving one as I guess I should be concerned about my health!.\nIf you’re in Mansfield, drop down to the Columbus VA Ambulatory Care Center just south of the airport on James Road. It’s probably closer to your home than the Cleveland VA. I rather imagine that you’d have your picture taken and have a card in the mail in a few days. Getting a card for you is not exactly doing you a favor. Making sure that every VA-eligible veteran has one actually makes it easier and more efficient for them to provide care, so they have a strong incentive to get that done for you. The Columbus VA is a very well-run facility.\nYou need to go to your closest VA medical center, go to their enrollment office, tell them you need a VHIC and they’ll need to see your ID (i.e. drivers license, passport, etc.). Then they’ll process your request and send you an ID, I got mine in a matter of 7-10 days.\nYou need to go to your VA facility to request an ID card. The card requires a photo and can’t just be sent out automatically as they were many years ago. When you enter the facility just ask the person at the desk about an ID and they will point you on the right direction. Good luck and thank you for your service. God bless!\nAn actual DOD ID card like a retiree but orange\nMy ID was made at the VA Hospital I first walked into after receiving my 30 percent rating. There was a staff there, looked at my driver’s license, looked at my rating paperwork, told me to smile for the camera, and 10 minutes later handed me my card.\nI’m service connected with 0% and can’t get an ID Card because my income is too high on the MEANS from. I dont understand why I can’t get an ID Card; its service connected. I can go to the VA medical facility only for that problem annually. Any thing else is billed to my personal insurance. ‘m also not allowed to have a primary care physician there because of my income.\nGladys, if you have a 0 percent service-connected condition and you received a VA Health Eligibility Center Form H623A that placed you in VA health care priority group 8E because of your income, you can bring the HEC Form H623A with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport for DoD installation and commissary, exchange, and MWR retail privilege access. DoD just recently identified this as an alternate to the VHIC for those veterans with a 0 percent condition who are unable to obtain a VHIC due to income.\nHey Ralph,\nTruth is you will never just “get one.” There is a specific place in each VA Medical Center that handles the issuing of these ID cards. No appointment needed, but I believe you just bring in a photo ID, and there might be a quick 1 page paper to fill out (I can’t remember, but it was easy). I was actually told by someone working at the VA Medical Center that I should go down and get one when I was there (Syracuse) but my wife was not told, nor did she know about it. It was only through my persistence that she went back and got one. They send it to you through the mail about a week or so later. Hope this helps!!!\nYou don’t just get one, you request to have one. I asked my CBOC if I could get one and they gave me a paper with what I needed to bring to show identity and place of residency. Took pic there and got it in the mail 2 weeks later. It’s the VA, you ask for it, not wait and see if you get it.\nYou need to go to the Eligibility Office at the VA.\nEnrolling in VA Healthcare doesn’t mean you automatically get an ID card from them. You must go to the enrollment and request a card. In my case I enrolled in the VA healthcare system in 2006 but I did not get an ID card until I actually went to the enrollment window at my local VA Clinic in 2014 and requested one. They printed it right there on the spot. They may mail them now. I don’t know if they have a new policy to mail all cards now. Good luck!\nDid you go and haveyour photo taken? I receivedmine right there on the spot at the VA facility.\nI took my photo at the VA clinic in Maryland. Received my ID in 10 days. You may want to call and inquire.\nI just went to the enrollment center two weeks ago at the Baltimore VA and received my ID card. If you did not sit and take a picture then you did not request an ID card. I suggest going to the Baltimore VA and requesting it because it is not automatic.\nThey don’t automatically give you a card. You have to go to the ID office at the branch you go to and request an ID. They have to take your picture and everything just like a drivers license.\nI wondered the same thing when I enrolled in 2014. I got the ID when I went to the hospital, took a picture and if I remember right got it right then, so you may want to go to the nearest VA hospital, I’ll assume there should be one in Columbus to get the card.\nDerogatory criminal history?! I’m not perfect yet no felonies either. Will I be automatically denied entry?\nto help a little, I too in the past year received healthcare but did not receive an ID card. The ID card wasn’t required to have for the medical clinic to provide services, as they only needed an ID which was my driver’s license. I then learned that I had to go into the facility and request to have the ID card. I went into the facility requested the card, and they assisted me in the very same day. They had a certain individual who takes care of this. He got me in right away, took my picture, and I received my card within 7 days. Please go back to the healthcare place, and let them know you need a VHIC card, and they will be able to assist you in getting one.\nWhen I got my photo ID at Hines Hospital near chicago one of the VA employees that assisted me told me I would also be getting a little complmentory ditty bag when I came back to him. I never recieved any such bag and don’t know what was in it.\nI don’t have any idea what was in it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if these VA employees take that stuff home with them.\nI also used the barber at that location and got a buzz cut. The barber that cut my hair tried to request more money because, according to him. I had a lot of hair. My hair was about 6″ long.\nThe V. A. commissary there had prices that were as high, if not higher, than a regular retail store.\nI would imagine that\nA regular brick a d mortar retail store has a much higher overhead and profit margin than a commissary on a military installation.\nSomebody please explain to me how that works.\nThe first VA employee I had to talk to at Hines told me I spent no time in an area that would have exposed me to Agent Orange.\nI spent part of my first week in Vietnam in Bien Hoa, which was a main distribution and storage installation for Agent Orange. Haven’t been back to the V.A. in years.\nI understand that they have changed enormously for the better. I sure hope so. I need to take my 70 year old butt back and get checked out.\nOur VA hospital takes a photo and issues the card immediately. Maybe you could try your VA hospital. I didn’t get one automatically, either.\nI lived in MD and now OH, too. If you head up to Parma VA Clinic, there is a booth with a camera and they will get your VHIC processed and sent in the mail.\nYour Card is not sent to you. Call your county Veteran Services Office and find out the nearest place to get a ID card.\nWhat is the phone number for the cummunity care office? What are the qualifications and how do you apply to obtain a letter as a care giver? Is there someone that can assist me with this?\nI found this site that can help answer your questions:\nhttps://hiddenheroes.org/va-caregiver-program-fact-sheets/\nFor more information about who is eligible and how to become a primary family caregiver for an eligible veteran under the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, visit https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/comprehensive-assistance/\nWill spouses be able to accompany the VHIC holder during visits to commissaries and MER facilities?\n[Editor: Yes!]\nJessica, eligible veterans may bring guests to accompany them onto the installations and into facilities. Similar to how the newly eligible veteran or caregiver must stop at the visitor control center the first time, so will your guests. They will need to show an acceptable credential, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport, as proof of identity at visitor control. At visitor control, they will verify identity and purpose (to accompany you to the store), and then they will run an on-the-spot background check. If the check comes back with no derogatory criminal or terrorism history, then they will be able to accompany you onto the installation. If the installation has credential enrollment capability and the acceptable credential they use is enrollable, it can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time they come with you. Your guests must remain with you at all times and they may not make any purchases.\nHow can spouse accompany veteran ?\nShow up with your spouse!\nI was going to say, “Try using your legs and flash your ID when required…kind of like Costco.”\nRoger, eligible veterans may bring guests to accompany them onto the installations and into facilities. Similar to how the newly eligible veteran or caregiver must stop at the visitor control center the first time, so will your guests. They will need to show an acceptable credential, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport, as proof of identity at visitor control. At visitor control, they will verify identity and purpose (to accompany you to the store), and then they will run an on-the-spot background check.

If the installation has credential enrollment capability and the acceptable credential they use is enrollable, it can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time they come with you.\nWhere can I find the 0 rating approval information. It sounded like 100 percent only from the article.\n[Editor: It’s the same info.]\nClearly you didn’t read it. The card must say “service connected” these cards do not specify percentage. MOH and 100% could get base access before this and don’t need these new rules to gain access.\nI’m a vet with honorable discharge will I have access to box and commissary? Travel at Travis AFB?\nAlfred, to take advantage of the new commissary, exchange, and MWR retail privileges, you must be a Purple Heart recipient, a former prisoner of war, or a veteran with a service-connected disability rating between 0-90 percent and it must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of your Veteran Health Identification Card. Space A travel is not included in these privileges.\nPerhaps another look at the VHIC graphic at the head of this story will help. First on the list is “VA Healthcare Enrollee” So If I understand correctly, it need not say “service-connected” to be eligible.\n“Veterans and Primary Family Caregivers who are eligible and want to take advantage of in-person benefits must have a Veterans Health Identification Card, or VHIC.”\n“Veterans use VHICs for identification and check-in at VA appointments, but will also use them for base access under the new program.”\n“Veterans eligible solely under this act who are eligible to obtain a Veteran Health Identification Card must use this credential for in-person installation and privilege access.”\nThe problem may be reading this sentence: “The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED).” While it does not specify “VA Healthcare Enrollee” I don’t see any exclusion.\nSo while I can not find that language, and I do think it could have been more clearly expressed, I’m going to assume that if you possess the VHIC you are good to go unless the editor says no.\nKen, everyone who has a VHIC should be stamped “VA Healthcare Enrollee,” but not everyone with a VHIC is eligible for these privileges. In addition to “VA Healthcare Enrollee,” the card must display any one or combination of the new eligibility criteria for these privileges, “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED.” If it doesn’t say “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED,” you are not eligible.\nIt adds 0-90%. I have a10% for hearing. I also got a 0% rating for coverage of two teeth injured while on duty. but no cash allowance. That is how you get a 0% qualification.\nIf your ID says service- connected then you are good to go.\nLou, veterans with a 100 percent service-connected or unemployability rating from VA already have DoD access privileges. These new privileges are for veterans who are Purple Heart recipients, a former prisoners of war, or a veterans with a service-connected disability rating between 0-90 percent and it must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of your Veteran Health Identification Card.\nMy spouse is not a vet. I have my VA ID. She is a great shopper so want to have her accompany me on base. How will this be handled so she doesn’t have to go to the visitor center? Will her California Drivers license be accepted at the gate as other visitors are when accompanying a retiree? Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!\nYes!\nIsn’t it great now that a Veteran who only served 3 months with a 0% service connected disability has the same benefits as a Retiree who served 20 years. Soon everyone will be eligible for Space A flights.\nJohn, space A flights are not included in these privileges as they are not operated by the commissary, exchange, or MWR.\nRobert, eligible veterans may bring guests to accompany them onto the installations and into facilities. Similar to how the newly eligible veteran or caregiver must stop at the visitor control center the first time, so will your guests. If her California driver’s license is REAL ID-compliant, she will be able to use it as proof of identity at visitor control. If it is not a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license, she will need to have another acceptable credential like a U.S. passport. At visitor control, they will verify her identity and purpose (to accompany you to the store), and then they will run an on-the-spot background check. If the check comes back with no derogatory criminal or terrorism history, then she will be able to accompany you onto the installation. If the installation has credential enrollment capability and the acceptable credential she uses is enrollable, it can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time she comes with you.\nI am 100 percent service connected now. Do I need to do anything else? I already have privileges tobhe get on installations etc?\nYou do not anything else if you have already been approved at the commissary.\nJust schedule an appointment with your local RAPIDS office to get your 100% serviced connected DoD ID card, and take all of the required paperwork with you; VA commissary letter, DD-214, identity documents, etc.\nAt your appointment, they’ll snap a photo and print your base access card right there on the spot….good to go!\nYour spouse and any dependent kids can get ID’s too. My kids feel special when we go shopping and they get to whip out their “military ID” at the base gate & at check out. The guys on watch at the gate get a chuckle out of it. What? Gate duty stinks….been there, done that. Haha!!\nDoes this give access to all military golf courses.\nYes! MWR access.\nRon, see my response below. Also want to be clear that this applies in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions. Access to installation golf courses in overseas foreign countries is subject applicable host-nation laws and applicable international agreements, like status of forces agreements.\nDoes this allow golfers access to on base golf courses .\nYes!\nRon, to be clear, it doesn’t allow anyone who wants to golf access to installation golf courses, but it does allow veterans and caregivers who meet the new eligibility criteria (Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings between 0-90 percent, and Primary Family Caregivers for eligible veterans under the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers) to access installation golf courses, provided they have the approved documentation.\nIt is easy to get a VAIC; but it does the veteran injustice if their claims are denial without merit. I am not saying that the claims got denied because I don’t have a current medical support documents, they denied my disabilities claims without looking at my medical records. It is easy with a stroke of the keyboard and close the case. I am sicken tired of the military mentions about MWR benefit or commissary benefit. Who give a DAMN about going shopping there. Everything there is very expensive compare to Winco or Walmart.\nReapply, if it’s in your service treatment records and you have a diagnosis now it shouldn’t be an issue to get rated. A lot have changed recently that take effect on Jan. 1, 2020!\nwhy don’t you try reapplying? I highly doubt they just “didn’t look at them”. if you don’t care about these benefits then why are you even here commenting?\nI have service connected disability and wanting to find out if non caregiver spouse will be able to company me onto base to visit bx/commissary? Will I be able to bring guests onto the base?\nYes, your immediate family is allowed to accompany you.\nRichard, as an authorized veteran with a service-connected disability and a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you are the only authorized patron. That said, your spouse and child may accompany you onto the installation and into the facilities, they just cannot purchase anything and they must stay with you at all times while you are on the installation. You will need to stop at the visitor control center on your way onto the installation and any guest with you that is 18 years or older will need to present an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport to verify identity. After an on-the spot background check is run, if it doesn’t show any derogatory criminal or terrorism history, they will be allowed to accompany you onto the installation. If the installation has credential enrollment capability and the acceptable credential they use is enrollable, it can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time they come with you.\nTHANKS TO ALL FOR THIS.\nI have the card for service connected disability. Will my wife and 14 year old daughter be able to go in to the PX and Commissary with me, it does it only give me access?\nYes, as it stated in the article.\nI guess people don’t know how to read or do their own research on the interwebs.\nYes, your spouse and kids can come with you.\nNo, they won’t be detained at the gate.\nYes, you can access MWR to see movies and play golf.\nRoger, as an authorized veteran with a service-connected disability and a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you are the only authorized patron. That said, your spouse and child may accompany you onto the installation and into the facilities, they just cannot purchase anything and they must stay with you at all times while you are on the installation.

If the installation has credential enrollment capability and the acceptable credential they use is enrollable, it can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time they come with you.\nWill I be able to access all military installations using my VHIC or are there certain ones that are not participating?\nAll\nAt overseas installations it depends on the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).\nGreat! Area 51, here I come!\n:-)\nMark, I think this is great and a very good move for veterans.\nI do have one question?\nI do have the VHIC card and do get medical help and support.\nIf I understand what I think I read and saw above only the three types of specific VHIC cards will get this new privilege ?\nJohn, only veterans who were awarded the Purple Heart, who were former prisoners of war, or who have a service-connected disability rating between 0 percent and 90 percent are included in these new privileges. It must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC).\nAaron, all of the installations in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions are included, since U.S. law applies here. In overseas foreign countries, applicable host-nation laws and applicable international agreements, like status of forces agreements, may limit access, so it is best to check with the installation before you try to access it. And if they tell you it’s not included, please understand that it’s not personal, it’s just the way it is.\nHallelujah! About time ALL veterans are recognized for their service.\nBut the rest of us veterans who did not have any health problems and no service disability are still left out.\nYou’re correct. You had the opportunity to serve 20 years and retire just like the rest of us. If you did not retire, that’s the consequence of your choice.\nMark, that’s insulting. Not everyone was able to stay in and retire.\nI tried to get a VHIC and was rejected because of my income. If I had applied 47 years ago I could have gotten it. I waited until I retired at 65 yrs. I have no disabilities other than hearing loss. All I could get was VIC. Why am I penalized for my income now?\nI can’t get BX privileges because of this. Are there no exceptions?\nJerry, if you have a 0 percent service-connected condition and you received a VA Health Eligibility Center Form H623A that placed you in VA health care priority group 8E because of your income, you can bring the HEC Form H623A with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport for installation and privilege access. DoD just recently identified this as an alternate to the VHIC for those veterans with a 0 percent condition who are unable to obtain a VHIC due to income.\nThat’s a sarcastic answer. We (Veterans without service connected) were in the military just like anybody else that was in, wartime or not, we still were ready to go if it amounted to that. We are still Veterans.\nJeez you don’t have to treat him like he got a DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE!\nThat’s a shtty reply. If everybody served 20 years and retired they wouldn’t need a program like this at all as retirees already have base access to facilities. Quit being sour and either assist those with questions, or simply leave the page. If somebody honorably served for 8 years or 18 years and then separated for reasons other than medical, I see no reason at all why they should be denied access to base MWR or shopping facilities.\nYep, I could have but I decided that I gave them 4 years to send me anywhere they chose. I did not get hurt, lucky me. I worked outside and paid taxes so you could get paid since you worked for the military and the tax they took out was still our tax dollars that civilians paid from real productive related work from the private sector who are the ones who really pay real dollar taxes into the government.\nYou sound stupid! Some people may if not been able to for other reasons besides being disabled. Service is service and everyone should be entitled especially if honorable.\nWhat kind of snide remark is that? I was in for 6 years until I ended up with a profile that barred me from re-enlistment. So no I did not have the choice of stating for 20 years until I retired and I have been left out of any and all recognition for the time I did spend. So keep your snide remarks.\nRetirement benefit is clearly better than being honorable discharge veteran, as it should be. But opportunity calls us all in different ways. Point is we are all veterans if we served. And if the gov states expanded benefits and access for veterans that expansion doesn’t deprive or diminish the retirees benefit, right? So whether we retired at twenty active, or got out and did some other positive thing with our veterans based life opportunities, the point is we are all just as beneficial to society and worthy of the benefits we were all promised when we signed up as part of the all volunteer force this country relies on.\nBesides, the prices will come down if there are more purchases from the local base stores. Especially on high end lower supply items. That is just common business sense. From what I can see the vendors are not discounting the prices at the BX anymore and low efficiency of lower sales make your prices higher. So if you have veterans shopping at your stores you will see lower Walmart type pricing because you will have higher volume sales. You retirees and active duty guys want our dollars in the mix. Thus should have happened to benefit you as well as us a long time ago. It keeps you more influential in the products outlet side of supply chain and resulting prices.\nWell not all, I know many people that were force shaped out of the Air force that wanted to continue on. When they applied for other jobs the denial took so long they did not have a chance to apply for other fields. They applied for law enforcement and aircraft mechanic which are the two most needed.\nSorry Mark. You are incorrect. I was “right sized” out of the military in the 90’s. Would have stayed in, but I didn’t have a choice.\nyou say we had a choice to stay 20 years well when I and several others were at Ramstein GE in 1992 were medically retired (I had over 18 and some had 19+) we had NO CHOICE AND CHANCE TO GO 20, so Mark A. Merrick, I think you should rephrase that answer and be glad this did not happen to you and you should offer an apology to those you insulted by the statement… “You had the opportunity to serve 20 and retire just like the rest of us, that’s the consequence of your choice”., I served and was medically discharged under my maiden name.\nSorry.. that’s a BS answer. Are you saying the person that served 10 years, or 5 years, or even 15 years is any less a veteran than the person who served 20??? We all wore the uniform, served our country, and should have the benefit of something as little as commissary or MWR benefits. Just because someone didn’t do 20 years doesn’t mean they aren’t as equal a veteran as the person who did 20.\nNot trying to call you out Mark, but are you really a veteran or just another internet troll? I’m only asking because on a few of your responses you’re coming across sounding like a millennial that spends too much time on Facebook. Whether having served 4, 20+, service connected, or not, a veteran is a veteran and should be able to expect some semblance of respect at least from one another.\nI concur with Mark. If you didn’t get seriously hurt or weren’t driven somewhat crazy by the jacked up stuff you saw overseas, weren’t captured & tortured, didn’t do something totally awesome to receive a Medal of Honor, or didn’t retire from service (serve 20+ years), and then have any of the above reviewed and approved by the VA, then why the heck should you receive special rewards and privileges?\nA lot of people sign on the dotted line to take Uncle Sam’s Wild Ride, but not everyone pays the price of admission. You already got your free ride, made your own choices, and you blew your shot by not sticking it out for 20 years or getting wounded/seriously injured in the line of duty.\nYou are a veteran, yes, but you aren’t a protected class of veteran. Er go, no big cookie for you at the end of the ride, dude. I paid for my ticket, and it sounds like Mark paid for his….and it sounds like guys like us paid for guys like you to sit around and accomplish nothing during their entire enlistment.\nWow, how disrespectful. Some of us left due to the poor treatment of others. Serving more than a decade should rate something for serving honorably. And when I served, there was no TSP or great pay. It was suggested buying US savings bonds. And if you’re old enough, you’ll know this went away long ago. If you’re not, google it. Don’t show disrespect because some of us decided it was time to leave without retiring. Serving IS serving. How dare you.\nOr you had the opportunity to be looked down upon when you needed to go to sick call so you didn’t because every other person was labeled a POS when they went to sick call so nothing is in your record and cant be proved service connected.\nSo what this should be clearly conveying is For Retired Veterans and Disabled Veterans Only.\nAll other Veterans need not apply.\nAnd Yes, an Honorably Discharged Veteran, regardless of anything, is a Veteran.\nGood answer, Mark. I served for about eight years and left with a 10% disability (hearing loss). I’m “in the system” and get a small check each month. I also get free hearing aids and meds with a very small copay.\nNot to mention learing a trade in the eight years.\nNot a perfect system, but it works.\nNope, serving 20 yrs does not elevate you to any special status although I think you want to believe that. When one raises their hand, swears in , and signs the contract then you are serving for what ever purpose that may be required by the country at that time. Good for you that you served 20 but just because someone did 3, 4, or 6 or whatever time does not make them any less and I think not having exchange privilege is not a “consequence”. Cmon man, here in PR they give civilian employees access to purchase. Bullshit if you ask me.\nWow what self righteous prick you are. We still served and recieved and honorable discharge. I served during combat just wasn’t injured. Screw you.\nWow!!! never mind circumstances that may have precluded these veterans from serving 20 years you know like the death of a spouse and being left a single parent , or from fortunately not having a service connected disability. Your response is a little short cited…\nTrue, I am grateful for the healthcare benefits that I am allotted. I served a bit over 6 years, and am astounded I am given the healthcare. Thank you for those who served until retirement! I love seeing that there are benefits given to those who suffered injuries, served in conflict or were taken prisoner. I appreciate them and it made my day knowing they get a little extra today.\nMark, you are a serious piece of work. Your comments are absolutely amazing. Someone should give you a Jr. G man badge or at a minimum put you on a recruitment billboard. Keep up the good work providing valuable feedback…..\nWell aren’t we special…you’re telling me if you serve in the military during armed conflict…you’re not a real veteran unless you serve 20 years…that really sux ! l went in 1962 (active 4 years 2mo.: 2yrs 2mo at sea). So l shouldn’t be considered a”real” veteran. l was told that if l served my country l would have full VA BENEFITS when l completed my service… only to have a 2007 law passed (by a lot of people that weren’t alive in 1962) to take away what l was promised by my country ( how about “ex post facto”? ). When l went in you didn’t get to choose your duty- you went where you were told and did what you were told to do… ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DIED ON MY SHIP WERE NOT REAL VETERANS because they were in the wrong theater at the time….there’s something wrong about that…\nYou want the fruits of labor while only providing minimal labor? The vast majority of retirees have between 20 to 40 years of service and have thus earned this benefit while providing virtually all of the labor. Undoubtedly a very easy concept to understand, even for civilians.\nYes, it’s about time. I’ve always been thinking about this ever since we were given the privilege to order online. I have a VA Health Ins Card & currently have no disability. Am I eligible to go on base to shop? I feel every VETERAN should have this privilege. Thank you!\nKathleen, if you are a Purple Heart recipient, a former prisoner of war, or have a service-connected disability rating between 0 percent and 90 percent, then you would be eligible for in-person shopping privileges. If you do not meet any of these eligibility criteria, then you are not eligible for in-person shopping privileges.\nIf you are already enrolled with the VA medical and have the old VHIC card, will the VA automatically send the new one?\nSame with me. My old card shows Service Connected and Purple Heart. Will that bw sufficient for access or do I need to get a new one? Thanks in advance for responding.\nMichael, as long as your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card, you should be good to go.\nYes.\nQuestion: Does your “old card” state that it is a Veterans Identification Card (VIC)? If so, you need to get an updated card. In 2014, the Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) was issued to replace the VIC. Be very aware that this guidance only allows access for veterans with a VHIC. Therefore, if your card does not resemble the sample above, then you will need to contact the VA to receive a new VHIC.\nI’d stop by your local VA and get a new card, the government is not quite known for its efficiency.\nJeez you don’t have to treat him like he got a DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE!\nThe new IDs came out several years ago. If you still have an old one you need to go to your VA health center and get a new one.\nJohn, if you are a Purple Heart recipient, a former prisoner of war, or have a service-connected disability rating between 0 percent an d90 percent AND your current VHIC displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card, you should be good to go. If it does not, you will need to contact VA to get a new one.\nIts nice to see so many people on here were retired for being illiterate.\nlol..so true. I’m reading all these questions and I’m like, “C’mon, really?!”\nI’m reading many of these just shaking my head……..they don’t read, they can’t seem to research, they sure as hell can’t write a proper sentence. they don’t even realize that they are asking certain questions that should be answered directly by the VA, not on here.\nI thought I was alone in that regard. Thank goodness someone else knows how to read and comprehend written language. LoL\nDarth Vader and AH-S: Its not very nice to degrade people and call them illiterate. Especially veterans!. Who do you think you are? This is why some veterans probably don’t get the help they need because people like you are working in places that can deny them benefits. What the hell is wrong with you!\nnyuk nyuk good one\nNot cool man. Some people on here are extremely old. Some are former POWs dealing with mental issues that might hinder their abilities to spell correctly or articulate their questions.\nI was wondering will I be able to use my card to gain access to the gyms on Fort Knox\nYes\nHow about the gold vaults ?\nAre you sure about that? I understood that these folks would be allowed to use all patron funded MWR activities. The base gyms are all appropriated funded. Are they actually going to allow potentially thousands of people into base gyms every week that are all ready pretty crowded as it is. I would think that the active duty folks would be pretty upset if they could not use the gym due to over crowding.\nJim, MWR fitness centers and gyms on the installations will not be accessible for the new categories of veterans and caregivers.\nI just viewed the the presentation from Ft. Belvoir. They mentioned several times that gyms are “mission-essential” facilities and are not available to VHIC card holders.\nNo.\nMike, MWR fitness centers and gyms on the installations will not be accessible for the new categories of veterans and caregivers.\nI have a VHIC, does my wife have to do anything for access to go with me?\nYes, she has to accompany you.\nlol.\nMichael, your VHIC needs to display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card. Not everyone with a VHIC will be authorized access to these benefits. If you meet the criteria, your wife will be allowed to accompany you. You will have to stop at the visitor control center so that she can undergo the routine security check, so she will need to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport with her. On the installation, she must stay with you. And she cannot make any purchases.\nCorrection to my last. AHIC Service Connected card is in my wallet ready to show at the gate.\nThank you VA and President TRUMP. I have my VAIC card in my wallet ready to show. I will now be able to shop at the 29 Palms Marine Base which is only 4 miles from my house. In the past I’ve ordered from AAFEES on line; however, now I will actually see, feel, inspect the item prior to my purchase, not worried about having to return for a refund. Again Thank you VA and President TRUMP.\nYou should thank the following representatives who introduced the bill which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services: Mr. Lipinski (for himself, Mr. Jones, Ms. Bordallo, Mr. Bost, Ms. Brownley of California, Mr. Capuano, Ms. Clarke of New York, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Correa, Mrs. Davis of California, Mr. DeFazio, Ms. Barragán, Mrs. Dingell, Mr. Donovan, Mr. Fortenberry, Mr. Gaetz, Mr. Gallego, Mr. Gonzalez of Texas, Mr. Grijalva, Ms. Norton, Ms. Jackson Lee, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Ms. Kaptur, Mr. Kilmer, Mr. Kinzinger, Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire, Mr. Lynch, Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, Mr. McGovern, Mr. Moolenaar, Mr. Moulton, Mr. Neal, Mr. Norman, Mr. O’Halleran, Mr. Payne, Mr. Peterson, Ms. Pingree, Mr. Poliquin, Mr. Raskin, Mrs. Radewagen, Ms. Rosen, Mr. Rush, Mr. Ryan of Ohio, Mr. Scott of Virginia, Ms. Shea-Porter, Ms. Sinema, Mr. Suozzi, Mr. Soto, Mr. Thompson of California, Mr. Vela, Ms. Velázquez, Mrs. Watson Coleman, and Ms. Wilson of Florida).\nThe process for this benefit started before #45 came into office. Thanks goes to President Obama.\nHad nothing to di with Trump. This was in place before he became president.\nTrump had nothing to do with this.\nThe prices in these facilities are not cheaper than your local retailers so please do not confuse the public. I have compared prices this past year with the same brand articles and groceries, In Germany, you have to pay a certain amount of custom tax added together with your so-called non-taxable items from the Military establishments.\nYou should be thanking Sen. Jon Tester (Dem.) who drafted this act. He has been a veteran advocate for years and relentless in the pursuit of expanding veteran benefits.\nThere are a different set of rules in Germany so check with your customs office and Post coordinators first.\nIt depends where you are in the country. In Hawaii, the prices on most grocery items are much cheaper. Meat and local products, not so much. It is a huge blessing on the budget for us.\nIf you don’t want it to be recurrent accessing the base. Can you just get a pass whenever you need to go to exchange or commissary. All I want to use is the service station where gas is cheaper and the commissary on a monthly basis and the exchange every so often as needed.\nFerrell, enrolling your VHIC for recurring access allows you to avoid stopping at the visitor control center every time you want to go to the gas station or the exchange, no matter how frequent it is. If you don’t want to have your VHIC enrolled, then you just need to build in extra time every trip to stop at visitor control.\nI am a Veteran with a 50% Service Connected Disability. My father is also a Veteran, but no Service Connected Disability. He does have his VHIC. Would he and my mother be allowed to accompany me into the commissary or base exchange?\nRuth, as an eligible veteran, you would be allowed to have guests accompany you onto the installation and into the facilities. The guests will have to stop at the visitor control center and go through all of the routine security checks, so they will need to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport with them. Also, your guest will have to stay with you and they cannot make any purchases. You should also know that you can only make purchases for yourself.\nAll Veterans regardless of disability should be able to use these resources. A disable veteran should be given far more privileges and respect than they get today. Think about it, a Congressman or Senator (even the ones who have never served in the military) gets their full retirement and full benefits for life after one tour in office. That my brothers and sisters is a shame!!\nI wholeheartedly agree with you on that statement about all Veterans should be able to use these resources and would go even further by saying our representatives should not get free health care for life after they leave office. They can apply for VA health care just like we do if they want it for free or pay out of pocket.\nA little off-topic, but you are completely wrong about senators and representatives’ retirement and benefits. It is easy to look up on any authoritative reference.\nIt says that The card must display the Veteran’s eligibility status (i.e., PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED). So is this exclusive only for disabled veterans purple heart and former POW? Or is this for all veterans disabled or not?\nYes, only the disabled veterans, POW, or purple heart are included in this new benefit\nLowell, the new veteran categories eligible for this new benefit are specifically Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, and veterans with a service-connected disability rating between 0%-90%.\nYour right it should be open to ALL honorably discharged veterans. From what I have heard and understand is that civilian employees of the DoD are allowed to use the commissaries.\nChris, you are mistaken. DoD civilians are not allowed to use commissary stores unless they are assigned to military installations overseas in foreign countries, accompanying the force. And 19 million additional veteran shoppers would certainly overwhelm the DoD resale facilities, which are sized to support the military mission.\nagree\nMathew,\nCongressman / Senators, do not automatically get retirement and healthcare for life even after just one term as you stated. This has been a false rumor that is spread by those that are upset and not in the know. I am not trying to start an argument just setting the record straight.\nRETIREMENT:\nA report on “Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress,” prepared in November by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, outlines how pension benefits are calculated.\nThe key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)\nTo collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.\nUnder the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member’s salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years.\nHere’s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year. The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,250 per year.\nA three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That’s generous, but not close to full pay.\nFederal law prevents members of Congress from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, “By law, the starting amount of a member’s retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.”\nUnder the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.\nSo saying that members of Congress can “receive full pay retirement after serving one term” is blatantly bogus. It’s never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.\nWhile not as expensive as some of us pay here is the fact on their healthcare cost\nHEALTHCARE:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/25/heres-how-much-members-of-congress-pay-for-their-health-insurance.html\nYou are wrong, U.S. Congressmen have to be elected to a third term to get a pension, then it is a percent base. A U.S. Senator must complete their one term to get a pension, then it is a percent base.\nMatthew, veterans with a service-connected disability rating from 0%-90% will now be eligible for these benefits beginning January 1, 2020, along with Purple Heart recipients and former prisoners of war, so long as they have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card.\nmilitary disabled\ndo we have access to class 6 stores?\nYes\nAs a disabled connected disability are we allowed access to the class six store ?\nNo access to the Class Six Store or to military uniforms is included in this new benefit.\n[Editor: DoD confirmed that Class VI IS included.]\nRichard, the class six store will be accessible to the new categories of eligible veterans and caregivers.\nAs a veteran, can I bring a civilian on base with me and have access to everything I have, as long as that person is with me.\nThis privilege is for the veteran not your neighbor or bar drinking buddy.\nSammie, if you meet one of the new veteran qualifications, you may bring a guest with you to an installation and into the authorized facilities. They will have to stop at the visitor control center and go through the routine security checks, so they will need to have an acceptable credential with them, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. They will have to stay with you throughout your visit and can accompany you into the facilities, but they cannot make any purchases.\nwill my spouse be able to accompany me into the commissary and exchange or will she need to get some type of pass?\nMichael, yes, your wife may accompany you as your guest. She will have to stop at the visitor control center and go through the routine security checks, so she will need to have an acceptable credential with her, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. She will have to stay with you throughout your visit and can accompany you into the facilities, but she cannot make any purchases.\nCan I bring my wife and kids when I visit the px or commissary?\nManuel, yes, your wife and kids may accompany you as your guests. They will have to stop at the visitor control center and go through the routine security checks, so they will need to each have an acceptable credential if they’re 18 or older, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. They will have to stay with you throughout your visit and can accompany you into the facilities, but they cannot make any purchases.\nI have read through this article and others, as well DOD statements and such. My only question is can my wife accompany me to the commissary. I would make the purchases and be driving, but can she join me as a guest? Aside from that very excited about this expansion of benefits. It’s about time.\nYes\nChris, yes, your wife may accompany you as your guest. She will have to stop at the visitor control center and go through the routine security checks, so she will need to have an acceptable credential with her, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. She will have to stay with you throughout your visit and can accompany you into the facilities, but she cannot make any purchases.\nI have what I’m guessing is an older card. It has a more stylish flag image on the left, with my picture, my printed name and service connected on the front. The barcode is on the right side of my picture and the magnetic strip on the back. But if there was an ID number on it it has rubbed off. Am I correct in assuming that I will need to figure out how to get this replaced before I can access the bases?\nYes. You can get one at your VA health center. Go to the eligibility office and tell them you need an ID.\nRonald, what you are describing sounds exactly like what DoD is requiring for access. You shouldn’t have to get it replaced.\nI’m sorry I meant I am a recently widowed survivor of a Viet Nam vet that died of service related injuries. Am I eligible for this benefit?\nYes\nI called China Lake MWR and was told I can not get a card. Although he passed of service related injuries he was only at time of passing 90%. Is there anyone that can direct me to someone that’s either in the know or….. Thank you.\nShery, I am very sorry for you loss. This new benefit is only for the eligible veteran or eligible caregiver and it doesn’t begin until January 1. It is not for family members and it is not transferrable.\nBrian, this benefit does not extend to family members or survivors of the new veteran and caregiver categories.\nNo, you are not eligible.\nShery, this benefit does not extend to family members. You are not eligible.\nMy husband has a disability but it isn’t listed on his VHIC card. We were told that he doesn’t need a new card yet your eligibility information states that the disability needs to be listed on the VHIC card. 1- does he need a new card stating his disability. 2- If so what do we need to do?\nWould like to know the answer to this question…\nIt doesn’t have to state his disability. It just has to state Service Connected.\nThe disability type doesn’t need to be listed on the VHIC card. All it needs to say is “Service Connected “.\nNo new card is needed. All it can show is “Service Connected”\nJoAnn, a veteran’s disability should not be listed on the VHIC. While it is true that your husband does not need a new VHIC to access his medical appointments through the VA, if he wants to take advantage of these new DoD privileges, then he will need to have a VHIC that states “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under his photo on the front of the card. This is the only way that DoD will be able to quickly verify his identity and eligibility, since not everyone who receives a VHIC is eligible for these privileges.\nSo true i left a full grocery cart in the exchange last week simply couldnt afford the groceries and it seem the prices hacked up on everything they giving access to get the money back the va is giving vets.\nSo why did you fill the cart up and leave it? I am sure you would have looked at the pries as you went through the store.\nSoooo survivors or Veterans that have died of service related injuries do not qualify?!\nThis service isnt designed for the families benefit. Its for the service member. Once your service member passes away you have no business being on any military instill\nation.\nShery, that is correct. This benefit is for the qualifying veteran or caregiver only, not their family members. And a caregiver will lose their eligibility when they are no longer providing care for an eligible veteran.\nEligibility requirements state that VHIC must show the eligibility reason (SERVICE CONNECTED, PURPLE HEART, or ?). My current VHIC does not have my eligibility reason (SERVICE CONNECTED). What is the process to obtain a new VHIC with the designation?\nI was issued my first ID card before I received my dis. Rating. Later, I just went to the VA hospital. I go to, had them look me up, and they issued, mailed, me a new card. No big deal.\nMy question too. I am at 20% disabled now for Gulf War Syndrome, and failing pretty quick. I expect to be up to 30% in another six months, ans things continue to go South. I have the ‘card,’ but I was issued it BEFORE the GWS hit; what do I need to do to get a NEW one to refelct that ‘change of status?’\nYour card doesn’t have the percentage on it. It will just say “service- connected”. If it doesn’t say that and you have a rating then go to your VA medical and get a new card.\nI made it is unemployability made it a hundred percent receive all the hundred percent considered 100% disabled militarily. Also federally disabled. So what do I need to get in the base do I still need to get the special card\nYes\nGo to the base I.D. Card building with your va paperwork and get a DOD ID card.\nCompensated at the hundred percent rate considered as unemployable by the military therefore compensated at that rate. I am eligible for everything at 100% Medical Dental at all including my disability pay. An employee ability level which is equal to the hundred percent disability level isn’t mentioned how do I go about getting that card or access to the base based on that and what would I need to show them\nTake your award letter to the base, get in and then go to the commissary and show them the same paper. At 100% you are automatically qualified. You have everything all of us vets want. But you still can work part time. Read your award letter or check with your service rep or attorney.\nCheck again, if 100% Disabled Veterans can work, they can have their disability rerated to a lower percentage. Veterans have been rerated for volunteering at the VA Hospital. I had considered volunteering at one time, but after another PTSD Episode and agoraphobia kicking back in I cannot even leave my house without drugs.\nYou should have already been going on base and free Space A flights. Don’t you have your Dept of Defense tan ID card, form 2765 ? Please don’t ask, what am I talking about? If you don’t know, I have no more answers. I can’t believe the questions on this blog.\nYou’re already eligible.\nI have the VHIC: Can my wife accompany me to (for example) an Army/Air Force Commissary and Exchange or will I be the only one permitted to enter?\nI doubt it. I am a contractor on base and already have a VHIC card and I cannot escort anyone on base at all.\nThis doesn’t take effect until Jan 2020.\nYou can bring a guest but they must stay with you.\nAlan, if your VHIC displays “PURPLE HEART,” FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you are eligible for access to these benefits and your wife may accompany you as your guest. She will have to stop at the visitor control center and go through the routine security checks, so she will need to have an acceptable credential with her, like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. She will have to stay with you throughout your visit and can accompany you into the facilities, but she cannot make any purchases.\nHello, does this also give us the ability to use the base ticket office? It says MWR, but I am not sure if that means I can get the reduced tickets to Disneyland, etc also with this. Thank you in advance.\nI would check once you have access.\nYes. You can take advantage of everything you used to on base. Minus purchasing uniform items and the daycare.\nAlex, you are mistaken. Not all of the morale, welfare, and recreation activities are going to be available to the new categories of veterans and caregivers. For sure, the revenue-generating activities will be available, like golf, bowling, marinas, entertainment, restaurants, equipment check-out, RV parks, recreational lodging, resorts, etc. DoD is still working on the policy for other MWR activities, so it would be best to check with the base once you get access.\nMWR is a military acronym that stands for Morale, Welfare and Recreation. The term is given to a complete range of community support and quality of life programs for members of the Armed Forces, their families, and retirees at more than 2,000 facilities on U.S. military bases throughout the world.\nIf this is addressed elsewhere, apologies. How about access to Fam Camps (on-base RV parks)? I’m service-connected and live in an RV. Used to be only retirees had access to these campgrounds? Is that now part of MWR to which I now have access as a 4-year (not retiree) vet? Thanks for clarifying.\nGene, access to military RV parks is an authorized revenue-generating MWR activity. Eligible veterans may begin making reservations starting January 1.\nJustin, I would follow John’s advice and check once you have access. Even though you have to pay for the tickets, the base ticket offices are not “revenue-generating” MWR activities, so you may not have access. DoD is still working on the policy for MWR activities that are not revenue-generating. You should also know that not everyone who is authorized to use the base ticket office is allowed to purchase or use every ticket they sell. Sometimes the vendors put restrictions on the tickets.\nVery thankful for this\nWhat good is it if the VA has taken away (disappeared) my service connected disability?\nDo u have to be 100% disability to be eligible\nnegative, any service connected veteran with a rating above 0% is eligible. Though you must have the VHIC reflecting the status. Hope this helps!\nDoes my spouse get expanded access priveliges with my credentials.\nMarvin, these new privileges are only for the new categories of veterans and caregivers. They do not extend to family members. That said, spouses may accompany eligible veterans and caregivers as guests onto the installation and into the facilities. As a guest, they will have to stop at the visitor control center and undergo the routine security check, so they need to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport with them. Also, they must stay with the sponsoring veteran or caregiver at all times and they cannot make any purchases of their own.\nRead the John S. McCain Defense Authorization Bill of 2018. It states all service connected disability 0-99 will have this benefit from 1 January 2020. You need to use your VA Healthcare that indicates service connected, purple heart, Medal of Honor, etc. It allows shopping on base in the exchange (formerly known as BX or PX), the commissary, and use of MWR facilities on a space available basis. Every veteran should review bills and laws passed to see if it affects them or not. It is all on line. The simple answer is no you do not have to be 100 percent to shop on base.\nJeff, please allow me to correct a few of the details you’ve tried to share. This authorization came from the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018, located in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The Act doesn’t tell you what identification is needed. DoD and VA have been working on the implementation details and DoD has agreed to accept the Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card for installation and privilege access for the newly eligible categories of veterans. Military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, and 100% disabled veterans already have privileges (and DoD ID cards). So this act really only applies to Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings between 0%-90% (disability ratings are 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100). It also includes individuals assessed, approved, and designated as primary family caregivers of eligible veterans under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. The eligible caregivers will be sent an eligibility letter from the Office of Community Care, which they will use for access. Morale, welfare, and recreation access is not on a space available basis, but it is limited to the revenue-generating activities like golf, bowling, entertainment, RV parks, recreational lodging and resorts, marinas, etc.\nDoes a 10% disability qualify me for access to commissary & PX?\nIf you have a service connected disability even a 0%,just bring your award letter to a nearby VA hospital or health clinic that issues chic. You will then be qualified.\nLeon, yes, a 10% service-connected disability rating meets the eligibility requirement for to access installations and these new privileges. But you must have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card to gain access.\nNo. “Service connected”\nAs shown on your VA ID\nNo. 0-100% Service Connected.\nDaniel, this is a new benefit for certain categories of veterans and caregivers who do not already have benefits (like military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, and veterans with 100% service-connected disabilities). The new categories of eligible veterans are Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, and veterans with service-connected disability ratings between 0%-90%. These newly eligible veterans must have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays one of the three categories on the front (PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW, or SERVICE CONNECTED) below the photo. Newly eligible caregivers are individuals assessed, approved, and designated as the primary family caregiver of an eligible veteran under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. These newly eligible caregivers will receive an eligibility letter from the Office of Community Care.\nVeterans who read this can you please help Disabled Veterans who is 100 percent service connected needs a Dentist know how to G4 implants so please email your Senators or Representative contract Veteran Affairs Committee passed a new Veteran Benefit Law for free because they don’t have one work at a Veteran Medical Centers or have a contract with Veteran Administration if a Disabled Veterans who is 100 percent service connected doesn’t get the G4 implants it would really bad Health Problems plus it would cause really bad Gums Disease also it may cause Cancer…..Semper Fi\nmy husband received implants at VA medical center dentist\nMore focus on better, privlaged, low prices, both in commissary & BX, would help soldiers active an retired. Military must not put pay raises on the backs of Retired personal, which has been done by Clinton administration. It is time to correct the pay tables. Making soldiers all equal in pay ,for rank. Retired must no longer be penalized. Bring back equal reconstruction in pay !\nNot at all. You can either access an installation with your Retiree ID or with the VHIC ID now. Basically this gives access to a wider range of veterans who might not have retired.\nI am medically retired. Have a Blue DOD retirees identification card as my wife has a dependents card.\nI have a current V.A. Photo I’D. Do I need to worry about this new program??\nNo need to worry. Blue or Red DD Form 2 (Retired/Reserve/National Guard) Identification Card holders are already entitled to these benefits and more. Veterans with a VA service connected disability rating from 0-90%, Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, and caregivers are affected by this new benefit. Meaning those who left the military with absolutely no medical or longevity based on 20+ years of service (and in some cases 15+ years) retirement.\nJerome, nothing changes for military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, or 100% disabled veterans. You are all still eligible for DoD ID cards and the same benefits you’ve always had. The Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 has extended access to some new categories of veterans and caregivers. These new categories of veterans and caregivers will not be eligible to obtain a DoD ID card, so this article is telling them what DoD will accept to allow them onto installations and into the retail facilities to shop.\nAre these benefits also extended to the bases here in Germany?\nAccording to what I have heard, it will be implemented, but this is still being worked on through USAREUR, USAFE, USNAVEUR, et al. It is still going to be contingent upon Status of Forces Agreements etc for the different countries. As I understand it, in Germany we will have to get the “pink card” from the German Zollamt to pay the VAT taxes (19% I believe).\nGood question. I’m wondering the same thing. I’m looking to move back to Germany within the coming months (civilian side), and unless I have a job on base, I won’t have access, which will make GETTING a job on base more difficult, in the least.\nThx!\nQ: Will commissary, exchange and morale, welfare and recreation retail privileges be available at overseas\ninstallations?\nA: Although new patrons eligible solely under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018, will have in-store commissary, military exchange and MWR retail privileges in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions, such access is not guaranteed at installations in foreign countries. Status of forces agreements and other host nation and international laws and agreements may limit or prevent access in foreign countries.\nSheldon and Kriss, U.S. law only applies in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions. Access at overseas installations in foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international law, and other agreements with the host countries, so you will need to check with the installation(s) you’re thinking about visiting.\nJust read, the eligibility requirement is in black and white.\nHow is this different from a regular retiree’s MID card?\nMy question as well. Retired 2 years ago and been using my blue ID for everything. I have not been denied access to anything. As a matter of fact, I’ve been issued an access card to access the gym after hours.\nNot really clear on the need for another ID. The only benefit I see is access to your medical information; if that’s truly a benefit of the card.\nIt’s just making more people eligible to go on base. If you’re already qualified nothing changes for you.\nSharon and Wendy, nothing changes for military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, or 100% disabled veterans. You are all still eligible for DoD ID cards and the same benefits you’ve always had, which actually allows you broader access than this Act. The Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 has extended access to some new categories of veterans and caregivers. These new categories of veterans and caregivers will not be eligible to obtain a DoD ID card, so this article is telling them what DoD will accept to allow them onto installations and into the retail facilities to shop.\nUnless something changed in a week, only Vets with Service Connected disabilities are eligible. They should put that in bold print in this article.\nThe qualifications are clearly stated.\nI am service connected 20%. Do I qualify.\nYes. 0-10-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90% service connected disability ratings are eligible for this new benefit.\nthis is awesome and long overdue. Been told for years had to be 100%. I’m at 60% and 100 with asthma would darn near be, if not actually dead. I have had a VA card for years, fortunately I work on a base so have access and went with friends (current or retired military) if I really needed something and on occasion the PX would let me purchase something with my CAC card. But this will now be awesome to be independently able to go and purchase what I need when I need it. Again awesome….\nJohn, yes, a 20% service-connected disability rating meets the eligibility requirement for to access installations and these new privileges. But you must have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card to gain access.\nI don’t have a disability but was still able to sign up to use the NEX online. 7yrs honorable discharge. Better then nothing I guess.\nI read that the veteran can have a 0% disability as well\nDoes the 0% disability have to be stated on the card?\nthey will not put your percentage rating on your card. it will say service connected, or not\nyour percentage is your business and no one else’s By the way you can be service connected\nand still have O% rating. it’s called government math. you can be 100% and only get paid for 50% it’s the VA way of keeping more of the money. it’s a full time job fighting them for what some have rightfully earned.\nthe amount of disability is never posted on a card period. It would be a HIPPA violation\nErnest, if you have a service-connected disability rating, it only needs to say “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of your Veteran Health Identification Card. It doesn’t need to show the percentage number.\nBryan, you’re not 100% correct. New categories of veterans include Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, and veterans with service-connected disability ratings between 0%-90%. Individuals assessed, approved, and designated as Primary Family Caregivers of veterans under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers are also eligible beginning January 1. Primary Family Caregivers will receive a letter indicating their eligibility from the Office of Community Care. Veterans who wish to take advantage of this new benefit will need to have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card.\nI send my paper 2 Gear back .i wang to now of i cualified for en benefit for VA. Sauth i hace to do. Thank.\nA donde mandastes eso. Esto es para ir al los PX y a la comisaria. Sólo con ID del hospital de Veteranos\nSeriously?\nLOL\nI’m a retired Marine and have a valid ID card, am I still required to have this VA card?\nNo! Since your retired military, you already have access.\nI am glad this is out there. My understanding is this is for qualified veterans, and not just retirees with those qualifications. So that is for all the answers. Qualified veterans thus is new for us. Retirees already get these benefits. Our numbers are good for these uses and help justify the numbers of dollars spent to provide these services. That’s what is the mutually beneficial part that helps drive the affirmative decision to do it. Not to take from retirees but to bolster the programs because the numbers are fairly often low uses. My opinion only.\nThank you for your service This may not solve your wishes, but definitely is recognized by me in your sacrifices. May God Bless You today and always ❤️\nEarl, nothing changes for military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, or 100% disabled veterans. You are all still eligible for DoD ID cards and the same benefits you’ve always had. The Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 has extended access to some new categories of veterans and caregivers. These new categories of veterans and caregivers will not be eligible to obtain a DoD ID card, so this article is telling them what DoD will accept to allow them onto installations and into the retail facilities to shop.\nThese benefits can have pro’s and con’s…. depending where you live. I live in Texas, and the nearest base to me is in Fort Worth. It wouldn’t be worth the hassle to drive X number of miles to save a couple of dollars. I hope the base exchange can start price matching with other competitors such as Target, Walmart. I recall some items at the commissary being more expensive than your local grocery store. Either way, this benefit was way overdue.\nNo! Since your retired military, you already have access.\nBase exchanges do price match with actual stores. You can also shop the exchanges online.\nHi Daniel, thank you for your service. The Exchange does price match in stores and online. ShopMyExchange.com will match a lower price (including shipping and handling) on any identical stock assortment item currently available for sale from competitor’s Internet site (marketplace and third-party sellers excluded). “Identical” is defined as same brand, same manufacturer and same model number.\nThat’s Great\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Tribute by Meghan McCain\n“The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for, and I hate very much to leave it.” When Ernest Hemingway’s Robert Jordan, at the close For Whom the Bell Tolls lies wounded, waiting for his last fight, these are among his final thoughts. My father had every reason to think the world was an awful place. my father had every reason to think the world was not worth fighting for. My father had every reason to think the world was worth leaving. He did not think any of those things. Like the hero of his favorite book, John McCain took the opposite view: You had to have a lot of luck to have had such a good life.\nI am here before you today saying the words I have never wanted to say giving the speech I have never wanted to give. Feeling the loss I have never wanted to feel. My father is gone, John Sidney McCain III was many things. He was a sailor, he was an aviator, he was a husband, he was a warrior, he was a prisoner, he was a hero, he was a congressman, he was a senator, he was nominee for President of the United States. These are all of the titles and roles of a life that’s been well lived. They’re not the greatest of his titles nor the most important of his roles.\nHe was a great man. We gather to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice, those that live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\nHe was a great fire who burned bright. In the past few days, my family and I have heard from so many of those Americans who stood in the warmth and light of his fire and found it illuminated what’s best about them. We are grateful to them because they’re grateful to him. A few have resented that fire for the light it cast upon them for the truth it revealed about their character, but my father never cared what they thought and even that small number still have the opportunity as long as they draw breath to live up to the example of John McCain.\nMy father was a great man. He was a great warrior. He was a great American. I admired him for all of these things. but I love him because he was a great father. My father knew what it was like to grow up in the shadow of greatness, he did just as his father had done before him. He was the son of a great admiral who was also the son of a great admiral. When it came time for the third John Sidney McCain to be a man, he had no choice but to walk in the same path. He had to become a sailor. He had to go to war. He had to have his shot at becoming a great admiral as they also had done. The past of his father and grandfather led my father to the Hanoi Hilton. This is where all of the biography, campaign literature say he showed his character, his patriotism, his faith, his endurance in the worst of possible circumstances. This is where we learned who John McCain truly was. And all is very true except for the last part.\nToday I want to share with you where I found out who John McCain truly was and wasn’t in the Hilton. It wasn’t in the cockpit of a fast and lethal fighter jet or on the campaign trail. John McCain was in all those places, but the best of him was somewhere else, the best of John McCain, the greatest of his titles and the most important of his roles was as a father.\nImagine the warrior the night of the skies gently carrying his little girl to bed. Imagine the dashing aviator who took his aircraft, hurdling off pitching decks in the South China Seas, kissing the hurt when I fell and skinned my knee. Imagine the distinguished states man who counseled presidents singing with his girl in oak creek during a rainstorm to singing in the rain. Imagine the senator fierce conscience of the nation’s best self taking his 14-year-old daughter out of school because he believed I would learn more about America at the town halls he held across the country. Imagine the loyal veteran with his eyes shining with happiness as he gave blessing for his grown daughter’s marriage.\nYou all have to imagine that. I don’t have to because I lived it all. I know who he was. I know what defined him. I got to see it every single day of my blessed life.\nJohn McCain was not defined by prison, by the navy, by the senate, by the republican party or by any single one of the deeds in his absolutely extraordinary life. John McCain was defined by love.\nSeveral of you in the pews that crossed swords with him or found yourselves on the receiving end of his famous temper or were at a cross purpose to him on anything, are doing your best to stay stone faced. Don’t. You know full well if John McCain were in your shoes today, he would be using some salty word while my mother jabbed him in the arm in embarrassment. He would look back at her and grumble, maybe stop talking, but he would keep grinning. She was the only one who could do that.\nOn their first date when he still did not know what sort of woman he was, he recited a poem called The Cremation of Sam McGee about an Alaskan prospector who welcomed his cremation as the only way to get warm in the icy north. “Strange things done in the midnight sun. The arctic trails have secret tales that would make your blood run cold.” He learned it in Hanoi. A prisoner rapped it out in code over and over during years of captivity. My father knew if she would sit through that, appreciate the dark humor that had seen him through so many years of imprisonment, she might sit through a lifetime with him as well, and she did.\nJohn McCain was defined by love. This love of my father for my mother was the most fierce and lasting of them all, mom. Let me tell you what love meant to John McCain and to me.\nAs much as he comforts, he was endlessly present for us, and though we did not always understand it, he was always teaching. he didn’t expect us to be like him. His worldly achievement was to be better than him. Armed with his wisdom, informed by his experiences, long before we were old enough to assemble our own. As a girl I didn’t appreciate what I most fully appreciate now; how he suffered and how he bore it with a stoic silence that was once the mark of an American man. I came to appreciate it first when he demanded it of me. I was a small girl, thrown from a horse and crying from a busted collarbone. My dad picked me up. He took me to the doctor, he got me all fixed up. Then he immediately took me back home and made me get back on the same horse. I was furious at him as a child, but how I love him for it now.\nMy father knew pain and suffering with an intimacy and immediacy most of us are blessed never to have endured. He was shot down, he was crippled, he was beaten, starved, tortured and humiliated. That pain never left him. The cruelty of his communist captors ensured he would never raise his arms above his head for the rest of his life, yet he survived, yet he endured. Yet he triumphed. And there was this man who had been through all that with a little girl that didn’t want to get back on her horse.\nHe could have sat me down and told me that and made me feel small because my complaint and fear was nothing next to his pain and memory. Instead, he made me feel loved, said in his quiet voice that spoke with authority and meant you had best obey. “Get back on the horse.” I did. And because I was a little girl, I resented it. Now that I am a woman, I look back across that time and see the expression on his face when I climbed back up and rode again, and see the pride and love in his eyes as he said “Nothing is going to break you.”\nFor the rest of my life, whenever I fall down, I get back up. Whenever I am hurt, I drive on. Whenever I am brought low, I rise. That is not because I am virtuous, strong, resilient, it is simply because my father, John McCain, was.\nWhen my father got sick, when I asked him what he wanted me to do with this eulogy, he said “Show them how tough you are.” that is what love meant to John McCain.\nLove for my father also meant caring for the nation entrusted to him. My father, the true son of his father and grandfather was born into the character of American greatness, was convinced of the need to defend it with ferocity and faith. John McCain was born in a distant now vanquished outpost of American power, and he understood America as a sacred trust. He understood our republic demands responsibilities, even before it defends its rights. He knew navigating the line between good and evil was often difficult but always simple. He grasped that our purpose and meaning was rooted in a missionary responsibility, stretching back centuries.\nJust as the first Americans looked upon a new world full of potential for a grand experiment in freedom and self confidence, so their descendants have a responsibility to defend the old world from its worst self. The America of John McCain is the America of the revolution. fighters with no stomach for the summer soldier and sunshine patriot, making the world anew with bells of America of John McCain is the America of Abraham Lincoln. Fulfilling the promise of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and suffering greatly to see it through. The America of John McCain is the America of the boys who rushed the colors in every war across three centuries, knowing in them is the life of the republic, and particularly those by their daring as Ronald Reagan said, gave up their chance as being husbands and fathers and grandfathers and gave up their chance to be revered old men. The America of John McCain is, yes, the America of Vietnam, fighting the fight, even in the most grim circumstances, even in the most distant, hostile corner of the world, standing for the life and liberty of other peoples in other lands.\nThe America of John McCain is generous and welcoming and bold. she’s resourceful, confident, secure. She meets her responsibilities. she speaks quietly because she’s strong. America does not boast because she has no need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great. That fervent faith, that proven devotion, that abiding love, that is what drove my father from the fiery skies above the Red River delta to the brink of the presidency itself.\nLove defined my father. As a young man he wondered if he would measure up to his distinguished lineage. I miss him so badly. I want to tell him that take small comfort in this. somewhere in the great beyond where the warriors go, there are two admirals of the United States meeting their much loved son, telling him he is the greatest among them.\nDad, I love you, I always have. All that I am, all that I hope, all that I dream is grounded in what you taught me. You loved me and you showed me what love must be. An ancient Greek historian wrote “The image of great men is woven into the stuff of other men’s lives.” Dad, your greatness is woven into my life, it is woven into my mother’s life, into my sister’s life, and it is woven into my brothers’ lives. It is woven into the life and liberty of the country you sacrificed so much to defend.\nDad, I know you were not perfect. We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure. You were an exception and gave us an ideal to strive for.\nLook, I know you can see this gathering in this cathedral. The nation is here to remember you. Like so many other heroes, you leave us draped in the flag you loved. You defended it, you sacrificed it, you always honored it. It is good to remember we are Americans. We don’t put our heroes on pedestals just to remember them, we raise them up because we want to emulate their virtues, this is how we honor them, this is how we will honor you.\nMy father gone. My father is gone and my sorrow is immense, but I know his life, and I know it was great because it was good. And as much as I hate to see him go, I do know how it ended. I know that on the afternoon of August 25th in front of Oak Creek in Arizona, surrounded by the family he loved so much, an old man shook off the scars of battle one last time and arose a new man to pilot one last flight up and up and up, busting clouds left and right, straight on through to the kingdom of heaven. And he slipped the earthly bonds, put out his hand, and touched the face of god.\nI love you, dad.\nTribute by Senator Joe Lieberman\nCindy McCain and the wonderful McCain family, presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama, Secretaries Kissinger and Clinton and all of the other honored guests that are here, ladies and gentlemen, becoming John McCain’s friend is one of the great blessings of my life. Being asked to pay tribute to him today is one of the great honors and for that I thank Cindy and the entire McCain family. I also want to thank them, including his mother, his brother, his sister, and seven wonderful children for the love and support you gave John throughout his life and his service, none more than in the last year of his life. You, Cindy, have been absolutely saintly and we, his friends, cannot thank you enough.\nThere’s a special satisfaction that comes from serving a cause greater than yourself. I heard John say those words hundreds of times, particularly to young people, and you all heard them a lot as well. But for him we know they were not just words in a speech, they were the creed that he lived by. The greater cause to which he devoted his life was America, not so much the country defined by its borders, but the America of our founding values, freedom, human rights, opportunity, democracy, and equal justice under law. In john’s life, he nobly served and advanced these American values and remarkably his death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what make us a great nation. Not the tribal partisanship, personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life. This week, the celebration of the life and values and patriotism of this hero I think have taken our country above all that.\nIn a way it is the last great gift that John McCain gave America and I want to suggest today that we can give a last great gift to him which is to nurture these values and take them forward into the years ahead to make America the better country John always knew it could be. I pray that we will and I ask you to do so as well.\nLet me try to pay tribute to this great man by describing and sharing stories from our friendship which began in the early 1990s as part of a bipartisan group pushing our government to stop the aggression and slaughter in Bosnia. Then we began to collaborate on a lot of bipartisan legislation. But really our friendship deepened in our travels together around the world with amigo Lindsey Graham.\nWhen you traveled with John, even with Lindsey along, the purpose was not to have fun. In fact, sometimes it seemed the purpose was just to survive the schedule he had organized. John traveled to get the most out of every day he possibly could and he did. And so did we who were privileged to know him. John traveled to learn so he could be a better senator. He traveled to represent America as best he could wherever we went, and he did. He traveled to support the men and women of our armed services, whether in war or at pace, wherever they were, and they in turn welcomed him in not just respect but awe as the hero John McCain was, is, and always will be.\nIn shared experiences in long conversations on these trips, John and I got to know and trust each other as friends in a way that doesn’t happen because it can happen much any more in the frenetic Washington life of senators. Our friendship taught me many things, including I must add some jokes that I otherwise never would have known. John loved to laugh and make others laugh.\nWhen he found a joke that people liked, he told it over and over and over again. One of my favorites was about the two inmates going through the food line for dinner at the state penitentiary. One says to the other “The food is terrible here” and the other says “It was a lot better when I was governor.” Yeah, I heard that one often and I laughed every time because John laughed so hard every time he told it.\nThe range of john’s mind’s interest and experience was impressive and often surprising. You couldn’t characterize this man. He loved to read history and fiction and talk about it, argue about it. He had a pervasive curiosity about everything in life. He loved the outdoors and all of god’s creatures, large and small, who lived there. Most people would be surprised by how much pleasure this combative senator got from watching the hummingbirds at the McCain home outside Sedona, Arizona.\nBut of course John’s great strength was his character. He was honest, fair, and civilized. In all the times we were together, I never heard him say a bigoted word about anyone.\nThe American people saw this great quality most clearly during the 2000 campaign when the woman made an offensive statement against then senator Barack Obama. To me what was most impressive about John’s reaction was that it was pure reflex. It was who john was. he didn’t need to consult anyone. He immediately defended his opponent’s name and honor and thereby elevated for that moment our politics and made us a more perfect union.\nPersonally, I can tell you that was a real friend in accommodating what were to him my unusual practices as a religiously observant Jew, whether it was walking with me on a Saturday to an important meeting or turning down a popular Friday night dinner invitation at the Munich security conference we went to every year because it was too far to walk, we would stay in the hotel and have what John learned to call our shalom dinners. With John they weren’t that peaceful. John naturally in doing these wonderful acts of friendship grumbled all the way about what I was putting him through, you know. Right now I think he is probably deriving some pleasure from the fact it turned out his funeral was held on a Saturday and I had to walk to get here. I’m sure if he were here now, he would tell me that was divine justice.\nHe ultimately as he did with so much of his life turned these interfaith interferences into a truly hilarious comedy routine. It began with a solemn pronouncement by John that he was converting to Judaism. Then he explained less solemnly “I do this not because of any particularly liking for the religion, it is just that for so many years I had to go along with all of Joe’s religious nonsense, i might as well convert and get the benefits.”\nOne of his favorite targets was the sabbath elevators in Israel hotels, preprogrammed to stop at every floor. John had many virtues, but patience was not one of them. Therefore, a ride on those shabot elevators weren’t the happiest times we spent together. I say this to say in stories how full and genuine were his acceptance of my practices which were different from what he knew, but to make a larger point. I can tell you everything we did together around the world and here in Washington and across America, he showed that same acceptance, respect, curiosity about everybody’s religious observances, and about everything else about them that was different from himself and his own experiences.\nI said patience was one virtue John didn’t have. Forgiveness was a great virtue he did have. Here’s a story to make that clear. Once on a trip to Hanoi as we were touring the Hanoi Hilton, a crowd of Vietnamese college students recognized John and they began to chant wildly “McCain, McCain.” They wanted to take his pictures and have him sign autographs. When it was over, I asked him why he got such a rock star reception in Hanoi and with classic directness he said “Well, first, Joe, it is because they have been taught that I was treated a lot better here than I really was. And second, it is because of the normalization of relations between the US. and Vietnam.” Well, that was a classic McCain understatement.\nAlong with president Clinton and John Kerry, John McCain was the leader in congress in bringing about the US and Vietnam, an extraordinary act of personal forgiveness when you consider what the Vietnamese did to him during his five and a half years as a prisoner of war. After his injuries in Vietnam he could not pursue his ambitions in the navy so he turned to government service as his greater American cause.\nOf course, I didn’t know john in his youth. I don’t think he was born with the natural skills of a legislator. And yet he learned them, became a great one. He knew when to be immovable, when to negotiate and compromise to get something done. he regularly reached across party lines because he knew that was the only way to solve problems and seize opportunities for the people of our country and his state. As a result, his legislative record is extremely impressive. He also fought and lost some big battles to stop climate change, to close the gun show loophole, to broadly reform our immigration laws. But that never seemed to get him down or diminish his ardor for the next battle. He loved to win but also loved a good fight for a just cause, even if it didn’t succeed. overall, he won many more than he lost.\nAll of his big wins were achieved with bipartisan support. In 2008 when he was republican nominee for president, he had a far out idea of asking a democrat to be his running mate. Can you believe that? Let me explain it to you as he did. When he first talked to me about it I said “You know, John, I’m really honored, but I don’t see how you can do it. Even though I won my last election as an independent, I’m still a registered democrat.” And John’s response was direct and really ennobling. “That’s the point, Joe,” he said with a certain impatience. “You’re a democrat, I’m a republican. We could give our country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.”\nWhen john returned to the senate after his surgery last summer and voted against the republican health care bill, some people accused him of being disloyal to his party and the president, but that was not the case. If you listen to the speech he gave that day, you’ll know it was not the case. That speech made clear that his vote was not really against that bill but against the mindless partisanship that has taken control of both our political parties and our government and produced totally one sided responses to complicated national problems like health care. And of course he was right.\nIn his remarks last July John also spoke eloquently of our position in the world. Of America’s continuing responsibility for principal leadership in the world. It was as if he thought that might be one of his last best opportunities to move his colleagues and his country. It’s a speech worth reading, but I just want to quote one sentence. “What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and dignity and defender of the dignity of all human beings.” That in short was the McCain American policy. Moral, engaged, and strong. Again, these words were not just rhetoric for John, he acted on them, he lived them.\nin our travels around the world i can tell you he always reassured our allies and unsettled our enemies, standing for America’s best values, attacking totalitarian governments, whether in Moscow, Tehran, Pyongyang or anywhere else. If we were going to a country not entirely free, John insisted we meet with local human rights activists as well as the government.\nI will never forget that day in Myanmar during the military dictate dictatorship there, we met three men who had just been released from political prison, showed terrible signs of physical and psychological abuse, and yet they told us that they would never have survived if they had not heard in jail that the great American senator John McCain had supported their cause, read their names on the US Senate floor, and demanded their release.\nOn another occasion we visited a refugee camp for Syrians who had been forced out of their country into Turkey by the brutal aggression of Assad, the Iranians, and the Russians. We were the first members of congress to visit that camp and there was some concern about the reception we would receive. Earlier in the day, an official of the UN had been there, was booed and had shoes thrown at him. When we arrived, a large crowd of Syrian refugees had formed and they were cheering and chanting words of welcome and thanks and the two words they chanted most were John McCain.\nWhat is most remarkable about these two stories, and I could tell you many more, is how unremarkable they are. And that’s because the name John McCain based on the actions of the man John McCain had become a source of hope and inspiration for oppressed people throughout the world, as it was a source of security for allied countries that share our values.\nOne last story. One of John’s favorite cities in the world was Jerusalem and one of his favorite things to do there was to stand on the balcony with Lindsey and me of our hotel looking out at the old city and discussing all of the religious and political history that happened there over the centuries. Ao when I first told John that I had decided not to run for the senate again in 2012, he was puzzled and frankly even a little bit angry. But then the next day he called me and this is my best recollection of the conversation. He said “You know, I’ve been thinking if you go out into the private sector, you’re going to make some more money, and then you can afford to buy a second home in Jerusalem that has an extra room for me with a balcony where we can look out and that city and its history.”\nSince then when I talked to John or visited with him, he would ask me, “Joey, have you made enough money yet to buy that place in Jerusalem?” and I would answer “Not yet, Johnny, but I’m getting closer.” Now sadly fate has intervened before we could realize that dream but I am comforted by the fact that Jerusalem is not just a holy, historic city, it is also the visionary symbol of the dreams that all people share and the destiny we all desire. It is the original heavenly shining city on the hill. In that sense for many people in the life of the spirit, Jerusalem, the shining city on the hill are really heaven, and it is to that heavenly Jerusalem where I am confident the soul of John Sidney McCain III is going now. I want to imagine that there is going to be a beautiful home waiting for him there with a balcony from which he can contemplate the shining city and hopefully inspire us here on earth to conduct ourselves with just some of the patriotism, principles and courage that characterize his magnificent life of service to America and to so many noble causes greater than himself. God speed, dear friend. may angels sing you to your eternal home.\nTribute by Dr. Henry Kissinger\nOur country has had the good fortune that at times of national trial a few great personalities have emerged to remind us of our essential unity and inspire us our sustaining values. John McCain was one of those gifts of destiny.\nI met john for the first time in April, 1973 at a White House reception for prisoners returned from captivity in Vietnam. He had been much on my mind during the negotiation to end the Vietnam War, oddly also because his father, then commander in chief of the Pacific command, when briefing the president answered references to his son by saying only “I pray for him.”\nIn the McCain family national service was its own reward that did not allow for special treatment. I thought of that when his Vietnamese captors during the final phase of negotiations offered to release John so that he could return with me on the official plane that had brought me to Hanoi. Against all odds, he thanked them for the offer but refused it. When we finally met, his greeting was both self effacing and moving. “Thank you for saving my honor.” He did not tell me then or ever that he had had an opportunity to be freed years earlier but had refused, a decision for which he had to endure additional periods of isolation and hardship. nor did he ever speak of his captivity again during the near half century of close friendship.\nJohn’s focus was on creating a better future. as a senator, he supported the restoration of relations with Vietnam, helped bring it about on a bipartisan basis in the Clinton administration and became one of the advocates of reconciliation with his enemy. Honor, it is an intangible quality, not obligatory. It has no code. It reflects an inward compulsion, free of self interest. It fulfills a cause, not a personal ambition. it represents what a society lives for beyond the necessities of the moment. Love makes life possible; honor and nobility. For john it was a way of life.\nJohn returned to America divided over its presidency, divided over the war. Amidst all of the turmoil and civic unrest, divided over the best way to protect our country and over whether it should be respected for its power or its ideals. John came back from the war and declared this is a false choice. America owed it to itself to embrace both strengths and ideals in decades of congressional service, ultimately as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John was an exponent of an America strong enough to its purpose.\nBut John believed also in a compassionate America, guided by core principles for which American foreign policy must always stand. “With liberty and justice for all” is not an empty sentiment he argued, it is the foundation of our national consciousness. To John, American advantages had universal applicability. I do not believe he said that there’s an errant exception any more than there is a black exception or an Asian or Latin exception. He warned against temptation of withdrawal from the world. In this manner John McCain ‘s name became synonymous with an America that reached out to oblige the powerful to be loyal and give hope to the oppressed.\nJohn lines of all these battles for decency and freedom. He was an engaged warrior fighting for his causes with a brilliance, with courage, and with humility. John was all about hope. In a commencement speech at Ohio’s Wesleyan University John summed up the essence of his engagement of a lifetime. “No one of us, if they have character, leaves behind a wasted life.” Like most people of my age I feel a longing for what is lost and cannot be restored. If the happy and casual beauty of youth prove something better can endure and endure until our last moment on earth and that is the moment in our lives when we sacrifice for something greater than ourselves. Heroes inspire us by the matter of factness of their sacrifice and the elevation of the root vision.\nThe world will be lonelier without John McCain, his faith in America and his instinctive sense of moral duty. None of us will ever forget how even in his parting John has bestowed on us a much needed moment of unity and renewed faith in the possibilities of America. Henceforth, the country’s honor is ours to sustain.\nTribute by President George W. Bush\nCindy and the McCain Family, I am honored to be with you to offer my sympathies and to celebrate a great life. The nation joins your extraordinary family in grief and gratitude for John McCain.\nSome lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant and distinctive, it is hard to think of them stilled. A man who seldom rested is laid to rest. And his absence is tangible, like the silence after a mighty roar.\nThe thing about John’s life was the amazing sweep of it. From a tiny prison cell in Vietnam to the floor of the United States Senate. From troublemaking plebe to presidential candidate. Wherever John passed throughout the world, people immediately knew there was a leader in their midst. In one epic life was written the courage and greatness of our country.\nFor John and me, there was a personal journey – a hard-fought political history. Back in the day, he could frustrate me. (Laughter.) And I know he’d say the same thing about me. But he also made me better. In recent years, we sometimes talked of that intense period like football players remembering a big game. In the process, rivalry melted away. In the end, I got to enjoy one of life’s great gifts: the friendship of John McCain. And I will miss him.\nMoments before my last debate – ever – with Senator John Kerry in Phoenix, I was trying to gather some thoughts in the holding room. I felt a presence… opened my eyes…and six inches from my face was McCain, who yelled, “RELAX! RELAX!”\nJohn was, above all, a man with a code. He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country.\nHe was courageous – with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen.\nHe was honest, no matter whom it offended. Presidents were not spared.\nHe was honorable – always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings.\nHe loved freedom, with the passion of a man who knew its absence.\nHe respected the dignity inherent in every life – a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators.\nPerhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots. There was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy – to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places.\nOne friend from his Naval Academy days recalled how John – while a lowly plebe – reacted to seeing an upperclassman verbally abuse a steward. Against all tradition, he told the jerk to pick on someone his own size. It was a familiar refrain during his six decades of service.\nWhere did such strength of conviction come from? Perhaps from a family where honor was in the atmosphere. Or from the firsthand experience of cruelty, which left physical reminders that lasted his whole life. Or from some deep well of moral principle. Whatever the cause, it was this combination of courage and decency that defined John’s calling – and so closely paralleled the calling of his country.\nIt is this combination of courage and decency that makes the American military something new in history – an unrivaled power for good. It is this combination of courage and decency that set America on a journey into the world – to liberate death camps, to stand guard against extremism, and to work for the true peace that comes only with freedom.\nJohn felt these commitments in his bones. It is a tribute to his moral compass that dissidents and prisoners in so many places – from Russia, to North Korea, to China – knew that he was on their side. And I think their respect meant more to him than any medals and honors life could bring.\nThis passion for fairness and justice extended to our own military. When a Private was poorly equipped, or a Seaman was overworked in terrible conditions, John enjoyed nothing more than dressing down an Admiral or a General. He remained that troublesome plebe to the end.\nThose in political power were not exempt. At various points throughout his long career, John confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this. America is better than this.\nJohn – as he was the first to tell you – was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived. He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles.\nHe saw our country not only as a physical place or power, but as the carrier of enduring human aspirations. As an advocate for the oppressed. As a defender of the peace. As a promise, unwavering, undimmed, unequaled.\nThe strength of a democracy is renewed by reaffirming the principles on which it was founded. And America somehow has always found leaders who were up to that task, particularly at times of greatest need. John was born to meet that kind of challenge – to defend and demonstrate the defining ideals of our nation.\nIf we are ever tempted to forget who we are, to grow weary of our cause, John’s voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder: We are better than this. America is better than this.\nJohn was a restless soul. He really didn’t glory in success or wallow in failure, because he was always on to the next thing. A friend said, “He can’t stand to stay in the same experience.” One of his books ended with the words: “And I moved on.”\nJohn has moved on. He would probably not want us to dwell on it. But we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure. And we will remember him as he was: unwavering, undimmed, unequaled.\nTribute by President Barack Obama\nTo John’s beloved family, Mrs. McCain, to Cindy and the McCain children, President and Mrs. Bush, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President and Mrs. Biden, Vice President and Mrs. Cheney, Vice President Gore, and as John would say, my friends. We come to celebrate an extraordinary man. A statesman, a patriot who embodied so much that is best in America.\nPresident Bush and I are among the fortunate few who competed against John at the highest levels of politics. He made us better presidents just as he made the senate better, just as he makes this country better.\nFor someone like John to ask you while he is still alive to stand and speak of him when he is gone is a precious and singular honor. Now, when John called me with that request earlier this year, I’ll admit sadness and also a certain surprise. After our conversation ended, I realized how well it captured some of John’s essential qualities.\nTo start with, John liked being unpredictable, even a little contrarian. He had no interest in conforming to some prepackaged version of what a senator should be and he didn’t want a memorial that was going to be prepackaged either. It also showed John’s disdain for self pity. He had been to hell and back and yet somehow never lost his energy or his optimism or his zest for life. So cancer did not scare him. And he would maintain that buoyant spirit to the very end, too stubborn to sit still, as ever, fiercely devoted to his friends and most of all to his family. It showed his irreverence, his sense of humor, a little bit of a mischievous streak. what better way to get a last laugh than make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience? And most of all it showed a largeness of spirit. An ability to see past differences in search of common ground.\nAnd in fact on the surface, John and i could not have been more different. We’re of different generations. I came from a broken home and never knew my father. John was the stein of one of America’s most distinguished military families. I have a reputation for keeping cool, John not so much. We were standard bearers of different American political traditions and throughout my presidency John never hesitated to tell me when he thought I was screwing up, which by his calculation was about once a day. But for all our differences, for all of the times we sparred, I never tried to hide, and I think John came to understand the long-standing admiration that I had for him.\nBy his own account John was a rebellious young man. In his case, what’s faster way to distinguish yourself when you’re the son and grandson of admirals than to mutiny. Eventually, though, he concluded that the only way to really make his mark on the world is to commit to something bigger than yourself. For John, that meant answering the highest of callings, serving his country in a time of war.\nOthers this week and this morning have spoken to the depths of his torment and the depths of his courage there in the cells of Hanoi when day after day, year after year that youthful iron was tempered into steel. And it brings to mind something that Hemingway wrote, a book that Meghan referred to, his favorite book. “Today is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that ever come can depend on what you do today.”\nIn captivity John learned in ways that few of us ever will the meaning of those words, how each moment, each day, each choice is a test. And John McCain passed that test again and again and again. And that’s why when John spoke of virtues like service and valor they weren’t just words to him, it was a truth that he had lived and for which he was prepared to die. And it forced even the most cynical to consider what were we doing for our country? What might we risk everything for?\nMuch has been said this week about what a maverick John was. In fact, John was a pretty conservative guy. Trust me, I was on the receiving end of some of those votes. But he did understand that some principles transcend politics. Some values transcend party. He considered it part of his duty to uphold those principles and uphold those values.\nJohn cared about the institutions of self government, our constitution, our bill of rights, rule of law. Separation of powers. Even the arcane rules and procedures of the senate. He knew that in a nation as big and boisterous and diverse as ours, those institutions, those rules, those norms are what bind us together. Give shape and order to our common life. Even when we disagree. Especially when we disagree.\nJohn believed in honest argument and hearing our views. He understood that if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy will not work. That’s why he was willing to buck his own party at times. occasionally work across the aisle on campaign finance reform and immigration reform. That’s why he championed a free and independent press as vital to our democratic debate. And the fact it earned him good coverage didn’t hurt either.\nJohn understood as JFK understood, as Ronald Reagan understood that part of what makes our country great is that our membership is based not on our blood line, not on what we look like, what our last names are, not based on where our parents or grandparents came from or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed that all of us are created equal. Endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights.\nIt has been mentioned today, seen footage this week, John pushing back against supporters that challenged my patriotism during the 2008 campaign. I was grateful but I wasn’t surprised. As Joe Lieberman said, that was John’s instinct. I never saw John treat anyone differently because of their race or religion or gender. That in those moments that have been referred to during the campaign he saw himself as defending America’s character, not just mine. He considered it the imperative of every citizen that loves this country to treat all people fairly.\nAnd finally while John and I disagreed on all kinds of foreign policy issues, we stood together on America’s role as the one nation, believing that with great power and great blessings comes great responsibility. That burden is borne most heavily by our men and women in uniform. Service members like Doug, Jimmy, Jack who followed their father’s footsteps, as well as families that serve alongside our troops. But John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others with our adherence to a set of universal values. Like rule of law and human rights and insistence on the god-given dignity of every human being.\nOf course John was the first to tell us he was not perfect. Like all of us that go into public service, he did have an ego. Like all of us there was no doubt some votes he cast, some compromises he struck, some decisions he made that he wished he could have back.\nIt is no secret, it has been mentioned that he had a temper, and when it flared up, it was a force of nature, a wonder to behold. His jaw grinding, his face reddening, his eyes boring a hole right through you. Not that I ever experienced it firsthand, mind you. But to know john was to know that as quick as his passions might flare, he was just as quick to forgive and ask for forgiveness. He knew more than most his own flaws, his blind spots, and he knew how to laugh at himself. And that self awareness made him all the more compelling.\nWe didn’t advertise it, but every so often over the course of my presidency John would come over to the White House and we’d just sit and talk in the oval office, just the two of us. We would talk about policy and we’d talk about family and we’d talk about the state of our politics. And our disagreements didn’t go away during these private conversations. Those were real and they were often deep. but we enjoyed the time we shared away from the bright lights and we laughed with each other and we learned from each other and we never doubted the other man’s sincerity or the other patriotism or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team. We never doubted we were on the same team.\nFor all of our differences, we shared a fidelity to the ideals for which generations of Americans have marched and fought and sacrificed and given their lives. We considered our political battles a privilege, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those ideals at home and do our best to advance them around the world. We saw this country as a place where anything is possible. and citizenship as an obligation to ensure it forever remains that way.\nMore than once during his career John drew comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt. I am sure it has been noted that Roosevelt’s men in the arena seems tailored to John. most of you know it. Roosevelt speaks of those who strive, who dare to do great things, who sometimes win and sometimes come up short but always relish a good fight. A contrast to those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat. Isn’t that the spirit we celebrate this week? That striving to be better, to do better, worthy of the great inheritance that our founders bestowed. So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. Trafficking in bombastic manufactured outrage, it’s politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that.\nToday is only one day in all the days that will ever be. but what will happen in all the other days that will ever come can depend on what you do today. What better way to honor John McCain’s life of service than as best we can follow his example to prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, and in fact it is demanded of all of us as citizens of this great republic. That’s perhaps how we honor him best, by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power, that the things that are worth risking everything for, principles that are eternal, truths that are abiding. At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt.\nMay God bless John McCain. May God bless this country he served so well.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Editor’s Note: This blog has been updated to reflect informational changes.

In 1962, right out of high school, I went into the US Marine Corps, for a short time, total time 3 months, 28 days. I was quite traumatized by the San Diego post, and after a few months, was discharged with a DD214 that I believe states, Honorable, unsuitable. That has since been changed to simply Honorable. In my later years, and with experience and advanced degrees in education, I received a direct commission to Captain, in the US Army Reserve. I served nearly 10 years with the Reserves.\nWhat I am wondering is, can the time in 1962, be re-visited in order to claim a disability for not being able to remain, due to the emotional anxiety and mental situation, I had during that brief time? Just wondering. Thanks.\nI am 40% disabled but my GA ID card only states “service connected” do I need to get a new card?\nCan service connect can buy gas and us the gym\nHi Andres, thank you for your service. You won’t be able to use the gym; the fitness centers are one of the critical MWR programs that supports mission readiness for our military members. But you will be able to shop at the Exchange and commissary, and buy gas. And you can always shop online tax-free at shopmyexchange.com.\nWith new benefits for service for the PX and the commissary, Are we going to have the privilege to buy gas and use the gym facilities.\nPlease let me know.\nThank you\nI would think yes, since the gym and fuel stations are a part of MWR facilities and PX facilities.\nNo on the gyms- those are Category A programs which are not included under thi\nJOHN S.

The service of those of us who served less than 20 years, was no less important or significant than those who retired. We all joined to defend our country, perhaps in the future all veterans will be given these benefits. “God bless America”\nNo on the gyms- those are Category A programs which are not included under this.\nMy name is Anibal Bonilla.

How come if you don’t have a service connected; you\ncannot qualify to get access in person to the military commissaries and the exchanges. I served in a combat unit; ready for deployment: many times, we will be on high alert to go to a hostile area; plus, the training field exercises in snow and desert. This is unfair. If a caregiver; who never serve in the armed forces got more rights that an active duty US Army veteran. This is unfair. So, the only benefit that we have is the online exchange shopping. The online shopping is not the same. With the online shopping benefit; you cannot purchase anything in the commissaries; you cannot buy liqueur online with the exchange; and sometimes when you buy an item online; all depend where you live so you can receive\nthe article by mail. I think this is a real case of discrimination against all the veterans who served\non active duty.\nThank you for your attention regarding this matter and I would appreciate action towards\nthese comments.\nSorry but after ready about 100 or lost I gave up trying to find if this question has been answered, so here it goes.\nIs there a list out there that lets you know which overseas military facilities will be accepting the VHIC card starting Jan 1st 2020? I know someone posted that Japan doesn’t allow access. It would be very helpful if we could simply reference a list of all overseas bases that’s states whether or not a Service connected veteran will be able to access their facility as long as your card states you are “Service Connected”\nThank you.\nRodney, unfortunately, there is not a consolidated list that identifies which overseas military facilities in foreign countries would allow access to veterans and caregivers who are eligible for privileges under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access act of 2018. Every status of forces agreement is different. On top of that, there are other international laws and host country agreements that have to be considered. At this time, your best option is to contact the installation you are interested in visiting and find out about access rules from the local sources.\nJW, thank you very much for the info. I was hoping that there might be something out there but I can see why not.\nThank you\nUnder this new directive will we be allowed to use the USO at the airports? Thats also kinda bug when we travel and have lengthy layovers.\nJose, the USO is not a DoD entity and DoD does not have any say regarding who can access USO facilities at airports.\nMy father served and was over 75% disabled and had a lot of issues due to them. He has since then passed and I was wondering if my mom could get shopping privs on base? The local offices have been giving her the run-around about it and i would like it resolved. Thanks\nJason, I am sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, these privileges are not extended to family members and are not transferrable.\nDoes anyone have more information on the Armed Forces Travel website? I have a rated service-connected disability and would like to use it. Will access be available effective January 01, 2020?\nRey, yes, AmericanForcesTravel.com will be accessible to the new categories of eligible veterans and caregivers on January 1.\nTLFs?\nGuy, MWR recreational lodging like RV parks, cottages and cabins, destination military recreation facilities, and military resorts and hotels are included. Temporary lodging facilities are still in the gray area and DoD is working that policy out right now. We should know for sure by January 1\nDoes anyone know if a 40% disabled veterans (me) will be eligible to use military campgrounds starting 01/01/2020? Thank you, Roy\nRoy, as a veterans with a 40% service-connected disability rating, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you will be able to make reservations and use military campgrounds beginning on January 1, 2020.\nI feel that it’s great that veterans with disabilities are being given access to commissary, PX, etc. What I don’t agree with is how the government, and the VA excludes all veterans that wasn’t injured while serving. It almost like saying that your time in service didn’t mean a thing. They Government and the VA should just come out and say, step aside, and sit on the curve because your time in service meant nothing.\nSo we still can’t just let veterans in general use these services? I remember there being a good number of individuals trying to document every little ache and pain in the hopes of getting a high enough disability rating for a paycheck and now they can use base services? How does that make any sense?\nAlex, 19 million veterans would surely overwhelm the military systems and interfere with mission focus, readiness, and the ability to properly take care of the needs of service members and their families.\nWhy are gold star families not included in this?\nThis new benefit is not a survivor benefit, it’s a benefit for specific categories of veterans (Purple Heart recipients, former POWs, and veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90%) and caregivers for veterans (individuals assessed, approved, and designated as the primary family caregivers of eligible veterans under the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers). It does not extend to those veterans’ or caregivers’ family members.\nIn response to all these comments, my problem is that my newly issued VHIC does not reflect “service connected” as I am 10% rated, and was told by the VA Hospital in which issued it that only ratings of 20% and above are listed as “service connected” on the card. Is there anyone who is 10% rated, whose card states “service connected”?\ni RECEIVED MY va cARD ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND IT STATES UNDER MY PICTURE “VA HEALTH CARE ENROLLEE SERVICE CONNECTED”\nMine says the exact same thing. Discharged with 10% rating.\nL., it sounds like your Veteran Health Identification Card is good then. The things to check: 1) your name; 2) your photo; 3) “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo; and 4) the scannable barcode.\nI was initially rated 0% service connected.\nIf when you left the service and they didn’t give you a service connected disability rating then it would not be considered by the V.A. You would have to go through the V.A. and requests it or dispute the claim.\nGood Luck\nmy new (6 months) card also says service connected (10%)\nI’m 10% and my card says, “Service Connected”.\nThe description states “Veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings” which indicates – even those with no service connected disability are eligible therefore it is needless to have any % listed on the card. Or am I reading too much into this……?\nIf a veteran has a 0% rating they are service connected it just is not serious enough to rate a higher percentage but if the condition/problem increases or worsens this percentage could be increased. Vets without a service connection will never have a %.\nThat isn’t true. I’ve had a 10% rating for over 30 years and my card has always had the “service connected” indication. I started out with the card that had the purple V on it. I was medically discharged though.\nI am 100% disabled, rated by the v.a.. i amresiding in the philippines. The benefits of allowing us to have access in exchange/commissary is not applicable here because there is no exchange/commissary in here.\nAristotle, you are correct. Even if you are in a foreign country that does have U.S. military commissary and exchange facilities, access is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host nations. However, if you are in the United States or in a U.S. territory or possession, you would have access with the appropriate credential.\nYou might be able to shop online at: https://www.shopmyexchange.com/veterans\nAs of Veterans Day 2017, all honorably discharged Veterans qualify for a Department of Defense-approved lifelong online military exchange shopping benefit.\nShopMyExchange.com offers millions of products and an expanded assortment of national brands. Online shoppers enjoy free delivery when using a MILITARY STAR® card or when their online purchases total $49 or more. All Exchange purchases—including those made online—are tax-free.\nNOT TRUE. You must have a military address to use ShopMyExchange in order to have the items delivered. I live in Japan and was told there is nothing they (AAFES) can do for a non-military address.\nCan the spouse of the service connected diable veteran get an assess card.\nLeslie, no. Family members are not eligible for military installation and privilege access.\nEven in US territories; I try many times to buy products but they don’t delivery to my address.\nWith the online shopping benefit ; you cannot purchase anything in the commissaries; you cannot buy liqueur online with the exchange; and sometimes when you buy an item online; all depend where you live so you can receive\nthe article by mail. This new law that start in January 2020 is a real case of discrimination against all the veterans who served\non active duty.\nI just have a question. My husband is 70% serviced connected disabled. I live in Oklahoma, which is a state that has not been real ID compliant and will not be until sometime in 2020. How would I be able to get onto the base for commissary with my husband without that real ID? Will they accept my drivers license as is?\nThank you and Thank you all for your service!!\nMary, you will not be able to use a driver’s license that is not REAL ID-compliant, but there are other documents you can use to accompany your husband onto the installation as his guest, such as a U.S. passport or a U.S. passport card.\nI called the Shades of Green Resort at Disney and they said they are funded by MWR but haven’t been given any info yet…will be calling back expeditiously until they have info….\nhttps://www.shadesofgreen.org\nWayne, please wait until after January 1 to contact Shades of Green. Until January 1, newly eligible veterans and caregivers are not eligible to make reservations. Also, the Military Services are still working on passing the information about newly eligible veterans and caregivers and how to verify identity and eligibility to their front line employees so that they will be ready to welcome you on January 1.\nI have become eligible and do draw a 10 percent disability rating from the VA. This came about after receiving my VIC card therefore it’s not reflecting on my VIC card which expires in 2024. In lieu of getting an updated card, can I use my current card with my eligibility letter to get onto base??\nThanks!\nI called the Enrollment office at the VA Hospital and she just sent the updated ID. It came in 3 days.\nI would suggest you get your card updated as soon as you can. In the mean time I would check with your local commissary or exchange if your current ID and VA award letter would be sufficient.\nKD, DoD will not accept a VA award letter.\nIn response to all these comments, my problem is that my newly issued VHIC does not reflect “service connected” as I am 10% rated, and was told by the VA Hospital in which issued it that only ratings of 20% and above are listed as “service connected” on the card. Is there anyone who is 10% rated, whose card states “service connected”?\nRon, let me know if its is labeled “service connected”, as I am also 10% rated, and was told it is only stated “service connected” for 20% and over.\nPeter, mine says service connected and I am 10%\nRon, DoD will not accept a VIC card for installation or privilege access. You must use a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card. This is the only VA credential that will be accepted as proof of identity and eligibility for newly eligible veterans that are not eligible for these privileges under any other authority.\nThank You\nWill this allow access to Edelweiss?\nJoe, because Edelweiss Lodge is located in an overseas foreign country, access is subject to the status of forces agreement, international law, or other agreements with the host nation.\nI can see this benefit being useful to bring in more revenue to the base shops.\nBase exchanges and commissaries are routinely out of items. MWR facilities such as campgrounds and vacation lodging are sold out months in advance. This policy is a slap in the face to active duty and retirees who will now suffer because of it.\nHey Eddie. I’m offended by the fact that you think active duty and retirees and better than a service member who put in 15 years and was forced out but received an hon and has a 30% disability. You say there’s a waiting list now. And adding people like us will just increase the wait? Well I think your wait will be no longer than before. You think these people have been waiting for this opportunity so they can use the MWR like camping and other MWR opportunities you are sadly mistaken. Don’t you think we already have our areas and other things we do? Your pissed because this puts veterans with a service connected disability to be on the same pedestal as you. So don’t worry I believe your safe on waiting no longer than before on your MWR adventures. But I think instead of a slap in your face you need a boot up your ass.\nEddie, do you have any happiness in your life? I bet you bitch about free meals on Veterans Day.\nPerhaps having a potentially greater Customer base may increase funding for Commissary-Exchange and MWR facilities\nSooo I guess you’re saying F**K the veterans. They don’t deserve anything after they get out.\nEddie,\nI understand your issue, but I honestly believe you are being selfish. I spent 20 months in combat in Vietnam. I’m 70% service-connected disabled; soon to be 100%. I think I’ve earned some privileges. Keep in mind, however, Navy Exchange prices are no better than Walmart prices. Military motel prices are pretty similar to non-military. The exception I’ve seen is Hawaii. Most elderly disabled veterans can’t afford either.\nIf I were you, I wouldn’t worry about anyone causing you undue waits in line or a shortage of items in exchanges.\nThis benefit was way overdue. I recall the commissary at 29 palms in 2008 having higher priced items than the Walmart by YuccaValley.\nI am a “Veteran”, not “Active Duty”. Ease up on Eddie. I no longer rate what active duty members have. Eddies point is valid, it’s not selfish. Just because I served does no mean I rate s..t.\nAs you can see by all the threads, MWR facilities will be over inundated. Im disappointed about MWR , because those were defiantly a place for an ACTIVE DUTY E-1 to be able to afford.\nDoes not matter though, the decision has been made all for an increase of money. Go figure.\nInterested in finding out more about this expanded access? Tune into the Facebook Live event on Military OneSource on November 26, 1-2 pm Eastern Time: https://www.facebook.com/events/723971608086292/\nDoD and VA are co-hosting a Facebook Live event on this expanded access on Military OneSource on November 25, 1-2 pm. Check it out at https://www.facebook.com/events/723971608086292/\nrecreation retail services – does that include the campgrounds and hotels?\nSteve, morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) retail facilities include RV campgrounds, recreational lodging like cabins and cottages and military resort properties…also golf, bowling, restaurants, marinas, equipment check out, entertainment, special interest activities like flying clubs, movie theaters, vehicle storage, kennels, and leisure travel which includes AmericanForcesTravel.com.\nthank you! I understand in reading that after Jan 1st, next step is to go to a base for a security check? I live near Oceanside Ca, so that is a Camp Pendalton. What is the process? thanks, steve\nSteve, you’ll need to go to the visitor control center with your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card. They will verify your identity and purpose for your visit, then run a quick background check. If nothing pops up regarding felony convictions, felony arrest warrants, or other types of derogatory information related to criminal history or terrorism, you will be able to access the installation. If Camp Pendleton has ID enrollment capabilities, you can have your VHIC enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at the visitor control center every time you go to the installation.\nWould this allow disabled veterans 0%-100% service connection to have access to places like Hale Koa, Shades of Green etc?\nYes.\nI see that spouses are included. Is it only current spouses? Or are spouses that were married during the veterans time as in over 10 yrs or more be included? As many of us did the time with them??? We suffered separation, anxiety, all the unknowns also, should we not be included?\nYolanda, you are mistaken. Family members are not included in this benefit.\nYour last sentence says it all. You should not be included. Want the bennies, keep the relationship. OR better yet, get into the service and do your time.\nYou must be joking. You definitely did not serve\nNo Yolanda. You gave up the relationship and didn’t serve so you get nothing but a spot on the dependa wall of shame.\nEntitlement- Party of you.\nit says veterans. You did not serve.\nAll you had to say was that before you ask a question try checking the FAQs. Be kind, do unto others: Matthew 7:12. Just saying.\nYour VA Healthcare Card will allow you on base. Then you’ll be issued a separate DOD ID Card. Your spouse can get an ID also.\nDavid, you are mistaken. DoD is not issuing ID cards for veterans and caregivers who are eligible for these benefits under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018. DoD is allowing eligible veterans to use their Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card to verify identity and eligibility. Primary family caregivers will be allowed to show their eligibility letter from the Office of Community Care paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport to verify identity and eligibility.\nFamily members are not eligible for these privileges.\nI wish they would have asked the disabled veterans what they needed most before simply deciding to give commissary MWR and exchange privileges to every single veteran.\nPersonally, I’m 90%, and I could use Dental Care.\nI do not understand how this came about and why they chose to give us the “privilege” to spend our hard-earned money at their facility instead of providing us care for dental or hearing, something that some of us need much more. Does anyone know who passed this and what the process was of deciding?\nI’m not trying to be ungrateful but it looks like they’ve just decided to throw us a bone and it didn’t matter what bone it was and it didn’t matter if it helps anyone or not, they just decided to throw us a scrap and hoped we wanted it. Any comments?\nHello. I have 17 disabilities, served 4 years in the navy. Top honors in the coldest bootcamp -40. I have recorded the V.A. 3 million veteran have been cut from receiving and VA benefits. I had no medical for 15 years and are deathly disabled. If you get 90% disability then you have enough money to get your teeth fixed! Stop whining! I drowned 5 times a day plus so much more. So please before you put pen to paper rethink it first. I have been left to die for 30 years since I was honorably discharged. NO MEDICAL!! took 8 years to get my disability, all while trying to figure out how to survive. Not 1 veteran or veteran organization has stepped up to save my life!!! So sad\nYou “drowned 5 times a day“ and you’re asking someone to think before they type. I love it.\nThe Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 was included in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. That’s how this came about. DoD, with the help of VA, is implementing the law.\nThe VA offers hearing aids your hearing loss has to qualify. Go ask for a consult at the VA specialty clinic in your area.\nWith a 90% disability rating, hearing aids should be automatic, if needed. You don’t have to be service connected for hearing loss to get hearing aids. Example: I was 30% service connected I requested a CPAP. I was NOT RATED for sleep apnea by the VA. With proper medical proof of sleep apnea, the VA gave me a CPAP and lifetime supplies.\nHow can I determine where these facilities are located in my area?\nRobert, if you click on the links for the different retail organizations that are included in the blog post above, you should find a store locator function.\nok, this is my second post as it appears my first post was deleted…..\ni have service connected on va medical card. however it has an expiration date on it when i turn 65 when im eligible for medicare.\nso what happens then, will i be able to access the bx, commissary etc and still use?\nJust renew your VA card once it expires.\nThank You for this new addition to Veteran’s benefits. Unless the liberal politicians gain control of our government things can only get better for Vets and their families in the future\nI rhink the commenters who complain abou people who ask questions that are answered n the article and and accuse those people of being lazy should not be so judgmental and show more understanding.\nI have read the complete article and still do not understand if I am eligible.\nDelores, if you’re a veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart, a veteran who was a former prisoner of war, a veteran with a service-connected disability rating anywhere from 0-90%, or an individual assessed, approved, and designated as the primary family caregiver for an eligible veteran under the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, then you’re eligible.\nThe second part is that you need to have the right credentials to gain access to the benefit. For veterans, it is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card. If you’re a veteran who meets one of these criteria and you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility for the VHIC and the application process. For primary family caregivers, it’s an eligibility letters from the Office of Community Care paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. Eligibility letters are being mailed and should be delivered to primary family caregivers before January 1.\nAs a vet with a 60% service-connected, I know I will be eligible. Will a spouse who is not a caregiver be allowed to accompany me to the commissary or exchange?\nThey only check the ID of the person paying at the checkout.\nMichael, yes, guests may accompany you into the facilities, but they cannot make any purchases. Keep in mind that the veteran and guest will have to stop at the installation visitor control center for the standard security checks to enter the installation. The veteran will have to show their Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card; and the guest will need to have an acceptable credential with them (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are usually the easiest).\nMy husband and I are veterans not retired but we receive 10% service connected disability. Do we qualify to use the commissary and bx?\nThank you,\nJulienne Thibeau\nJulienne, veterans with a 10% service-connected disability rating do qualify for this benefit. You’ll also need a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nI have a facility use card from Joint Base MDL (Mainly used to play golf) and I am enrolled in the VA Health System with zero % disability. Am I entitled to shop at the PX? Thank you!\n“recreation retail services”. does this include the campgrounds?\nSteve, it definitely includes RV campgrounds and probably includes primitive campgrounds if they are connected to the RV campgrounds.\nPlease cut and paste the below link and go to page 10 of the PDF.\nHere is the Fact Sheet and the link to it: http://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Factsheets/expanding-access-fact-sheet.pdf\nQ: When does the shopping benefit start?\nA: Jan. 1, 2020.\nPhase one includes access to commissaries, military exchanges and morale, welfare and recreation retail activities\n(in-person and online) for:\n• Veterans eligible solely under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 (Purple Heart\nrecipients, former prisoners of war, and veterans with a Department of Veterans Affairs-documented service connected\ndisability rating of 0-90 percent) who possess and present a Veteran Health Identification Card\n• Individuals approved and designated as the primary family caregiver of an eligible veteran under the VA\nProgram of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers who possess and present a letter from the VA\nOffice of Community Care that indicates eligibility for these privileges, paired with an acceptable credential\n(e.g., REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or U.S. passport)\nFuture phases of rollout will address acceptable credentials for eligible veterans and caregivers and consideration\nand criteria for other eligible caregivers.\nDon, if you have a 0% service-connected disability rating and a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. You cannot use a locally issued facility use card to make purchases at commissaries or exchanges. The VHIC marked as I just mentioned is the credential that DoD will accept as proof of identity and eligibility for commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facility use. In fact, after January 1, you won’t even need the facility use card to access the golf course anymore, because your VHIC will authorized you to access the installation and the golf course. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nOk, I read everything and I know that I qualify. My question is- for the MWR, does that include tickets (like universal and disney) and travel (lodging, etc)? I saw that Shades of Green is included. but tickets to sea world, etc is what I’m wondering about?\nKristina, the good news is that MWR’s AmericanForcesTravel.com (a discount leisure travel booking site) is definitely a revenue-generating MWR activity and access is included beginning on January 1. In-person tickets and travel offices are still a gray-area MWR activity. Even though you have to pay for these purchases, technically, they are not a revenue-generating MWR activities by DoD’s definition. I just found out that DoD is still working out the policy for MWR activities that fall into this gray area (so I definitely need to go back and correct a few of my earlier responses). They should have it sorted out before January 1. On a side note, you should keep in mind that there are many discount tickets sold by MWR that the vendors have placed restrictions on, so not everyone can purchase or use them.\nI am 100% P&T. I just checked AmericanForcesTravel.com for prices for a trip I am planning. After selecting my travel dates, the website asked for last four, DOB and last name for verification purposes. It let me in so I guess 100% P&T vets are already authorized to use that service.\nUnited Airlines – New Orleans to Incheon, Korea for my selected dates on their site – $1552.25\nSame flight with same dates on United Airlines website – $1553.\nSame flight with same dates on JustFly.com – $1556.80\nI’m not seeing a lot of benefit through AmericanForcesTravel.com – Am I missing something?\nok, i read the FAQ but have a question that was not mentioned.\nmy VA service connected has an expiration date on it when I turn 65, what happens to my privileges for using the commissary, bx, etc after that?\nJohnetta, I am a 8 year Army reservist veteran and I receive 80% service connected disability. Have you checked into your disability status (if any?) You may even qualify for 0%. Just a thought.\nVeterans with the VA Service Conncted ID card will have access to the base after initial visit to the base security office. I live in a location where six various military bases. Will I have to visit all six base security offices for access. OR ‘ Will there be a VA ID central data base used by the guards at each different base that will recognize my VA ID without having to visit each individual security office.\nWilliam, I would recommend you check with the visitor control center personnel when you visit your first installation. You will likely have to enroll at each installation that is a different Military Service, but you might be enrolled for multiple installations in the immediate area if they are all the same Military Service. There is definitely not a single enrollment option for all military installations.\nNo one who is asking question already addressed in the Frequently Asked Questions should be allowed these privileges. If you are too lazy to read for yourself, you don’t deserve the privileges. Ninety-nine percent of the questions asked above were answered in the FAQs.\nWell consider if they are disabled and are unable to comprehend written instruction. You should not judge especially if the content is related to disabilities. You should be ashamed for shaming a fellow past or present military veteran.\nAmen\nThat’s stupid. Shut up\nNot everyone is just able to do the simplest of tasks, myself included. Maybe you might consider the mindset of an individual who has pretty much nothing but a lot of excuses, no follow up and because of the extra hardship just doesn’t need a brother reminding them of their liabilities. Just saying, were talking about the awesome chance to pay more for their items.\nThank you,\nTim\nI am confused. I retired in 1983 (no disabilities) with full commissary. exchange, mwr and other privileges. The only identification required was my retired id. Does this new policy mean that retired veterans’ privileges will be cancelled on 1/1/2020?\nNo. The subject of this article is for Veterans who are NOT retired who is a recipient of MOH, Purple Heart, and Disabled Veterans with 100 percent disability.\nBOTTOM LINE – If you are a RETIREE, you have access to commissary & Exchange priveleges with or without disability.\nMy husband is deceased, he was 100%, am I eligible to receive ID or can I use his?\nNo. Your retired privileges will not be cancelled.\nVeteran’s with 0 to 90% service connected disability ratings will now have these privileges. I believe that 100% service connected already did. This is an expansion and nobody who already had these benefits will lose them.\nDean, there is no change to the benefits that military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, and 100% disabled veterans receive under DoD policy. This is a new benefit specifically for Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90%, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as caregivers for eligible veterans under VA caregiver programs.\nI was awarded 100% disability in Aug 2014, for prostrate cancer from exposure to agent orange in VN (1968-1969) and was Honorably discharged from the Regular Army (Army of the United States) in Jan 1970. My VA Health card reflects “Service Incurred”\nAfter my prostratectomy my disability was down graded to 50% as of Nov 2019 (which is under appeal).\nI assume that effective Jan 1, 2020 I will still be eligible for the benefits outlined in the VA news letter.\nI am unfamilar with the “travel” benefits. Where can I find more information?\nMy spouse of 54 years should be eligible for the same benefits once i register/enroll her in the “Care Giver” program. Is thisLeave a Reply\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *\nWe are both approved traveler under the PSA, does that help with access to Fort Sam Houston??\nComment correct?\nWill she be issued an ID by the VA as a “care-giver”?\nCornelius, if you have a 50% service-connected disability rating and a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. The VHIC marked as I just mentioned is the credential that DoD will accept as proof of identity and eligibility for commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facility use. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nIf your spouse is assessed, approved, and designated as your primary family caregiver under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, then she would also be eligible for these benefits. If she does not qualify to be a primary family caregiver, she can still accompany you into the facilities, she just cannot make any purchases. To get her on base as a guest, you will have to stop at the installation visitor control center for the standard security checks to enter the installation. The veteran will have to show their Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card; and the guest will need to have an acceptable credential with them (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are usually the easiest).\nIf you’re asking about AmericanForcesTravel.com, it is a leisure travel booking website that offers great deals for eligible users. You will be eligible for this beginning January 1.\nSo I get my healthcare at the Omaha VA Hospital, I’m not service connected and do not have a disability. Can my VA ID Card get me on base, commissary etc, MWR etc?\nNo you can’t. Read the article again.\nOnly veterans with a service connected disability rating 0%-90%, Purple Heart recipients, former POW’s, and approved caregivers.\nHubert, if your VA ID card is not a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card, then it will not get you on an installation for commissary, exchange, or MWR privileges.\nDoes it include fitness center access? Also does this include OCONUS bases?\nI found the answer for the OCONUS question.\nSean, it does not include fitness center access. Fitness centers are one of the critical MWR programs that supports mission readiness for our military members.\nThis benefit extends to installations in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions, so the OCONUS installations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Marianas are included. Installations in overseas foreign countries are subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host nations.\nWhy are people not reading the article?\n99% of these questions are answered in the article. It states exactly the new benefit and what to do and not do…\nThe MP’s have their work cut out for them…\nLiz,\nI totally agree with your comments.\nDitto Liz. People please read, know the facts before you go to the base. Base operations must continue. this new policy is good but not for the MPs.\nHow my dental, eyes, hearing for me and spouse if stayed 20 years when I enlisted in 1966?1\nRetired 22 years AF. No problem with this new benefits for none retired veterans. But, I do have problems, if government can do this, then why they can also give 1960s veterans that where promises full dental, hospital, eye care and hearing to include spouses, if they stay 20 years and layer it was taken from us that enlisted under lies? It seems the Px, commissary and liquors store are running out of clientele (mostly baby boomers) that are tired of being used.\nDear Sir, Mam. I”m 50% Service Connected and retired after 31 years as a Health Tech for the VA. I’m I Eligible?\nYes, the article stated all service- connected veterans.\nAny veteran with a service connected disability. 0%-90%.\nR, if you have a 50% service-connected disability rating and a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. The VHIC marked as I just mentioned is the credential that DoD will accept as proof of identity and eligibility for commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facility use. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nWhen was it not great. Or are you saying go back to the way things were pre civil Rights movement because at that time it wasn’t great. Please explain yourself as a veteran I find that statement ridiculous\nCan someone clarify whether this benefit includes stays at MWR lodging such as the Navy Lodge, Getaway Inns, Army Lodge, et al?\nYes, we stayed at the Hale Koa Hotel in Hawaii as well as the Nellis lnn at NAFB.\nJoe, it sounds like David already has DoD privileges through another authority, because this benefit for veterans awarded the Purple Heart, veterans who are former prisoners of war, veterans with a service-connected disability rating of 0-90%, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as caregivers for eligible veterans under a VA caregiver program doesn’t kick in until January 1.\nThat said, yes, MWR recreational lodging is included (e.g., RV campgrounds, cabins, cottages, military resorts), as is lodging run by the exchanges (Navy Lodge).\nI guess we were skipped over.\nDo you have to be disabled to be eligible or can veterans with 0%disability be eligible as well?\nAnnette\nAccording to the article 0% to 90% you are eligible\nVeterans that are at 0% is considered a disable veteran.\nThere are 0% disability rating that is considered service connected. Unless you are referring to not submitting for disability compensation and pension, then of course you will considered a regular veteran.\nAnd not eligible for a service connected Veteran Health Card.\nthis is a disability rating with 0 compensation. for me, prostate problem with no physical limitations.\nAnnette, if you have a service-connected disability rating anywhere from 0-90% and a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. The VHIC marked as I just mentioned is the credential that DoD will accept as proof of identity and eligibility for commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facility use. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nI am eligible under the guidelines but how do I get on the base? Does my VA card work at the gate?\nI assume that’s what’s going to change on Jan 1st. Does anyone know if they excluded firearms and alcohol?\nCharles, the only purchase restrictions for newly eligible veterans and caregivers for veterans are uniform items at the exchanges.\nStarting January First your VA card should be accepted for base access. See the first paragraph of this Military Times article.\nhttps://www.militarytimes.com/pay-benefits/2019/07/22/heres-how-3-million-more-people-will-get-military-shopping-benefits/?fbclid=IwAR1p2xikrrIqcNStuSoQkeJvDKWatcfpTCmEfuypaHltsReCYNMelyNjIR4\nYour Veteran Health Card with service connected on it is sufficient.\nI live overseas. I tried mi VHIC at the nearby base front gate in October. They initially said it was not valid for post access. I insisted they scan it and they did. I was then allowed on base very cordially. I wasn’t able to use the commissary or px but was allowed to get on the base. Commissary and px will lick in come 1Jan 2020.\nRaymond, installations in overseas foreign countries may not be accessible due to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host nations. And access with a VHIC to installations that do not have VA medical centers is not authorized until January 1, 2020.\nChad, if you VA card is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. The VHIC marked as I just mentioned is the credential that DoD will accept as proof of identity and eligibility for commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facility use. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nIs the Halekoa Hotel in Hawaii considers a MWR facility?\nI’m under the impression that if you are 100% disable,you are allowed on any and all bases to use the Commissary/Bx and Px.Im 100% myself and have a General Under Honorable Conditions and there isn’t an expiration on the card I was issued.the expiration date is marked INDEFINITELY..card also marked Ex/Bx/MWR AND Commissary.I live in Colorado in the metro Denver area,there are a lot of bases in Colorado and all said I can get a replacement if needed.read the article in its entirety,talk to someone at the DAV.hope I have been of some help.Good Luck.\nLarry, if you are a 100% disabled veteran, then you have DoD privileges under DoD policy, so you already have access to these benefits. The new access to benefits is for veterans who are Purple Heart recipients, veterans who are former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90%, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as caregivers for eligible veterans under a VA caregiver program. These newly eligible veterans will not be issued a DoD ID card. Newly eligible veterans will use a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, and eligible caregivers will use an eligibility letter from the Office of Community Care paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport to access military installations and these benefits.\nYes, we stayed at the Hale Koa Hotel in Hawaii as well as the Nellis lnn at NAFB.\nDavid, if you’ve already stayed in MWR lodging, then you have different privileges than these newly eligible veterans and caregivers. Their access is slightly different from yours and theirs doesn’t start until January 1.\nJudson, yes, the Kale Koa Hotel in Hawaii is an MWR facility.\nI’m 100% VA rated. Last year, when we went on base to get my wife’s DoD ID renewed, they refused to do it AND confiscated mine stating that my General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions did not qualify me for a DoD ID. I have been going round and round with this since. VA says that I am eligible but ID card office on base says no. If no is correct, why was I issued the card to begin with and why does VA still say yes, I’m eligible?\nYou should have been issued a Service-Connected Veteran Health Card, which is sufficient for access to the base. Take that to the Visitor’s Center for a base pass.\nContact the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) for help with this. It is a FREE service for veterans by veterans. They have offices everywhere – do a google search for one near you. Good Luck.\n“Make America Great Again”\nThe best way to “Make America Great Again” is to get that Draft Dodging old man out of office ASAP!!\nThe HONORABLE President Trump IS making America great again! Look at his promises made, promises kept. You watch too much FAKE NEWS…..\nAccording to the article your VA healthcare ID card has to say service-connected on it and yes at the gate is how you would use it according to the article\nAmen brother you are 100% correct 6 deferments to keep from protecting the country get him out of office immediately vote 2020\nMichael Cowan – You would rather have Lying HildeBeast who left my Navy Brothers in Arms die in Benghazi? Then say At this point what difference does it make??? President Trump will win in a landslide! Go Trump 2020!\nClinton is not in office anymore.\nThat draft dodging (as you call him) old man has done more for our military and nation than any other president since Ronald Reagan held that position.\nHe is why we are getting these additional benefits.\nPrior administration tried to shrink military as much as possible making us weak. Didn’t care about veterans at all. Try watching FOX news instead of the liberal crap.\nThe truth is the bill that extends these privileges to veterans was sign while Senator McCain was battling brain cancer.\nThe full title of the bill, which passed the Senate on a 92-5 vote Wednesday, is the “John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018.”\nThe bill is designated for McCain and Rep. Samuel Johnson, a Texas Republican, both of whom were prisoners of war in Vietnam, and also for Daniel Akaka, a former Hawaii Democratic senator and World War II veteran who died in April.\nLet’s give credit where it is due—to the true heroes that demonstrated true patriotism—even when it came to putting themselves in danger for the sake of liberty.\nSo if I’m understanding this right, a Vietnam Nam era veteran with no disabilities cannot take advantage of this even tho they use the VA for their health issues and have the VA medical card, right?\nYes, You will be able to use the facilities as of 1-1-20.\nonly if you have a service connected disability rating.\nYou are understanding it right, unfortunately.\nCorrect. 0% – 90% service connected on VA Health Card\nVeterans:\n*Purple Heart recipients\n*former prisoners of war\n*Veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings\nMichael, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card, then you will have access beginning January 1.\nI am 80% service connected, does this new privilege allow me access to Class Six store to purchase alcohol or tobacco products?\nD, if you have an 80% service-connected disability rating and a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. The VHIC marked as I just mentioned is the credential that DoD will accept as proof of identity and eligibility for commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facility use. This includes the Class Six store and the ability to purchase alcohol and tobacco products. If you don’t have a VHIC, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nI’m upset about them not letting members on base that have had a felony conviction. My brother got one when he was a teenager living on the street. He went on to serve honorably in the Marines with an honorable discharge. Are you seriously going to tell me because of this he is going to be screwed over! Really!\nSeems that way by the article but all you have to do is file a claim if anything at all that’s wrong with you related to the military service even if you get a 0% rating you will be allowed to use these privileges\nWhat you do will follow you. Good, bad and indifferent.\nExactly my sentiment on this subject. What makes this any better for Veterans who have served honorably and then get a slap in the face and told no way are you getting on base.8\nRobert, that rule applies to anyone visiting an installation, not just newly eligible veterans and caregivers.\nYou all really need to read the article before posting! It clearly answers a lot of the questions that are being asked…..but here it is in a nutshell.\nYou must be enrolled in VA healthcare and obtain the ID – the link to do that is listed. If you are a Veteran and don’t have a service connected disability rating of 0-90 percent (yes 0 percent is a rating!!!) then you cannot utilize these new services – those at 100% rating already have access. Also, your VA ID must list “Service Connected” “Purple Heart” or “POW” under your name, just being enrolled in the healthcare program without those won’t work.\nIf you are overseas, you will still have to adhere to the host nation’s Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which more than likely, this new program won’t change for you. Some countries are fairly strict in what they are going to allow.\nYou should be able to bring a guest with you, similar to if you went with someone now that had a ID to get in, you or they just wouldn’t be able to purchase anything on their own. Remember that base access and Commissary/PX/BX access will be different so the VA can’t tell you whether or not you can “get on base”, that will have to be up to the local installation on/how they’ll accept the VA ID (more than likely they’ll allow it along with your DL or other form of ID).\nWhen I obtained my VA ID, I had to visit the local VA hospital in person, get my picture taken, then a few weeks later it showed up in the mail. But again, read the Article!!!!!!\nAmen. Great summary\nGREAT…THANK YOU…PLEASE READ PEOPLE!!!\nI have a vhic, but it’s a few years old and doesn’t indicate the 10% service related disability from a recent claim. Since the qualifier indicates 0 to 90%, my current card ‘should’ be sufficient, but is it common to get a card replaced if if it doesn’t reflect a change in disability?\nIt is very easy to get your card switched to a new one that states “service connected”. I’ve always been service connected, but my original card did not state that. Simple process.\nThe card must show service-connected otherwise it will not work\nYour card should say Service-Connected, whether 0% – 90%. That card is sufficient.\nI have an older vhic card that i received before being diagnosed 70% disabled. The card does not reflect that I have a disability. I simply called a local VA number and they verified my personal info including my updated disability rating (it’s in the system nationwide). Through this call, I confirmed my address and DOB and was told that I’d receive my updated vhic card through the mail (with the picture they already had on hand) within 7 to 10 days. No need to travel anywhere, it can be done via phone call to any local VA office in the states. Hope this helps..\nKenneth, the Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card. DoD needs this for visual verification of identity and eligibility, since not everyone who has a VHIC is eligible for these privileges.\nUm, sorry to disappoint but Service Connected Veterans have been able to use the PX/BX for the last 20 years! I have been using it since 1995 and I never had to do anything other then show my VA card and that has been in every state of the Union.\nYou can’t get on post here without being 100% disabled as a vet. Nice try though.\nno we couldn’t only 100% disabled could. this is for 0%-90% service connected and purple heart recipients\nThis does not take affect until Jan 1 2020\nSorry but that’s not true most bases will not let you on simply because you have a VA card now they all have to honor the VA card\nGlad you have been able to use it. I have been disabled for years, I D says so, and could not use unless 100%\nDan, you are mistaken. Even if you are a 100% disabled veteran, you would have to show a DoD ID card to get onto a military installation and shop at military exchange facilities. A VA card has not been an authorized form of ID for DoD privileges up to this point. On January 1, 2020, DoD will begin accepting a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displaying “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card for newly eligible veterans to show proof of identity and eligibility for military commissary, exchange, and MWR retail privileges.\nI have the VA health card, was denied disability at time of discharge from Navy due to asthma being pre-existing; however, my asthma became very disabling after a couple bouts of severe respiratory infections while at medical corp school in the Great Lakes region. It took many months to be able to function properly and as of now, my lung capacity is minimal.\nI also was employed by DOD most of my 23 years of Civil Service and am allowed on bases, but do not have commissary, nor exchange privileges, which I would love.\nWould I be able to use my DOD i.d. and the VA health card in January 2020 to access these locations?\nBarbara, unless you are entitled to commissary and exchange privileges as a DoD civilian (assigned overseas), you cannot use your DoD ID card to access commissary and exchange privileges. To access these benefits as an eligible veteran, you must use a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. If your VHIC is not marked as I just mentioned, then you would not be eligible for these privileges.\nI am a Service Connected Disabled Veteran, will my spouse be able to enter the commissary with me beginning January 1st?\ndoes a 5 point vet with a Letter that procLaims that he has LifeLong benefits on tooth #9 that he chipped on an m-16 bracket quaLify for this benefit?\nPhilip, if all of that qualifies you for a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card, then yes. If not, then no.\nGet her own card. She could get one just like yours.\nSo my wife and daughter can come on the base with me? It would be kinda of crazy if l would be the only one to get on.\nGary, family members are not eligible for this benefit.\nI believe the only person able to “pay for and buy” at the commissary will be the VA ID holder.\nSee abuse coming with this change, especially in San Antonio area military bases. Hope the bases can handle the invasion of hoarders.\nI’m 100% and have had this privilege since 2014. My spouse was issued his own ID card and uses the BX/commissary by himself.\nDavid, as a 100% disabled veteran, you have privileges under DoD policy. This is a new benefit, slightly different from yours, that is specific to Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90%, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as caregivers for eligible veterans under VA caregiver programs.\nTim, yes, guests may accompany you into the facilities, but they cannot make any purchases. Keep in mind that the veteran and guest will have to stop at the installation visitor control center for the standard security checks to enter the installation. The veteran will have to show their Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card; and the guest will need to have an acceptable credential with them (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are usually the easiest).\nI see the Navy Lodge emblem above. Do the expanded privileges include Space-A use of military lodging facilities?\nSpace-A is available starting Jan 1, 2020 for service connection rating of 100% permanent and total. If you’re not permanent and total you’re not eligible.\nJohn, this new benefit does include space-available use of the Navy Lodge, which is a Navy Exchange operation. It also includes MWR recreational lodging, RV campgrounds, cabins, cottages, and military resort properties. Nothing is firm yet on access to permanent change of station of temporary duty lodging facilities.\nHow do I get on base? What ID do I show at the gate?\nRichard, on your first visit to an installation, stop at the visitor control center and show them your VHIC that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. The security folks will have to run a basic background check for criminal history and terrorism. If you’re cleared, you will have access. If the installation has ID enrollment capabilities, you can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at visitor control every time you want to go shopping.\nAs with all other individuals seeking access to DoD installations, all eligible veterans must pass a basic on-the-spot background check prior to enrolling and an automated check each time they enter the installation. Veterans with felony convictions, felony arrest warrants or other types of derogatory information related to criminal history or terrorism will not be permitted entry.\nThe above statement then is also a double standard. What about Veterans with higher than just service connected who have prior records are they allowed access on base? I feel that all Veterans who have prior records and are service connect should be given at least a chance. They should be able to check in whenever they want to go on base. This way they their location is known at all times and can be monitored if needed. To make a statement to not authorized them is not serving our Veteran’s who have made major or minor mistakes in their lives but have served honorably. No one is perfect but we should all learned from our past and do better as we move forward in life.\nIf you try to enter some installations with a VHC you will be turned around. Most installations only recognize Active duty and Retired IDs. I asked the gate guard at Ft McClellan if a VA card would get me in. He said, ‘No.’. Luckily I have a Retired ID card. Marine Base Quantico will give you access to the base with a state driver’s license as will many bases. I’m not sure you can make purchases in the Commissary and BX. I’ve used my Retired ID to access bases all over the country but never tried using only a VA Health Card. I also know I can use my Retired ID to go on AMC military aircraft, but they comply with TSA regs now and do background checks just like going on a commercial flight. AAFES/MWR is hurting for cash just like many stores outside the gate. Other than the tax savings and that profits go to MWR that supports troop morale, the PX/BX/Commissary is not the bargain it was 30 years ago. When you figure that most local bases are now closed meaning you have to drive long distances and that the PX sells named branded items with name-brand prices. Wal Mart and Amazon will usually beat their prices and you don’t have to travel. Of course, it’s always fun to get your “Green Fix” and go down memory lane on the post.\nFt McClellan was shut down in 1999 as part of base realignment. It was also heavily contaminated.\nErnest, on January 1, 2020, DoD will begin accepting a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displaying “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card for newly eligible veterans to show proof of identity and eligibility for military commissary, exchange, and MWR retail privileges. This new benefit is slightly different from your benefits as a military retiree.\nFerrell, the same security protocols are followed for any visitor to an installation, DoD is not singling out the newly eligible veterans.\nShopping these facilities is no benefit anymore, and the farther you drive to get there, the less of a deal it is! I’m guessing the only reason it’s being opened to all honorably discharged veterans, is because prices have risen so much in both the commissary and BX/PX, that currently authorized shoppers who must drive 20 miles or more have stopped patronizing them.\nAmazon, WalMart, etc. combined with all of the other online retailers are giving the commissary/exchange a run for their money. Won’t be long before you see stateside farmed out to retailers – and with onliners shipping to APO/AFO the overseas exchange days are also numbered – will become expresses with limited stock. As I see it only the overseas commissaries will survive.\nHi Mark, thank you for your service, and for your feedback. Your Exchange benefit is strong. The Exchange’s financial statements are audited annually by a third-party company; you can find our most recent annual report here: https://publicaffairs-sme.com/Community/2018annualreport.\nMark, you are mistaken. While online military exchange shopping privileges were extended to all honorably discharged veterans on November 11, 2017 through the DoD’s Veterans Online Shopping Benefit, in-store shopping is not being extended this broadly. The new in-store shopping access that takes effect on January 1 is for veterans who were awarded the Purple Heart, veterans who are former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90%, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as the primary family caregivers of eligible veterans under the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.\nHello all,\nI am a 60% veteran but have no idea what is a MWR facility that everyone is speaking of. Can someone help me with this information?\nAnd that you for extended the offer, it’s much appreciated..\nHappy belated Veterans Day to you all\nGod bless\nMWR is Morale, Welfare, and Recreation office on base. You go to buy discounted tickets to theme parks, plan vacations, etc.\nMWR stands for Morale, Welfare and Recreation. MWR facilities would include Base/Camp/Post/Station Gyms, Pools, Libraries, Outdoor Recreation, Bowling Allies, Golf Courses. There may be other MWR facilities depending on location.\nLanadra, morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) retail facilities include RV campgrounds, recreational lodging like cabins and cottages and military resort properties…also golf, bowling, restaurants, marinas, equipment check out, entertainment, special interest activities like flying clubs, movie theaters, vehicle storage, kennels, and leisure travel which includes AmericanForcesTravel.com. Discount tickets may be available, but know that sometimes the vendors put restrictions on who can buy/use them, so all of the tickets might not be authorized. The MWR facilities that directly support mission readiness or support for military members and their families are not included, like gyms, fitness centers, libraries, child development programs, etc.\nLandra, I wanted to correct my earlier response. In-person tickets and travel offices are still a gray-area MWR activity. Even though you have to pay for these purchases, technically, they are not a revenue-generating MWR activities by DoD’s definition. I just found out that DoD is still working out the policy for MWR activities that fall into this gray area. They should have it sorted out before January 1.\nHello all,\nI am a 60% veteran but have no idea what is a MWR facility that everyone is speaking of. Can someone help me with this information?\nAnd that you for extended the offer, it’s much appreciated..\nHappy belated Veterans Day to you all\nGod belss\nMWR stands for morale, welfare, and recreation.\nhttps://www.navymwr.org/\nThey typically will schedule outings and trips that you can sign up for. Also have good resources for tickets to theme parks and events in your area at discounted rates. Most have rental equipment from campers to kayaks, and bounce houses. Even had one that would rent ATV’s.\nMWR is a military acronym that stands for Morale, Welfare and Recreation. The term is given to a complete range of community support and quality of life programs for members of the Armed Forces, their families, and retirees at more than 2,000 facilities on U.S. military bases throughout the world.\nI am Floyd w Jones Jr I am service connected I am still whiting on my rating can I still apply\nFloyd, you won’t be able to access military installations or the benefits unless you’ve got a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card. DoD needs this for visual verification of identity and eligibility, because not everyone who has a VHIC is eligible for these benefits.\nI am a 60% service-connected Vietnam veteran. Does my income matter for getting the VHIC?\nMWR stands for morale, welfare, and recreation.\nhttps://www.navymwr.org/\nThey typically will schedule outings and trips that you can sign up for. Also have good resources for tickets to theme parks and events in your area at discounted rates. Most have rental equipment from campers to kayaks, and bounce houses. Even had one that would rent ATV’s.\nHow would we be able to shop at commissaries without a military id (just the VHIC)? They don’t have online shopping and almost all locations are inside a military base, which requires a military id. Are they going to allow those with only a VHIC on bases now?\nYou’ll use your VA Healthcare ID to initially get on base then get a DOD ID issued for access to the BX. That’s how it worked when I got my card 5 years ago. Your spouse is also eligible for their own ID card.\nDavid, if you have a DoD ID card, then you have eligibility as a military retiree or a veteran with a 100% service-connected condition. These new categories of eligible veterans are not eligible to obtain a DoD ID card and their family members are not authorized these privileges or ID cards, either.\nKelly, for veterans who are eligible in the new categories, DoD is going to accept the Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card as proof of identity and eligibility for entering an installation and accessing the commissary, exchange, or MWR retail facilities. Because the VHIC displays the new veteran categories clearly on the front of the card, it is easy to differentiate between a VHIC that is eligible (has one of the categories I mentioned) or ineligible (doesn’t have one of the categories). It’s more complicated for the primary family caregivers. Until the VA start issuing them an ID card, DoD has agreed to accept a letter from the VA Office of Community Care that indicates the primary family caregiver is eligible for DoD privileges. Primary family caregivers will have to bring this eligibility letter and an acceptable credential (like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport) with them to access the installation or any of the eligible facilities.\nHello, my name is Annette and my question is will I be eligible if I do not have a disability but I am a veteran?\nNo, sorry.\nYou must have a service connected disability in order to be eligible. Meaning something happened while on active duty and you are being treated for it thru VA. 0 to 90% disability.\n0-90% is the rating. So I think you’re still eligible.\nAnnette, veterans who meet any of the new criteria for in-person access must be either Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, or have a VA-documented service-connected disability rating (new rating levels are 0-90%, because 100% already have privileges). While all honorably discharged veterans are not eligible for this new in-person access, they are eligible for the Veterans Online Shopping Benefit that launched on November 11, 2017 and gives online military exchange access to all honorably discharged veterans.\nIf I am understanding correctly, I, as a 30% service-connected disability rated veteran, can access the commissaries and exchanges but not the American Forces Travel benefit? Is that correct? I do have a VHIC.\nThanks!\nWhat it states is that if an eligible veteran (PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW, SERVICE CONNECTED) does not possess a Veteran Health Identification Card they will not have access to DoD and Coast Guard installations but will have full access to online exchanges and American Forces Travel. You must be a veteran whose VHIC card indicates you have a PURPLE HEART, are a FORMER POW or are SERVICE CONNECTED to access a military base and go to any of the available services on that base, including the use of American Forces Travel online and at the base.\nOTHERWISE, all honorably discharged veterans are eligible for online military exchange shopping through the Veterans Online Shopping Benefit ONLY. They cannot go on base, and they cannot use the American Forces Travel service.\nI hope that helps clarify things.\nIf I am understanding correctly, I, as a 30% service-connected disability rated veteran, can access the commissaries and exchanges but not the American Forces Travel benefit? Is that correct?\nThanks!\nNope..you will be able to access the travel site as well\nErin, AmericanForcesTravel.com is DoD’s online leisure travel booking website and it is a revenue-generating MWR activity, so if your VHIC says “SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front below your photo, then you may begin to use it as of January 1. (And the commissaries and exchanges, too.)\nSo if you are 60% disabled you are qualified to get commissary privileges. Does that require a didn’t veterans health card\nYou’re VA Healthcare ID has to say “Service Connected” on it in order to get on base. Then go to the ID card office and get a DOD ID.\nDavid, the new categories of veterans (Purple Heart recipients, former POWs, and veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings) are not eligible to obtain a DoD ID card. DoD has agreed to accept their Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card for installation and privilege access.\nJackie, if you’ve got a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card, you’re all set. Your VHIC will serve as your proof of identity and eligibility for accessing installations and the DoD privileges. You are not eligible for a DoD ID card, so DO NOT go the ID card office on an installation to try to get one as David suggests. He is mistaken.\nI am a disabled Vet with 60% am I eligible to shop st the commissary? My disability is service connected.\nYes\nTerry, a 60% service-connected disability rating makes you eligible, but you also have to have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card for installation and privilege access at the installation commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facilities. If you don’t have a VHIC, visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nHello, I am a 100% Disabled Veteran at the Housebound rate and live in Germany. I had a DAY military ID card issued when I still lived in Florida. Can I now shop in the PX and Commissary here in Germany? 7 years ago the staff there told me I couldn’t. Thank you.\nBettina, the status of forces agreement, international law, and/or agreements with host nations that currently prevents your access to the commissary and exchange in Germany as a 100% disabled veteran will likely also prevent access under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018. U.S. law only applies to the United States and the U.S. territories and possessions.\nCan wife,girlfriends,siblings,kids be sponsored by us veterans to come in and shop or use the MWR facilities?\nThis is for the PURPLE HEART, FORMER POW or SERVICE CONNECTED veteran ONLY. For anyone else going on the base with you, they must first be cleared by base security and get a pass for the day. You have to be the one making the purchases. There may be other restrictions for use of MWR services and travel too, that I do not know.\nYour spouse and dependent children are eligible for an ID as well. I’m rated at 100% and had this privilege for 5 years already and my spouse also has an ID card.\nDavid, spouses and dependent children of the new categories of veterans are not eligible for these privileges or for DoD or VA ID cards. As a veterans with a 100% service-connected condition, you have eligibility for different privileges than these new veterans and caregivers for veterans.\nLuis, newly eligible veterans will need to have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. This ID will work for installation and privilege access at the installation commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facilities. Only the eligible veteran can make purchases, but your guests could accompany you onto the installation and into the facilities. They will also have to go through the visitor control center at the installation and must show an acceptable credential to go through the standard security screening (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are the easiest documents to bring).\nDavid is actually totally wrong. Family members are not authorized privileges or credentials under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018. It sounds like David is eligible under DoD policy as a 100% disabled veteran, which does authorize privileges and ID cards for family members.\nYour information on privileges should be more concise because anyone living outside the United States has to follow the regulations of the country they are living in, for example, if you live in Europe there is a SOFA agreement and just because you served does not mean you can use this privilege. You must first obtain pass privileges to get onto a military base then you must acquire a Customs Card for both Husband and Wife if they want to shop in an Exchange store or go to the Commissary. Please update this information because so many will be disappointed if not brought up to date.\nDarrel, you are correct in that access at installations in overseas foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host nations. You should always check the restrictions before you go.\nJust want to make sure I have the correct info\nI am a server connected veteran and form what I have read your saying I have access to my local base which is Macdill air force base in Tampa fl?\nI have my ID Card will I need any other info ?\nRaymond, if your ID card is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, then you’re set. If the VHIC isn’t the ID card you have, you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nThis applies to recreation (MWR) retail facilitie, but will this also allow access to MWR facilities such as FAMCAMP(RV) parks?\nYes. You will need all of your vehicle information. IE license, proof of insurance, also a secondary form of ID.\nDylan, yes, RV parks are included.\nEveryone keep in mind that having a VHIC does NOT automatically allow you entry onto a military installation. The VHIC is just for use at the Commissary, Exchange, etc. You will still need to have to go through the process for entry to any installation unless you already possess a military ID card.\nYour VA Healthcare ID will get you on base as long as it says “Service Connected”. You’ll have to go to the military ID card office on base and get a DOD ID Card (Department of Defense/Uniformed Services).With that card, you will have access to military bases, the BX, the commissary, and MWR facilities, bowling centers, fitness gyms, discounted tickets to amusement parks, etc. I’m rated at 100% and have had these privileges for 5 years.\nKevin and David, let me try to help clear things up. The VHIC can be used by veterans with medical appointments and business at VA medical centers located on military installations to access those installations regardless of what it says on the front…but that’s only for installations that have VA medical centers. To access installations without VA medical centers, the VHIC must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” OR “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card. To access commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities, the VHIC must also display “PURPLE HEART,” FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED.” And, yes, VHIC holders will have to go through the same installation access security protocols as any visitor to an installation.\nDoD is not issuing ID cards for newly eligible veterans or caregivers. DoD is accepting the VHIC as proof of identity and eligibility for veterans and the caregiver eligibility letter paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a passport for proof of identity and eligibility for primary family caregivers.\nAlso, MWR facilities are limited to the MWR retail facilities like golf, bowling, restaurants, marinas, equipment check out, etc. Fitness centers, gyms, libraries, etc. are not authorized. And discount tickets may be restricted based on agreements with vendors. Just trying to manage expectations.\nKevin and David, I wanted to correct my earlier response. In-person tickets and travel offices are still a gray-area MWR activity. Even though you have to pay for these purchases, technically, they are not a revenue-generating MWR activities by DoD’s definition. I just found out that DoD is still working out the policy for MWR activities that fall into this gray area. They should have it sorted out before January 1.\nI am presently 10 percent disable. I would like to know how I get commissary privileges an any thing else that available. Who do I need to see at the va to get my health card showing my eligibility. I live in Tennessee.\nFirst and foremost, thank you for your service. Quick answer; YES! “Veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings”. Please understand your benefits as a veteran with the VA. My example to you; I and my wife are both USAF veterans. I have a 20% rating, and my wife with no disability, has a 0% disability rating. 0% is in fact a rating and gives you the privileges of service from the VA. So both of us receive this and many other benefits. To register for yours… Go to your local VA or VA advocate (usually can find one at the DAV or American Legion, VFW, etc…) and identify yourself as wanting to be rated. The process is much less lengthy than it used to be, so please do not fear the process. These are all benefits that you earned defending the values of America while in the United States military. I recommend that all prior service do this and see the VA! Hope this helps in any way. -Henry Willcox, SSGT, USAF.\nFrank, newly eligible veterans will need to show a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card to access military installations and commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facilities. If you’ve already got a VHIC, you’re set. If you don’t, you may want to visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility for the VHIC and the application process.\nAt this point I’m a 40% percent service connected as stated on my VA ID card. My question is can my dependent children /family accompany me & enter the exchange as well?\nI have the same question.. anyone know?\nMarisa, newly eligible veterans will need to have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. This ID will work for installation and privilege access at the installation commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facilities. Only the eligible veteran can make purchases, but your family member may accompany you onto the installation and into the facilities. They will also have to go through the visitor control center at the installation and must show an acceptable credential to go through the standard security screening (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are the easiest documents to bring).\nWhat percentage of service connection does it require? I am 30% service conectes.\nYes, if you have a VHIC with service-connected on it.\nuh, if you read the statement, it says 0-90%, those who are 100% disabled already have the eligibility.\n0 %\nGabriel, this benefit is available for veterans with service-connected disability ratings from 0-90%, so with a 30% service-connected disability rating, you are eligible. You also must have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card to access military installations and commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities beginning January 1.\nDouble standards everywhere! Vets who were not injured or have no service-connected disability were just as instrumental in the military effort as any other veteran. Why the double standard?\nThere is no double standard. “Veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings”. Make sure you read the full article before complaining about it.\nI totally agree with your sentiments. I think the access to the exchanges and facilities should be extended to all honorably discharged veterans, not just those with injuries. I completely understand that the degree of sacrifices varies extensively, some by choice (length of service and MOS selection) and some by chance. Some veterans were unfortunate enough to get a disability or worse and others who served equally or for a longer time were lucky enough not to get injured. I think they ALL deserve the privileges. I enlisted to active duty at 17 years old as a combat engineer and served in the regular army, MOS 12B. I was lucky enough to not get injured. It would be nice to be able to access some of these facilities once in a while…\nAgreed, it’s disrespectful and dishonorable to exclude all who have served and put there lives on the line for our country. As a Vietnam vet that was drafted into the military I can’t even allowed access to any military base! My wife is a civilian contractor, is allowed on base and has more access than I do!! Why are all the many thousands of veterans who were drafted dishonorned as though unworthy after serving risking life and limb for our country!\nA friend was dishonorably discharged and was told at separation that after 6 months he could submit and request a change from Dishonorable to Honorable Discharge, have you tried this? All they can do is say no!\nWhat double standard? if you chose to get out or did one contract that’s not our fault. Most of us were hurt and HAD to be Med boarded. If you want the perks, reenlist and do 20 years…problem solved.\nI’m retired and have a disability rating of 60%. I was not allowed to use the exchange when I went to visit my son in Germany even though I had a VA card and retired military card. Will retirees like me will ever be able to use AAEFFES overseas?\nMeredith, installations in overseas foreign countries are subject to status of forces agreements, international law, and other agreements with host nations. You should always find out the restrictions before you travel.\nHow can I receive a card to use the commissary? I am 20% disabled Thank you Richard Schlogl\nRichard, the DoD is accepting, as proof of eligibility for this benefit, the VA’s Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” OR “SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front of the card below your photo. If you’ve got a VHIC, then you’re good to go. If you don’t, you may want to go to https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility for the VHIC and the application process.\nI am a Nam-era vet as well as being stationed at Camp Lejuene. I have yet to receive my disability rating from the VA. Do I qualify to utilize the base commissary?\nJohn, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card, then you will have access beginning January 1.\nI hope this gets posted. I don’t have a request. I just want to make a statement. I was only in for 4 years (USAF) and never left the U.S. during the Vietnam War. To those who served in combat anywhere, any time, and especially to all, regardless of where you served, who dedicated their lives to military service, Thank You For My Freedom! God bless you for your service to our country.\nRon Vincent, thank you for your inspiring and uplifting message. It is especially needed during these fractious times. We all need to be more grateful for our great country, flaws and all.\nThanks Ron! I agree, I am very thankful for those who have, and who continue to serve our beautiful country and for the freedoms and blessings their service gives me. I also served in the Vietnam Era and never left the States. But those who served in combat situations certainly deserve the recognition, gratitude and support for their countrymen.\nI am a veteran with 10% service connected disability do I qualify?\nCopied from the article above:\nWho is eligible Jan. 1, 2020?\nVeterans\nPurple Heart recipients\nformer prisoners of war\nVeterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings\nDwayne, a 10% service-connected disability rating makes you eligible, but you also must have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card in order to access military installations and commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facilities.\nI am a Navy Retiree with 26 years living in Spain. I only have 10% disability. Retirees here do not have access to PX or Commissary will that be changed by this new law?\nJay, U.S. law only applies to the United States and the U.S. territories and possessions. Installations in overseas foreign countries are subject to status of forces agreements, international law, and other agreements with host nations. My guess is that if military retirees do not get access in Spain, then neither will veterans and caregivers.\nI am 84 year old retired air force vet with commissary and PX privileges but not officially disabled, will my id card no longer be accepted?\nIt will still be accepted because you are retired and served your time. Thanks for your service.\nWilliam, there is no change to the benefits that military retirees, Medal of Honor recipients, and 100% disabled veterans receive under DoD policy. This is a new benefit specifically for Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90%, and individuals assessed, approved, and designated as caregivers for eligible veterans under VA caregiver programs.\nDo MWR family camps qualify as “morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) retail facilities”? Are there lodging facilities run by MWR that fit in this category also??\nKimberly, RV campgrounds, recreational lodging like cabins and cottages, destination military recreation centers, and military hotel and resort properties are all MWR retail facilities.\nWill I be able to access overseas exchange locations? Specifically I would love to be able to shop at the Jebel Ali Free Zone Area (JAFZA) NEX in Dubai, UAE, but do not have access to get on “base”.\nWill my VHIDC now get me on site?\nI’d like to know as well. I tried earlier this year and it didn’t work.\nJames and Tim, installations in overseas foreign countries are subject to status of forces agreements, international law, and other agreements with host nations.\nHello I am a veteran currently retired from federal service and living in lovely Germany.My question to you are veterans overseas with a rating from 0-90 percent also eligible to use the Exchange and Commissary.Or is this new policy only for veterans stateside.I would like to know so that I can pass this good information to all my veterans living here overseas,thanks for listening to my question.\nRobert, U.S. law only applies to the United States and the U.S. territories and possessions. Installations in overseas foreign countries are still subject to status of forces agreements, international law, and other agreements with host nations.\nI received my VHIC card prior to my disability determination. Do I reapply to the VA for an upgraded card to identify me a a service connected disability veteran? Where on the VHIC card does it list that designation?\nWhen you are service connected disabled it will say so under your picture on your VHIC.\nKurtis, to access military installations and commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities, your VHIC will need to display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card. DoD needs the status printed on the card for visual verification of eligibility, because not all veterans who have a VHIC are eligible for this benefit.\nI am a veteran with a 10% service connected disability. Under this new act am I eligible to utilize the exchange and commissary?\nDella, veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90% are eligible for this benefit. If you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you will be able to access the exchange and commissary beginning January 1.\nHello Sir, my name is Charles E.Williams I’m currently 70 percent service connected. I live in Zushi japan. I have my VA service connected card.i am unemployable and in connected with the VA to receive 100%. My question is where do I go to get the other card to use the base facility, such as the commissary, the PX so on like I stated I am in the VA system .please guide to the right authority to use the base facility for me and my Wife.\nWaiting for your reply.\nThank you, Charles E.Williams served with Honor and Honorably discharge\nCharles, unfortunately the status of forces agreement with Japan does not allow veterans to access this benefit.\nThe article says any veteran with a 0-90% service-connected disability rating. Do you really mean 0%? Was that suppose to read 10%? 20%? 30%? If its 0% than ALL veterans are entitled.\nAccording to the VA 0% is still a rating.\nThere is a difference between a 0% rating and having no rating. 0% means you have gone through the disability claim process and the VA has determined you have a disability, but it is a very minor. No rating means you haven’t gone through the process or your claim was denied.\n0% means you have a recognized service-connected disability but are not receiving disability compensation because it is not severe enough.\nThe zero percent 0% rating is obtained by applying for any serviced connected injuries… You do/did this either prior to exiting service by initiating a “VA/ Physical Examination.”\nEx: you had frostbite on feet during service. During your exit, you took the VA physical and requested VA service connected for the current problems of old frostbite injury. The VA rates you 0% or higher. 0% is where they declare they won’t give you any monies. However, it is still a rating!!!. Hence, 0%- 90% is still a rating which now qualifies you to 1. Get on post and 2. Utilize the afore mentioned entitlements in article.\nNote*\nThose whom have applied for any VA ratings through the VA prior to exit from military or post service and received the 0% is still a disability rating!\nThese rules are confusing! My husband’s army service period qualifies him for Vietnam Era status. He was able to use educational benefits many years ago. Apparently he would not be qualified for in person commissary privileges, but what about online exchanges and American Forces Travel?\naccording to above section “Veterans eligible solely under this act who are not enrolled in or are not eligible to enroll in VA health care, or who are enrolled in VA health care, but do not possess a Veteran Health Identification Card will not have access to DoD and Coast Guard installations for in-person commissary, exchange, and MWR retail privileges, but will have full access to online exchanges and American Forces Travel.”\nJB, for in-person privileges, your husband would have to be a Purple Heart recipient, a former prisoner of war, or have a service-connected disability rating of 0-90%. If he doesn’t have any of those things, then he is eligible for the Veterans Online Shopping Benefit that was introduced on November 11, 2017. The Veterans Online Shopping Benefit allows any honorably discharged veteran to shop at the online military service exchanges from the comfort of home. He can access the online military exchange websites at the links in the blog post, above. He would not have access to AmericanForcesTravel, though.\nWhat percentage do you have to be to use this program just wondering because I do have a disability at a low percentage can you tell me what percentage you have to be\nRoy, to be eligible for this benefit, you would need to be a Purple Heart recipient, a former prisoner of war, or have a service-connected disability rating anywhere from 0-90%. In addition, you need to have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front of the card below your photo to access installations and commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities.\nSo I would be eligible as a 0% service connected veteran if I understand the qualifications correctly?\nTimothy, veterans with a 0% service-connected disability rating who have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card will be able to access this benefit beginning on January 1.\nJW,\nCould you please confirm that statement? I have recently enrolled in the VA Health system, have a 10% disability rating for over 30 years, and when I received my VHIC card, it did not state “service connected”. Went back about 2 months ago to report it, and get a new card, and was told that only 20% and above VHIC cards state “service connected” on them. This is going to pose a problem with me getting these benefits.\nHow will this effect Veterans living in Germany. Are the restrictions on rationed items and the need for a “Pink Card” with it’s requirement to pay 17,5% on purchases at the German customs office still required? I retired after almost 26 yrs of service with an honorable discharge and my 20 yr letter and have a 70% VA disability rating.\nMatthew, the status of forces agreement, international laws, and other agreements with the host nation will still apply. My guess is that your situation in Germany will not change.\nI am a Vietnam Era veteran with a less than 10 percent rating. About 2 weeks ago I visited the VA office in San Diego. When I had previously read about the new benefits as of January 2020, I was advised by the ID card benefits office that I did not qualify because I did not meet the salary requirements (I made more that their guidelines).\nMy question to you is, who is correct, your printed information provided in this article or the VA guidelines provided to me.\nAlejo, there is a small group of veterans with a 0% service-connected disability rating whose income is too high to be eligible to obtain a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC). Unfortunately, that is the only secure, scannable VA credential that DoD can use to verify identity and eligibility for all of the newly eligible veterans under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018. DoD and VA are working on a solution for you and will provide updated information as soon as there is an answer, but it won’t be before January 1.\nI have 60% disability and enrolled in the VA Health Care but living overseas. In order for me to get the VHIC I will need to fly back to U.S. and that will probably cost me about $1000. There is an USAF base near by but they are not issuing VHIC. How am I suppose to get my VHIC without spending all that money? Why can’t they do it online thru ebenefits just like being able to attach your picture and print the veteran ID card? I mean just take a picture I shouldn’t have to spend all that money.\nJohn, this benefit may not be available at your location overseas, so make sure you check that first, before you decide whether or not to make a trip to get a VHIC. Privileges at installations in overseas foreign countries are subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host nations.\nWhy is the VA so poorly run at almost everything there can possibly be?\nI don’t know what your VA experience(s) have been like, Derek, but I have been a VA patient since 4/2009, and have had well over 300 appointments at NorCal/Bay Area facilities for many problems related to Agent Orange. I was treated for 7 years for cancer but have been in remission for over a year: I am calling that a da*ned good success, rather than “a failure.”\n.\nI was at a VA clinic yesterday and despite their ongoing expansions, it was hard to n.v find a parking space. That is true of the various VA’s that I go to. Your claim that the VA can’t do anything right is definitely *NOT* what most Veterans are experiencing.\n.\nWith over 100 hospitals and over 1,000 clinics, and 375,000 employees (over *half* of whom are Veterans), there is probably going to be a glitch here-and-there: and that is unacceptable. But the overwhelmingly vast majority of VA-Veteran experiences and interactions are positive. Veterans pretty consistently give the VA about a 90% approcal/ satisfaction r as ting and would recommend VA healthcare to other Veterans.\nI have been in the VA system since 2003. I have had multiple heart and cancer issues, all treated thru the VA. The care I received from the caregivers has been great ! The problems I have encountered are with the government and the people employed to operate this vast system of healthcare. I have been treated at six {6) VA facilities and had to use an advocate at four (4) of these facilities. The advocates I worked with have ALL been great. The problem and question is, why do I have to get an advocate involved before I can receive quality care ? Apparently the advocates are receiving better training or orientation before they are placed in their respective positions of employment. It appears to me the rest of the people employed by the VA are programed or wound up and sent on their way, to learn as they go. The problem with this method of operation is we the veterans or the advocates are left with the responsibility of explaining to the doctors and their staff how this system is suppose to work. It is past time to teach the VA employees more than last name, last four {4} of S.S. apparently those with advanced training do ask if you receive travel pay. If they have not received this training yet they will send you to another line. The bigger problem is, why do I have to get an advocate involved before I can receive the quality of care that I have the right to expect? Everybody has a supervisor so the necessary training starts at the top. Sadly the higher you climb this ladder it turns into a political system . The higher ups continue to feather their nests and the suicide rates continue to climb. I do not wish to become a victim of this political system!!\nDo these new benefits include access to famcamps?\nJim, RV campgrounds, recreational lodging like cabins and cottages, destination military recreation centers, and military hotel and resort properties are all MWR retail facilities and are included.\nWith these new benefits for service connected disabled , will one be able to purchase Disney salute to service theme park discount tickets at the MWR office?\nThat’s what I want to know, too! Disney tickets are expensive!\nBenjamin and Sally, access to discounted tickets at the installation MWR ticket offices will be subject to any restrictions or limitations put on them by the vendors. I can tell you from experience, the Disney Salute tickets are heavily restricted and usually available only for active duty personnel, retirees, and their dependents. In addition, those members must show their military ID cards at the park to activate the tickets, so if one was purchased or given to someone that did not have the authority to activate it, it would not be good at the park.\nwill the current VA id card i have work for the commissary and exchange?\nWilliam, if the current VA ID card you have is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, it will work for access to the exchange and commissary beginning on January 1.\nI do have a VA card but do not have a service connected disability of any rating. Do I have access to the commissary?\nI AM IN THE SAME SITUATION. I HAVE A VA CARD, BUT DO NOT HAVE A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY. OR SO THEY SAID AT MY DISCHARGE. MY ASTHMA WAS MADE SEVERELY WORSE WHEN I WAS STATIONED IN THE GREAT LAKES AREA BY A COUPLE OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS. AFTER THE INFECTIONS, MY ASTHMA BECAME SEVERE FOR MANY MONTHS. I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY BECAUSE I HAD HAD ASTHMA PREVIOUSLY; HOWEVER, NOT TO THIS EXTENT. NOW, MY LUNG CAPACITY IS VERY MINIMUM AND I AM 76 YEARS OLD, A VIET NAM VET (STATIONED IN U.S.).\nI AM ALSO A RETIRED DOD EMPLOYEE AND AM ABLE TO USE SOME OF THE BASE’S FACILITIES, BUT WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE COMMISSARY AND EXCHANGE. THE INFO GIVEN FOR THE UPCOMING CHANGE CAN BE TAKEN SEVERAL WAYS AND WAS NOT THAT CLEAR.\nPLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING MORE ON THIS.\nCindy and Barbara, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC), but it doesn’t display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front of the card under your photo, then you will not have access to this benefit.\nThe trouble is usually getting on base. They seem oblivious at the gate what a VHIC is. Hopefully this information makes it’s way to all installation commanders and local AAFES managers. I’ve had privileges for some time but it’s a challenge getting on base or checking out at the exchange.\nJon, currently, I believe VHIC holders can only access installations with VA medical centers using their VHIC, but VHIC holders do not have access to commissaries or exchanges. Beginning January 1, VHIC holders whose cards display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card will be able to access military installations in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions to use commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities.\ni have a VA id to check in at my clinic. will this work for the exchange and commissary?\nWilliam, if that VA ID is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card, it will work for access to the exchange and commissary beginning on January 1.\nAn honorably discharged Veteran with zero percent disability status is eligible so long as they have a Veterans Health ID card?\nYou must be service connected to be eligible\nJerry, veterans who are Purple Heart recipients, veterans who are former prisoners of war, and veterans with service-connected disability ratings of 0-90% will be eligible for privileges on January 1. To prove eligibility at military installations and commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities, these veterans will need to show a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card.\nI’m a 90% disabled Veteran so I’m looking forward to this privalge. Will my spouse, also a Veteran but not service connected, and underage children have access as well, or just me?\nKimberly, this benefit is only for the eligible veterans and eligible caregivers for veterans (currently primary family caregivers for eligible veterans under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers). Spouses and children do not get the benefit, but they can accompany you when you go to the installation facilities, they just can’t make any purchases.\nDo service connected military members get base Gym access as well?\nNo. Gyms are considered mission essential facilities for our active duty personnel.\nunless it has changed,not all that great, they are just commercial store now. i guess you save on state taxes.but depending on how far you have to drive.or me that is over 2 hours each way.\nI also qualify for this. What other credentials, if any, would I need to use any of the base or post facilities near me? Would my non-veteran wife be able to join me?\nCarl, newly eligible veterans will need to have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. This ID will work for installation and privilege access at the installation commissary, exchange, and MWR retail facilities. Only the eligible veteran can make purchases, but your wife could accompany you onto the installation and into the facilities. She will also have to go through the visitor control center at the installation and must show an acceptable credential to go through the standard security screening (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are the easiest documents to bring).\nWhat if I am 70% being paid at 100% unemployibility service connected?\nJames, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under your photo on the front of the card, then you’re good to go. 70% service-connected is eligible.\nThis new privilege is great, however, no mention is made on how we disabled veterans are going to be able to get base access to be able to use these exchanges, commissaries, and MWR facilities. So, will our VA-issued ID work? Thanks.\nDave, the fact sheet located at http://www.militaryonesource.mil/expanding-access actually goes into great detail on how to get access to installations.\nNewly eligible veterans will need to present a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displaying “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below the photo on the front of the card at the installation visitor control center on the first visit. At visitor control, they will verify your identity and purpose for the visit, then they will run a basic on-the-spot background check. If you’ve got a felony conviction, felony arrest, or other type of derogatory information related to criminal history or terrorism, you will not be permitted on the installation. If you’re cleared to enter the installation and the installation has ID enrollment capability, then you can have your VHIC enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at visitor control for future visits. At commissaries, exchanges, and MWR retail facilities, you show your VHIC at the point of sale to verify your eligibility.\nOut-freaking-standing! Thank you, sir.\nAs a surviving spouse of a disabled veteran receiving DIC due to his service-connected death, will I be eligible in January for commissary privileges?\nI am in the same position. I receive DIC and have a VA medical card. Am I eligible?\nKaren and Heidi, I am so sorry for your losses. Unfortunately, no, you will not be eligible for these privileges. The privileges are not transferable.\nas a Marine Corps Veteran with a 70% Service related Disability…will I get this Privilege?\nPatrick, yes, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card.\nI am a 100% service connected VA, but my discharge was General, with this change will I now be able to use the on base privileges (Commissary or Exchange).\nI am a 100% service connected VA, but my discharge was General, with this change will I now be able to use the on base privileges (Commissary or Exchange)\nBob, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you will be eligible to use the commissary and exchange beginning January 1.\nI spent 8 years as a Naval Reservist amnd am not able to receive this honor; when someone who is a caregiver can.\nSomething seems very wrong with that picture This needs\nto be rethought all over again.\nWhere is the fairness to all veterans? We could be given at least a 50 per cent shopping privelege.\nShame.\nBeing a service connected disabled veteran will I have the ability to take my spouse with to these facilities?\nRobert, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” OR “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, then you will be eligible to access the base and your spouse can be your guest. You will have to stop at the visitor control center the first time they accompany you and they will have to go through the standard required security check. They will have to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. They can go with you into the facilities, but they will not be allowed to make any purchases.\nI am 70% service connected does my wife and kids have the ability to access the bases?\nWith proper ID they can access the base i.e. Government ID, Driver’s license issued but the state, passport ID card etc. As long as its government issued with a photo. Thats what I was told at the gate at Ft Drum, NY\nMichael, unless your wife and kids are authorized DoD privileges in their own right, they cannot access the base on their own. If you have a Veteran Health Identification Card that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” OR “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, then you are eligible to access the base and they can be your guests. You will have to stop at the visitor control center the first time they accompany you and they will have to go through the standard required security check. Depending on their ages, they will have to have an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport.\nDoes This includes Child youth services as well?\nMonica, no. It does not include child care.\nI’m confused, and was wondering what steps I need to take. I am 50% service connected Vietnam Veteran. I had\nbeen exposed to Agent Orange, and have certain health problems occur.\nAm I required to fill out a form for commissary and exchange privileges? I have my Dod VA Healthcare Benefits.\nThank you for your response.\nRalph, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front of the card below your photo, then you have what you need to access commissary and exchange privileges on January 1. If you do not have the VHIC, then you should visit https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/ for information regarding eligibility and the application process.\nWhat exactly does 100% Service Connected mean? I served active duty, am a member of the American Legion, Honorably Discharged with my DD214. I have no clue as to what I am entitled to. Thank you, Dana\nAre you disabled?? “Service connected” is your percentage of disability that was caused by the military. Just because you served and are a veteran does not entitle you to this benefit. 100% Service connected means 100% disabled due to the fault of military service… an injury or disability at no fault of your own during service. If your VA health ID does not say “service connected”, then you’re not service connected. It’s not for all veterans.\nI read the FAQ’s and looked over every question about what you can and cannot buy at the Commissary or BX. It says Veterans eligible for access under this new law cannot buy anything related to military uniforms.\nI’m a DoD civilian with the AF and we have shopping privileges at the small BX on the Air Reserve Base. Restrictions in place now are no uniforms, no alcohol and no tobacco.\nI have 10% rating for tinnitus and I have a VHIC already as well as my civilian CAC card. Once this new law takes effect will eligible Veterans under this new law be able to purchase alcohol/tobacco at the BX?\nThomas, DoD civilians are not authorized commissary access in the United States and are only authorized limited access to convenience items at certain military exchange mini marts and express stores. With a VHIC that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” below your photo on the front of the card, you will have much broader access to military exchange stores and products, so I would recommend that after January 1, you use your VHIC at the point of sale in the exchange instead of your civilian CAC card. With the VHIC, only uniform items will be off limits.\nI have my VHIC, in January what do I do? Go to the my local base’s ID card office to get a base access card made, or is the VHIC my access card for base privileges? furthermore, will I be able to bring my family members or fiance on base with me? does this extend to all bases across the CONUS and abroad?\nDavid, DoD is not issuing ID cards to veterans or caregivers of veterans who qualify for these privileges under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018. Because eligibility is tied to VA-determined status, DoD is allowing the use of the Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) for newly eligible veterans, because this card displays the eligibility status under the veteran’s photo on the front of the card (“PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED”); and, for primary family caregivers, an eligibility letter from the VA Office of Community Care paired with an acceptable credential like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport.\nIn January, you can bring the approved credential to the installation visitor control center you wish to access and go through the required security check that all visitors to the installation must go through. If the installation has ID enrollment capability and your criminal history/terrorism check comes back clean, your VHIC (or acceptable credential for primary family caregivers) can be enrolled so that you don’t have to stop at visitor control every visit.\nYou are allowed to bring guests with you, but they will also have to stop at visitor control before entering the base; and they will not be allowed to make any purchases. Your guests will also have to have an acceptable credential (the REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or U.S. passport are the easiest) and go through the same background check.\nThis benefit is available in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions. Access at installations in overseas foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host nations.\nWhat is a service-connected Veteran?\nAre you disabled?? “Service connected” is your percentage of disability that was caused by the military. Just because you served and are a veteran does not entitle you to this benefit. 100% Service connected means 100% disabled due to the fault of military service… an injury or disability at no fault of your own during service. If your VA health ID does not say “service connected”, then you’re not service connected. It’s not for all veterans.\nWhat is a service-connected Veteran? I am a Cold War vet with no “official” service-connected disabilities. Am I a service-connected Veteran?\nI’m 20% DAV. Are the prices at the exchange any better than retail?\nWill my Veteran Health Identification Card get me on base to utilize the Base Exchange and Commissary?\nConnie, if your Veteran Health Identification Card displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath your photo on the front of the card, then you’re set.\nIt only took 54 yrs. for my disability to get beyond 0%. So thankful to learn that I’ll have commissary & exchange access after 1/01/20. Is the VA card I now have with the words “Service Connected” on the front sufficient to use & also how does one go about finding the nearest locations of these participating exchanges/commissaries??\nStan, if the ID card you have is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) and “SERVICE CONNECTED” is displayed underneath your photo on the front of the card, then it sounds like you’ve got what you need. Try the links in this blog post to find commissary and exchange locations.\nStan, if the ID card you have is a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) and “SERVICE CONNECTED” is displayed underneath your photo on the front of the card, then you’re all set for access on January 1. All of the Military Service commissaries and exchanges in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions are participating. You can search for them if you click on the exchange and commissary links in this blog post, above. Commissaries and exchanges on installations in overseas foreign countries are subject to status of forces agreement, international law, and other host country agreements.\nStan, if the ID you have is the Veteran Health Identification Card and it displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath your photo on the front of the card, then you’re good to go for shopping on January 1. All of the commissaries and exchanges in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions are participating. You can find where they are located by searching in the links in the blog post, above.

All of the Military Service commissaries and exchanges in the United States and in the U.S. territories and possessions are participating. You can find out where they are by searching locations at the links for each of the retail organizations in the blog post above. Participation at installations in overseas foreign countries is limited by the status of forces agreements, international law, and other agreements with the host countries.\nAre service connected Vets allowed to accompany a guest to the exchange as well?\nCurtis, are you asking if a newly eligible service-connected veteran can bring a guest with them to the exchange? If so, the answer is yes. The guest cannot make any purchases, but they can accompany the eligible service-connected veteran into the store. Keep in mind that the veteran and guest will have to stop at the installation visitor control center for the standard security checks to enter the installation. As you know, the veteran will have to show their Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card; and the guest will need to have an acceptable credential with them (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are usually the easiest).\nI am Vietnam Veteran with 40% disability.\nI have a VA issued ID card. To be clear do I\nUnderstand that I now have Commissary\nPrivilege to shop at nearby Air Force Base?\nThis would be terrific!\nThanks,\nCharles H. Collins\nUSAF 1967 to 1971\nCharles, a VA ID card will not get you access to the commissary, but a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card will. If you’ve got a VHIC that has any of these three eligibilities printed on it, then you’re good to go for shopping beginning January 1 (or January 2, as the commissary will be closed for the Federal holiday).\nDo these new privileges extend to military RV parks and facilities?\nYes.\nHello,\nDoes this pertain to overseas veterans that are also service connected?\nThank you\nRoman\nAccess in overseas foreign countries is subject to status of forces agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host countries.\nCan you tell me if the Hale Koa Resort in Hawaii is a MWR facility that will be accessible as described in this article beginning January 2020.\nThank you.\nGillian, yes, the Hale Koa Resort is an MWR facility, owned and operated by the Army’s Armed Forces Recreation Centers and access to it is included in these benefits. If you are a veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart, a veteran who was a former prisoner of war, a veteran who has a service-connected disability rating of 0-90%, or an individual assessed, approved, and designated as the primary family caregiver of an eligible veteran under the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, then you will be eligible to make reservations here beginning January 1.\nI have a service connected disability and I think I am qualified. There is a recreation center on the lake close by me. Will I be able to access that MWR location under these rules? Am I also now going to be able to access the commissary?\nJames, if you have a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card, then you should be able to access the commissary. I’m not sure if you’d also have access to the recreation center, depends on what kind it is.\nDo I need to get a new VA ID card if I got it before I became service connected? Is there anything different on the card to identify that I’m service connected?\nNewly eligible veterans cannot use a VA ID card to access these benefits on DoD installations, only the Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC). And, the VHIC must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card. If you have a VHIC and it does not display “SERVICE CONNECTED,” then you need to get a new card. DoD needs to be able to visually verify your eligibility and not everyone who has a VHIC is eligible for this benefit.\nI am a veteran from actuve duty Army 1984-1987.\nI have a Veteran Health Identification Card and recieve trwatment at the VA.\nI did not file for disabilty and did not have purple heart or medal of honor. Am I eligible for these new on base benefits. They do let us shop at the exchange at the Washington Dc veteran medical center. I am interested in using the morale support facilites ie craft shop etc.\nFrancis, if your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displays ‘PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath your photo on the front of the card, then you are eligible. If it doesn’t display any of these things, then you are not. My guess is that you are shopping at the Veterans Canteen Service store at the Washington DC Veteran Medical Center, not a Military Service exchange. They are very similar.\nUnder this new law, can Veterans who become eligible starting January 1, 2021 access the base with a guest/spouse or girlfriend etc? I’m 90% Service connected and wondering if I can bring a guest on base to help me shop? Or does the guest have to be a caregiver etc?\nChris, good news for you, these benefits start on January 1, 2020! And you should be able to bring a guest on base with you, but they will have to stay with you the whole time and they will have to go through the same visitor control process to get on the installation. Make sure they bring an acceptable credential with them (a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport are the easiest documents). Your guest can accompany you into the stores, too, but they can’t make any purchases, only you.\nIf we already have a VHIC but it doesn’t state “SERVICE CONNECTED” despite being service connected (got the card before I filed for disability), do we need to get a new card or will it still work?\nIt must state Service Connected according to the article.\nStephanie, you need to get a new VHIC that displays “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card. This is required for visual verification of eligibility, because not everyone who has a VHIC is eligible for these benefits.\nSo, is my understanding correct that one of the requirements for eligibility is to have some service connected disability and have a va health card that says you have a disability?\nNewly eligible veterans must meet one of these eligibility criteria: 1) Purple Heart recipient; 2) former prisoner of war; or 3) service-connected disability rating of 0-90%. To gain access to the benefits on DoD installations, these veterans must present a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC).\nI am a disabled Vet with a VA ID Card. Can I take my spouse with my to the Commissaries and Exchange?\nChad, you can’t access an installation with a VA ID card, only with a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of the card. If you’ve got the VHIC as described here, you will be able to access commissaries and exchanges. Your spouse can go into the stores with you, but they cannot make any purchases, only you as the authorized shopper.\nHow do I obtain a Veterans Health Identification Card?\nHow do I obtain a Veterans Health Identification Card?\nI already have my VHIC, but my question is, how do I get aboard base to exchange/commissary without a vehicle decal? Will I be required to get a visitor pass each visit?\nVehicle decals are not required. On your first visit to an installation, stop at the visitor control center and show them your VHIC that displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card. The security folks will have to run a basic background check for criminal history and terrorism. If you’re cleared, you will have access. If the installation has ID enrollment capabilities, you can be enrolled for recurring access so that you don’t have to stop at visitor control every time you want to go shopping.\nI’m 0% service connected and under the act eligible to get on base BUT the VA says I’m not able to get a card because I’m 0% so what is the problem here? One contradicts the other.\nSIRS: I was in the USAF( active duty – honorable discharge} from 1963 – 1967. Would I qualify for this new benefit?\nThank You\nJerome Miller\nThis new benefit is available for veterans who are Purple Heart recipients, veterans who are former prisoners of war, and veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings, so if you fall into any of these groups you would qualify.\nOne less thing the fight for P and T will go down\nThis may be great news for me. I am a Vietnam Vet with a 30% disability. I am registered and do have the Veterans Health ID Card. But, I live in South Korea. I retired here after working for a Defense Contractor in 2016. Will I be able to use the Base facilities here at Camp Carroll?\nChuck, unfortunately this benefit is not accessible in South Korea due to the status of forces agreement with South Korea.\nHello,\nI’m a disabled veteran with a 10% disability rating.\nI am currently living out of country in Japan with my wife. How can I get the identification card and will it be sent to my address here in Japan.\nTimothy, the status of forces agreement in Japan does not allow veterans and caregivers in these new eligibility categories to access installations or these privileges.\nso does this new commissary access etc starting in Jan 2020 mean anyone with a VA Healthcare card has access? I have no service related injury or disability nor am I a purple heart recipeint (Bless those folks), nor am I a former POW (again, bless you folks) but I do have VA healthcare and a VA healthcare card but just as an enrollee no special circumstances? Thank you for any knowledge anyone has on this new development\nNo. The Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) must display “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” under the photo on the front of the card.\nBX not a real benefit since their prices have gotten so high.\nJust making sure that I am understanding this correctly. So, if I have a VA card for healthcare, I can go commissary & PX? Thank you.\nFrank, as long as your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” or “SERVICE CONNECTED” underneath the photo on the front of your card, you should be eligible to shop at the commissary and exchange beginning January 1.\nI am a veteran and I do have a VA health card but I have not submitted a claim for benefits. Will I be able to access these benefits come January?\nIf your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) displays “PURPLE HEART,” “FORMER POW,” OR “SERVICE CONNECTED” on the front underneath your photo, you should be able to access the benefits beginning January 1.\nJW, you are a very patient person!\nIf your dependent is 23 and enrolled in college can she get ID card for commissary and PX\nLarry, not under this expanded access benefit for veterans who were awarded the Purple Heart, veterans who are former POWs, and veterans with 0-90% service-connected disability ratings.\nAm I correct in reading that veterans without any disability are excluded at this time? I have my Veteran ID card. Not a VHIC. I do have access to military installations with my government CAC, as I am a contractor working on base. I am still not able to shop in store, only online, correct? Thank you.\nCorrect.\nI’m a little confused I’ve always used commissary and PX wherever I went as a Veteran. What am I missing here.\nMy guess is that you are either a Military Service retiree, a Medal of Honor recipient, or a 100% disabled veteran.\nI qualify for the access in January. Is my non-veteran spouse and child allowed to access the base to go to the commissary with me?\nNo. Only the veterans and caregivers eligible solely under the Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 will have these privileges. The veterans and caregivers eligible are veterans who were awarded the Purple Heart, veterans who are former prisoners of war, veterans with a Department of Veterans Affairs-documented service-connected disability rating of 0-90 percent and individuals approved and designated as the primary family caregiver of an eligible veteran under the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Eligibility for these privileges is tied to eligibility for and enrollment in specific VA programs. Family members of these eligible veterans and caregivers who are not eligible for these privileges in their own right are not authorized privileges.\nVeterans who are Medal of Honor recipients and veterans with a VA-documented service-connected disability rating of 100 percent, as well as their authorized family members are eligible for privileges in previously established Department of Defense policy.\nHi Kevin, thank you for your service. They won’t have shopping privileges, unless your spouse is a caregiver, but they should be able to accompany you. Please see your local base for access information.\nI called Luke AFB with the same question and they told me no\nChris, if you qualify for access, then you will be able take guests on the installation and into the facilities with you. They will have to get vetted through the installation visitor control center, so they will need to have an acceptable credential with them like a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or a U.S. passport. In the facilities, they will not be allowed to make any purchases. And they will need to stay with you at all times while they are on the installation, so if you go to the exchange, they will need to go there with you, not to some other facility on the installation.\nI have the same question. I have a VHIC card and will qualify in January, can my wife accompany me to the base?\nBruce, if you qualify for access, then you will be able take guests on the installation and into the facilities with you.

I’m a 100% disabled vet, so I have a military ID card. However, I can bring friends on base with me with no problem. Only once has the guard ever looked at their drivers licenses.\nSo, this is only an educated guess, but I would assume you can bring guests with you so long as they remain with you at all times.\nBesides, I doubt the VA or the DoD would want to make you bowl alone :)\nChris, access is handled a little differently if you have a DoD-issued ID card, which these new categories of eligible veterans and caregivers won’t have.\nIf someone entering the installation with a VHIC or primary family caregiver letter/acceptable credential has guests in the car with them, they must stop at the visitor control center for the guests to be vetted. The good news is that if the installation has credential enrollment capabilities and the guests present an enrollable credential, they can get their credential enrolled so that they won’t have to stop at visitor control every time they accompany the eligible veteran or caregiver to the installation.\nYes I took family with me but you have to park at the gate and go in the guard station and sign them in and get a temporary pass for them.\nAnthony, it sounds like you have access by a different authority and you probably have a DoD-issued ID card, which these new categories of eligible veterans and caregivers won’t have.\nIf someone entering the installation with a VHIC or primary family caregiver letter/acceptable credential has guests in the car with them, they must stop at the visitor control center for the guests to be vetted.

I’ve called numerous VA Hotlines and talked to many sympathetic VA representatives, but still no solution. I am a 50% service-connected Vietnam-Era veteran. I live in Japan. I moved here in 1999 when I was assigned by the Department of Defense Dependents Schools to teach at Yokosuka Navy Base. I retired here two years ago.\nWhen I check the VA site and sign in to my account, it indicates that I am enrolled in the VA Health system. However, I do not have a current VHIC card, needed to access the new benefits taking effect January 1, 2020. I had one over twenty years ago. I am told that the only way I can get a replacement is to return to the United States-too expensive for me right now. However, according to “Department of Defense Expanding Access to Military Commissaries, Exchanges and Recreation Facilities” publication, “Veterans eligible for DoD and Coast Guard installation and privilege access through previously established DoD and Coast Guard policy (i.e.,Medal of Honor recipients and veterans with VA-documented service-connected disability ratings of 100 percent) may obtain a DoD identification card to facilitate installation and privilege access.” (Bottom of page 7 https://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Factsheets/expanding-access-fact-sheet.pdf from https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2015599/department-of-defense-expanding-access-to-commissaries-military-exchanges-and-r/ ) I have a DoD ID card, due to 21 years of Department of Defense employment. (over three years active duty and 18 years as a DoDDS educator) I am currently able to use it to access Yokosuka Navy Base and use MWR facilities and Navy Federal Credit Union, where my pension and TSP payments are deposited. My understanding of the above quoted policy would be, that since I have a DoD ID card “through previously established DoD and Coast Guard policy,” my DoD ID card could be updated to allow access to benefits starting January 1, 2020. Is my understanding correct, and if so, how do I apply for this update? I’m not sure when I will be able to travel back to the States, but will get a replacement VHIC at that time.\nAlvin,\nyou can actually go on to VA.gov and request a Veteran ID card. As long as you submit you information, they will mail it to you.\nGood luck!\nHi Alvin,\nI am not a representative of any type with the VA, only a veteran myself. I may not have an answer, but I wanted to suggest trying(or asking someone) if you can get your VHIC in the Philippines at the VA facility there since it’s much closer and cheaper to fly to. I have been considering moving to Japan myself and I’ve looked into that facility a couple times.\nFor a full report on Access :\nhttps://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Factsheets/expanding-access-fact-sheet.pdf\nOCONUS shopping on base is determined by the SOFA agreement.\nI do not thin this new benefit changes that… so no you will not be able to shop at the commissary in Japan.\nYou are correct, access in foreign countries overseas is subject to SOFA agreements, international laws, and other agreements with host countries.\nAlvin, the status of forces agreement in Japan does not allow veterans and caregivers in these new eligibility categories to access installations or these privileges.\nMy husband, 100% DAV, died on 30 Oct 19, can I still renew my card through Offutt?\nHi Brenda, I’m so sorry for your loss. Congress determines benefits for service members, and unfortunately shopping privileges at military exchanges are not extended to a surviving spouse when a service member passes away. Please see your local VA office or the ID Card Office at Offutt AFB about renewing your ID card.\nBrenda, I misspoke. If your husband was disabled 100% then you still have shopping privileges. You should be able to renew your card at Offutt AFB.\nWhat about OCONUS locations where the SOFA agreement specifically does not allow retirees base access at all, such as Spain?\nDisregard question about OCONUS access. SOFA/local law agreements take precedence! So, it depends on overseas location.\nHi J, You need to contact the VA if you do not have a Veteran Health Identification Card, and you are eligible for one.\nSee more information here: https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic/index.asp.\nI am 100% service connected. Hpw do I get a card that says that?\nThank you for your ASAP Response\nOnce you receive your rating of 100%, you should look up RAPIDS Appointment Scheduler online to set up an appointment at a DOD location near you to get an ID card (DD Form 2765) for yourself and if applicable, you can also set up an appointment to receive ID cards for your dependents. The appointment scheduler states what documents you need to have in order to obtain your ID card. You must bring your DD Form 214 and letter from the VA showing that you are an honorably discharged veteran rated 100% service connected authorizing commissary and exchange privileges.\nThis is not entirely true. You must be 100% P&T to attain a tan VA card (for base access, commissary, PX etc.). I am 100% sceduler NON P&T and do not qualify for access (per the current rules).\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

In return for prompt and certain payment of benefits to an employee, an employer's liability is limited.\nWorker’s Compensation Insurance Requirements in Wisconsin\nMost Wisconsin employers are required by law to have worker’s compensation insurance, including:\nThere are special provisions in the law covering independent contractors. An independent contractor, sub-contractor or owner/operator may actually be a statutory employee of the employer for whom he or she is working, unless they meet the Worker's Compensation 9-point test under s. 102.07(8)(b) of the Wisconsin statutes. An independent contractor, sub-contractor or owner/operator who employs others must provide insurance for employees, as well as obtain insurance in his or her personal or trade name. No employer may elect to be under the insurance coverage of another employer or contractor. Independent contractors who do not have employees or who are not required to be insured may choose to purchase insurance for self-coverage. The policy must be endorsed to name the sole proprietor or partners for them to be covered. Employers and independent contractors may purchase insurance without personal benefit coverage. Find more detailed information here: Independent Contractors and Worker's Compensation in Wisconsin\nIn addition, there are specific provisions under s. 452.38, Wis. Stats., for a real estate broker, agent or salesperson that may exempt them from the Act. For more information, visit:\nReal Estate Brokers, Agents & Salespersons and Worker’s Compensation in Wisconsin.\nSole Proprietors Under the Wisconsin Worker's Compensation Act\nSole proprietors, partners and members of limited liability companies are not considered or counted as employees. Generally, policies exclude sole proprietors, partners and members of limited liability companies, unless they are specifically endorsed to include them. Sole proprietors, partners and members of limited liability companies may voluntarily purchase insurance to cover their own work-related injuries and illnesses.\nCorporate Officers and Worker's Compensation in Wisconsin\nCorporate officers are employees. Generally, policies covering corporations include corporate officers. In closely held corporations with not more than 10 stockholders, no more than 2 officers can be excluded from insurance coverage. If the corporation has other employees and/or officers, a policy is required and the election must be made by endorsement on the worker’s compensation policy. Officers who have made this election will still be counted in determining whether the employer is subject to the Worker’s Compensation Act. If a closely held corporation has no more than 2 corporate officers and has no other employees a worker’s compensation policy is not required, if both officers elect not to be subject to the Worker’s Compensation Act. This election must be completed by filing a Corporate Officer Option Notice with the Worker’s Compensation Division.\nThe employer pays for the insurance and may not withhold, deduct or collect payment for premiums from any employee or any other person. Agreements made by employees who waive rights to compensation are not valid.\nWisconsin Compensation Rating Bureau\nThe cost of insurance will vary and is based on payroll. The amount due is determined through approximately 650 separate job classifications rated on past experience in the industry. Insurance will cost more for most hazardous occupations. With approval of the Commissioner of Insurance, rates are set statewide by the Wisconsin Compensation Rating Bureau (WCRB). There are approximately 400 insurance companies licensed to write Worker’s Compensation insurance in Wisconsin. If any insurance carrier denies your application for insurance, you may apply to another carrier or to the WCRB. The WCRB will assign an insurer to write a policy for you. The cost is the same for assigned coverage.\nContact WCRB: 20700 W. Swenson Drive, Suite 100, Waukesha, WI 53186 | (262) 796-4540\nApproximately 180 private sector and 55 municipal employers are self-insured. Self-insured entities do not purchase insurance; instead they pay their claims using their own funds. Self-insurers must have written approval from the Worker's Compensation Division before becoming self-insured. The approval process includes submitting an application with 5 years of audited financial data and documentation demonstrating expertise in safety and claims management. Self-insurers are required to have excess insurance and other security to protect against potential claims.\nThe penalty for any lapse in worker’s compensation coverage is twice the amount of premium not paid during the uninsured time period or $750, whichever is greater. An employer who has a coverage lapse of 7 consecutive days or less is subject to a $100 penalty for each uninsured day up to 7 days, if the employer has not previously had an illegal lapse in coverage and no injury occurred during the uninsured period. In addition, employers that fail to obtain required insurance may be ordered by the Worker’s Compensation Division to cease operations until coverage is obtained.\nThe Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF) pays benefits on valid claims filed by employees who are injured while working for illegally uninsured employers. When an employee files a compensable claim, the UEF pays benefits as if the uninsured employer had been insured. The uninsured employer is required to reimburse the UEF for all costs of a paid claim. The uninsured employer is personally liable to reimburse the UEF for benefit payments to an injured employee. Aggressive collection, including warrants, levies, garnishment and execution against property, are used to ensure reimbursement. The normal exemptions of property from seizure and sale on execution of a judgment do not apply to uninsured employers.\nAny worker’s compensation insurance policy covers liability for compensation and medical expenses for all employees. Policies do not cover:\nNegligence, either by the employer or employee, is not an issue except when the injury occurs because:\nAll employers must report, by phone, all work-related fatalities to the Worker’s Compensation Division, Madison Office, within 24 hours. All employers must also report all work-related fatalities to their insurance carrier within 24 hours. Additionally:\nIf an employer intentionally fails to file a report of injury, the employer may be assessed a penalty for bad faith up to 200% of compensation due up to a $30,000 maximum. An employer may be assessed a 10% penalty payable to the injured worker for delay in reporting an injury that causes an untimely payment.\nThe employee has the right to select any physician, psychologist, podiatrist, dentist, chiropractor, physician assistant or advanced practice nurse prescriber, unless there is an emergency. The employee has the right to a second choice of a provider by giving notice to the employer or insurer. An employer may require an employee to submit to reasonable medical examinations for the purpose of reviewing claims for compensation. Out-of-state treatment requires an insurer’s consent, unless it is based upon a referral from an in-state provider.\nThe employer may not “unreasonably” refuse to rehire an injured employee, if suitable employment is available within the employee’s physical and mental limitations. If the employer has suitable employment available and unreasonably refuses to rehire the worker, the employer is liable for any lost wages, up to a total of one year’s wages. The employer is not required to hold or create a job to guarantee the employee a job after an injury.\nIf you suspect fraud from an employee, employer, medical provider or insurance carrier, you may report it to the Worker's Compensation Division. The Division has an agreement with the Department of Justice for assistance with investigating and prosecuting fraud.\nWisconsin Department of Workforce Development\nWorker’s Compensation Division\n201 E.

This form replaces Schedules A and B (Form 1045).\nFarmers and ranchers affected by drought may be eligible for extension of tax relief.\nFarmers and ranchers forced to sell certain livestock because of drought conditions may have more time to replace their livestock and defer tax on any gains from the forced sales. See IRS Tax Tip 2022-152 and IRS extends relief to farmers and ranchers in 49 states and other areas.\nBusiness meals deduction.\nThe temporary 100% deduction for food or beverages provided by a restaurant has expired. The business meal deduction reverted back to the 50% allowable deduction beginning January 1, 2023. See Travel and meals , later, for more information.\nForm 1040-SS, Part III, has been replaced.\nSchedule F (Form 1040) is now filed with Form 1040-SS, if applicable.

For more information, see the Instructions for Form 1040 and Pub. 334, Tax Guide For Small Business.\nNet operating loss (NOL).\nAn NOL can no longer be carried back, unless the NOL is a farming loss. If you have an NOL attributable to farming, you must carry it back to each of the 2 tax years preceding the tax year of the loss, unless you elect to forgo the carryback. Farming businesses can elect to forgo the carryback and carry forward the farm NOL to a later year.

This election, in most cases, won't increase the total tax owed on the joint return, but it does give each of you credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based and for Medicare coverage without filing a partnership return. For an explanation of “material participation,” see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G; andLine E, later.\nMaking the election.\nTo make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the farming business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. Each of you must file a separate Schedule F (Form 1040). On each line of your separate Schedule F (Form 1040), you must enter your share of the applicable income, deduction, or loss. Each of you must also file a separate Schedule SE (Form 1040) to pay self-employment tax, as applicable.\nAs long as you remain qualified, your election can't be revoked without IRS consent.\nFor more information on QJVs, go to IRS.gov/QJV.\nIf you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated farming business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat your wholly owned, unincorporated business as a sole proprietorship, instead of a partnership. Any change in your reporting position will be treated as a conversion of the entity.\nReport your income and deductions as follows.\n-\nIf only one spouse participates in the business, all of the income from that business is the self-employment earnings of the spouse who carried on the business.\n-\nIf both spouses participate, the income and deductions are allocated to the spouses based on their distributive shares.\n-\nIf either or both you and your spouse are partners in a partnership, see Pub. 541.\n-\nIf you and your spouse elected to treat the business as a QJV, see Qualified Joint Venture (QJV) , earlier, for how to report income and deductions.\nStates with community property laws include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. See Pub. 555 for more information about community property laws.\nEstimated Tax\nIf you had to make estimated tax payments for 2024, and you underpaid your estimated tax, you won't be charged a penalty if both of the following apply.\n-\nYour gross farming or fishing income for 2023 or 2024 is at least two-thirds of your gross income.\n-\nYou file your 2024 tax return and pay the tax due by March 3, 2025.\nFor details and alternative ways to avoid the estimated tax penalty, see the Instructions for Form 2210-F and chapter 15 of Pub. 225.\nFilers of Forms 1041 and 1065.\nDon't complete the block labeled “Social security number (SSN).” Instead, enter the employer identification number (EIN) issued to the estate, trust, or partnership on line D.\nLine B\nOn line B, enter one of the 17 principal agricultural activity codes listed in Part IV on page 2 of Schedule F (Form 1040). Select the code that best describes the source of most of your income.\nLine C\nIf you use the cash method, check the box for “Cash.” Complete Schedule F (Form 1040), Parts I and II. In most cases, report income in the year in which you actually or constructively received it and deduct expenses in the year you paid them. However, if the payment of an expenditure creates an intangible asset (such as a prepaid expense) having a useful life that extends beyond the earlier of 12 months after the creation of the benefit or the end of the next tax year, it may not be deductible or may be deductible only in part for the year of the payment. See chapter 2 of Pub. 225.\nIf you use the accrual method, check the box for “Accrual.” Complete Schedule F (Form 1040), Part I, line 9; and Part II; and Part III. Generally, report income in the year in which you earned it and deduct expenses in the year you incurred them, even if you didn't pay them in that year. Accrual-basis taxpayers are put on a cash basis for deducting business expenses owed to a related cash-basis taxpayer. Other rules determine the timing of deductions based on economic performance. See Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.\nFarming syndicates.\nFarming syndicates can't use the cash method of accounting. A farming syndicate may be a partnership, an LLC, an S corporation, or any other enterprise other than a C corporation if:\n-\nThe interests in the business have at any time been offered for sale in a way that would require registration with any federal or state agency, or\n-\nMore than 35% of the losses during any tax year are allocable to limited partners or limited entrepreneurs. A limited partner is one who can lose only the amount invested or required to be invested in the partnership. A limited entrepreneur is a person who doesn't take any active part in managing the business.\nLine D\nEnter on line D the EIN that was issued to you on Form SS-4. Don't enter your SSN. Don't enter another taxpayer's EIN (for example, from any Forms 1099-MISC that you received). If you don't have an EIN, leave line D blank.\nYou need an EIN only if you have a qualified retirement plan or are required to file employment, excise, alcohol, tobacco, or firearms returns, or if you are a payer of gambling winnings. If you need an EIN, see the Instructions for Form SS-4.\nSingle-member LLCs.\nIf you are a sole owner of an LLC that isn't treated as a separate entity for federal income tax purposes, you may have an EIN that was issued to the LLC (and in the LLC's legal name) if you are required to file employment tax returns and certain excise tax returns. However, you should enter on line D only the EIN issued to you and in your name as the sole proprietor of your farming business. If you don't have such an EIN, leave line D blank. Don't enter on line D the EIN issued to the LLC.\nSingle-member LLCs with employees.\nSingle-member LLCs that are disregarded as entities separate from their owners for federal income tax purposes are required to file employment tax returns using the LLC's name and EIN rather than the LLC owner's name and EIN. For more information, see the Instructions for Form SS-4.\nFilers of Forms 1041 and 1065.\nEnter on line D the EIN issued to the estate, trust, or partnership.\nLine E\nMaterial participation.\nFor the definition of material participation for purposes of the passive activity rules, see the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G. If you meet any of the material participation tests described in those instructions, check the “Yes” box.\nIf you are a retired or disabled farmer, you are treated as materially participating in a farming business if you materially participated 5 or more of the 8 years preceding your retirement or disability. Also, a surviving spouse is treated as materially participating in a farming activity if the surviving spouse actively manages the farm and the real property used for farming meets the estate tax rules for special valuation of farm property passed from a qualifying decedent.\nCheck the “No” box if you didn't materially participate. If you checked “No” and you have a loss from this business, see Limit on passive losses, next. If you have a profit from this business activity but have current-year losses from other passive activities or prior year unallowed passive activity losses, see the Instructions for Form 8582.\nLimit on passive losses.\nIf you checked the “No” box and you have a loss from this business, you may have to use Form 8582 to figure your allowable loss, if any, to enter on Schedule F (Form 1040), line 34. In most cases, you can deduct losses from passive activities only to the extent of income from passive activities. For details, see Pub. 925.\nLine F\nIf you made any payments in 2024 that would require you to file any Forms 1099, check the “Yes” box. Otherwise, check the “No” box. See the 2024 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns in Guide to Information Returns if you are unsure whether you are required to file any Forms 1099. Also see the separate specific instructions for each Form 1099.\nGenerally, you must file Form 1099-MISC or Form 1099-NEC if you paid at least $600 in rents, services, prizes, medical and health care payments, and other income payments. See the Guide to Information Returns in the 2024 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns which has more information, including the due dates for the various information returns.\nIn Part I, show income received for items listed on lines 1 through 8. In most cases, include both the cash actually or constructively received and the fair market value (FMV) of goods or other property received for these items. Income is constructively received when it's credited to your account or set aside for you to use.\nIf you received rents based on crop shares or farm production and materially participated in the management or operation of a farm, report these rents as income on line 2.\nSales of livestock because of weather-related conditions.\nIf you sold livestock because of drought, flood, or other weather-related conditions, you can elect to report the income from the sale in the year after the year of sale if all of the following apply.\n-\nYour main business is farming.\n-\nYou can show that you sold the livestock only because of weather-related conditions.\n-\nYour area qualified for federal aid.\nSee chapter 3 of Pub. 225 for details.\nChapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIf you were a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case during 2024, see Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases in the Instructions for Form 1040 (under Income) and the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040).\nForms 1099 or CCC-1099-G.\nIf you received Forms 1099 or CCC-1099-G showing amounts paid to you, first determine if the amounts are to be included with farm income. Then, use the following chart to determine where to report the income on Schedule F (Form 1040). Include the Form 1099 or CCC-1099-G amounts in the total amount reported on that line.\n| Form | Where to report |\n||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1099-PATR | Line 3a | ||\n| 1099-A | Line 5b | ||\n| 1099-MISC for crop insurance | Line 6a | ||\n| 1099-G or CCC-1099-G | |||\n|\nLine 6a | ||\n|\nLine 4a |\nYou may receive Form 1099-MISC for other types of income. In this case, report it on whichever line best describes the income. For example, if you receive a Form 1099-MISC for custom farming work, include this amount on line 7. In most cases, your business income will be in the form of cash, checks, and debit/credit card payments. Therefore, you should consider the amounts shown on Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, along with all other amounts received, when calculating gross receipts. (See Understanding Your 1099-K on IRS.gov.)\nLines 3a and 3b\nIf you received distributions from a cooperative in 2024, you should receive a Form 1099-PATR. On line 3a, show your total distributions from cooperatives. This includes patronage dividends, nonpatronage distributions, per-unit retain allocations, and redemptions of nonqualified written notices of allocation and per-unit retain certificates.\nShow patronage dividends received in cash and the dollar amount of qualified written notices of allocation. If you received property as patronage dividends, report the FMV of the property as income. Include cash advances received from a marketing cooperative. If you received per-unit retains in cash, show the amount of cash. If you received qualified per-unit retain certificates, show the stated dollar amount of the certificates.\nDon't include as income on line 3b patronage dividends from buying personal or family items, capital assets, or depreciable assets. Enter these amounts on line 3a only. Because you don't report patronage dividends from these items as income, you must subtract the amount of the dividend from the cost or other basis of these items.\nLines 4a and 4b\nEnter on line 4a the total of the government agricultural program payments that you received. This includes the following amounts.\n-\nPrice loss coverage payments.\n-\nAgriculture risk coverage payments.\n-\nCoronavirus Food Assistance Program payments.\n-\nMarket Facilitation Program payments.\n-\nMarket gain from the repayment of a secured Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan for less than the original loan amount.\n-\nDiversion payments.\n-\nCost-share payments (sight drafts).\n-\nPayments in the form of materials (such as fertilizer or lime) or services (such as grading or building dams).\nThese amounts are usually reported to you on Form 1099-G. You may also receive Form CCC-1099-G from the Department of Agriculture showing the amounts and types of payments made to you.\nOn line 4b, report only the taxable amount. For example, don't report the market gain shown on Form CCC-1099-G on line 4b if you elected to report CCC loan proceeds as income in the year received (see Lines 5a Through 5c). No gain results from redemption of the commodity because you previously reported the CCC loan proceeds as income. You are treated as repurchasing the commodity for the amount of the loan repayment. However, if you didn't report the CCC loan proceeds under the election, you must report the market gain on line 4b.\nLines 5a Through 5c\nCCC loans.\nIn most cases, you don't report CCC loan proceeds as income. However, if you pledge part or all of your production to secure a CCC loan, you can elect to report the loan proceeds as income in the year you receive them. If you make this election (or made the election in a prior year), report loan proceeds you received in 2024 on line 5a. Attach a statement to your return showing the details of the loan(s). See chapter 3 of Pub. 225.\nForfeited CCC loans.\nInclude the full amount forfeited on line 5b, even if you reported the loan proceeds as income. This amount may be reported to you on Form 1099-A.\nIf you didn't elect to report the loan proceeds as income, also include the forfeited amount on line 5c.\nIf you did elect to report the loan proceeds as income, you generally won't have an entry on line 5c. But if the amount forfeited is different from your basis in the commodity, you may have an entry on line 5c.\nSee chapter 3 of Pub. 225 for details on the tax consequences of electing to report CCC loan proceeds as income or forfeiting CCC loans.\nLines 6a Through 6d\nIn most cases, you must report crop insurance proceeds in the year you receive them. Federal crop disaster payments are treated as crop insurance proceeds. However, if 2024 was the year of damage, you can elect to include certain proceeds in income for 2025. To make this election, check the box on line 6c and attach a statement to your return. See chapter 3 of Pub. 225 for a description of the proceeds for which an election can be made and for what you must include in your statement.\nIf you elect to defer any eligible crop insurance proceeds, you must defer all such crop insurance proceeds (including federal crop disaster payments) from a single trade or business.\nEnter on line 6a the total crop insurance proceeds you received in 2024, even if you elect to include them in income for 2025.\nEnter on line 6b the taxable amount of the proceeds you received in 2024. Don't include proceeds you elect to include in income for 2025.\nEnter on line 6d the amount, if any, of crop insurance proceeds you received in 2023 and elected to include in income for 2024.\nLine 8\nEnter on line 8 income not otherwise reportable on lines 1 through 7. This includes the following types of income.\n-\nIllegal federal irrigation subsidies. See chapter 3 of Pub. 225.\n-\nBartering income.\n-\nIncome from cancellation of debt. In most cases, if a debt is canceled or forgiven, you must include the canceled amount in income. If a federal agency, financial institution, or credit union canceled or forgave a debt you owed of $600 or more, it should send you a Form 1099-C, or similar statement, by January 31, 2025, showing the amount of debt canceled in 2024. However, you may be able to exclude the canceled debt from income. See Pub. 4681 for details.\n-\nState gasoline or fuel tax refunds you received in 2024.\n-\nAny amount included in income from line 3 of Form 6478, Biofuel Producer Credit.\n-\nAny amount included in income from line 10 of Form 8864, Biodiesel, Renewable Diesel, or Sustainable Aviation Fuels Credit.\n-\nThe amount of credit for federal tax paid on fuels claimed on your 2023 Schedule 3 (Form 1040). For information on including the credit in income, see chapter 2 of Pub. 510.\n-\nAny recapture of excess depreciation on any listed property, including any section 179 expense deduction, if the business use percentage of that property decreased to 50% or less in 2024. Use Part IV of Form 4797 to figure the recapture. See the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line 13, for the definition of listed property.\n-\nThe inclusion amount on leased listed property (other than vehicles) when the business use percentage drops to 50% or less. See chapter 5 of Pub. 946 to figure the amount.\n-\nAny recapture of the deduction or credit for clean-fuel vehicle refueling property or alternative fuel vehicle refueling property used in your farming business. For details on how to figure recapture, see section 30C(e)(5).\n-\nAny income from breeding fees, or fees from renting teams, machinery, or land that isn't reported on Schedule E (Form 1040) or Form 4835.\n-\nThe gain or loss on the sale of commodity futures contracts if the contracts were made to protect you from price changes. These are a form of business insurance and are considered hedges. If you had a loss in a closed futures contract, enclose the amount of the loss in parentheses.\nFor property acquired and hedging positions established, you must clearly identify on your books and records both the hedging transaction and the item(s) or aggregate risk being hedged.\nPurchase or sales contracts aren't true hedges if they offset losses that already occurred. If you bought or sold commodity futures with the hope of making a profit due to favorable price changes, report the profit or loss on Form 6781 instead of this line.\nDon't deduct the following.\n-\nPersonal or living expenses (such as taxes, insurance, or repairs on your home) that don't produce farm income.\n-\nExpenses of raising anything you or your family used that would not have otherwise been deductible as an expense except for the presence of the income-producing farm activity.\n-\nThe value of animals you raised that died.\n-\nInventory losses.\n-\nPersonal losses.\nIf you were repaid for any part of an expense during the same year, you must subtract the amount you were repaid from the deduction.\nCapitalizing costs to property produced and property acquired for resale.\nIf you produced real or tangible personal property or acquired property for resale, you must generally capitalize certain expenses to your inventory or other property. These expenses include the direct costs of the property and any indirect costs properly allocable to that property.\nFor tax years beginning after 2017, small business taxpayers, defined later, are not required to capitalize costs under section 263A. Section 263A generally doesn't apply to the following expenses.\n-\nProducing any plant that has a preproduction period of 2 years or less.\n-\nRaising animals.\n-\nReplanting certain crops if they were lost or damaged by reason of freezing temperatures, disease, drought, pests, or casualty.\nExceptions (1) and (2) don't apply to tax shelters, farming syndicates, partnerships, or corporations required to use the accrual method of accounting under section 447 or 448(a)(3).\nSpecial rules apply to exception (3) if replanting costs are paid or incurred by a taxpayer other than the person described in section 263A(d)(2)(A). See sections 263A(d)(2)(B) and (C) for these different rules. Under section 263A(d)(2)(C), there is a temporary rule for replanting costs of citrus plants that are paid or incurred after December 22, 2017, and on or before December 22, 2027.\nSmall business taxpayer.\nA small business taxpayer is one that has gross receipts of $30 million or less for the 3 prior tax years and is not a tax shelter, as defined in section 448(d)(3). See also the inflation adjustment in Rev. Proc. 2023–34 (updated annually), which increased the threshold for small business taxpayers from $29 million to $30 million for tax years beginning in 2024.\nIf you capitalize your expenses, don't reduce your deductions on lines 10 through 32e by the capitalized expenses. Instead, enter the total amount capitalized in parentheses on line 32f (to indicate a negative amount) and enter “263A” in the space to the left of the total. See Preproductive period expenses, later, for details.\nBut you may be able to currently deduct rather than capitalize the expenses of producing a plant with a preproductive period of more than 2 years.\nElection to deduct certain preproductive period expenses.\nIf the preproductive period of any plant you produce is more than 2 years, you can elect to currently deduct the expenses rather than capitalize them. But you can't make this election for the costs of planting or growing citrus or almond groves incurred before the end of the fourth tax year beginning with the tax year you planted them in their permanent grove. You are treated as having made the election by deducting the preproductive period expenses in the first tax year for which you can make this election and by applying the special rules, discussed later.\nIn the case of a partnership or S corporation, the election must be made by the partner, shareholder, or member. This election can't be made by tax shelters, farming syndicates, partnerships, or corporations required to use the accrual method of accounting under section 447 or 448(a)(3).\nUnless you obtain IRS consent, you must make this election for the first tax year in which you engage in a farming business involving the production of property subject to the capitalization rules. You can't revoke this election without IRS consent.\nSpecial rules.\nIf you make the election to deduct preproductive expenses for plants:\n-\nAny gain you realize when disposing of the plants is ordinary income up to the amount of the preproductive expenses you deducted, and\n-\nThe alternative depreciation rules apply to property placed in service in any tax year your election is in effect.\nFor details, see Uniform Capitalization Rules in chapter 6 of Pub. 225.\nPrepaid farm supplies.\nIn most cases, if you use the cash method of accounting and your prepaid farm supplies are more than 50% of your other deductible farm expenses, your deduction for those supplies may be limited. Prepaid farm supplies include expenses for feed, seed, fertilizer, and similar farm supplies not used or consumed during the year.\nThey also include the cost of poultry that would be allowable as a deduction in a later tax year if you were to:\n-\nCapitalize the cost of poultry bought for use in your farming business and deduct it ratably over the lesser of 12 months or the useful life of the poultry, and\n-\nDeduct the cost of poultry bought for resale in the year you sell or otherwise dispose of it.\nIf the limit applies, you can deduct prepaid farm supplies that don't exceed 50% of your other deductible farm expenses in the year of payment. You can deduct the excess only in the year you use or consume the supplies (other than poultry, which is deductible, as explained above). For details and exceptions to these rules, see chapter 4 of Pub. 225.\nWhether or not this 50% limit applies, your expenses for livestock feed paid during the year but consumed in a later year may be subject to the rules explained in the line 16 instructions.\nLine 10\nYou can deduct the actual expenses of operating your car or truck or take the standard mileage rate. You must use actual expenses if you used five or more vehicles simultaneously in your farming business (such as in fleet operations). You can't use actual expenses for a leased vehicle if you previously used the standard mileage rate for that vehicle.\nYou can take the standard mileage rate for 2024 only if you:\n-\nOwned the vehicle and used the standard mileage rate for the first year you placed the vehicle in service, or\n-\nLeased the vehicle and are using the standard mileage rate for the entire lease period.\nIf you take the standard mileage rate:\n-\nMultiply the business standard mileage rate by 67 cents a mile; and\n-\nAdd to this amount your parking fees and tolls, and enter the total on line 10.\nDon't deduct depreciation, rent or lease payments, or your actual operating expenses.\nIf you deduct actual expenses:\n-\nInclude on line 10 the business portion of expenses for gasoline, oil, repairs, insurance, license plates, etc.; and\n-\nShow depreciation on line 14 and rent or lease payments on line 24a.\nIf you claim any car or truck expenses (actual or the standard mileage rate), you must provide the information requested on Form 4562, Part V. Be sure to attach Form 4562 to your return.\nFor details, see chapter 4 of Pub. 463.\nLine 12\nDeductible conservation expenses are generally those that are paid to conserve soil and water for land used in farming, to prevent erosion of land used for farming, or for endangered species recovery. These expenses include (but aren't limited to) costs for the following.\n-\nThe treatment or movement of earth, such as leveling, grading, conditioning, terracing, contour furrowing, and the restoration of soil fertility.\n-\nThe construction, control, and protection of diversion channels, drainage ditches, irrigation ditches, earthen dams, watercourses, outlets, and ponds.\n-\nThe eradication of brush.\n-\nThe planting of windbreaks.\n-\nThe achievement of site-specific management actions recommended in recovery plans approved pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\nThese expenses can be deducted only if they're consistent with a conservation plan approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture or a recovery plan approved pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for the area in which your land is located. If no plan exists, the expenses must be consistent with a plan of a comparable state agency. You can't deduct the expenses if they were paid or incurred for land used in farming in a foreign country.\nDon't deduct expenses you paid or incurred to drain or fill wetlands, or to prepare land for center pivot irrigation systems.\nYour deduction can't exceed 25% of your gross income from farming (excluding certain gains from selling assets such as farm machinery and land). If your conservation expenses are more than the limit, the excess can be carried forward and deducted in later tax years. However, the amount deductible for any 1 year can't exceed the 25% gross income limit for that year.\nFor details, see chapter 5 of Pub. 225.\nLine 13\nEnter amounts paid for custom hire or machine work (the machine operator furnished the equipment).\nDon't include amounts paid for rental or lease of equipment you operated yourself. Instead, report those amounts on line 24a.\nLine 14\nYou can deduct depreciation of buildings, improvements, cars and trucks, machinery, and other farm equipment of a permanent nature.\nDon't deduct depreciation of your home, furniture or other personal items, land, livestock you bought or raised for resale, or other property in your inventory.\nYou can also elect under section 179 to expense a portion of the cost of certain property you bought in 2024 for use in your farming business. The section 179 election is made on Form 4562.\nSpecial depreciation allowance.\nFor certain trees and vines bearing fruits and nuts, planted or grafted after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027, you may elect to claim the special depreciation allowance at the time they were planted or grafted. Additional property placed in service in 2024 may qualify for the special depreciation allowance. See the Instructions for Form 4562 for more information.\nElecting farming business.\nIf you made an election not to have the business interest expense limitation apply, any property with a recovery period of 10 years or more held by you must be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system. For details, see Rev. Proc. 2019-08, available at IRS.gov/irb/2019-03_IRB#RP-2019-08 (or its successor).\nFor information about depreciation and the section 179 deduction, see Pub. 946 and chapter 7 of Pub. 225. For details on the special depreciation allowance, see chapter 3 of Pub. 946.\nSee the Instructions for Form 4562 for information on when you must complete and attach Form 4562.\nLine 15\nDeduct contributions to employee benefit programs that aren't an incidental part of a pension or profit-sharing plan included on line 23. Examples are accident and health plans, group-term life insurance, and dependent care assistance programs. If you made contributions on your behalf as a self-employed person to a dependent care assistance program, complete Form 2441, Parts I and III, to figure your deductible contributions to that program.\nContributions you made on your behalf as a self-employed person to an accident and health plan or for group-term life insurance aren't deductible on Schedule F (Form 1040). However, you may be able to deduct on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 17, the amount you paid for health insurance on behalf of yourself, your spouse, and your dependent(s) even if you don't itemize your deductions. See the instructions for Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 17, for details.\nYou must reduce your line 15 deduction by the amount of any credit for small employer health insurance premiums determined on Form 8941. See Form 8941 and its instructions to determine which expenses are eligible for the credit.\nLine 16\nIf you use the cash method, you can't deduct when paid the cost of feed your livestock will consume in a later year unless all of the following apply.\n-\nThe payment was for the purchase of feed rather than a deposit.\n-\nThe prepayment had a business purpose and wasn't made merely to avoid tax.\n-\nDeducting the prepayment won't materially distort your income.\nIf all of the above apply, you can deduct the prepaid feed when paid, subject to the overall limit for Prepaid farm supplies , explained earlier. If all of the above don’t apply, you can deduct the prepaid feed only in the year it's consumed.\nLine 18\nDon't include the cost of transportation incurred in purchasing livestock held for resale as freight paid. Instead, add these costs to the cost of the livestock.\nLine 20\nDeduct on this line premiums paid for farm business insurance. Deduct on line 15 amounts paid for employee accident and health insurance. Amounts credited to a reserve for self-insurance or premiums paid for a policy that pays for your lost earnings due to sickness or disability aren't deductible. For details, see chapter 4 of Pub. 225.\nLines 21a and 21b\nInterest allocation rules.\nThe tax treatment of interest expense differs depending on its type. For example, home mortgage interest and investment interest are treated differently. Interest allocation rules require you to allocate (classify) your interest expense so it's deducted (or capitalized) on the correct line of your return and receives the right tax treatment. These rules could affect how much interest you are allowed to deduct on Schedule F (Form 1040).\nIn most cases, you allocate interest expense by tracing how the proceeds of the loan are used. See chapter 4 of Pub. 225 for details.\nIf you paid interest on a debt secured by your main home and any of the proceeds from that debt were used in your farming business, see chapter 4 of Pub. 225 to figure the amount to include on lines 21a and 21b.\nHow to report.\nBefore entering an amount on line 21a or 21b, see the Instructions for Form 8990 to identify whether you are required to limit your business interest expense or whether you can elect not to limit your business interest expense. If you are required to limit your business interest expense, include only the amount you are allowed to deduct on lines 21a and 21b. If you are not required to limit your business interest expense and if you have a mortgage on real property used in your farming business (other than your main home), enter on line 21a the interest you paid for 2024 to banks or other financial institutions for which you received a Form 1098 (or similar statement). If you didn't receive a Form 1098, enter the interest on line 21b.\nIf you paid more mortgage interest than is shown on Form 1098 (or similar statement), see chapter 4 of Pub. 225 to find out if you can deduct the additional interest. If you can, include the amount on line 21a. Attach a statement to your return explaining the difference and enter “See attached” in the margin next to line 21a.\nIf you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if you file a joint return) were liable for and paid interest on the mortgage and the other person received the Form 1098 (or similar statement), include your share of the interest on line 21b. Attach a statement to your return showing the name and address of the person who received the Form 1098 (or similar statement). In the margin next to line 21b, enter “See attached.”\nDon't deduct interest you prepaid in 2024 for later years; include only the part that applies to 2024.\nLine 22\nEnter the amounts you paid for farm labor. Don't include amounts paid to yourself. Reduce your deduction by the amounts claimed on the following.\n-\nForm 5884, Work Opportunity Credit.\n-\nForm 8844, Empowerment Zone Employment Credit.\n-\nForm 8932, Credit for Employer Differential Wage Payments.\n-\nForm 8994, Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave.\nInclude the cost of boarding farm labor but not the value of any products they used from the farm. Include only what you paid household help to care for farm laborers.\nIf you provided taxable fringe benefits to your employees, such as personal use of a car, don't include in farm labor the amounts you depreciated or deducted elsewhere.\nLine 23\nEnter your deduction for contributions to employee pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plans. If the plan included you as a self-employed person, enter contributions made as an employer on your behalf on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 16, not on Schedule F (Form 1040).\nIn most cases, you must file the applicable form listed next if you maintain a pension, profit-sharing, or other funded-deferred compensation plan. The filing requirement isn't affected by whether the plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code, or whether you claim a deduction for the current tax year. There is a penalty for failure to timely file these forms. See U.S. Department of Labor.\nForm 5500-EZ.\nFile this form if you have a one-participant retirement plan that meets certain requirements. A one-participant plan is a plan that covers only you (or you and your spouse).\nForm 5500-SF.\nFile this form electronically with the Department of Labor (at efast.dol.gov) if you have a small plan (fewer than 100 participants in most cases) that meets certain requirements.\nForm 5500.\nFile this form electronically with the Department of Labor (at efast.dol.gov) for a plan that doesn't meet the requirements for filing Form 5500-EZ or 5500-SF.\nFor details, see Pub. 560.\nLines 24a and 24b\nIf you rented or leased vehicles, machinery, or equipment, enter on line 24a the business portion of your rental cost. But, if you leased a vehicle for a term of 30 days or more, you may have to reduce your deduction by an inclusion amount. See Leasing a Car in chapter 4 of Pub. 463 to figure this amount.\nEnter on line 24b amounts paid to rent or lease other property such as pasture or farmland.\nLine 25\nEnter amounts you paid for repairs and maintenance of farm buildings, machinery, and equipment that are not payments for improvements to the property. Amounts are paid for improvements if they are for betterments to your property or restorations of your property (such as the replacements of major components or substantial structural parts), or if they adapt your property to a new or different use. See chapter 4 of Pub. 225 for more information.\nDon't deduct repairs or maintenance on your home.\nHowever, you may be able to elect to capitalize and depreciate certain amounts paid for repair and maintenance of tangible property to the extent you treat these amounts as capital expenditures on your books and records regularly used in figuring your income and expenses. For details, see chapter 8 of Pub. 225.\nLine 29\nYou can deduct the following taxes on this line.\n-\nReal estate and personal property taxes on farm business assets.\n-\nSocial security and Medicare taxes you paid to match what you are required to withhold from farm employees' wages.\n-\nFederal unemployment tax.\n-\nFederal highway use tax.\n-\nContributions to a state unemployment insurance fund or disability benefit fund if they're considered taxes under state law.\nDon't deduct the following taxes on this line.\n-\nFederal income taxes, including your self-employment tax. However, you can deduct one-half of self-employment tax on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 15.\n-\nEstate and gift taxes.\n-\nTaxes assessed for improvements, such as paving and sewers.\n-\nTaxes on your home or personal-use property. You may be able to deduct on line 32 expenses related to your home or principle residence, such as property taxes, if you use your home to conduct farming activities. See Business use of your home, later.\n-\nState and local sales taxes on property purchased for use in your farming business. Instead, treat these taxes as part of the cost of the property.\n-\nOther taxes not related to your farming business.\nLine 30\nEnter amounts you paid for gas, electricity, water, and other utilities for business use on the farm. Don't include personal utilities. You can't deduct the base rate (including taxes) of the first telephone line into your residence, even if you use it for your farming business. But you can deduct expenses you paid for your farming business that are more than the cost of the base rate for the first phone line. For example, if you had a second phone line, you can deduct the business percentage of the charges for that line, including the base rate charges.\nLines 32a Through 32f\nInclude all ordinary and necessary farm expenses not deducted elsewhere on Schedule F (Form 1040), such as advertising, office supplies, etc. Don't include fines or penalties paid to a government for violating any law. For details on business expenses, see chapter 4 of Pub. 225.\nAt-risk loss deduction.\nAny loss from this activity that wasn't allowed last year because of the at-risk rules is treated as a deduction allocable to this activity in 2024. See Form 6198 and its instructions for more details.\nBusiness startup costs.\nIf your farming business began in 2024, you can elect to deduct up to $5,000 of certain business startup costs. The $5,000 limit is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which your startup costs exceed $50,000. Your remaining startup costs can be amortized over a 180-month period, beginning with the month the farming business began. For details, see chapters 4 and 7 of Pub. 225. For amortization that begins in 2024, you must complete and attach Form 4562.\nBusiness use of your home.\nYou may be able to deduct certain expenses for business use of your home, subject to limitations. You may also be able to use a simplified method to figure your deduction. Use the appropriate worksheets in Pub. 587 to figure your allowable deduction. Don't use Form 8829.\nDe minimis safe harbor for tangible property.\nYou may be able to elect to use a de minimis safe harbor to deduct amounts paid for certain tangible real or personal property used in your farming business. If you elect the de minimis safe harbor for the tax year, enter the total amounts you paid for property qualifying under the de minimis safe harbor on line 32. Don’t include these amounts on any other line. For details, see chapter 8 of Pub. 334.\nEnergy efficient commercial buildings deduction.\nYou may be able to deduct part or all of the expenses of modifying an existing commercial building to make it energy efficient. For details, see Form 7205 and its instructions.\nForestation and reforestation costs.\nReforestation costs are generally capital expenditures. However, for each qualified timber property, you can elect to expense up to $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately) of qualifying reforestation costs paid or incurred in 2024.\nYou can elect to amortize the remaining costs over 84 months. For amortization that begins in 2024, you must complete and attach Form 4562.\nThe amortization election doesn't apply to trusts, and the expense election doesn't apply to estates and trusts. For details on reforestation expenses, see chapters 4 and 7 of Pub. 225.\nLegal and professional fees.\nYou can include on this line fees charged by accountants and attorneys that are ordinary and necessary expenses directly related to your farming business. Include fees for tax advice and for the preparation of tax forms related to your farming business. Also, include expenses incurred in resolving asserted tax deficiencies related to your farming business.\nTools.\nYou can deduct the amount you paid for tools that have a short life or cost a small amount, such as shovels and rakes.\nTravel and meals.\nIn most cases, you can deduct expenses for farm business travel and 50% of your business meals. See the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), lines 24a and 24b.\nEntertainment expenses related to your trade or business are generally no longer deductible after 2017.\nPreproductive period expenses.\nIf you had preproductive period expenses in 2024 that you are capitalizing, enter the total of these expenses in parentheses on line 32f (to indicate a negative amount) and enter “263A” in the space to the left of the total.\nFor details, see Capitalizing costs to property produced and property acquired for resale, earlier, and Uniform Capitalization Rules in chapter 6 of Pub. 225.\nExcess business loss limitation.\nNoncorporate taxpayers may be subject to excess business loss limitations. The at-risk limits and the passive activity limits are applied before calculating the amount of any excess business loss. An excess business loss is the amount by which the total deductions attributable to all of your trades or businesses exceed your total gross income and gains attributable to those trades or businesses plus $305,000 (or $610,000 in the case of a joint return). A trade or business includes, but is not limited to, Schedule F and Schedule C activities, an activity reported on Form 4835, and other business activities reported on Schedule E.\nBusiness gains and losses reported on Form 4797 and Form 8949 are included in the excess business loss calculation. This includes farming losses from casualty losses or losses by reason of disease or drought. Excess business losses that are disallowed are treated as an NOL carryover to the following tax year. See Form 461 and its instructions for details.\nLine 33\nIf line 32f is a negative amount, subtract it from the total of lines 10 through 32e. Enter the result on line 33.\nLine 34\nFiguring your net profit or loss.\nIf line 33 is more than line 9, don't enter your loss on line 34 until you have applied the at-risk rules and the passive activity loss rules. To apply these rules, follow the instructions for line 36 and the Instructions for Form 8582. After applying these rules, the amount on line 34 will be your loss, and it may be smaller than the amount figured by subtracting line 33 from line 9. You may also be required to file Form 461, which limits the allowable loss. See Form 461 and its instructions for more information.\nIf line 9 is more than line 33, and you don't have prior-year unallowed passive activity losses, subtract line 33 from line 9. The result is your net profit.\nIf line 9 is more than line 33, and you have prior-year unallowed passive activity losses, don't enter your net profit on line 34 until you have figured the amount of prior-year unallowed passive activity losses you may claim this year for this activity. Use Form 8582 to figure the amount of prior-year unallowed passive activity losses you may include on line 34. Make sure to indicate that you are including prior-year passive activity losses by entering \"PAL\" to the left of the entry space.\nIf you checked the \"No\" box on line E, see the Instructions for Form 8582; you may need to include information from this schedule on that form, even if you have a net profit.\nPartnerships.\nSubtract line 33 from line 9. If the amount is a loss, the partners may need to apply the at-risk rules and the passive activity loss rules to determine the amount of their loss on line 34. A partner may also be required to file Form 461 to limit any excess business loss. See Form 461 and its instructions for more information.\nReporting your net profit or loss.\nOnce you have figured your net profit or loss, report it as follows. You must also consider any excess business loss limitation. See Form 461 and its instructions for more information.\nIndividuals.\nEnter your net profit or loss on line 34 and on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 6 and; Schedule SE (Form 1040), line 1a.\nNonresident aliens.\nEnter the net profit or loss on line 34 and on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 6. You should also enter this amount on Schedule SE (Form 1040), line 1a, if you are covered under the U.S. social security system due to an international social security agreement currently in effect. See the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040) or SSA.gov/international/agreements for information on international social security agreements.\nPartnerships.\nEnter the net profit or loss on line 34 and on Form 1065, line 5. The excess business loss rules are applied at the partner level.\nCommunity income.\nIf you and your spouse had community income and are filing separate returns, see the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040) before figuring self-employment tax.\nEarned income credit.\nIf you have a net profit on line 34, this amount is earned income and may qualify you for the earned income credit if you meet certain conditions. See the instructions for Form 1040, line 27, for details.\nConservation Reserve Program (CRP) payments.\nIf you received social security retirement or disability benefits in addition to CRP payments, the CRP payments aren't subject to self-employment tax. You will deduct these payments from your net farm profit or loss on Schedule SE (Form 1040), line 1b. Don't make any adjustment on Schedule F (Form 1040).\nLine 36\nYou don't need to complete line 36 if line 9 is more than line 33.\nAt-risk rules.\nIn most cases, if you have a loss from a farming activity and amounts invested in the activity for which you aren't at risk, you must complete Form 6198 to figure your allowable loss. The at-risk rules generally limit the amount of loss (including loss on the disposition of assets) you can claim to the amount you could actually lose in the activity.\nCheck box 36b if you have amounts invested in this activity for which you aren't at risk, such as the following.\n-\nNonrecourse loans used to finance the activity, to acquire property used in the activity, or to acquire the activity that aren't secured by your own property (other than property used in the activity). However, there is an exception for certain nonrecourse financing borrowed by you in connection with holding real property.\n-\nCash, property, or borrowed amounts used in the activity (or contributed to the activity, or used to acquire the activity) that are protected against loss by a guarantee, stop-loss agreement, or other similar arrangement (excluding casualty insurance and insurance against tort liability).\n-\nAmounts borrowed for use in the activity from a person who has an interest in the activity, other than as a creditor, or who is related under section 465(b)(3)(C) to a person (other than you) having such an interest.\nFiguring your loss.\nBefore determining your loss on line 34, you must check box 36a or 36b to determine if your loss from farming is limited by the at-risk rules. Follow the instructions below that apply to your box 36 activity.\nAll investment is at risk.\nIf all your investment amounts are at risk in this activity, check box 36a. If you also checked the “Yes” box on line E, your remaining loss is your loss. The at-risk rules and the passive activity loss rules don't apply. See Line 34, earlier, for how to report your loss.\nBut, if you checked the “No” box on line E, you may need to complete Form 8582 to figure your loss to enter on Line 34. See the Instructions for Form 8582.\nSome investment isn't at risk.\nIf some investment isn't at risk, check box 36b; the at-risk rules apply to your loss. Be sure to attach Form 6198 to your return.\nIf you also checked the “Yes” box on line E, complete Form 6198 to determine the amount of your loss. The passive activity loss rules don't apply. See Line 34, earlier, for how to report your loss.\nBut, if you checked the “No” box on line E, the passive activity loss rules may apply. First, complete Form 6198 to figure the amount of your profit or loss for the at-risk activity, which may include amounts reported on other forms and schedules, and the at-risk amount for the activity. Follow the Instructions for Form 6198 to determine how much of your Schedule F (Form 1040) loss to enter on line 34. After you figure the amount of your loss under the at-risk rules, you may need to complete Form 8582 to figure the amount of loss to enter on line 34. See the Instructions for Form 8582 for details.\nIf you checked box 36b because some investment isn't at risk and you don't attach Form 6198, the processing of your return may be delayed.\nAt-risk loss deduction.\nAny loss from this activity not allowed for 2024 only because of the at-risk rules is treated as a deduction allocable to the activity in 2025.\nYou may be required to use the accrual method of accounting. If you use the accrual method, report farm income when it is due, paid, earned, or taken into account as revenue in its applicable financial statement, not when you receive it. In most cases, you must include animals and crops in your inventory if you use this method. See Pub. 225 for exceptions, inventory methods, how to change methods of accounting, and rules that require certain costs to be capitalized or included in inventory. For information about accounting periods, see Pub. 538.\nChapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIf you were a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case during 2024, see Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases in the Instructions for Form 1040 (under Income) and the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040).\nLines 38a Through 40c\nSee the instructions for lines 3a through 5c , earlier.\nLine 43\nSee Line 8, earlier.\nPaperwork Reduction Act Notice.\nWe ask for the information on this form to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

Tom Coburn, R-Okla. “I didn’t support the sequester because that’s a stupid way to cut spending, and I didn’t support increasing the debt limit because there is no such thing as a debt limit in this country because we always raise it.”\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan said the threat of sequestration is already having an effect on local school districts, which have to plan their budgets for the coming school year next fall.\n“There are literally teachers right now getting pink slips,” he said.\nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood, who has become an administration point man on the harmful effects of sequestration, denied suggestions that the consequences are being exaggerated.\n“This sequester is very serious business and it requires us to make all the reductions we have to make,” LaHood said. “We hope that this week that Republicans and Democrats will step forward. The president has put forward a plan to find the $84 billion.”\nLaHood said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that his agency is required to cut about $1 billion.\n“The largest number of employees at DOT is at FAA, of which the largest number are FAA controllers,” he said. “We’re going to try and cut as much as we possibly can out of contracts and other things that we do. But in the end, there has to be some kind of furlough of air traffic control — air traffic controllers, and that then will also begin to curtail or eliminate the opportunity for them to guide planes in and out of airports.”\nLaHood’s case was a reprise of the argument he made Friday at the White House. The law that set up sequestration was structured in a way that gives departments and agencies limited discretion in implementing the required spending cuts. The federal spending curbs are due to begin to take effect March 1, although implementation of the cuts will be phased in over the rest of the fiscal year in many parts of the government.\n“The sequester doesn’t allow us to move money around,” LaHood explained on NBC’s Meet the Press.\nMany Republicans, including House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan, want to enact a patch to increase flexibility.\n“It’s really only two-cents on the dollar over the whole federal budget, but they’ve scrunched that down into seven months and highlight, or at least put most of the burden, on the Defense department,” Rogers said on ABC’s This Week, before suggesting that federal officials could find added efficiencies to trim the budget if given the option to do so legally. Coburn made a similar case.\nBut other Republican lawmakers rejected the idea of giving the administration more flexibility in making the budget cuts.\n“I say to my Republican friends, if you want to just give the president flexibility in how to enact these cuts, then why don’t we just go home?” said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also appearing on the CNN broadcast. “I am totally against that.”\nSpeaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Coburn said the scale of the mandatory spending reductions has been exaggerated and there is plenty of room for cuts.\n“We have tons — hundreds of billions of dollars of fat and waste and excess in the federal government and we ought to be about cutting some of it out,” Coburn said.\nSpeaking on the same program, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., pushed for a big deficit reduction deal to address long-term fiscal issues, but noted that some modifications to implementation of the sequester could be explored in the week ahead.\n“I think right now the way this is set up there are going to be cuts in a lot of places, and there will be some flexibility, and I think we’re going to look at a number of things this week,” McCaskill said. “We’ve got a much bigger problem down the line in terms of reducing our debt than just what we face this week.”\nGovernors from both parties in Washington for National Governor’s Association meetings also made the rounds on Sunday programs to express concern about sequestration on their states and press the case for a deal between Congress and the White House. Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Democratic Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware appeared together on Fox.\n“If we’re not careful, a tax increase on one can be a problem and severe cuts on the other end can be a problem,” Walker said, criticizing both parties for kicking the can down the road. “Our hope is between now and March 1, they’ll find a way to provide some better alternatives to the cuts in the sequester.”\nMarkell said many governors are concerned about the impact of the cuts on the economy.\n“You know, I think a lot of us feel like we’re, after some very difficult years, we’re starting to come out of it,” Markell said. “Things are getting a little bit better, and unfortunately the sequester could put us right back where we were.”\nAsked if he thought the sequester could lead to another economic recession, Markell replied, “I don’t think there’s any doubt about it.”\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        sileod/deberta-v3-base-tasksource-nli\nZero-Shot

not true, and got caught. But it’s worth pausing to appreciate how the two responded to the ensuing controversy.\nDuncan, about a week ago, told CBS that “as many as 40,000 teachers could lose their jobs” as a consequence of the sequestration cuts. He added, “There are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips, who are getting notices that they can’t come back this fall.”\nThis was fact-checked and proven to be incorrect. When pressed for an explanation, Duncan acknowledged that he’d made a mistake, apologized, and set the record straight.\nSeven days later, Boehner told NBC, “[T]here’s no plan from Senate Democrats or the White House to replace the sequester.” This, too, was fact-checked and also proven to be incorrect. Asked for an explanation, Boehner acknowledged that he’d made a mistake, apologized, and set the record straight.\nNo, I’m just kidding. Boehner’s office actually doubled-down on the lie, saying the falsehood is true if Republicans are allowed to change the meaning of basic words.\nWith both of those “plans” easily found in official records and news reports, we asked Boehner’s spokesman Brendan Buck how the speaker could claim that none exists.\n“A plan must demonstrate it has the ability to pass a chamber of Congress to be worth anything. We’ve twice passed a plan. We’re still waiting for the Senate to pass something, anything,” Buck told PolitiFact in an email.\nIt would have been very easy for Boehner and his team to say, “The Speaker misspoke. Democrats have a plan, but we think it’s an awful plan that would produce awful consequences.”\nBut that would mean taking honesty seriously. Instead, the Speaker and his office have to argue, with a straight face, that they have their own definitions of the words “plan” and “is,” which do not comport to any known dictionary.\nIn this case, Boehner said there is no Democratic plan. Reminded that there is a Democratic plan, Boehner’s spokesperson says a plan isn’t actually a plan unless it can pass the House or Senate. How did this conditional definition come about? They just made it up.\nTold that the Democratic plan could pass the Senate fairly easily if Republicans stop filibustering it, the Speaker says … well, he doesn’t say anything, because it’s a question he doesn’t know how to answer.\nIf Boehner told the truth, it would make Republicans look even worse, so he finds it necessary — indeed, he feels an obvious obligation — to deliberately deceive the public, cynically hoping Americans are easily fooled by garbage talking points.\nDuncan made a claim that wasn’t true; Boehner made a claim that wasn’t true. Duncan quickly acknowledged his mistake; Boehner quickly tried to redefine reality in ways that don’t make sense. Duncan apologized; Boehner still wants to pretend his lie isn’t a lie.\nIf you ever have the impression that the two sides of the political divide are playing by a very different set of rules, it’s not your imagination.\nThe place for in-depth analysis, commentary and informed perspectives.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Obamacare is reducing both the supply of and demand for workers.\nOn the demand side, the law’s regulations have made employer-sponsored health insurance more expensive. Many businesses have seen their health insurance costs skyrocket. If they do not provide “qualifying” benefits, however, they must pay stiff penalties.\nOver time, businesses will pass most of these costs on to their workers through lower wages and smaller raises. In the short term, however, many businesses must eat these costs. So they have held back on hiring.\nGallup polls find two-fifths of small-business owners reporting Obamacare caused them to hire less. Federal Reserve Banks hear similar concerns from their contacts. Recent Fed reports on the economy contain repeated variations on this theme: “Employers continued to express concern about potential cost increases related to the Affordable Care Act.”\nIn short, the Affordable Care Act has made health care less affordable. Businesses have responded by hiring less.\nObamacare will also encourage businesses to create part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs. Employers only pay the penalty on full-time workers. If they cut workers’ hours to part-time status, they owe no fines. So full-time jobs will become harder to come by when the penalties kick in.\nThe recent CBO report also finds Obamacare will strongly discourage many Americans from working. The Affordable Care Act subsidizes health insurance premiums. As workers’ incomes rise, their subsidies fall -- a lot. The health-insurance premiums for a family of four double when their income rises from one and a half to twice the poverty level. These higher premiums come on top of additional taxes owed.\nUniversity of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan -- whose work the CBO relied on -- finds that Obamacare will raise the effective tax rate on workers with median incomes to 47 percent. Each additional dollar earned will raise their income by just 53 cents. The rest goes to taxes and higher health insurance premiums.\nLower-income workers, who qualify for more benefits, will face effective tax rates exceeding 75 percent. Not surprisingly, the CBO projects this will cause millions of Americans to work less -- or not at all.\nObamacare’s defenders have spun this as good news: people who do not like their jobs can now leave the labor force without losing healthcare. They should temper their enthusiasm. Aside from the perversity of celebrating idleness (even the Soviet constitution required comrades to work), this feature makes the poverty trap worse.\nWorking less is a very rational short-term response to Obamacare’s incentives. Few Americans at any income level would work much at 75 percent tax rates. Why work 40 hours a week if you can make almost as much after-tax and after-health premiums working part-time? Why work if it adds almost nothing -- after tax and premiums -- to your spouses’ income?\nIn the short-term Obamacare makes working less a very sensible choice. But in the long term this makes it much harder to gain the skills and experience necessary to get ahead. The government heavily penalizes Americans who work hard and try to lift themselves out of poverty. Nobody should celebrate such a system.\nReduced labor supply will also hurt the broader economy. Fewer workers and fewer jobs mean less wealth in the economy. This hurts the governments’ finances too -- payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. Encouraging workers to stop working puts more stress on America’s retirement programs.\nThe Affordable Care Act has discouraged companies from creating jobs and workers from accepting them. No doctor should prescribe such a policy to an already weak economy.\n- James Sherk is a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation\nOriginally distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Rep. Kelly Statement on House Action to Fund Government, Support Troops, & Protect Americans from Obamacare\nWASHINGTON — Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) issued the following statement today after the House of Representatives passed H.J. Res 59, a Resolution to Make Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2014, along with two bipartisan amendments which would delay the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for one year and permanently repeal the law’s Medical Device Tax provision. The House also passed H.R. 3210, the Pay Our Military Act, bipartisan legislation which would ensure that members of the U.S. military are fully paid in the event of a government shutdown.\n“Once again the ‘People’s House’ has answered the will of the American people by passing responsible, commonsense legislation to deliver Americans what they’ve persistently demanded from their representatives: a fully functioning government, and protection from the president’s job-killing health care law. Now the Senate and President Obama have a duty to put their pride aside and do what is right for the entire nation. Now is the time for the interests of millions of hardworking taxpayers and families to trump petty politics and stubborn priorities. There is simply no good reason for the president to let the government shut down just so that Obamacare – a law most Americans reject – can carry on as planned.\n“In addition to keeping the government open, I was also proud to join my colleagues this evening in acting to guarantee that our brave men and women in uniform are fully paid no matter what happens in the days ahead. Support for our troops should never be a casualty of this president’s stubbornness. We also took action to permanently repeal the senseless medical device tax that Obamacare will impose on manufacturers and importers of life-saving products. This dangerous tax will kill jobs and put patients at risk and should be stopped in its tracks immediately.”\nNOTE: Rep. Kelly is a co-sponsor of the Stability, Security and Fairness Resolution introduced by Rep. Tom Graves which would delay and defund the Affordable Care Act for one year while funding the federal government for the entirety of Fiscal Year 2014.

But in live+3 ratings (which includes three days of DVR and video on-demand usage), both premieres scored an identical total viewer average: 10.6 million each.\nFox’s “The Orville” was at least a light year ahead in the adults 18-49 demo, however, opening to a strong 3.5 rating — compared to the decent, but less stellar, 2.1 rating for “Star Trek: Discovery.”\nBoth shows premiered on a Sunday, but it’s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison: “Orville” benefited from a direct NFL lead-in (on Sept. 10), while “Discovery” premiered behind “60 Minutes” (on Sept. 24). Also, “Discovery” has been promoted as a CBS All Access property, and the Eye’s digital platform generated record sign-ups in time for the launch of the latest “Star Trek” chapter — which means many fans probably watched it on that outlet.\nFrom this point on, ratings don’t really matter for “Discovery” any more — subscription levels and retention will be what CBS All Access is looking at. (They’ll be dissecting viewership internally, but much like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, those ratings won’t be shared with the media or the general public.)\nIt’s a much different story for “The Orville,” which must now battle it out on Thursday nights. In its first regular time slot outing, on Sept. 21, the results were promising: The show averaged 6.3 million viewers in live+3, and a 1.8 rating with adults 18-49, making it Fox’s highest-rated Thursday 9 p.m. telecast in more than two years.\nAfter two weeks behind football, “The Orville” will now settle in on Thursdays with a smaller lead-in and lower ratings expectations. But Fox execs are pleased with the sampling the show got at launch: According to the network, which recently saw the live+7 day (which includes a week’s worth of DVR and VOD usage) numbers, “The Orville” was Fox’s most-viewed drama debut since “Empire” in 2015, and the highest-rated drama launch among any broadcast network in adults 18-49 since ABC’s “Designated Survivor” last September.\nMeanwhile, despite naysayers claiming NFL ratings have been damaged by #TakeAKnee, the top programs on TV for the week ending Sept. 24 were Sunday Night Football in both adults 18-49 and total viewers. FX’s “American Horror Story: Cult” continues to see massive time-shifted gains, jumping 102% between its live broadcast and three days later. And NBC’s “The Good Place” returned for Season 2 in a good place.\nAs for the latest on-demand viewership chart from Xfinity, it appears viewers were looking to catch up on “Will & Grace” on the eve of its return, and have also rediscovered HBO’s “Big Little Lies” after the limited-run series’ big Emmy win. Other new shows making waves: PBS’ “The Vietnam War” documentary series, Fox’s “The Orville,” and HBO’s “The Deuce.\nHere are this week’s rankers:\n|\nRANK |\nSHOW & NETWORK |\nLIVE+3 RATING |\nWATCHED RATING |\n|\n1 |\nNFL Sunday Night Football NBC |\n6.3 |\n6.3 |\n|\n2 |\nNFL Monday Night Football ESPN |\n4.3 |\n4.3 |\n|\n3 |\nAmerica’s Got Talent (Tuesday) NBC |\n3.6 |\n3.0 |\n|\n4 |\nAmerica’s Got Talent (Wednesday) NBC |\n3.3 |\n3.0 |\n|\n5 |\n60 Minutes CBS NFL Thursday Night Football NFL Network |\n2.8 2.8 |\n2.7 2.8 |\n|\n7 |\nBig Brother (Thursday) CBS |\n2.6 |\n2.2 |\n|\n8 |\nAmerican Horror Story: Cult FX |\n2.4 |\n1.1 |\n|\n9 |\nStar Trek: Discovery CBS |\n2.1 |\n1.9 |\n|\n10 |\nDancing With The Stars ABC The Good Place NBC |\n2.0 2.0 |\n1.6 1.3 |\n|\n12 |\nThe Orville (Thursday) Fox |\n1.8 |\n1.1 |\n|\n13 |\nAmerican Ninja Warrior NBC |\n1.7 |\n1.5 |\n|\n14 |\nMasterchef (Wed 9pm) Fox |\n1.6 |\n1.2 |\n|\n15 |\nGotham Fox The Sinner USA Love & Hip Hop Hollywood 4 VH1 |\n1.5 1.5 1.5 |\n1.0 0.8 1.0 |\n|\n18 |\nMasterchef (Wed 8 pm) Fox Saturday Night Football ABC Teen Mom 2 Season 8 MTV |\n1.4 1.4 1.4 |\n1.1 1.4 0.7 |\n|\n21 |\nWho Shot Biggie & Tupac Fox The Big Bang Theory (Thu 8 pm) CBS South Park Comedy Central |\n1.3 1.3 1.3 |\n1.1 1.2 0.7 |\n|\n24 |\nCelebrity Family Feud ABC Fear the Walking Dead AMC Real Housewives of OC Bravo The Big Bang Theory (Thu 9pm) CBS The Big Bang Theory (Mon 8 pm) Bravo The Paley Center Salutes Will & Grace NBC Midnight, Texas NBC |\n1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 |\n1.1 0.7 0.6 1.2 1.1 1.1 0.8 |\n| Adults 18-49; ratings points |\n|\nRANK |\nSHOW & NETWORK |\nLIVE+3 |\nWATCHED |\n|\n1 |\nNFL Sunday Night Football NBC |\n17.56 |\n17.48 |\n|\n2 |\nAmerica’s Got Talent (Wednesday) NBC |\n17.30 |\n15.64 |\n|\n3 |\nAmerica’s Got Talent (Tuesday) NBC |\n16.82 |\n14.70 |\n|\n4 |\n60 Minutes CBS |\n15.24 |\n14.83 |\n|\n5 |\nNFL Monday Night Football ESPN |\n12.36 |\n12.29 |\n|\n6 |\nDancing With The Stars ABC |\n12.25 |\n10.72 |\n|\n7 |\nStar Trek: Discovery CBS |\n10.63 |\n9.49 |\n|\n8 |\nBig Brother (Wednesday) CBS |\n7.79 |\n6.72 |\n|\n9 |\nNFL Thursday Night Football NFL Network |\n7.52 |\n7.46 |\n|\n10 |\nThe Big Bang Theory (Thu 8pm) CBS |\n7.49 |\n7.16 |\n|\n11 |\nThe Good Place NBC |\n6.95 |\n5.28 |\n|\n12 |\nNCIS CBS |\n6.94 |\n6.60 |\n|\n13 |\nAmerican Ninja Warrior NBC |\n6.70 |\n5.96 |\n| 14 |\nThe Big Bang Theory (Thu 9pm) CBS |\n6.41 |\n6.10 |\n|\n15 |\nThe Orville (Thursday) Fox |\n6.26 |\n4.05 |\n|\n16 |\nThe Big Bang Theory (Mon 8pm) CBS |\n6.24 |\n5.97 |\n|\n17 |\nMom (Thu 8:30pm) CBS |\n6.09 |\n5.96 |\n|\n18 |\nNCIS: New Orleans CBS |\n5.97 |\n5.65 |\n|\n19 |\nBull CBS |\n5.84 |\n5.55 |\n|\n20 |\nCelebrity Family Feud ABC |\n5.65 |\n5.23 |\n|\n21 |\nBlue Bloods CBS |\n5.59 |\n5.26 |\n|\n22 |\nNCIS: Los Angeles CBS |\n5.56 |\n5.30 |\n|\n23 |\nMasterchef (Wed 9pm) Fox |\n5.32 |\n4.15 |\n|\n24 |\nDateline Friday NBC Saturday Night Football ABC |\n5.28 5.28 |\n4.04 5.26 |\n| Total viewers; in millions |\nHere is this week’s Xfinity On Demand ranker:\n|\nRANK |\nSHOW |\nNETWORK |\n|\n1 |\nGame of Thrones |\nHBO |\n|\n2 |\nThe Sinner |\nUSA |\n|\n3 |\nOutlander |\nStarz |\n|\n4 |\nThe Vietnam War |\nPBS |\n|\n5 |\nThe Orville |\nFox |\n|\n6 |\nRick and Morty |\nAdult Swim |\n|\n7 |\nAmerican Horror Story: Cult |\nFX |\n|\n8 |\nAmerica’s Got Talent |\nNBC |\n|\n9 |\nBallers |\nHBO |\n|\n10 |\nRay Donovan |\nShowtime |\n|\n11 |\nThis Is Us |\nNBC |\n|\n12 |\nTeen Mom 2 |\nMTV |\n|\n13 |\nThe Simpsons |\nFox/FXX |\n|\n14 |\nThe Deuce |\nHBO |\n|\n15 |\nLove & Hip Hop: Hollywood |\nVH1 |\n|\n16 |\nBig Little Lies |\nHBO |\n|\n17 |\nWill & Grace |\nNBC |\n|\n18 |\nSouth Park |\nComedy Central |\n|\n19 |\nLeah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath |\nA&E |\n|\n20 |\nChrisley Knows Best |\nUSA |\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest TV news!

In a year marked by a fractious presidential election which created a historic appetite for cable news and a pandemic that has disrupted nearly every aspect of our day-to-day lives, the NFL still managed to account for more than half of the 50 most-watched broadcasts, leaving little doubt that football’s outsized influence over the culture remains unassailable.\nThe NFL delivered 33 of the year’s 50 biggest TV audiences, a tally that includes 14 of the top 20 programs, of which three were games that aired during the current season. As was the case in 2016, politics insinuated itself into the Nielsen mix, as the Biden-Trump debates knocked the AFC and NFC Championship Games from their customary No. 2 and No. 3 perches, while the socially-distanced presidential conventions displaced a number of high-rated national NFL broadcasts on CBS and Fox.\nStretch the parameters to include the year’s top 100 broadcasts and the NFL appears on the list no fewer than 71 times. Toss in the Jan. 13 Clemson-LSU title tilt as well as the Rose Bowl (Oregon-Wisconsin) and the Citrus Bowl (Michigan-Alabama), and sporting events take a grand total of 74 spots. That’s down from 88 a year ago and 89 in 2018, a decline that can be attributed to the loss of the Summer Olympics on NBC and a frenzied fall sports slate that contributed to a significant contraction in viewership for the NBA Finals, World Series, Kentucky Derby and Masters Tournament. (While none of the aforementioned events managed to pull a big enough crowd to earn a spot on this year’s list, Game 6 of Fox’s Fall Classic came within shooting distance, finishing at No. 118.)\nA different sort of upheaval played out for the NFL in 2020, as the power balance between the two conferences began to even out. After years of enjoying disproportionate representation on the ratings chart, the NFC lost some of its clout, accounting for 29 of the year’s most-watched broadcasts, compared to the AFC’s 24. (Last year, the NFC held a 13-game advantage over its rival.) As cross-flexing becomes more commonplace, interconference meetings have flourished; year-to-date, AFC vs. NFC broadcasts have filled 16 of the 100 top slots. Naturally, the biggest draw among these was Super Bowl LIV.\nAmong the 71 NFL broadcasts that charted in 2020, 28 aired in primetime. The majority of these were Sunday Night Football games on NBC (15), although Fox’s Thursday Night Football broadcasts and ESPN’s Monday Night Football each claimed three spots of their own. Meanwhile, among the NFL teams that appeared in the top 100 with the greatest frequency were the Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles and Buffalo Bills.\nIn a less convulsive year, the Olympics likely would have elbowed a number of the higher-rated political events out of the upper reaches of the chart. In 2018, NBC’s coverage of the PyeongChang Games laid claim to six of the top 50 programs and 15 of the 100 most-watched broadcasts, while the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio accounted for 11 of the top 50 and 17 of the top 100 airings. Also conspicuous by its absence was the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, which was canceled on March 12.\nDespite the ongoing erosion of the advertiser-coveted demos—on a prorated basis, the Big Four broadcasters this season are averaging on the order of 5.6 million adults 18-49 per night, down 21% from the year-ago 7.1 million—sports have managed to remain a source of fascination for the TV-watching population at large. The same can no longer be said for scripted programming, which continues to lose ground to the capriciousness of a commercial-avoiding audience of Veruca Salts whose media diets have been scrambled by the everything-on-demand model.\nWhile one episode of scripted TV managed to hang on to a spot in the top 100 through Christmas Day, the release of the Dec. 27 NFL ratings shoved NCIS out of the running. The March 31 installment of CBS’s long-running procedural now stands at No. 102 on the list, making this the first year in which a single drama or comedy failed to rank among the upper echelon. Last year saw a scripted series nearly breach the ranks of the upper 50, although that was an outlier event, given that the episode in question was the two-part season finale of The Big Bang Theory. Leonard, Sheldon and the rest of CBS’s nerd herd averaged 18.5 million viewers in their swan song, good for No. 55 on the year.\nOver the last few seasons, the gap between the reach of the NFL and even the most popular scripted series has grown only wider; while NCIS remains the most-watched entertainment program with an average draw of 9.71 million live-same-day viewers—a figure that nearly doubles the overall primetime average of 5.04 million viewers per night—that pales in comparison with the numbers football puts up each week. The league’s top TV property, the national Sunday afternoon window shared by Fox and CBS, is currently averaging a staggering 22.7 million viewers, while NBC’s Sunday Night Football eclipses everything in primetime with its average draw of 16.7 million viewers.\nSetting aside the Season 3 opener of Fox’s The Masked Singer, which benefitted mightily from its Super Bowl LIV lead-in, only three episodes of unscripted entertainment programming managed to make their way onto this year’s top 100 list. In what is ultimately a fitting tribute to the late Alex Trebek, three of the four installments of ABC’s January primetime tournament Jeopardy!: The Greatest of All Time were among the year’s most-watched broadcasts, finishing at Nos. 77, 86 and 93. Also earning a place at the table were three episodes of CBS’s 53-year-old newsmagazine, 60 Minutes.\n(This story has been updated with ratings data through Dec. 27.)\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

CRISI grants will benefit several Amtrak routes that riders rely on every day and potential future corridors, with millions also supporting Amtrak’s current and future workforce” said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration and through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, FRA has announced funding for 300 rail projects nationwide—the most significant investment in American rail in more than 50 years. We look forward to our continued work with Amtrak and State partners to deliver the world-class passenger rail our citizens deserve.\nThe funding awarded to Amtrak will support six projects directly benefitting more than two dozen states:\nWolverine and Blue Water Capacity Enhancement: Niles-Glenwood Road (up to $8,384,000)\nThis project – part of the Chicago Hub Improvement Program (CHIP), an Amtrak-led Midwest megaproject aimed at improving passenger rail service into Chicago – will advance final design for plans to increase capacity along a 19-mile, mostly single tracked segment of Amtrak’s Michigan Line. This congested area impacts Amtrak’s Blue Water and Wolverine services connecting Michigan and Chicago, along with Norfolk Southern freight trains. The project will set the stage for future construction to improve service reliability, minimize traffic bottlenecks and reduce trip times for customers. Amtrak and the Michigan Department of Transportation will contribute the required local funding match.\nGrade Crossing Shunt Enhancement Safety Project (up to $58,800,000)\nThis project includes procurement and installation of Onboard Shunt Enhancement (OSE) devices for 443 locomotives and 192 cab cars on the nationwide Amtrak-operated fleet to enhance grade crossing activation reliability. Amtrak and partner State Departments of Transportation, host railroad, and railroad equipment supplier partners recently completed successful preliminary testing of this onboard innovative device that will improve grade crossing activations and reduce problems that have impacted train operations and fleet requirements for several years. This investment will improve service reliability and ensure continued safety protection. Amtrak and California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin State Departments of Transportation will contribute the required local funding match.\nSeligman Sub Efficiency Improvements Project (up to $30,237,345)\nThis project includes right-of-way acquisition and installation of a nearly three-mile-long siding and a crossover in western Arizona, where Amtrak’s Southwest Chief operates. Together, these improvements will reduce congestion and improve efficiency for freight and passenger rail operations along the Seligman Subdivision of BNSF’s Southern Transcon, one of the most heavily trafficked rail corridors in the United States. Amtrak and BNSF will contribute the required local funding match.\nMechanical Craft Workforce Development Apprenticeship Training Program (up to $14,400,000)\nThis funding will support a three-year continuation of Amtrak’s Mechanical Apprenticeship Program for 60 apprentices. This apprenticeship program was created thanks to funding from a prior CRISI grant, and it helps to strengthen Amtrak’s skilled mechanical craft workforce responsible for maintaining the company’s fleet of trains. The three-level program will be offered in Beech Grove, Indiana; Wilmington, Delaware; Washington, D.C.; New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles. Amtrak will contribute the required local funding match.\nCity of Chester, Penn. High-Security Fence Project (up to $7,769,421)\nThis project includes installation of high-security steel fencing along a segment of the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in Chester, Pa. This will significantly reduce unauthorized access along the NEC and increase safety for the surrounding communities in a high-risk area. Amtrak will contribute the required local funding match.\nRoadway Equipment Repairmen Training Program (up to $6,400,000)\nThis funding will enable Amtrak to implement a Roadway Equipment Repairmen Training Program to attract new employees and provide a continuing education for currently employed repairmen in Wilmington, Del. and Groton, Conn. Amtrak will contribute the required local funding match.\nIn addition, Amtrak supported several critical grants submitted by Amtrak partners and other entities which received funding and will benefit the Amtrak network and customers, such as:\nMuskego Yard Bypass Project\nWisconsin Department of Transportation\nReplacement of the Livingston Avenue Movable Rail Bridge\nNew York State Department of Transportation\nSpringfield Rail Improvements\nCity of Springfield, Ill.\nCarolinian and Piedmont Passenger and Freight Improvements Project\nNorth Carolina Railroad Company\nCoastal Rail Infrastructure Resiliency Project\nOrange County Transportation Authority\nThis is the second round of CRISI grant awards funded by the IIJA’s vision for expanded and improved passenger rail. Last week, Amtrak President Roger Harris joined Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson, FRA Administrator Amit Bose, representatives from the Southern Rail Commission and other local leaders to break ground on the Gulf Coast Corridor Improvement Project, which is supported by a $178M FY2022 CRISI grant announced late last year in the first batch of CRISI grants funded by the IIJA.\nMany of the CRISI grants awarded to or for the benefit of Amtrak will also benefit host freight or commuter railroads over which Amtrak trains operate. The CRISI Program is an important funding source for vital projects, including rail safety and workforce development initiatives, not eligible under other competitive FRA grant programs.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        » Governor Jim Doyle proposes using stimulus money for Madison-to-Milwaukee line.\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports that Wisconsin is to apply for $519 million in stimulus funds for the Milwaukee-Madison tin-hsr program, which will reactivate an abandoned freight line between the state’s biggest cities. Wisconsin joins the list of states gearing up for a part of the $8 billion in high-speed rail money that Congress approved last month. New York will ask for funds for a third track between Albany and Buffalo, Illinois is pushing improvements for the line between Chicago and St. Louis, Washington will work to improve the Cascades corridor between Portland and Seattle, and California will of course be angling for a huge percentage of the money for its already partially-funded Los Angeles-to-San Francisco line.\nWisconsin’s first priority will be connecting its two biggest cities, which currently lacks any kind of rail link. Trains running at up to 110 mph would run along the corridor in 1h07 six times a day, round trip. Meanwhile, the current Hiawatha Amtrak service between Chicago and Milwaukee would ramp up to ten trains a day from the seven currently offered.\nGovernor Jim Doyle (D) also suggested that the state would be pushing forward quickly with other corridors as soon as it could secure funding. The Chicago-to-Milwaukee line would be sped up to 110 mph for a cost of $419 million and provide an astonishing 17 round trips daily; a new corridor between Milwaukee and Green Bay would be activated at a cost of $421 million, with 7 trains daily; and a line from Madison to St. Paul, Minnesota would be constructed and upgraded for a cost of $456 million (in Wisconsin alone), for six trains daily.\nThis last corridor is one of the more important in the nation since it would connect with the Twin Cities, whose metro population is more than three million. Travel between Chicago and that area could expand significantly with faster trip times. But Minnesota, under a Republican governor, has been less active in pushing for rail improvements and as a result most of the planning for improvements has been on the Wisconsin side. That said, citizen and business groups in Rochester, Minnesota, a city of 85,000 in the southeast section of the state, are pushing to reroute current Amtrak services through their city on the way to St. Paul. Such a connection would require the construction of new track and acquisition of right-of-way, so it’s unclear whether the state will be able to develop a viable funding solution to that problem, or whether Minnesota will invest in rail at all.\nBut the news from Wisconsin is great news on all fronts – the state has developed a long-term vision for rail services there and has prioritized a corridor for federal stimulus investment. For a small state like Wisconsin, which already has good rail ridership and could see large increases with service improvements, $519 million seems a reasonable sum for which to demand from Washington. We’ll see in June what Secretary LaHood thinks.\n5 replies on “Wisconsin Offers Up Proposal for Rail Expansion”\nThere’s no specific news story or big roll-out but I believe that North Carolina is also going to request tin-hsr funds.\nThe big ticket item is double-tracking the line from Greensboro to Goldsboro ($650 mn). About half of that mileage would be for the high speed line.\nLINK\nI’m concerned about the Madison terminus of the proposed service. As a student at UW-Madison a decade ago, I dreamed of being able to walk from campus to catch a train to Chicago and Milwaukee. The proposed alignment has the service stopping on the far east side of Madison at Truax Field (Dane County airport). This terminus would require a 20-minute bus or taxi ride from the downtown isthmus. The 1h07m running time being touted between Madison and Milwaukee would really be more like 1h30m from downtown Madison to Milwaukee’s Amtrak station if everything ran perfectly. In reality, it’s probably closer to a 2h trip considering transit from downtown Madison to the station and 10-15 minutes of transfer time.\nThe Madison-Milwaukee and Madison-Chicago routes are already served by two high-frequency, high-quality bus services (Badger and Van Galder last I checked), which depart from the Memorial Union on campus. If travelers have a choice of walking to the Union to catch a direct bus versus taking a city bus or taxi to a distant eastside station to transfer to an “accelerail” or “TIN-HSR” train service, they may just decide to stick with the bus.\nGranted, it will be difficult to thread passenger service all the way downtown – lots of grade crossings and slow speeds – but there are two fantastic potential station sites once you get there. The existing station on West Washington Ave (former C&NW, I believe) backs up to the Kohl Center arena and Southeast Dorms (probably over 3,000 student beds) and could serve as the terminus. Another downtown station could be built underneath the Monona Terrace conference center, 2-3 blocks from the capitol in the heart of downtown. These two stations are located where the potential ridership is going to come from. Again, reaching downtown will be slow and require the creation of many Quiet Zones, but a one-seat train ride would trump a one-seat bus ride.\nMadison does have terrible geography for good rail service along this corridor.\nThe solution I’ve seen proposed is to leave the high-speed station outside of town at the airport — the extra time to go downtown and back, plus reversing the direction of the train, would be deadly for the Minneapolis-Chicago service — but also build Dane County Commuter Rail.\nhttp://www.co.dane.wi.us/rail/railmap.htm\nThis would mean that the trip from downtown would be a matter of changing trains at the airport station. A two-seat train ride would probably trump a one-seat bus ride. Especially if the commuter train was faster than a bus or taxi, which it should be if designed properly.\nWhile I agree that bringing a train from Milwaukee to the Isthmus, then heading back out to the Eastside on the way to Minneapolis would be a time-consuming affair, I think the ridership potential between Madison-Milwaukee/Chicago is far higher than Minneapolis-Milwaukee/Chicago. Under this accelerail (“not quite HSR”) proposal, Madison and the UW campus will be a FAR larger source of ridership than Minneapolis. The only way to make Minneapolis-Chicago a route that requires high frequency is to have true HSR service on that corridor. If that were ever built, I could imagine an HSR station like Lyon-Satolas near the airport on the Eastside.\nTherefore, I think the service concept is flawed if they’re going to extend every train from Milwaukee to Minneapolis. I could see something like an hourly service from Milwaukee to Madison in a decade with service every 2-3 hours to Minneapolis. In that case it would make more sense to run the train to the Isthmus first.\nGood comments and discussion. I struggled with improving transit in Madison as a student and unfortunately had to leave for better job prospects. It still has a special place in my heart. Too bad Madison is just far enough off the “path” to make through service problematic. For trains originating and ending in Madison it would make the most sense to do that at Monona Terrace or W. Washington Ave. like the old days. As the commenter above noted – you need a one seat ride from campus without a long cab/bus trip to the airport. Neighborhood opposition will require low speeds in the city and will thwart any elevated options. A tunnel would be best, but its’ doubtful if such a small city warrants that expense. The federal money for HSR would be best spent for true High Speed at 220mph on the Minneapolis-Milwaukee-Chicago route that serves areas with over 1 mil population, then Madison, Eau Claire and Green Bay/Fox Valley should be connected into it with 90 or 110mph and direct routed interoperable trains. For Madison, connections from Downtown to Milwaukee and a N-S line parallel to I-90 from IL to the Wis.Dells make a lot of sense. If businesses in the Dells were smart they would be advocating a commuter rail link from the Dane County Airport to the Dells and south through the Rock Valley to Janesville, Beloit and Rockford, IL. One train a day at bad times (Empire Builder) is currently a huge disservice to the tourism potential there.\nSadly, Madison has been lost in a pipe dream of E-W commuter rail (Transport 2020) that has inhibited any real action on improving transit in the city for the last 20 years. I love light rail and commuter rail and wish it was workable there, but what a city the size of Madison can and should realistically do now is to upgrade its excellent bus network with a few affordable BRT lines to take people around town quickly, like Eugene, OR. — and have speedy trains to get outside of the city!\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

It is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.[16] Its primary clinical use is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from surgery.[17][18] Fentanyl is also used as a sedative for intubated patients.[19] Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and ingesting a small quantity can cause overdose.[20] Fentanyl works by activating μ-opioid receptors.[14] Fentanyl is sold under the brand names Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze, among others.[21]\nPharmaceutical fentanyl's adverse effects are similar to those of other opioids and narcotics,[22] including addiction, confusion, respiratory depression (which, if extensive and untreated, may lead to respiratory arrest), drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, hallucinations, delirium (including narcotic delirium), narcotic ileus, muscle rigidity, constipation, loss of consciousness, hypotension, coma, and death.[19] Alcohol and other drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin) can synergistically exacerbate fentanyl's side effects. Naloxone and naltrexone are opioid antagonists that reverse the effects of fentanyl.\nFentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1960 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968.[14][23] In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 pounds) were used in healthcare globally.[24] As of 2017[update], fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine;[25] in 2019, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than a million prescriptions.[26][27] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[28]\nFentanyl is contributing to an epidemic of synthetic opioid drug overdose deaths in the United States. From 2011 to 2021, deaths from prescription opioid (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) per year remained stable, while synthetic opioid (primarily fentanyl) deaths per year increased from 2,600 overdoses to 70,601.[29] Since 2018, fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in 2021.[30][29][31] Fentanyl constitutes the majority of all drug overdose deaths in the United States since it overtook heroin in 2018.[30] The United States National Forensic Laboratory estimates fentanyl reports by federal, state, and local forensic laboratories increased from 4,697 reports in 2014 to 117,045 reports in 2020.[32] Fentanyl is often mixed, cut, or ingested alongside other drugs, including cocaine and heroin.[32] Fentanyl has been reported in pill form, including pills mimicking pharmaceutical drugs such as oxycodone.[32] Mixing with other drugs or disguising as a pharmaceutical makes it difficult to determine the correct treatment in the case of an overdose, resulting in more deaths.[19] In an attempt to reduce the number of overdoses from taking other drugs mixed with fentanyl, drug testing kits, strips, and labs are available.[33][34] Fentanyl's ease of manufacture and high potency makes it easier to produce and smuggle, resulting in fentanyl replacing other abused narcotics and becoming more widely used.[citation needed]\nMedical uses\n[edit]Anesthesia\n[edit]Intravenous fentanyl is often used for anesthesia and as an analgesic.[35] To induce anesthesia, it is given with a sedative like propofol or thiopental.[36] To maintain anesthesia, inhaled anesthetics and additional fentanyl may be used.[36] These are often given in 15–30 minute intervals throughout procedures such as endoscopy and surgeries and in emergency rooms.[37][38]\nFor pain relief after surgery, use can decrease the amount of inhalational anesthetic needed for emergence from anesthesia.[36] Balancing this medication and titrating the drug based on expected stimuli and the person's responses can result in stable blood pressure and heart rate throughout a procedure and a faster emergence from anesthesia with minimal pain.[36]\nRegional anesthesia\n[edit]Fentanyl is the most commonly used intrathecal opioid because its lipophilic profile allows a quick onset of action (5–10 min) and intermediate duration of action (60–120 min).[39] Spinal administration of hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl may be the optimal combination. The almost immediate onset of fentanyl reduces visceral discomfort and even nausea during the procedure.[40]\nObstetrics\n[edit]Fentanyl is sometimes given intrathecally as part of spinal anesthesia or epidurally for epidural anesthesia and analgesia. Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia.[41] It is widely used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its short time to action peak (about 5 minutes), the rapid termination of its effect after a single dose, and the occurrence of relative cardiovascular stability.[42] In obstetrics, the dose must be closely regulated to prevent large amounts of transfer from mother to fetus. At high doses, the drug may act on the fetus to cause neonatal withdrawal.[42] For this reason, shorter-acting agents such as alfentanyl or remifentanil may be more suitable in the context of inducing general anesthesia.[43]\nPain management\n[edit]The bioavailability of intranasal fentanyl is about 70–90% but with some imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow, and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, intranasal fentanyl is available in doses of 50, 100, 200, 400(PecFent) μg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of intranasal fentanyl with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain-reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900 out-of-hospital patients.[44]\nIn children, intranasal fentanyl is useful for the treatment of moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated.[45] Furthermore, a 2017 study suggested the efficacy of fentanyl lozenges in children as young as five, weighing as little as 13 kg. Lozenges are more inclined to be used as the child is in control of sufficient dosage, in contrast to buccal tablets.[46]\nChronic pain\n[edit]It is also used in the management of chronic pain.[47] Often, transdermal patches are used.[32] The patches work by slowly releasing fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management.[48] Dosage is based on the size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature.[48] Each patch should be changed every 72 hours.[49] Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption, and route of administration. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opioid (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain.[48] It is unclear if fentanyl gives long-term pain relief to people with neuropathic pain.[50]\nBreakthrough pain\n[edit]Sublingual fentanyl dissolves quickly and is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa to provide rapid analgesia.[51] Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound,[51][52] which is well absorbed sublingually and generally well tolerated.[51] Such forms are particularly useful for breakthrough cancer pain episodes, which are often rapid in onset, short in duration, and severe in intensity.[53]\nPalliative care\n[edit]In palliative care, transdermal fentanyl patches have a definitive, but limited role for:\n- people already stabilized on other opioids who have persistent swallowing problems and cannot tolerate other parenteral routes such as subcutaneous administration.\n- people with moderate to severe kidney failure.[54]\n- troublesome side effects of oral morphine, hydromorphone, or oxycodone.[55][56]\nWhen using the transdermal patch, patients must be careful to minimize or avoid external heat sources (direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.), which can trigger the release and absorption of too much medication and cause potentially deadly complications.[57]\nCombat medicine\n[edit]USAF Pararescue combat medics in Afghanistan used fentanyl lozenges in the form of lollipops on combat casualties from IED blasts and other trauma.[58] The stick is taped to a finger and the lozenge put in the cheek of the person. When enough fentanyl has been absorbed, the (sedated) person generally lets the lollipop fall from the mouth, indicating sufficient analgesia and somewhat reducing the likelihood of overdose and associated risks.[58]\nBreathing difficulties\n[edit]Fentanyl is used to help relieve shortness of breath (dyspnea) when patients cannot tolerate morphine, or whose breathlessness is refractory to morphine. Fentanyl is useful for such treatment in palliative care settings where pain and shortness of breath are severe and need to be treated with strong opioids. Nebulized fentanyl citrate is used to relieve end-of-life dyspnea in hospice settings.[59][60]\nOther\n[edit]Some routes of administration such as nasal sprays and inhalers generally result in a faster onset of high blood levels, which can provide more immediate analgesia but also more severe side effects, especially in overdose. The much higher cost of some of these appliances may not be justified by marginal benefit compared with buccal or oral options. Intranasal fentanyl appears to be equally effective as IV morphine and superior to intramuscular morphine for the management of acute hospital pain.[45]\nA fentanyl patient-controlled transdermal system (PCTS) is under development, which aims to allow patients to control the administration of fentanyl through the skin to treat postoperative pain.[61] The technology consists of a \"preprogrammed, self-contained drug-delivery system\" that uses electrotransport technology to administer on-demand doses of 40 μg of fentanyl hydrochloride over ten minutes. In a 2004 experiment including 189 patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain up to 24 hours after major surgery, 25% of patients withdrew due to inadequate analgesia. However, the PCTS method proved superior to the placebo, showing lower mean VAS pain scores and having no significant respiratory depression effects.[62]\nAdverse effects\n[edit]Fentanyl's most common side effects, which affect more than 10% of people, include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, and asthenia (weakness). Less frequently, in 3–10% of people, fentanyl can cause abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), shortness of breath, hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with aphasia.[63] Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less histamine-mediated itching, than morphine.[64] In rare cases, serotonin syndrome is associated with fentanyl use. Existing studies advise medical practitioners to exercise caution when combining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs with fentanyl.[65][66]\nThe duration of action of fentanyl has sometimes been underestimated, leading to harm in a medical context.[67][68][69][70] In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but doctors in the United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008.[71] The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more had become seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.[72]\nRespiratory depression\n[edit]The most dangerous adverse effect of fentanyl is respiratory depression,[73] that is, decreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide leading to reduced rate of breathing, which can cause anoxic brain injury or death. This risk is decreased when the airway is secured with an endotracheal tube (as during anesthesia).[74] This risk is higher in specific groups, like those with obstructive sleep apnea.[74]\nOther factors that increase the risk of respiratory depression are:[74]\n- High fentanyl doses\n- Simultaneous use of methadone\n- Sleep\n- Older age\n- Simultaneous use of CNS depressants like benzodiazepines (i.e. alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam), barbiturates, alcohol, and inhaled anesthetics\n- Hyperventilation\n- Decreased CO2 levels in the serum\n- Respiratory acidosis\n- Decreased fentanyl clearance from the body\n- Decreased blood flow to the liver\n- Renal insufficiency\nSustained release fentanyl preparations, such as patches, may also produce unexpected delayed respiratory depression.[75][76][77] The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:\n- Saturation of the body fat compartment in people with rapid and profound body fat loss (people with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced cachexia can lose 80% of their body fat).\n- Early carbon dioxide retention causes cutaneous vasodilation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces the protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.\n- Reduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.\nAnother related complication of fentanyl overdoses includes the so-called wooden chest syndrome, which quickly induces complete respiratory failure by paralyzing the thoracic muscles, explained in more detail in the Muscle rigidity section below.\nHeart and blood vessels\n[edit]- Bradycardia: Fentanyl decreases the heart rate by increasing vagal nerve tone in the brainstem, which increases the parasympathetic drive.[74]\n- Vasodilation: It also vasodilates arterial and venous blood vessels through a central mechanism, by primarily slowing down vasomotor centers in the brainstem. To a lesser extent, it does this by directly affecting blood vessels.[74] This is much more profound in patients who have an already increased sympathetic drive, like patients who have high blood pressure or congestive heart failure.[74] It does not affect the contractility of the heart when regular doses are administered.[74]\nMuscle rigidity\n[edit]If high boluses of fentanyl are administered quickly, muscle rigidity of the vocal cords can make bag-mask ventilation very difficult.[74] The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it can be prevented and treated using neuromuscular blockers.[74]\nWooden chest syndrome\n[edit]A prominent idiosyncratic adverse effect of fentanyl also includes a sudden onset of rigidity of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, which induces respiratory failure; this is seen with high doses and is known as wooden chest syndrome.[78] The syndrome is believed to be the main cause of death as a result of fentanyl overdoses.[79]\nWooden chest syndrome is reversed by naloxone and is believed to be caused by a release of noradrenaline, which activates α-adrenergic receptors and also possibly via activation of cholinergic receptors.[80]\nWooden chest syndrome is unique to the most powerful opioids—which today comprise fentanyl and its analogs—while other less-powerful opioids like heroin produce mild rigidity of the respiratory muscles to a much lesser degree.[81][80]\nOverdose\n[edit]Fentanyl poses an exceptionally high overdose risk in humans since the amount required to cause toxicity is unpredictable.[19] In its pharmaceutical form, most overdose deaths attributed solely to fentanyl occur at serum concentrations at a mean of 0.025 μg/mL, with a range 0.005–0.027 μg/mL.[82] In contexts of poly-substance use, blood fentanyl concentrations of approximately 0.007 μg/mL or greater have been associated with fatalities.[83] Over 85% of overdoses involved at least one other drug, and there was no clear correlation showing at which level the mixtures were fatal. The dosages of fatal mixtures varied by over three magnitudes in some cases.[84]\nNaloxone (sold under the brand name Narcan) can completely or partially reverse an opioid overdose.[85] In July 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK issued a warning about the potential for life-threatening harm from accidental exposure to transdermal fentanyl patches, particularly in children,[86] and advised that they should be folded, with the adhesive side in, before being discarded. The patches should be kept away from children, who are most at risk from fentanyl overdose.[87] In the US, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs caused over 29,000 deaths in 2017, a large increase over the previous four years.[88][89]\nSome increases in fentanyl deaths do not involve prescription fentanyl but are related to illicitly made fentanyl that is being mixed with or sold as heroin.[90] Death from fentanyl overdose continues to be a public health issue of national concern in Canada since September 2015.[91] In 2016, deaths from fentanyl overdoses in the province of British Columbia averaged two persons per day.[92] In 2017 the death rate increased by more than 100% with 368 overdose-related deaths in British Columbia between January and April 2017.[93]\nFentanyl has started to be mixed into illicitly manufactured opioids and benzodiazepines. Fentanyl contamination in cocaine, methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA, and other drugs is common.[94][95] A kilogram of heroin laced with fentanyl may sell for more than US$100,000, but the fentanyl itself may be produced far more cheaply, for about US$6,000 per kilogram. While Mexico and China are the primary source countries for fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked directly into the United States, India is emerging as a source for finished fentanyl powder and fentanyl precursor chemicals.[96][97] The United Kingdom illicit drug market is no longer reliant on China, as domestic fentanyl production is replacing imports.[98]\nThe intravenous dose causing 50% of opioid-naive experimental subjects to die (LD50) is \"3 mg/kg in rats, 1 mg/kg in cats, 14 mg/kg in dogs, and 0.03 mg/kg in monkeys.\"[99] The LD50 in mice has been given as 6.9 mg/kg by intravenous administration, 17.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 27.8 mg/kg by oral administration.[100] The LD50 in humans is unknown.[101][unreliable medical source?] [undue weight? – discuss]\nIn 2023, overdose deaths in the U.S. and Canada again reached record numbers.[102] While overdoses involving fentanyl in the United States have decreased in 2024, the overall percentage of overdoses involving fentanyl has remained stable between 70% and 80% from 2021-2024.[102] According to a 2023 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the increased numbers of deaths are not related to an increased number of users but to the lethal effects of fentanyl itself. In an article published by Los Alamos National Laboratory, researchers state, \"Because of the very high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it's hard to dilute precisely, so small inaccuracies in weight can cause huge variation between batches, and it's all too easy for someone to get too much.\"[103]\nFentanyl would require a special status as it is considerably more toxic than other widely abused opioids and opiates.[104] Overdose deaths in pediatric cases are also concerning. In a report published in JAMA Pediatrics, 37.5% of all fatal pediatric cases between 1999 and 2021 were related to fentanyl; most of the deaths were among adolescents (89.6%) and children aged 0 to 4 years (6.6%). According to the UNODC, \"the opioid crisis in North America is unabated, fueled by an unprecedented number of overdose deaths.\"[105]\nPrevention\n[edit]Public health advisories to prevent fentanyl misuse and fatal overdose have been issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). An initial HAN Advisory, also known as a Health Alert Network Advisory (\"provides vital, time-sensitive information for a specific incident or situation; warrants immediate action or attention by health officials, laboratorians, clinicians, and members of the public; and conveys the highest level of importance\") was issued during October 2015.[106] A subsequent HAN Alert was issued in July 2018, warning of rising numbers of deaths due to fentanyl abuse and mixing with non-opioids.[107] A December 2020 HAN Advisory warned of:\nsubstantial increases in drug overdose deaths across the United States, primarily driven by rapid increases in overdose deaths involving ... illicitly manufactured fentanyl; a concerning acceleration of the increase in drug overdose deaths, with the largest increase recorded from March 2020 to May 2020, coinciding with the implementation of widespread mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic; significant increases in overdose deaths involving methamphetamine.[108]\n81,230 drug overdose deaths occurred during the 12 months from May 2019 to May 2020, the largest number of drug overdoses for a 12-month interval ever recorded for the U.S. The CDC recommended the following four actions to counter this rise:[108]\n- Local need to expand the distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education,\n- Expand awareness, access, and availability of treatment for substance use disorders,\n- Intervene early with individuals at the highest risk for overdose, and\n- improve detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.[108][109]\nIn Arizona, a counterfeit fentanyl pill costs between $1-$3.[110] Another initiative is a social media campaign from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) called \"One Pill Can Kill\".[111] This social media campaign's goal is to spread awareness of the prevalence of counterfeit pills that are being sold in America that is leading to the large overdose epidemic in America. This campaign also shows the difference between counterfeit pills and real pills.\nPharmacology\n[edit]Classification\n[edit]Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid in the phenylpiperidine family, which includes sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil.[112][113] Some fentanyl analogues, such as carfentanil, are up to 10,000 times stronger than morphine.[114]\nStructure-activity\n[edit]The structures of opioids share many similarities. Whereas opioids like codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and hydromorphone are synthesized by simple modifications of morphine, fentanyl, and its relatives are synthesized by modifications of meperidine.[74] Meperidine is a fully synthetic opioid, and other members of the phenylpiperidine family like alfentanil and sufentanil are complex versions of this structure.[74]\nLike other opioids, fentanyl is a weak base that is highly lipid-soluble, protein-bound, and protonated at physiological pH.[74] All of these factors allow it to rapidly cross cellular membranes, contributing to its quick effect in the body and the central nervous system.[64][112]\nFentanyl analogs\n[edit]Fentanyl analogs are types of fentanyl with various chemical modifications on any number of positions of the molecule, but still maintain, or even exceed, its pharmacological effects. Many fentanyl analogs are termed \"designer drugs\" because they are synthesized solely to be used illicitly. Carfentanil, a fentanyl analog, has an additional methyl ester group attached to the 4 position. Carfentanil is 20–30 times as potent as fentanyl and is common in the illicit drug chain. The drug is commonly used to tranquilize elephants and other large animals.[115]\nMechanism of action\n[edit]| Affinities, Ki | Ratio | ||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| MOR | DOR | KOR | MOR:DOR:KOR |\n| 0.39 nM | >1,000 nM | 255 nM | 1:>2564:654 |\nFentanyl, like other opioids, acts on opioid receptors. These receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, which contain seven transmembrane portions, intracellular loops, extracellular loops, intracellular C-terminus, and extracellular N-terminus.[74] The extracellular N-terminus is important in differentiating different types of binding substrates.[74] When fentanyl binds, downstream signaling leads to inhibitory effects, such as decreased cAMP production, decreased calcium ion influx, and increased potassium efflux.[74] This inhibits the ascending pathways in the central nervous system to increase pain threshold by changing the perception of pain; this is mediated by decreasing propagation of nociceptive signals, resulting in analgesic effects.[117][118][unreliable medical source?]\nAs a μ-receptor agonist, fentanyl binds 50 to 100 times more potently than morphine.[117] It can also bind to the delta and kappa opioid receptors but with a lower affinity. It has high lipid solubility, allowing it to penetrate more easily the central nervous system.[112][64] It attenuates \"second pain\" with primary effects on slow-conducting, unmyelinated C-fibers and is less effective on neuropathic pain and \"first pain\" signals through small, myelinated A-fibers.[74]\nFentanyl can produce the following clinical effects strongly, through μ-receptor agonism:[119]\n- Supraspinal analgesia (μ1)\n- Respiratory depression (μ2)\n- Physical dependence\n- Muscle rigidity\nIt also produces sedation and spinal analgesia through Κ-receptor agonism.[119]\nTherapeutic effects\n[edit]- Pain relief: Primarily, fentanyl provides the relief of pain by acting on the brain and spinal μ-receptors.[74]\n- Sedation: Fentanyl produces sleep and drowsiness, as the dosage is increased, and can produce the δ-waves often seen in natural sleep on electroencephalogram.[74]\n- Suppression of the cough reflex: Fentanyl can decrease the struggle against an endotracheal tube and excessive coughing by decreasing the cough reflex, becoming useful when intubating people who are awake and have compromised airways.[74] After receiving a bolus dose of fentanyl, people can also experience paradoxical coughing, which is a phenomenon that is not well understood.[74]\nDetection in biological fluids\n[edit]Fentanyl may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Commercially available immunoassays are often used as initial screening tests, but chromatographic techniques are generally used for confirmation and quantitation. The Marquis Color test may also be used to detect the presence of fentanyl. Using formaldehyde and sulfuric acid, the solution will turn purple when introduced to opium drugs. Blood or plasma fentanyl concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 μg/L in persons using the medication therapeutically, 1–10 μg/L in intoxicated people, and 3–300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.[120] Paper spray-mass spectrometry (PS-MS) may be useful for initial testing of samples.[121]\nDetection for harm reduction purposes\n[edit]Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues can be qualitatively detected in drug samples using commercially available fentanyl testing strips or spot reagents. Following the principles of harm reduction, this test is to be used directly on drug samples as opposed to urine. To prepare a sample for testing, approximately 10 mg of the drug should be diluted into 1 teaspoon, or 5 mL, of water.[122] Research in Dr. Lieberman's lab at the University of Notre Dame has reported false positive results on BTNX fentanyl testing strips with methamphetamine, MDMA, and diphenhydramine.[123] The sensitivity and specificity of fentanyl test strips vary depending on the concentration of fentanyl tested, particularly from 10 to 250 ng/mL.[124]\nSynthesis\n[edit]Fentanyl is a 4-anilinopiperidine class synthetic opioid.[125] The synthesis of Fentanyl is accomplished by one of four main methods as reported in the scientific literature: the Janssen, Siegfried, Gupta, or Suh method.[126][127]\nJanssen\n[edit]The original synthesis as patented in 1964 by Paul Janssen involves the synthesis of benzylfentanyl from N-benzyl-4-Piperidone. The resulting benzylfentanyl is used as feedstock to norfentanyl. It is norfentanyl that forms fentanyl upon reaction with a phenethyl halide.[128][129]\nSiegfried\n[edit]The Siegfried method, initially described in 1978 and later published on The Hive, involves the initial synthesis of N-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP).[130] This intermediate is reductively aminated to 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (4-ANPP). Fentanyl is produced following the reaction of 4-ANPP with an acyl chloride.[131] The Siegfried method was used in the early 2000s to manufacture fentanyl in clandestine laboratories in the USA and other countries.[132]\nGupta\n[edit]The Gupta (or 'one-pot') method starts from 4-Piperidone and skips the direct use of 4-ANPP/NPP; rather, the compounds are formed only as impurities or temporary intermediates.[133][134] For the first half of 2021, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the Gupta method was the predominant synthesis route in their samples of seized fentanyl.[135] In 2022, Braga and coworkers described a synthesis of fentanyl involving continuous flow with photoredox catalysis that uses reagents similar to the ones described for the Gupta procedure.[136]\nSuh\n[edit]The Suh (or 'total synthesis') method skips the direct use of piperidine precursors in favor of creating the ring system in situ.[137]\nHistory\n[edit]Fentanyl was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul Janssen under the label of his relatively newly formed Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1959.[138] It was developed by screening chemicals similar to pethidine (Demerol) for opioid activity.[139] The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio).[140][141] Fentanyl citrate entered medical use as a general anesthetic in 1968, manufactured by McNeil Laboratories under the brand name Sublimaze.[142]\nIn the mid-1990s, Janssen Pharmaceutica developed and introduced into clinical trials the Duragesic patch, which is a formulation of an inert alcohol gel infused with select fentanyl doses, which are worn to provide constant administration of the opioid over 48 to 72 hours. After a set of successful clinical trials, Duragesic fentanyl patches were introduced into medical practice.[143]\nFollowing the patch, a flavored lollipop of fentanyl citrate mixed with inert fillers was introduced in 1998 under the brand name Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain.[144]\nIn 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Onsolis (fentanyl buccal soluble film), a fentanyl drug in a new dosage form for cancer pain management in opioid-tolerant subjects.[145] It uses a medication delivery technology called BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive), a small dissolvable polymer film containing various fentanyl doses applied to the inner lining of the cheek.[145]\nFentanyl has a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number (ACSCN) of 9801. Its annual aggregate manufacturing quota has significantly reduced in recent years from 2,300,000 kg in 2015 and 2016 to only 731,452 kg in 2021, a nearly 68.2% decrease.[146]\nSociety and culture\n[edit]Legal status\n[edit]Effective from 1 May 2019, China officially classified all forms of fentanyl as controlled narcotics.[147]\nIn the UK, fentanyl is classified as a controlled Schedule II, Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.[148]\nIn the Netherlands, fentanyl is a List I substance of the Opium Law.[149]\nIn the US, fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance per the Controlled Substances Act. Distributors of Abstral are required to implement an FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program.[150][151] In order to curb misuse, many health insurers have begun to require precertification and/or quantity limits for Actiq prescriptions.[152][153][154]\nIn Canada, fentanyl is considered a schedule I drug as listed in Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.[155] Some fentanyl precursors, such as the piperidones (after October 2023) have been banned under its Precursor Control Regulations,[156] which have been in place at least since November 2016.[157]\nEstonia is known to have been home to the world's longest documented fentanyl epidemic, especially following the Taliban ban on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan.[158]\nA 2018 report by The Guardian indicated that many major drug suppliers on the dark web have voluntarily banned the trafficking of fentanyl.[159]\nThe fentanyl epidemic has erupted in a highly acrimonious dispute between the U.S. and Mexican governments. While U.S. officials blame the flood of fentanyl crossing the border primarily on Mexican crime groups, then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador insisted that the main source of this synthetic drug is Asia. He stated that the crisis of a lack of family values in the United States drives people to use the drug.[160]\nRecreational use\n[edit]Illicit use of pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues first appeared in the mid-1970s in the medical community and continues in the present. More than 12 different analogues of fentanyl, all unapproved and clandestinely produced, have been identified in the U.S. drug traffic. In February 2018, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration indicated that illicit fentanyl analogs have no medically valid use, and thus applied a \"Schedule I\" classification to them.[161]\nFentanyl analogues may be hundreds of times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, which can lead to overdose. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses.[162] Recreational use is not particularly widespread in the EU except for Tallinn, Estonia, where it has largely replaced heroin. Estonia has the highest rate of 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.[163]\nFentanyl is sometimes sold on the black market in the form of transdermal fentanyl patches such as Duragesic, diverted from legitimate medical supplies. The gel from inside the patches is sometimes ingested or injected.[164]\nAnother form of fentanyl that has appeared on the streets is the Actiq lollipop formulation. The pharmacy retail price ranges from US$15 to US$50 per unit based on the strength of the lozenge, with the black market cost ranging from US$5 to US$25 in 2007, depending on the dose.[165] The attorneys general of Connecticut and Pennsylvania have launched investigations into its diversion from the legitimate pharmaceutical market, including Cephalon's \"sales and promotional practices for Provigil, Actiq and Gabitril.\"[165]\nNon-medical use of fentanyl by individuals without opioid tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths.[164] Even those with opiate tolerances are at high risk for overdoses. Like all opioids, the effects of fentanyl can be reversed with naloxone, or other opiate antagonists. Naloxone is increasingly available to the public. Long-acting or sustained-release opioids may require repeat dosage. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.[166]\nSome heroin dealers mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. In 2006, illegally manufactured, non-pharmaceutical fentanyl often mixed with cocaine or heroin caused an outbreak of overdose deaths in the United States and Canada, heavily concentrated in the cities of Dayton, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[167]\nEnforcement\n[edit]The fentanyl supply chain in Mexico consists of a vast and elusive network, potentially involving hundreds of players. U.S. and Mexican anti-narcotics officials acknowledge that the exact number is unknown. Some brokers operate as specialists within major cartels, while others act independently. However, the majority remain unknown to authorities and operate below the radar. A major challenge in disrupting this trade lies in the global chemical industry. Many of the compounds used to manufacture fentanyl have legitimate industrial applications, classifying them as dual-use chemicals. These substances are often unregulated or only lightly controlled in key countries such as the United States, Mexico, and China. This regulatory gap enables brokers to evade detection, seamlessly navigating between the legal chemical trade and the illicit drug market to acquire the necessary precursors.[169]\nSeveral large quantities of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a tablet press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China.[170][171] A seizure of a record amount of fentanyl occurred on 2 February 2019, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Nogales, Arizona. The 254 pounds (115 kg) of fentanyl, which was estimated to be worth US$3.5M, was concealed in a compartment under a false floor of a truck transporting cucumbers.[172] The \"China White\" form of fentanyl refers to any of a number of clandestinely produced analogues, especially α-methylfentanyl (AMF).[173] One US Department of Justice publication lists \"China White\" as a synonym for a number of fentanyl analogues, including 3-methylfentanyl and α-methylfentanyl,[174] which today are classified as Schedule I drugs in the United States.[173] Part of the motivation for AMF is that, despite the extra difficulty from a synthetic standpoint, the resultant drug is more resistant to metabolic degradation. This results in a drug with an increased duration.[175]\nIn June 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory[176] to emergency departments alerting to 14 overdose deaths among intravenous drug users in Rhode Island associated with acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid analog of fentanyl that has never been licensed for medical use. In a separate study conducted by the CDC, 82% of fentanyl overdose deaths involved illegally manufactured fentanyl, while only 4% were suspected to originate from a prescription.[177]\nBeginning in 2015, Canada has seen several fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspected that the drug was being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups in powder form and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets.[178] Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in the deaths of people from all walks of life—from homeless individuals to professionals—including teens and young parents.[179] Because of the rising deaths across the country, especially in British Columbia where 1,716 deaths were reported in 2020 and 1,782 from January to October 2021,[180] Health Canada is putting a rush on a review of the prescription-only status of naloxone in an effort to combat overdoses of the drug.[181] In 2018, Global News reported allegations that diplomatic tensions between Canada and China hindered cooperation to seize imports, with Beijing being accused of inaction.[182]\nFentanyl has been discovered for sale in illicit markets in Australia in 2017[183] and in New Zealand in 2018.[184] In response, New Zealand experts called for wider availability of naloxone.[185]\nIn May 2019, China regulated the entire class of fentanyl-type drugs and two fentanyl precursors. Nevertheless, it remains the principal origin of fentanyl in the United States: Mexican cartels source fentanyl precursors from Chinese suppliers such as Yuancheng Group, which are finished in Mexico and smuggled to the United States.[186][187][97] Following the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, China halted cooperation with the United States on combatting drug trafficking.[188] Bilateral talks on fentanyl later resumed in San Francisco in 2023 when then U.S. President Joe Biden and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping met. In the past several months before February 2025, China had also began scheduling fentanyl precursors that are internationally banned, aligning with efforts to restrict the flow of chemicals used in fentanyl production as well as the drug itself. These actions are intended to strengthen efforts to curb drug trafficking and disrupt the supply chain more effectively. In February 2025, US president Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, claiming the move as a way \"to pressure China into taking action on fentanyl\" but experts have expressed concern that these tariffs could reverse the progress made under the Biden administration and weaken the international cooperation necessary to combat global drug trafficking.[189][190][191]\nIndia has also emerged as a source of fentanyl and fentanyl precursors,[97] where Mexican cartels have already developed networks for the import of synthetic drugs. It is possible that fentanyl and precursor production may disperse to other countries, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Netherlands.[187]\nIn 2020, the Myanmar military and police confiscated 990 gallons of \"methyl fentanyl\" [sic], as well as precursors for the illicit synthesis of the drug. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Shan State of Myanmar has been identified as a major source for fentanyl derivatives. In 2021, the agency reported a further drop in opium poppy cultivation in Burma, as the region's synthetic drug market continues to expand and diversify.[192][193]\nIn 2023, a California police union director was charged with importing synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and tapentadol disguised as chocolate. U.S. law enforcement had been slow in their response to the fentanyl crisis, according to the Washington Post. The response by the federal government to the fentanyl crisis had also faltered, according to the press release. Overdose deaths by fentanyl and other illegally imported opioids were surging since 2019 and are presently a major cause of death in all U.S. states.[194][195]\nAccording to the national archives and the DEA, direct fentanyl shipments from China have stopped since 2022.[196][197] The majority of illicit fentanyl and analogues now entering the U.S. from Mexico are final products in form of \"tablets\" and adulterated heroin from previously synthesized fentanyl. From the sophistication of full fentanyl synthesis and acute toxicity in laboratory environments, 'clandestine' labs in Mexico relate to making an illicit dosage form from available fentanyl rather than the synthesis itself. Based on further research by investigators, fentanyl and analogues are likely synthesized in labs that have the appearance of a legal entity, or are diverted from pharmaceutical laboratories.[198][199][200]\nRecent investigations and convictions of members of the Sinaloa drug cartel by federal agencies made a clear connection between illegal arms trafficking from the U.S. to Mexico and the smuggling of fentanyl into the U.S. Mexico had repeatedly made official complaints since illegal guns are easily purchased for example in Arizona and as far north as Wisconsin and even Alaska, according to U.S. intelligence sources, and transported onto Mexican territory through a chain of American brokers and couriers often financed by those drug cartels that also engage in money laundering. Therefore, the lack of arms controls in the U.S. has directly contributed to the U.S. opioid overdose crisis.[201][202][203]\nThe opioid epidemic in the United States is largely fueled by drugs smuggled from Mexico; approximately 98% of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes from Mexico.[204] In January 2025, President Trump said that tariffs on Mexico were intended to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and force the country to secure its border with the U.S. against fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration.[205]\nBrand names\n[edit]Brand names include Sublimaze,[63] Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis,[206] Instanyl,[207] Abstral,[208] Lazanda[209] and others.[210]\nEconomics\n[edit]In the United States, the 800 mcg tablet was 6.75 times more expensive as of 2020 than the lozenge.[211][212] As of 2023, the average cost for an injectable fentanyl solution (50 mcg/mL) is around US$17 for a supply of 20 milliliters, depending on the pharmacy.[213] In a 2020 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology, a 100-microgram transdermal patch was valued from between AU$75 and AU$450 on illicit markets.[214] Furthermore, in another 2020 study, the average price per gram of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl on various cryptomarkets was US$1,470.40 for offerings of less than five grams; the average for offers over five grams was US$139.50. In addition, on DreamMarket furanfentanyl (Fu-F), the most common analog on said market, the average price per gram was US$243.10 for retail listings and US$26.50 per gram for wholesale listings.[215]\nStorage and disposal\n[edit]The fentanyl patch is one of a few medications that may be especially harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if misused by a child.[216][217] Experts have advised that any unused fentanyl patches be kept in a secure location out of children's sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.\nIn British Columbia, Canada, where there are environmental concerns about toilet flushing or garbage disposal, pharmacists recommend that unused patches be sealed in a child-proof container that is then returned to a pharmacy.[218] In the United States where patches cannot always be returned through a medication take-back program, flushing is recommended for fentanyl patches, because it is the fastest and surest way to remove them from the home to prevent ingestion by children, pets or others not intended to use them.[217][219]\nGovernmental usage\n[edit]In August 2018, Nebraska became the first American state to use fentanyl to execute a prisoner.[220][221][222] Carey Dean Moore, then one of the longest-serving death row inmates in the United States,[223] was executed at the Nebraska State Penitentiary. Moore received a lethal injection, administered as an intravenous series of four drugs that included fentanyl citrate, to inhibit breathing and render the subject unconscious. The other drugs included diazepam as a tranquilizer, cisatracurium besylate as a muscle relaxant, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.[224][225] The use of fentanyl in execution caused concern among death penalty experts because it was part of a previously untested drug cocktail.[220][222] The execution was also protested by anti-death penalty advocates at the prison during the execution and later at the Nebraska State Capitol.[224][225]\nRussian Spetsnaz security forces are suspected to have used a fentanyl analogue, or derivative (suspected to be carfentanil and remifentanil),[226] to rapidly incapacitate people in the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002. The siege was ended, but many hostages died from the gas after their health was severely taxed during the days long siege.[227][228] The Russian Health Minister later stated that the gas was based on fentanyl,[229] but the exact chemical agent has not been clearly identified.[230]\nVeterinary use\n[edit]Fentanyl is commonly used for analgesia and as a component of balanced sedation and general anesthesia in small animal patients.[231][232][233] Fentanyl's short-acting nature, wide safety profile, lower rate of adverse effect compared to other opioids, and high potency make it one of the most effective and common analgesics in veterinary medicine; fentanyl's ability to reduce the minimum alveolar concentration leads to it being commonly used in dogs that are elderly or have cardiovascular issues.[234][235][236] Due to fentanyl's short duration and quick onset it is commonly used as a constant rate infusion or as a transdermal patch, with the latter being able to last 3 to 4 days. Fentanyl can provide sedation for dogs. Fentanyl is less common and has more adverse effects in livestock and equine compared to cats and dogs.[235] In horses at analgesic doses tachycardia, restlessness, and excitement occur. Subcutaneous administration often causes pain due but a bicarbonate solution exists which does not cause pain when giving subcutaneously.[237]\nFentanyl is highly lipophilic, about 1000 times more than morphine. In dogs it has low protein binding of 15.6% and a half-life of 2–6 hours. In cats the half-life is 2.5 hours. Fentanyl has poor oral bio-availability due to it being metabolised by the liver. Transdermal and transmucosal formulations are common for out-patients, although the latter's efficacy is not well supported by evidence.[237]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Bonewit-West K, Hunt SA, Applegate E (2012).

In the United States in 2021, following a year-on-year trend of increase, there were more than 80,000 opioid overdose deaths. Most of those deaths, 70,000, were attributed to any pharmaceutical opioid with synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyls).

This study estimates potential costs, health benefits, and net savings of expanding access to MDMA-AT to eligible US patients with chronic and severe PTSD.\nMethods\nUsing a decision-analytic model, we compared the costs, deaths averted, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained of three, 10-year MDMA-AT coverage targets (25%, 50%, and 75%) compared to providing standard of care to the same number of eligible patients with chronic and severe PTSD. We used a payer perspective and discounted costs (in US$) and QALYs to 2020. We conducted one-way, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and calculated the net monetary value of MDMA-AT using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained.\nResults\nExpanding access to MDMA-AT to 25–75% of eligible patients is projected to avert 43,618–106,932 deaths and gain 3.3–8.2 million QALYs. All three treatment targets are dominant or cost-saving compared to standard of care. Our sensitivity analyses found that accounting for parameter uncertainty and changes in various assumptions did not alter the main finding—MDMA-AT is dominant compared to standard of care.\nConclusion\nExpanding access to MDMA-AT to patients with chronic and severe PTSD will provide substantial health and financial benefits. The precise magnitude is uncertain and will depend on the number of eligible patients and other inputs.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40261-022-01122-0.\nKey Points\n| MDMA-AT has been shown in Phase 3 clinical trials to substantially reduce PTSD symptoms compared to psychotherapy with placebo. |\n| Increasing access to MDMA-AT to 25–75% of eligible patients with chronic and severe PTSD over 10 years would avert between 43,000 and 106,000 deaths, produce 3.3–8.2 million discounted quality-adjusted life years, and lead to $109–$266 billions in discounted net savings for the healthcare system. |\n| Increased access to MDMA-AT can save lives and improve the health of patients with chronic and severe PTSD, while reducing healthcare costs. |\nIntroduction\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly debilitating psychiatric condition that adversely affects mood, cognition, physical and emotional health, and can lead to suicidal ideation and behavior [1–4]. In any given year, 3.5–4.7% of US adults or about 7.3–9.8 million individuals experience PTSD. Among military veterans, current prevalence of PTSD is as high as 13%, although some cohorts of combat veterans have reported PTSD prevalence as high as 20% [5–8]. PTSD is associated with healthcare costs and service utilization that are higher than those of other mental health conditions [9–15].\nWhile about half of people with PTSD achieve recovery or remission spontaneously or following standard of care (SoC) [16–18], the remainder suffer from chronic and severe forms of PTSD which require long-term treatment. Existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapies, sertraline and paroxetine, however, have limited effectiveness and unwanted side effects [19–21]. Recently, a new treatment for PTSD involving 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a currently illegal psychedelic agent, combined with psychotherapy was shown in a multi-site, Phase 3 randomized clinical trial to be significantly more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms than placebo with same course of psychotherapy in patients with severe or extreme PTSD. The trial also found that MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) did not increase suicidal ideation and other adverse events, even among those with comorbidities such as dissociation and depression [22]. With such promising results, the FDA could approve MDMA-AT for PTSD by 2023 [23].\nPrevious cost-effectiveness analyses have shown that MDMA-AT is dominant, which means that it generates more health benefits and has lower net costs than SoC, even under conservative assumptions regarding the benefits of treatment [24, 25]. In this study, we aim to estimate the costs, health benefits, and net savings of increased access to MDMA-AT among US adult patients with chronic and severe PTSD.\nMethods\nOverview\nFollowing the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and guidelines from the 2nd Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine [26, 27], we developed a decision-analytic model that simulates a closed cohort of about 3.5 million adult patients (i.e., excluding incident cases) with chronic and severe PTSD who are eligible for MDMA-AT based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the Phase 3 trial [22]. We used a payer perspective and discounted future costs and benefits using a 3% yearly rate over a 30-year time horizon in the base-case analysis. The model, which was programmed in Microsoft Excel® (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA), uses annual cycles.\nWe modeled three hypothetical MDMA-AT treatment targets: 25%, 50%, and 75% (Fig. 1). These targets were selected because they are within the Healthy People 2030 goal for the proportion of adults with serious mental illness who receive treatment [28]. From year to year, the proportion of treated patients with chronic and severe PTSD nearly doubles until each cumulative target is reached at the end of 10 years. Our approach in constructing these treatment targets is based on previous modeling studies on the costs and benefits of scaling up mental health treatment services [29, 30].\nData Sources\nData for the model (Table 1) were based on secondary sources. A full description of our estimation methods is presented in the Supplement.\nTable 1.\n| Base value (range) | Distribution in PSA | Source | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Distribution of patients with PTSD who receive MDMA-AT by severity | |||\n| Asymptomatic | 33.3 | NA | [24] |\n| Mild | 26.2 | NA | [24] |\n| Moderate | 26.2 | NA | [24] |\n| Severe | 11.9 | NA | [24] |\n| Extreme | 2.4 | NA | [24] |\n| Dead | 0 | NA | [24] |\n| Distribution of patients with PTSD who receive standard of care by severity | |||\n| Asymptomatic | 0 | NA | [24] |\n| Mild | 0 | NA | [24] |\n| Moderate | 0 | NA | [24] |\n| Severe | 71.4 | NA | [24] |\n| Extreme | 28.3 | NA | [24] |\n| Dead | 0 | NA | [24] |\n| Costs (in 2020 US$)b | |||\n| MDMA-AT (one-time) | 11,537 (8076–14,998) | Gamma | [55, 56]a |\n| Standard of care | 0 (0–13,256) | Gamma | [55, 56]a |\n| Medical care for asymptomatic PTSD | 5032 (3608–6456) | Gamma | [57–60]a |\n| Medical care for mild PTSD | 10,118 (7250–12,986) | Gamma | [57–60]a |\n| Medical care for moderate PTSD | 15,177 (10,855–19,469) | Gamma | [57–60]a |\n| Medical care for severe PTSD | 20,236 (14,512–25,960) | Gamma | [57–60]a |\n| Medical care for extreme PTSD | 24,283 (17,415–31,151) | Gamma | [57–60]a |\n| Health utilities | |||\n| Asymptomatic | 0.90 (0.81–0.99) | Beta | [24] |\n| Mild | 0.83 (0.75–0.91) | Beta | [24] |\n| Moderate | 0.74 (0.67–0.81) | Beta | [24] |\n| Severe | 0.61 (0.55–0.67) | Beta | [24] |\n| Extreme | 0.37 (0.33–0.41) | Beta | [24] |\n| Dead | 0 | NA | Assumed |\n| Other inputs and assumptions | |||\n| Cohort size (range) | 3,523,049 (2,110,743–4,735,640) | Normal | [16–18, 31–33]a |\n| Annual discount rate (%) | 3 (0.23–0.38) | Beta | Assumed |\n| Time horizon (years) | 30 (10–40) | Uniform | Assumed |\n| Mean age of cohort | 41 | NA | [22] |\n| Probability of death from all causes | 0.002 (0.0018–0.0022) | Beta | [61] |\nMDMA-AT 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine assisted-therapy, NA not applicable, PSA probabilistic sensitivity analysis, PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder\naBase-case value and range calculated by authors using the references listed\nbCosts are annual unless otherwise noted\nPatients Eligible for MDMA-AT\nWe estimated the number of adult patients with chronic and severe PTSD who are eligible for MDMA-AT (Fig. 2) using published sources (see Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM]). Citing national survey data, the National Institute for Mental Health states that the past-year prevalence of PTSD among US adults is 3.6% [31]. Since there are 250,563,000 people aged ≥ 18 years in 2019 [32], we estimated that the number of adults with PTSD is 9,020,268.\nPrevious studies estimate that the proportion of people with PTSD who experience a chronic and severe form is 50% (range 40–60%) [16–18]. Of this population, about 21.9% (range 12.5–41.5%) would be ineligible for MDMA-AT because of psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as any current substance use disorder, primary psychotic disorder, and bipolar disorder according to the inclusion criteria of the Phase 3 trial [33]. Thus, in the base-case analysis we assumed that the number of eligible patients is 3,523,049 (range: 2,110,743–4,735,640).\nTransition Probabilities\nWe based transition probabilities on the results of our previous modeling study [24]. We used a previously published state-transition model developed by two of the current authors that estimated the health and economic outcomes beyond the 8-week time horizon of the Phase 3 trial (Fig. 3) [24]. In addition to deceased, the health states in the model were asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme PTSD, which are based on patient scores on the most recent iteration of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.\nOur prior study produced “Markov traces,” or distributions of 1000 simulated patients across health states, for those who received MDMA-AT and SoC (Fig. S1–S2 and Tables S1–S2 in ESM). We used these traces to portray the proportion of simulated patients in each health state over time. For example, 71.4% of simulated patients who receive SoC start from the severe PTSD health state, while 28.6% begin from the extreme PTSD health state (Table 1). These patients progress to other health states based on the Markov trace for this population (Fig. S2 in ESM). Similarly, patients who receive MDMA-AT start from the asymptomatic (33.3%), mild (26.2%), moderate (28.6%), severe (9.5%), and extreme (2.4%) health states (Table 1), and their trajectories follow the Markov trace for this population (Fig. S1 in ESM). The costs of treating PTSD, health state utilities, and annual mortality vary according to the severity of PTSD; thus, the results are determined by the proportion of patients in each severity category over time.\nWe assume that patients with PTSD are treated with the same MDMA-AT protocol as in the Phase 3 trial [19, 22, 34], and that they experience the same level of efficacy modeled in the prior study in the base-case analysis. While the long-term efficacy of MDMA-AT is still unknown, limited research suggests that remission from severe PTSD symptoms among patients who receive MDMA-AT was maintained for a follow-up period averaging 3.5 years following treatment [35]. In scenario analysis, we reduce the efficacy of MDMA-AT to understand the effect of this assumption on our results.\nCosts\nWe included two main healthcare-related costs: the cost of MDMA-AT and the cost of medical care for patients with PTSD (Table 1). We briefly describe our methods for estimating these costs below, and full details are provided elsewhere [24]. All costs are in 2020 US$.\nThe one-time cost of MDMA-AT ($11,537, range: $8076–14,998; Table 1) was based on a previous micro-costing of the resources required to deliver MDMA-AT per protocol, including three 90-min preparatory psychotherapy sessions, three 8-h MDMA sessions, and nine 90-min integration sessions. All sessions are conducted with one patient and two clinicians.\nThe cost of medical care refers to all healthcare costs incurred by patients with PTSD in a year; these care costs are positively associated with PTSD severity according to previous research [36]. The costs of medical care for different PTSD severity levels were derived from estimates in the peer-reviewed literature (Table 1). In the base-case analysis, we assumed that the costs of SoC are included in medical care costs, although we varied this assumption in the sensitivity analyses.\nHealth Outcomes\nThe outcomes of interest in this study were deaths averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. QALYs combine length and quality of life and are the preferred health outcome in economic evaluations for health in developed countries [37]. QALYs in this study incorporate health utilities that were calculated using EQ-5D-5L scores of participants in the MDMA-AT Phase 3 trial (Table 1) [24]. Respondent scores on the EQ-5D-5L are converted to health utilities through a valuation method that uses preference weights specific to the USA [38].\nAnalysis\nIncremental Costs and Benefits\nFor each treatment target, we calculated the incremental costs and health benefits of MDMA-AT versus SoC over 30 years (note: the time horizon extends beyond the 10-year scale-up period). The ratio of incremental costs to incremental health benefits, or the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), is the net cost per unit of health outcome gained. The ICER is used to assess the cost effectiveness of an intervention by comparing it to a context-specific cost-effectiveness threshold. In this study, we used $100,000 per QALY gained as the threshold, which is commonly used in the USA [37]. In instances where the incremental costs were negative, we did not report negative ICERs, which are uninterpretable.\nSensitivity Analysis\nTo generate base-case results for each treatment target, we used the base value of each input parameter (see Table 1) in the model. Then, to test the effect of parameter uncertainty and various assumptions on our results, we conducted one-way, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).\nIn one-way sensitivity analysis, we varied each input parameter one at a time from their lowest to highest value (Table 1) to understand how extreme values affect the cost effectiveness of MDMA-AT. The results of one-way sensitivity analyses are presented in tornado diagrams that show how the net monetary value (NMV) of MDMA-AT changes as the value of an input changes. The NMV is a measure combining the costs and health benefits of an intervention into a single number and is calculated by multiplying the number of QALYs gained by a cost-effectiveness threshold (i.e., $100,000 per QALY gained), and then subtracting from the product the total costs of the intervention. An intervention is deemed efficient if its NMV is positive, which means that the benefits of the intervention outweigh its costs.\nIn scenario analyses, we varied the effectiveness of MDMA-AT and SoC. In one scenario, we assumed that SoC is more effective and is associated with some reduction in PTSD severity (Fig. S3 in ESM). In a second scenario, we assumed that MDMA-AT’s effectiveness declines over time, and that patients who receive MDMA-AT experience a 10% annual regression in their PTSD severity after five years of their treatment (Fig. S4 in ESM). In a third scenario, we combined these two assumptions.\nIn PSA, we varied selected inputs simultaneously over 10,000 independent Monte Carlo trials using distributions that were assigned a priori (Table 1 and Table S3 in ESM). We summarized the results of the PSA in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves that plot the average probability that SoC and MDMA-AT have the highest NMV across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds ($0–100,000 per QALY gained).\nResults\nBase-case\nBetween 780,000 and 1.41 million patients with PTSD receive MDMA-AT under the three treatment targets (Fig. S5 in ESM). Achieving the 50% target would avert an estimated 78,768 deaths and gain over 6 million discounted QALYs over 10 years (Table 2). Achieving the 25% target can save 43,618 lives and gain 3.3 million QALYs over 10 years. The 75% treatment target saves most lives (106,932) and gains the most QALYs (8.2 million) over 10 years.\nTable 2.\n| 25% target | 50% target | 75% target | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Standard of care | MDMA-AT | Standard of care | MDMA-AT | Standard of care | MDMA-AT | |\n| Deaths | 191,199 | 147,581 | 347,618 | 268,850 | 475,175 | 368,243 |\n| QALYs | 6,491,139 | 9,818,489 | 11,723,620 | 17,736,175 | 15,917,517 | 24,085,168 |\n| Costs (billions US$) | 256 | 147 | 462 | 266 | 628 | 361 |\n| Incremental deaths averted | 43,618 | 78,768 | 106,932 | |||\n| Incremental QALYs | 3,327,350 | 6,012,555 | 8,167,652 | |||\n| Incremental cost-savings (US$) | $109 billion | $196 billion | $266 billion |\nIncremental cost-effectiveness ratios were not calculated because MDMA-AT was lower in cost and produced more health benefits than standard of care for three MDMA-AT treatment targets. Costs are in billions US$\nMDMA-AT methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy, QALY quality-adjusted life year\nIn all three targets, the costs of expanding access to MDMA-AT to eligible patients is less than the costs of providing SoC to the same number of patients. As a result, all three treatment targets are dominant (i.e., cost-saving while producing health benefits).\nOne-way Sensitivity Analysis\nOne-way sensitivity analysis found that using the highest and lowest values of various inputs in our model did not change the main finding that MDMA-AT is dominant when compared to SoC (Tables S4–S6 in ESM).\nThe influence of various inputs on the NMV of MDMA-AT are shown in Fig. S6–S8 in the ESM for the 25%, 50%, and 75% treatment targets, respectively. The results show that across all three treatment targets, MDMA-AT has a positive NMV, even when the most extreme values of any input are used in the model, which means that the benefits of the intervention outweigh its costs. The most influential parameters for all three targets are the time horizon used (10–40 years) and the number of eligible patients with chronic and severe PTSD (2.11–4.74 million).\nScenario Analysis\nThe results of the scenario analyses are found in Table S7 in ESM. We found that reducing the effectiveness of MDMA-AT or increasing the effectiveness of SoC does not change the main finding that MDMA-AT is dominant in all three treatment targets.\nProbabilistic Sensitivity Analysis\nAcross 10,000 independent simulations, we found that MDMA-AT is dominant compared to SoC, and the average results (Table S8 in ESM) were similar to our base-case findings (Table 2). The results of the PSA are further summarized in cost-effectiveness planes (Fig. S9–S11 in ESM) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (Fig. S12–S14 in ESM). After accounting for multi-parameter uncertainty, MDMA-AT under any treatment target was found to be the optimal choice (i.e., provide greater NMV) 100% of the time across various cost-effectiveness thresholds.\nDiscussion\nThis study estimated the economic and public health benefits of MDMA-AT for treating chronic and severe PTSD. We found that expanding access to MDMA-AT to 25–75% of eligible patients over 10 years would avert between 43,618–106,932 deaths, produce 3.3–8.2 million discounted QALYs, and lead to $109–$266 billion in discounted savings for the healthcare system.\nThe findings from this study suggest that MDMA-AT is comparable to other widely used therapies in the USA. For example, the number of deaths averted by expanding access to MDMA-AT is higher than the estimated number of suicides prevented by the availability of fluoxetine for depression (33,600, credible interval 22,400–45,000) [39]. The number of QALYs gained through MDMA-AT is more than antiretroviral therapy during the first few years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (2.95 million) [40] or achieving national targets for HIV testing and treatment over 20 years (2.14 million) [41]. Finally, the costs savings we estimated in this study are comparable to the direct medical expenditures that can be averted by access to smoking cessation programs [42, 43].\nOur study builds on two economic evaluations of MDMA-AT that demonstrated the value of this intervention. Using pooled results from six Phase 2 trials [19], one study estimated that MDMA-AT for 1000 patients with PTSD can generate $103.2 million in net savings and 5553 QALYs over 30 years when compared to SoC [25]. Under the most conservative assumption that benefit ceases after 12 months, the ICER is $26,427 per QALY gained, significantly lower than the $100,000 per QALY gained threshold that is commonly used to evaluate the efficiency of health interventions in the USA [37]. A more recent study used data from the Phase 3 trial of MDMA-AT, which involved one additional MDMA session than in the Phase 2 trial, and found that providing 1000 patients with PTSD access to MDMA-AT would save the healthcare system approximate $132.9 million while averting 61.4 premature deaths and generating 4856 QALYs over 30 years [24].\nOur study also finds that MDMA-AT is cost-saving under a range of assumptions, although expanding access to MDMA-AT requires significant initial outlay. To realize the savings we estimated from this study, public and private payers, health systems, and government will have to invest in human resources to administer MDMA-AT. For example, the Phase 3 trial protocol involved 15 sessions with two trained therapists, which means that treating 25–75% of eligible patients with MDMA-AT (as we modeled in this study) will require training and certifying thousands of therapists.\nAs with any new therapy, other scientific, political, and legal factors will also shape the speed and scale in which MDMA-AT will be adopted [44]. Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), the Phase 3 trial sponsor, obtained an FDA “breakthrough therapy” designation for MDMA-AT in 2017, which promises to expedite development and review processes [45]. Although not required by the FDA, MAPS is currently enrolling subjects for an additional Phase 3 trial and expects to apply for full FDA approval for MDMA-AT by 2023 [23].\nFederal and state action is also needed to fully legalize the production and prescription of MDMA-AT. Congress or the Drug Enforcement Administration, for instance, may fully deschedule MDMA, as was done for cannabidiol in 2018, a non-psychoactive ingredient found in cannabis that is used to produce the FDA-approved seizure medication Epidolex®. Descheduling would exempt MDMA from controlled substance restrictions, enable the FDA to regulate it as an approved therapeutic, and provide access to federal research dollars [46, 47]. FDA approval and descheduling of MDMA is also a necessary condition for private and public payers to include MDMA-AT as a benefit; thus, without such approvals, the level of access explored in the current analysis would be impossible.\nAside from supply-side factors, demand-side determinants will have to be addressed to achieve the savings and health benefits we estimated. For example, our model assumes that there are no financial barriers to care, and all those who are eligible and wish to receive treatment can do so via sufficient insurance coverage or self-financing. Additionally, our study assumes high levels of care-seeking and treatment adherence among people with PTSD, which may not reflect reality given the stigma around severe mental illness and other cognitive, cultural, economic, and logistical barriers to PTSD care, which have been documented in the literature [48–50].\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, there is uncertainty around the true number of eligible patients with chronic and severe PTSD for MDMA-AT. Estimates of the number of people with PTSD are limited and challenging to calculate because PTSD cases, like many mental illnesses that are highly stigmatized, are often underreported. There are also no precise estimates of the proportion of PTSD cases that are chronic and severe, and, among these cases, no studies to our knowledge have estimated the prevalence of comorbidities that would make patients ineligible for MDMA-AT. For this study, we used the prevalence of any current alcohol and substance use disorder, which is the most common comorbidity in PTSD patients, to determine the proportion of cases that would be ineligible for MDMA-AT. However, we used data from the Veterans Administration, and the prevalence from that patient population may be different from that of the broader public. Additional research is needed to refine this input.\nSecond, we modeled a closed cohort of patients with chronic and severe PTSD, and we have likely underestimated the benefits of access to MDMA-AT over the time horizon of our study. Future studies should include incident (in addition to prevalent) cases of PTSD, although estimates of the incidence of PTSD are limited and often focus on specific groups of people that experience a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster or acute violent episodes [51–53]. Third, we used a healthcare payer perspective, and future analyses should use a societal perspective that include other sources of costs and benefits, such as patient time costs, travel costs, caregiver burden, and lost productivity and consumption [26].\nFourth, our model relies primarily on the inputs and findings of a previous cost-effectiveness analysis, which means that limitations from that study carry over to our current study. For example, Marseille et al assumed that patients with PTSD who receive SoC experience no improvements in their disease severity. This assumption is supported by evidence that chronic and severe PTSD is highly treatment-resistant, and that spontaneous remission in PTSD is limited to the first years following diagnosis [17, 22, 35, 54]. In addition, we assumed that the efficacy of MDMA-AT is durable, which is supported by limited research showing that patients who have received MDMA-AT maintain statistically and clinically significant improvements in their severe PTSD symptoms for years following treatment [35]; however, the true long-term efficacy of MDMA-AT remains unknown. We conducted scenario analyses to relax these assumptions, and future studies should further explore the effect of this assumption on the efficiency of MDMA-AT.\nFinally, the generalizability of our results is limited by the underlying Phase 3 trial which (1) only evaluated the short-term efficacy of MDMA-AT and (2) involved participants who do not necessarily represent the diversity of the US patients with chronic and severe PTSD.\nConclusion\nMDMA-AT has the potential to significantly improve PTSD care nationwide. Increased access to this therapy can save and extend lives of patients with chronic and severe PTSD, as well as reduce healthcare costs.\nSupplementary Information\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nDeclarations\nFunding\nNo funding was received to conduct this study.\nConflicts of interest\nAll authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\nEthics approval\nNot applicable.\nConsent to publish\nNot applicable.\nConsent to participate\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of data and materials\nData needed to replicate this study are found in the main text, cited references, and in the electronic supplementary material.\nCode availability\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nALVA validated, curated, analyzed, and interpreted the data, wrote the first draft of the manuscript, edited the manuscript, and is the guarantor of the study.

Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, and Florida have sold both ground-based and aerial consumer fireworks for consumers since the ’90s.\nHistory of Fireworks in Georgia and What Has Changed\nPrior to 2005, all types of fireworks were illegal in Georgia. In 2005, Georgia relaxed its prohibition on fireworks by allowing sparklers and small, non-explosive fireworks. These are typically fountains that “emit showers of sparks,” and small spinners.\nEarlier this year, Georgia House Bill 110 was passed allowing the regulation and sale of consumer fireworks (also known as 1.4G fireworks). It is still illegal for consumers to possess or sell large professional fireworks (also known as 1.3G or display fireworks). What determines the difference between classes of consumer and display fireworks? Primarily it’s the composition and weight of the products. Most heavily regulated are aerial shells which are typically launched from a firing tube. The maximum weight for consumer shells is 60 grams (about 2 ounces) and no larger than 44 millimeters (about 2 inches in diameter). The largest professional display fireworks in the world are just over 1200 millimeters wide – a whopping 4 feet in diameter!\nLawmakers who voted to approve the new law argued that the sale of consumer fireworks would bring much-needed tax revenue to Georgia, create jobs, and keep millions of dollars of revenue from flowing out of the state every year. The new sales tax on consumer fireworks is expected to raise an estimated $10 million each year a large portion of which will go to increasing Georgia’s emergency services budget.\nWhile legalizing consumer fireworks, it’s important to know that the recent change in Georgia’s law makes it illegal to release flying Chinese lanterns or any other type of device into the air that requires fire for propulsion or to release floating lanterns on any public waterway.\nThe changed law in Georgia also makes it illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to buy, use, possess, manufacture, transport, or store consumer fireworks.\n5 Important Things to Know about Georgia’s New Fireworks Law\n-\nGeorgians can now legally purchase fireworks including sparklers, Roman candles, bottle rockets, and shell/mortar aerial products. The weight/size limit on aerial shells is 60 grams and/or about 2” in diameter.\n-\nThe law stipulates that those “igniting” or lighting fireworks must be at least 18 years old. If you allow your child to ignite consumer fireworks, and they end up in urgent care of the emergency room due to injury, you may be arrested!\n-\nPreviously, consumers had to travel to bordering states for fireworks. Businesses are opening stores in metro Atlanta pending approval by state agencies.\n-\nConsumers purchasing fireworks in Georgia will pay an extra 5% at the register – in addition to regular state and local sales taxes.\n-\nYou probably do not live within 100 yards of a nuclear power plant or gasoline station! However, it’s important for you to know that if you do, never ignite fireworks near these facilities. The new law makes you liable assuming, of course, you survive the accident you caused!\nRecommendations for The Safe Use of Fireworks\nThese suggestions should be obvious. However, if you have never handled consumer fireworks, consider these tips! They are sure to keep you out of urgent care facilities or the emergency room.\n- Always read and follow the directions on the label.\n- Only adults at least 18 years of age can legally ignite fireworks. Keep your children at least 30 yards (about 100’) away from aerial fireworks. Always make sure aerial fireworks are in a flat and level area away from anything flammable.\n- Keep a water hose and a garbage can of water nearby, If a firework is deemed a “dud after not going off once ignited, do not stand near it to see what is wrong. Wait for 15-20 minutes then put the dud into a garbage can full of water.\n- If you plan to ignite aerial fireworks, keep a number of large heavy towels soaked in water very close surrounding your launch area. If an aerial is lit and then knocked on its side toward spectators, you should have time to get behind it and throw a wet towel over it. Never approach an aerial that has been lit that is facing you.\n- Always keep a water source very close by.\n- Never consume alcohol and ignite fireworks. Alcohol slows your reaction time if something goes wrong.\n- Never light fireworks in a drought situation. It’s a very good thing for the rain to fall a day or so before you plan to ignite fireworks. Always obey and follow local announcements if conditions are dry and fireworks are forbidden.\n- Light fireworks one at a time. Lighting multiple fireworks can knock over or ignite other fireworks injuring yourself or others. Professionals use very specialized equipment to keep multiple displays safe.\nWhen in doubt, let the professionals entertain you!\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        - Home\n- About\n- Resources\n- Membership\n- News/Meetings\n- About Fireworks\n- Safety\n- APA U\n- Fire Service\n- Advocacy\n- Conference\n|\nFor Immediate Release Media Contact: Julie L. Heckman, Executive Director Bethesda, MD, June 21, 2017 – Fireworks are among the most widely anticipated traditions of celebrating our nation’s independence. As the Fourth of July holiday quickly approaches, Americans in certain municipalities and states will have a greater variety of backyard fireworks as well as more places to purchase them due to a continuing national trend in relaxing the consumer fireworks laws.\nThe popularity of consumer fireworks continues to grow each year. According to the American Pyrotechnics Association (APA), “consumer fireworks retailers are reporting strong fireworks sales numbers as the busy selling season officially gets off to a start and we predict revenues could exceed $850 million for the 2017 fireworks season,” said Julie L. Heckman, Executive Director of the APA. In 2016, American consumers spent approximately $825 million on fireworks for the Fourth of July, a $70 million increase over fireworks sales in 2015.[1] Economic Benefits from Fireworks Sales States experience great economic benefits from the sale of fireworks. States with anti-fireworks laws lose tax revenues to neighboring states where the sale of fireworks is legal. Keeping fireworks illegal in certain states hampers job creation and hurts charitable organizations that use the sale of fireworks each year for fundraising. Since 2011, eight states — Kentucky, Utah, New Hampshire, Michigan, New York, Georgia, West Virginia and Iowa — have lifted restrictions on the sale of most types of consumer fireworks in order to reap the significant tax revenues. The tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue for states with fireworks bans has led many, including New York, West Virginia and Iowa to change their stance. Iowa, the most recent state to relax its fireworks law expects to generate approximately $1.5 million in sales tax revenue for the 2018 fiscal year. [2] Injuries Decline While Fireworks Consumption Soars “With the liberalization of consumer fireworks laws and record-breaking growth in backyard fireworks usage, the number of fireworks-related injuries and fires has dramatically declined,” says Heckman. The fireworks-related injury rate is 43% lower than it was in 2000, when the trend in relaxing consumer fireworks laws was first initiated. [3] Heckman urges, “While the number of fireworks-related injuries and fires has declined significantly, this is not the time for consumers to be lax about safety. Consumers should always keep safety top-of-mind when using backyard fireworks. When used appropriately and in accordance with common sense safety practices, fireworks are a safe, enjoyable and family-friendly entertainment experience.” Safety Tips The APA encourages consumers to take the time to plan Independence Day fireworks celebrations by selecting a safe location that is free of debris and has a flat, level surface. Make certain to read and follow all instructions for use and keep spectators at a safe distance.

The Association of Mature American Citizens, or AMAC, is based in Lady Lake, Florida.\nDaniel C. Weber is the founder of AMAC, and on his bio page, he describes himself as “A devoted advocate of free enterprise.” He refers to AMAC “as a way to unite citizens to defend our American way of life.” A quote from the FAQ page regarding the organization’s purpose is stated as “other major 50+ organizations were too liberal and did not represent his views. Rather than do nothing, Weber decided to begin his own organization. AMAC is a conservative, non-partisan organization representing those whose core beliefs are not represented by other major 50+ organizations.”\nYou can view the complete list of the board of directors here.\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\nFunded by / Ownership\nAMAC’s revenue, according to its FAQ page, is originally from its founder, Dan Weber, and the site indicates the rest is derived from membership fees and advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, AMAC is essentially a conservative version of AARP that boasts over 1 million members. The website indicates their conservative political positions, such as support for the 2nd Amendment, Small Government, Fiscal Responsibility, Religious Freedom, Pro-Life, Low Taxes, and Repeal Obamacare. Besides promoting their agenda, they also republish news with loaded emotional headlines such as this: Portland Is the New Berkeley: “Occupy ICE” and Antifa Mayhem and this: Will the FEC Please Stand Up — and Hold Hillary Clinton Accountable?\nRepublished articles tend to come from strongly right-leaning sources such as the New American and Inside Sources. AMAC also publishes original content that again utilizes loaded language such as this: Courts Say Protestors Can Disrespect The Flag, But You Don’t Need a Court Order To Salute The ‘Grand Old Flag,’ says AMAC. This article is properly sourced from credible information and media sources. This source does not align with the consensus on climate change when it comes to science. AMAC publishes strongly right-leaning conservative news and sometimes uses poor sources.\nFailed Fact Checks\n- AARP backed “federal funding for Planned Parenthood.” – False\n- “If you and I fail to defund ObamaCare now, some 16,000 new IRS agents will be begin prying into our private medical records, eyeing each and every one of our treatments and prescriptions for “violations’.” – Pants on Fire\n- The American Association of Retired People — help elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats in the 2018 congressional mid-term elections – False\nOverall, we rate AMAC Right Biased based on political positions and story selection that favors the conservative right. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sources and failed fact checks. (M.

It was the start of an eight-year conflict that resulted in the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. servicemembers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.\nThe war began March 19, 2003, with an overwhelming show of American military might, described by the unforgettable phrase “shock and awe.” Within weeks, the United States achieved the primary objective of Operation Iraqi Freedom, as the military operation was called, ousting the regime of dictator Saddam Hussein.\nYet the military campaign that began so auspiciously ended up deeply dividing Americans and alienating key U.S. allies. As Americans looked back on the war four years ago, 62% said it was not worth fighting. Majorities of military veterans, including those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, came to the same conclusion.\nThe bleak retrospective judgments on the war obscure the breadth of public support for U.S. military action at the start of the conflict and, perhaps more importantly, in the months leading up to it. Throughout 2002 and early 2003, President George W. Bush and his administration marshaled wide backing for the use of military force in Iraq among both the public and Congress.\nThe administration’s success in these efforts was the result of several factors, not least of which was the climate of public opinion at the time. Still reeling from the horrors of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Americans were extraordinarily accepting of the possible use of military force as part of what Bush called the “global war on terror.”\nBy early 2002, with U.S. troops already fighting in Afghanistan, large majorities of Americans favored the use of military force in Iraq to oust Hussein from power and to destroy terrorist groups in Somalia and Sudan. These attitudes represented “a strong endorsement of the prospective use of force compared with other military missions in the post-Cold War era,” Pew Research Center noted at the time.\nBush and senior members of his administration then spent more than a year outlining the dangers that they claimed Iraq posed to the United States and its allies. Two of the administration’s arguments proved especially powerful, given the public’s mood: first, that Hussein’s regime possessed “weapons of mass destruction” (WMD), a shorthand for nuclear, biological or chemical weapons; and second, that it supported terrorism and had close ties to terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, which had attacked the U.S. on 9/11.\nAs numerous investigations by independent and governmental commissions subsequently found, there was no factual basis for either of these assertions. Two decades later, debate continues about whether the administration was the victim of flawed intelligence, or whether Bush and his senior advisers deliberately misled the public about its WMD capabilities, in particular.\nIn the months leading up to the war, sizable majorities of Americans believed that Iraq either possessed WMD or was close to obtaining them, that Iraq was closely tied to terrorism – and even that Hussein himself had a role in the 9/11 attacks. Two decades after the war began, a review of Pew Research Center surveys on the war in Iraq shows that support for U.S. military action was built, at least in part, on a foundation of falsehoods.\nThe path to war: From the ‘axis of evil’ to a ‘mushroom cloud’\nIn his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began making the case for why the United States might need to use military force to remove Saddam Hussein from power. “Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror,” he said. “The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons, for over a decade.”\nIraq was one of three countries, along with Iran and North Korea, that constituted an “axis of evil,” according to Bush. But Iraq drew much more attention from the former president than did those countries. “This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world,” Bush said.\nEven before his speech, Americans were inclined to believe the worst about Hussein’s regime. In a survey conducted a few weeks prior to the State of the Union, 73% favored military action in Iraq to end Hussein’s rule; just 16% were opposed. More than half (56%) said the U.S. should take action against Iraq “even if it meant U.S. forces might suffer thousands of casualties.”\nBush delivered this address, among the most memorable of his presidency, just four months after the terrorist attacks in New York City and near Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Americans remained on edge: 62% said they were very or somewhat worried another terrorist attack was imminent.\nAt that point, more than a year before the United States went to war, Americans overwhelmingly embraced several possible rationales for military action: 83% said that if the U.S. learned that Iraq had aided the 9/11 terrorists, that would be a “very important reason” to use military force in Iraq; nearly as many said the same if it was shown that Iraq was developing WMD (77%) or harboring other terrorists (75%).\nOver the next several months, Bush and other senior officials claimed with varying degrees of certainty that there was evidence justifying the use of U.S. military force. In a speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in August 2002, former Vice President Dick Cheney was unequivocal in asserting: “Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.”\nOn other occasions, Bush and his advisers suggested that even if there was no definitive proof that Iraq possessed WMD, it was too risky not to act, given Hussein’s failure to abide by UN weapons resolutions. “The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he [Hussein] can acquire nuclear weapons,” said National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in a CNN interview. “But we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.”\nSuch warnings resonated strongly with Americans: Most believed that Hussein either already possessed WMD or was close to obtaining them. In October 2002, 65% of the public said Hussein was close to having nuclear weapons, while another 14% volunteered that he already possessed them. Just 11% said he was not close to developing such weapons.\nThat month, Congress overwhelmingly approved a resolution authorizing Bush to use the U.S. armed forces “as he determines to be necessary and appropriate” to defend the security of the United States and enforce UN resolutions on Iraq. (This month, more than 20 years after it passed, Congress is moving to repeal the resolution.)\nIn addition to alleging that Hussein possessed (or was on the verge of obtaining) unconventional weapons, administration officials also repeatedly linked his regime to terrorists and terrorism. For the most part, these allegations were vague and unspecified, but on occasion, senior officials – including the president himself – directly connected Iraq with al-Qaida, the terrorist group that attacked the United States on 9/11. “We know that Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network share a common enemy – the United States of America,” Bush said that October. “We know that Iraq and al-Qaida have had high-level contacts that go back a decade.”\nNeither Bush nor senior administration officials directly linked Iraq or its leader to the planning or execution of the 9/11 attacks. Yet a sizable majority of Americans believed that Hussein aided the terrorist attacks that took nearly 3,000 lives.\nThe same month that Congress approved the use of force resolution against Iraq, 66% of the public said that “Saddam Hussein helped the terrorists in the September 11th attacks”; just 21% said he was not involved in 9/11. In February 2003, a month before the war began, that belief was only somewhat less widespread; 57% thought Hussein had supported the 9/11 terrorists.\nIt is not entirely clear why so many Americans – including majorities in both parties – embraced this falsehood. But by connecting Hussein to terrorism and the group that attacked the United States, administration officials blurred the lines between Iraq and 9/11. “The notion was reinforced by these hints, the discussions that they had about possible links” with al-Qaida terrorists, the late Andrew Kohut, founding director of Pew Research Center, told The Washington Post after the war was underway in 2003.\nAs prospects for war grew, thousands took to the streets to protest\nIn the months leading up to the war, majorities of between 55% and 68% said they favored taking military action to end Hussein’s rule in Iraq. No more than about a third opposed military action.\nHowever, support for military action in Iraq was consistently less pronounced among a handful of demographic and partisan groups.\nThe Center’s final survey before the U.S. invasion, conducted in mid-February 2003, highlighted these differences: Women were about 10 percentage points less likely than men to support the use of military force against Iraq (61% vs. 71%).\nA sizable majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (83%) favored the use of military force to end Hussein’s rule. Democrats and Democratic leaners were less supportive; still, more Democrats favored (52%) than opposed (40%) military action.\nYet Democrats were divided in opinions about whether to go to war in Iraq, with liberal Democrats less likely than conservative and moderate Democrats to favor using military force.\nTo build greater backing for the use of force among U.S. allies – and assuage lingering public concerns about war – the administration dispatched one of its most popular figures, Secretary of State Colin Powell, to the UN Security Council. In a pivotal moment in the Iraq debate, Powell presented what he described as “facts and conclusions, based on solid intelligence” to show that Iraq had failed to comply with UN weapons resolutions. “Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-Sept. 11 world,” Powell said.\nPowell’s address had a significant impact on U.S. public opinion, even among those who were opposed to war. Roughly six-in-ten adults (61%) said Powell had explained clearly why the United States might use military force to end Hussein’s rule; that was greater than the share saying Bush had clearly explained the stakes in Iraq (52%). Powell was particularly persuasive among those who were opposed to using force in Iraq: 39% said he had clearly explained why the U.S. may need to take military action, about twice the share saying the same about Bush.\nIn a last-ditch effort to prevent war, millions of protestors took to the streets in numerous cities across the world and in the U.S. on Feb. 15. While the largest demonstrations were in London and Rome, several hundred thousand antiwar protesters crowded the streets of New York City, with some carrying signs saying “No Blood for Oil.”\nAmericans initially rallied behind the war; then support plummeted\nAfter the war began, administration officials were confident that the United States would quickly prevail. For a time, it appeared they would be right: U.S. and allied forces easily overwhelmed the Iraqi army.\nBy April 9, U.S. forces and Iraqi civilians brought down a statue of Saddam Hussein in a Baghdad square. And on May 1, Bush stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln – in front of a banner proclaiming “Mission Accomplished” – and declared that major combat operations had ended.\nYet the war continued for another eight years. Public support for the use of U.S. military force in Iraq, which rose to 74% during the month that Bush gave what became known as his “Mission Accomplished” speech, never again reached that level.\nAs U.S. forces faced a mounting Iraqi insurgency, a growing share of Americans – especially Democrats – expressed doubts about the war. The share of Americans saying the U.S. military effort in Iraq was going well, which surpassed 90% in the war’s early weeks, fell to about 60% in late summer 2003.\nThere had been partisan differences in attitudes related to Iraq since Bush began raising the prospect of war in 2002. But as the war continued, these differences intensified: In October 2003, a 56% majority of Democrats said that U.S. forces should be brought home from Iraq as soon as possible, a 12-point increase from just a month earlier. By contrast, fewer than half of independents (40%) and just 20% of Republicans favored withdrawing U.S. troops.\nSupport for U.S. military action declined further the next year as two incidents brought the horrors of war home to Americans. In March 2004, four American private security contractors were killed and their bodies desecrated in a spate of anti-American violence. Then, the first pictures emerged of abuse of prisoners by U.S. troops at Abu Ghraib, an Iraqi prison. In a survey that May, the share of Americans who said the use of military force was going at least “fairly well” fell below 50% for the first time.\nBush’s reelection as president in November underscored the extent to which the war in Iraq had divided the nation. Among the narrow majority of voters (51%) who then approved of the decision to go to war, 85% voted for Bush; among the smaller share (45%) who disapproved, 87% voted for his Democratic opponent, John Kerry, according to national exit polls.\nPublic support for the war declined further during Bush’s second term. By January 2007, with the situation on the ground deteriorating, Bush defied growing calls from Democrats to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq and instead announced that he was sending more troops to the country. What Bush called “a new way forward” in Iraq – which became more widely known as the troop surge, or surge – was a risky gambit to alter the trajectory of the war.\nThe new strategy, in which more than 20,000 additional U.S. forces were deployed to Iraq, was broadly unpopular with a public that had grown weary of war. By roughly two-to-one (61% to 31%), Americans opposed Bush’s plan to send additional forces to Iraq. Bush’s new strategy “triggered increased partisan polarization on the debate over what to do in Iraq,” the Center noted in its report on the January 2007 survey.\nStill, while the overall impact of the surge on Iraq was intensely debated, it was widely credited with helping to reduce the level of violence in the country, both among U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians. While Americans acknowledged the improvement in the situation in Iraq, they remained deeply skeptical of the decision to go to war.\nIn November 2007, nearly half of Americans (48%) said the war was going very or fairly well, an 18 percentage point increase from February of that year. Yet support for withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq was undiminished; by 54% to 41%, more Americans favored bringing troops home from Iraq as soon as possible rather than keeping troops there until the situation had stabilized. Those attitudes were virtually unchanged from earlier in 2007.\nWith the 2008 presidential campaign approaching – and roughly 100,000 U.S. troops still in Iraq – it seemed likely that the war would again be a major issue. During the Democratic primaries, Barack Obama repeatedly contrasted his early opposition to the war with Hillary Clinton’s 2002 Senate vote in support of the war authorization.\nHowever, after Obama defeated Clinton for the Democratic nomination and faced John McCain in the general election, the Iraq War was increasingly overshadowed by turmoil in financial markets, which triggered a worldwide economic crisis. In national exit polls conducted after Obama’s victory over McCain, 63% of voters cited the economy as the most important issue facing the country; just 10% mentioned the war in Iraq.\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Obama vowed to end the war in Iraq, adding that the United States “would be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in.” Three years later, the U.S. withdrew all but a handful of its troops; in a ceremony on Dec. 15, 2011, the United States lowered the flag of command that had flown over Baghdad. President Obama’s decision drew overwhelming public support. A month before the ceremony, 75% of Americans – including nearly half of Republicans – approved of his decision to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq.\nYet Obama soon discovered how difficult it would be for the U.S. to fully disengage from Iraq. In 2014, a new security threat emerged in Iraq – the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. With ISIS taking over territory in Iraq and committing high-profile terrorist acts, the group quickly became one of the U.S. public’s top security threats. In response, Obama reluctantly authorized U.S. airstrikes and dispatched a small number of U.S. forces back to Iraq. Five years later, his successor, then-President Donald Trump, claimed that the group was on the verge of defeat in Iraq and Syria, although some U.S. security officials say it remains a threat.\nJudgments on the Iraq War and its impact on Bush’s legacy\nThe Iraq War has a long and complicated legacy. After the war officially ended, it remained an issue, to varying degrees, in both the 2012 and 2016 presidential election campaigns. Even in the 2020 campaign, nearly a decade after the war’s end, Trump and Joe Biden each portrayed themselves as better able to extricate the nation from what have been called “endless wars” – the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBy that point, most Americans had largely moved on from the war. Shortly before the United States withdrew its forces in 2011, a majority of Americans (56%) had concluded that, despite the war’s enormous costs, the U.S. had “mostly succeeded” in achieving its goals in Iraq.\nBut over the next few years, that belief faded. By 2018, the 15th anniversary of the start of the war, just 39% of Americans said the U.S. had succeeded in Iraq, while 53% said it had failed to achieve its goals.\nEven among Republicans, who had consistently favored the use of U.S. military force throughout the war and before it began, there were divisions over whether the U.S. had achieved its goals in Iraq. Only about half (48%) of Republicans and Republican leaners said the U.S. had succeeded, although that was 10 points higher than four years earlier.\nThe Iraq War will long be associated with the presidency of George W. Bush, its primary architect and one of its strongest advocates. When Bush looked back at the war in his 2010 memoir, “Decision Points,” he acknowledged that mistakes had been made. Among them, he said in an interview with NBC News, was his 2003 “Mission Accomplished” speech. “No question it was a mistake,” Bush said.\nAs far as the failure to find WMD in Iraq, “no one was more shocked and angry than I was when we didn’t find the weapons,” Bush said. Still, he was insistent that going to war in Iraq and removing Hussein from power was the right thing to do.\nThe war’s impact on Americans’ views of Bush’s presidency was underscored in a December 2008 survey, conducted shortly before he left office. Asked what Bush would be most remembered for, roughly half (51%) cited wars, with 29% specifically mentioning the war in Iraq. No other issue, not even Bush’s leadership following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was mentioned as frequently.\nLead image, from left: President George W.

MCCAIN AND OBAMA PARTICIPATE IN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK\nSPEAKERS:\nU.S. SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (AZ)\nREPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\nU. S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\nBOB SCHIEFFER, MODERATOR\n[*] SCHIEFFER: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Bob Schieffer of CBS News.\nThe rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.\nI will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we’ll have a discussion.\nI’ll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.\nThe audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.\n(APPLAUSE)\nGentlemen, welcome.\nBy now, we’ve heard all the talking points, so let’s try to tell the people tonight some things that they — they haven’t heard. Let’s get to it.\nAnother very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.\nSenator McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.\nSenator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.\nI will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?\nSenator McCain, you go first.\nMCCAIN: Well, let — let me say, Bob, thank you.\nAnd thanks to Hofstra.\nAnd, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.\nIt’s good to see you again, Senator Obama.\nAmericans are hurting right now, and they’re angry. They’re hurting, and they’re angry. They’re innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they’re angry, and they have every reason to be angry.\nAnd they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won’t repeat.\nBut we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.\nLet me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.\nThe catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.\nI am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.\nNow, we have allocated $750 billion. Let’s take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.\nNow, I know the criticism of this.\nMCCAIN: Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn’t help that person in their home if the next door neighbor’s house is abandoned. And so we’ve got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Senator Obama?\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it’s wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.\nI think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they’re putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.\nAnd I think that it’s going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven’t yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I’ve proposed four specific things that I think can help.\nNumber one, let’s focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that’s creating a job right here in America.\nNumber two, let’s help families right away by providing them a tax cut — a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let’s allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they’re experiencing a crisis.\nNow Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we’ve got to help homeowners. That’s why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.\nI disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we’re buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don’t want to waste taxpayer money. And we’ve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.\nLast point I want to make, though. We’ve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We’ve got to fix our energy policy that’s giving our wealth away. We’ve got to fix our health care system and we’ve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Would you like to ask him a question?\nMCCAIN: No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who’s a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.\nJoe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.\nYou were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.\nNow Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I’ll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able — and I’ll keep your taxes low and I’ll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.\nAnd I will not have — I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. That’s 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.\nSCHIEFFER: Is that what you want to do?\nMCCAIN: That’s what Joe believes.\nOBAMA: He has been watching ads of Senator McCain’s. Let me tell you what I’m actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.\nNow, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.\nWhat I’ve said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more — if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.\nOBAMA: Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, “Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.”\nAnd what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn’t yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices.\nThe last point I’ll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.\nMCCAIN: You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber — we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, we’re going to take Joe’s money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.\nI want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.\nThe whole premise behind Senator Obama’s plans are class warfare, let’s spread the wealth around. I want small businesses — and by the way, the small businesses that we’re talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.\nWho — why would you want to increase anybody’s taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.\nI’m not going to…\nOBAMA: OK. Can I…\nMCCAIN: We’re not going to do that in my administration.\nOBAMA: If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order…\nMCCAIN: We’re talking about Joe the plumber. OBAMA: … in order to give — in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.\nThen Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there — they’re trying to figure out how they’re going to afford food, how they’re going to save for their kids’ college education, they need a break.\nSo, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, we’ve got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody’s got to do it.\nMCCAIN: Nobody likes taxes. Let’s not raise anybody’s taxes. OK?\nOBAMA: Well, I don’t mind paying a little more.\nMCCAIN: The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. Ireland, it’s 11 percent.\nWhere are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?\nWe need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business.\nNow, of all times in America, we need to cut people’s taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let’s go to another topic. It’s related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.\nThis question goes to you first, Senator Obama.\nWe found out yesterday that this year’s deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. Some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year.\nBoth of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit.\nAren’t you both ignoring reality? Won’t some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?\nGive us some specifics on what you’re going to cut back.\nSenator Obama?\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it’s important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it’s structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it’s structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that’s important to understand.\nBut there is no doubt that we’ve been living beyond our means and we’re going to have to make some adjustments.\nNow, what I’ve done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. I haven’t made a promise about…\nSCHIEFFER: But you’re going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.\nOBAMA: Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I’ve proposed, I’ve proposed an additional cut so that it matches.\nOBAMA: And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn’t — under the Medicare plan — it doesn’t help seniors get any better. It’s not improving our health care system. It’s just a giveaway.\nWe need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don’t work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don’t work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better.\nNow, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier.\nIf we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.\nIf we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we’re borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.\nIf we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.\nBut what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we’re not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.\nAnd we’re going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.\nSCHIEFFER: Time’s up.\nSenator?\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.\nAnd they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money. And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.\nSo, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.\nSCHIEFFER: But what…\nMCCAIN: But — OK. All right.\nSCHIEFFER: The question was, what are you going to cut?\nMCCAIN: Energy — well, first — second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don’t like us very much. It’s wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.\nAnd the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs — millions of jobs in America.\nOK, what — what would I cut? I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK? Some people say that’s a hatchet. That’s a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?\nBecause we’ve got — we have presided over the largest increase — we’ve got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.\nGovernment spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we’re giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.\nI know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.\nSCHIEFFER: Which ones?\nMCCAIN: I have fought against — well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.\nI oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.\nI would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.\nI know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.\nBut I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects…\nSCHIEFFER: Time’s up.\nMCCAIN: … including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. That’s not the way we cut — we’ll cut out all the pork.\nSCHIEFFER: Time’s up.\nOBAMA: Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It’s proposed periodically. It doesn’t happen.\nAnd, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don’t work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.\nNow, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. That’s one of the centerpieces of his campaign.\nEarmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There’s no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it’s not going to solve the problem.\nNow, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we’re doing going forward.\nWhen President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years.\nOBAMA: And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.\nSo one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush’s budgets.\nWe’ve got to take this in a new direction, that’s what I propose as president.\nSCHIEFFER: Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? You have said previously you thought you could, Senator McCain.\nMCCAIN: Sure I do. And let me tell you…\nSCHIEFFER: You can still do that?\nMCCAIN: Yes. Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I’m going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.\nSenator Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. It’s completely out of control.\nThe mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City. They’re doing it all over America because they have to. Because they have to balance their budgets. I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will…\nSCHIEFFER: In four years?\nMCCAIN: … reduce this — I can — we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.\nNow, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they’re angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.\nSenator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed. He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, let’s look at our records, Senator Obama. Let’s look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.\nI have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.\nSCHIEFFER: Barack.\nOBAMA: Well, there’s a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn’t very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support…\nMCCAIN: An overwhelming vote.\nOBAMA: I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. Doesn’t make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. Doesn’t make me popular with environmentalists. So I’ve got a history of reaching across the aisle.\nNow with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.\nEven FOX News disputes it, and that doesn’t happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush’s policies, it’s because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.\nNow, you’ve shown independence — commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you’re proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it hasn’t worked.\nAnd I think the American people understand it hasn’t worked. We need to move in a new direction.\nSCHIEFFER: All right…\nMCCAIN: Let me just say, Bob.\nSCHIEFFER: OK. About 30 seconds.\nMCCAIN: OK. But it’s very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration. I have disagreed with leaders of my own party. I’ve got the scars to prove it.\nWhether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time. Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient’s bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.\nI have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nMCCAIN: Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn’t very convincing.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. We’re going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator Obama, your campaign has used words like “erratic,” “out of touch,” “lie,” “angry,” “losing his bearings” to describe Senator McCain.\nSenator McCain, your commercials have included words like “disrespectful,” “dangerous,” “dishonorable,” “he lied.” Your running mate said he “palled around with terrorists.”\nAre each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other’s face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?\nAnd, Senator McCain, you’re first.\nMCCAIN: Well, this has been a tough campaign. It’s been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked — responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.\nWhen Senator Obama was first asked, he said, “Any place, any time,” the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.\nAnd the fact is, it’s gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.\nOne of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect — I’ve written about him — Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful.\nAnd, Senator Obama, you didn’t repudiate those remarks. Every time there’s been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.\nSo I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And it’s a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it. And, Senator Obama, when he said — and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did — that was back when he was a long-shot candidate — you didn’t keep your word.\nAnd when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, “I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,” you didn’t tell the American people the truth because you didn’t.\nAnd that’s — that’s — that’s an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama’s campaign than any time since Watergate.\nSCHIEFFER: Time’s up. All right.\nOBAMA: Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people — Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.\nAnd 100 percent, John, of your ads — 100 percent of them have been negative.\nMCCAIN: It’s not true.\nOBAMA: It absolutely is true. And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.\nAnd there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we’re having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. That’s the stuff that campaigns should be made of.\nThe notion, though, that because we’re not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don’t mind being attacked for the next three weeks.\nWhat the American people can’t afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what’s most pressing to them: the economic crisis.\nSenator McCain’s own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.\nAnd I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college. And that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.\nMCCAIN: Well, if you’ll turn on the television, as I — I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.\nOBAMA: Congratulations.\nMCCAIN: Every other ad — ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said it’s not true. You’re running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I don’t.\nYou’re running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented — unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.\nAnd of course, I’ve been talking about the economy. Of course, I’ve talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I’m not going to spread his wealth around. I’m going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, we’re talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.\nThat’s what my campaign is all about and that’s what it’ll continue to be all about.\nBut again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman…\nOBAMA: I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign’s awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like “terrorist” and “kill him,” and that you’re running mate didn’t mention, didn’t stop, didn’t say “Hold on a second, that’s kind of out of line.”\nAnd I think Congressman Lewis’ point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.\nNow…\nMCCAIN: You’ve got to read what he said…\n(CROSSTALK)\nOBAMA: Let — let — let… MCCAIN: You’ve got to read what he said.\nOBAMA: Let me — let me complete…\nSCHIEFFER: Go ahead.\nOBAMA: … my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don’t think that comparison is appropriate.\nAnd, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.\nThe important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that’s what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.\nMCCAIN: I cannot…\nOBAMA: We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we…\nMCCAIN: We do and I hope…\nOBAMA: … talking about it this evening.\nMCCAIN: Sure.\nOBAMA: But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we’re not talking about issues. What we’re talking about…\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just say I would…\nSCHIEFFER: (inaudible)\nMCCAIN: Let me just say categorically I’m proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you’re going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I’ve — and we’ve always said that that’s not appropriate.\nBut to somehow say that group of young women who said “Military wives for McCain” are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything — and those veterans that wear those hats that say “World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,” I’m not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they’re great citizens.\nAnd I’m not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally — there’s a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I’m not happy about either.\nIn fact, some T-shirts that are very…\nOBAMA: John, I…\nMCCAIN: … unacceptable. So the point is — the point is that I have repudiated every time someone’s been out of line, whether they’ve been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.\nBut the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. I haven’t.\nOBAMA: Well, look, Bob, as I said…\nSCHIEFFER: I mean, do you take issue with that?\nOBAMA: You know, here’s what I would say. I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other’s campaigns. I suspect we won’t agree here tonight.\nWhat I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we’re facing, if we’re going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can — if we’re going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we’re going to have to be able to work together.\nOBAMA: And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable. And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues. What we can’t do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people. And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long. And I think…\nMCCAIN: Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.\nSCHIEFFER: Short answer, yes, short answer.\nMCCAIN: Yes, real quick. Mr. Ayers, I don’t care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.\nWe need to know the full extent of Senator Obama’s relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for “lighting and site selection.” So all of these things need to be examined, of course.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. I’m going to let you respond and we’ll extend this for a moment.\nOBAMA: Bob, I think it’s going to be important to just — I’ll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.\nIn fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain’s campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let’s get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.\nForty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan’s former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.\nOther members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.\nMr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that’s Mr. Ayers.\nNow, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they’ve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn’t really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.\nIt had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I’ve had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.\nNow, the reason I think that it’s important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.\nLet me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If I’m interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.\nThose are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.\nMCCAIN: Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN. So — and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers’ living room.\nOBAMA: That’s absolutely not true.\nMCCAIN: And the facts are facts and records are records.\nOBAMA: And that’s not the facts.\nMCCAIN: And it’s not the fact — it’s not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. It’s the fact that all the — all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama’s relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.\nAnd my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America. And that’s what my campaign is about and I’m not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. And that’s really what this campaign is going to be about.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let’s go to the next topic and you — we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. I want to ask both of you about the people that you’re going to bring into the government. And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.\nSCHIEFFER: So I’ll begin by asking both of you this question, and I’ll ask you to answer first, Senator Obama. Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?\nOBAMA: Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. It’s not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.\nBut it’s also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it’s like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.\nAnd, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. That’s what he’s done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.\nThat’s what he’s done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women’s Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.\nBecause after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we’re going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we’re investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.\nSo, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden’s always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\nMCCAIN: Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin. They know that she’s a role model to women and other — and reformers all over America. She’s a reformer. She is — she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, “This can’t go on.”\nShe’s given money back to the taxpayers. She’s cut the size of government. She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that’s going to relieve the energy needs of the United — of what they call the lower 48.\nShe’s a reformer through and through. And it’s time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) — breath of fresh air coming into our nation’s capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that’s been so much a part of it that I’ve fought against for all these years.\nShe’ll be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that we’ve got to find out what’s causing it, and we’ve got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.\nShe understands that better than almost any American that I know. I’m proud of her.\nAnd she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process. And I can’t tell how proud I am of her and her family.\nHer husband’s a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think she’s qualified to be president?\nOBAMA: You know, I think it’s — that’s going to be up to the American people. I think that, obviously, she’s a capable politician who has, I think, excited the — a base in the Republican Party.\nAnd I think it’s very commendable the work she’s done on behalf of special needs. I agree with that, John.\nI do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we’re going to get serious in terms of research. That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.\nAnd if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we’re not going to be able to do it. That’s an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we’re funding some of those programs.\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think Senator Biden is qualified?\nMCCAIN: I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. But I do point out that he’s been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.\nHe voted against the first Gulf War. He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would’ve threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.\nIn Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. We’re seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we’re seeing them. We’re now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.\nThere are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he’s been wrong on a number of the major ones.\nBut again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, “We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that’s the answer” — why do we always have to spend more?\nWhy can’t we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? Maybe that’s why he’s asked for 860 — sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people’s taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.\nSCHIEFFER: Let’s go to — let’s go to a new topic. We’re running a little behind.\nLet’s talk about energy and climate control. Every president since Nixon has said what both of you…\nMCCAIN: Climate change.\nSCHIEFFER: Climate change, yes — has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\nWhen Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil. Now, we’re importing more than 60 percent.\nWould each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?\nAnd I believe the first question goes to you, Senator McCain. MCCAIN: I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine.\nBy the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, “Yes, and we’ll sell our oil to China.”\nYou don’t tell countries you’re going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.\nWe can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess.\nSenator Obama will tell you, in the — as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.\nLook, we’ve sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.\nSo the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that’s hurting rather badly.\nSo I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don’t achieve our independence.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?\nOBAMA: I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think that’s about a realistic timeframe.\nAnd this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we’ve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It’s mortgaging our children’s future.\nNow, from the start of this campaign, I’ve identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.\nNumber one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they’re not drilling, use them or lose them.\nAnd I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world’s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil, which means that we can’t drill our way out of the problem.\nThat’s why I’ve focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that’s built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.\nWe invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.\nOBAMA: Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn’t have — did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.\nAnd what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.\nAnd when it comes to South Korea, we’ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That’s all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We’ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\nMCCAIN: Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama’s eloquence. And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. We’ve got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. It’s doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now.\nNow, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need — we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.\nBut let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is — there’s a billion dollars that we — our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.\nBecause of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that’s helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that’s killing young Americans.\nAnd also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay — without us having to pay the billions of dollars — the billion dollars and more that we’ve already paid.\nFree trade with Colombia is something that’s a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.\nOBAMA: Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.\nAnd what I have said, because the free trade — the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn’t being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.\nBut I think that the important point is we’ve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.\nAnd the last point I’ll make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can’t get car loans.\nThat’s why I think it’s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.\nAnd Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It’s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.\nIf we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just said that that this is — he — Senator Obama doesn’t want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to — with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.\nFree trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.\nSo I don’t — I don’t think there’s any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.\nWe’re not going to follow that path while I’m — when I’m president of the United States.\nSCHIEFFER: All right, let’s go to a new topic, health care. Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? The question is first to Senator Obama.\nOBAMA: We’ve got to do both, and that’s exactly what my plan does.\nLook, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance.\nAnd they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they’re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.\nSo here’s what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don’t have to do anything. If you’ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.\nThe only thing we’re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family’s premium by about $2,500 per year. If you don’t have health insurance, then what we’re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.\nWe’re going to make sure that insurance companies can’t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We’ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.\nWe are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.\nAnd we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We’ve got to put more money into preventive care.\nThis will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it’s also how we’re going to save the federal budget, because we can’t afford these escalating costs.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nSenator McCain?\nMCCAIN: Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. They’re seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.\nAnd it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.\nWe need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will — that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics.\nThe rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know what’s going on there.\nWe — we need to have — we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.\nBut I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.\nNow, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Senator Obama’s plan, if you’re a small business and you are able — and your — the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you’re out there, my friend, and you’ve got employees, and you’ve got kids, if you don’t get — adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he’s going to fine you.\nMCCAIN: Now, Senator Obama, I’d like — still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don’t think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America’s economy.\nSenator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through — as he said, his object is a single payer system.\nIf you like that, you’ll love Canada and England. So the point is…\nSCHIEFFER: So that’s your objective?\nOBAMA: It is not and I just described it…\nMCCAIN: No, you stated it.\nOBAMA: I just…\nMCCAIN: Excuse me.\nOBAMA: I just described what my plan is. And I’m happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you’re out there. Here’s your fine — zero. You won’t pay a fine, because…\nMCCAIN: Zero?\nOBAMA: Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I’ll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.\nI exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we’ve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.\nRight now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they’re going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.\nThe average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.\nSo here’s what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we’ll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.\nIf you don’t have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.\nNow, what we haven’t talked about is Senator McCain’s plan. He says he’s going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance.\nHere’s the problem — that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.\nOlder folks, less healthy folks, what’s going to end up happening is that you’re going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won’t be able to afford it.\nAnd once you’re out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.\nAnd this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people’s health care benefits.\nBy the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you’ve got $5,000 and it’s going to cost you $12,000, that’s a loss for you.\nLast point about Senator McCain’s plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain’s plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.\nThat, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.\nSCHIEFFER: What about that?\nMCCAIN: Hey, Joe, you’re rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he’s been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but — in other words, take Joe’s money and then you decide what to do with it.\nNow, Joe, you’re rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you’ll have to pay a fine if you don’t provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.\nThat’s big government at its best. Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.\nAnd the good thing about this is they’ll be able to go across America. The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800. I’m going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.\nThis will give them availability. This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.\nThis really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator — government wants — Senator Obama wants government to do the job.\nSenator Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job.\nMCCAIN: I want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. That’s what I’m all about. And we’ve got too much government and too much spending and the government is — the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.\nWe can’t afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, they’ve been in charge the last two years.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. A short response.\nOBAMA: Very briefly. You all just heard my plan. If you’ve got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. Now, under Senator McCain’s plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.\nThat’s the choice you’ll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. And don’t take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn’t support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\nAll I want to do, if you’ve already got health care, is lower your costs. That includes you, Joe.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let’s stop there and go to another question. And this one goes to Senator McCain. Senator McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Senator Obama, you believe it shouldn’t.\nCould either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue? Senator McCain?\nMCCAIN: I would never and have never in all the years I’ve been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. That’s not appropriate to do.\nSCHIEFFER: But you don’t want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?\nMCCAIN: I thought it was a bad decision. I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. I’m a federalist. And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test. Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up. Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.\nWe got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats. You were offered a chance to join. You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, “conservative judges.”\nI voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. This is a very important issue we’re talking about.\nSenator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn’t meet his ideological standards. That’s not the way we should judge these nominees. Elections have consequences. They should be judged on their qualifications. And so that’s what I will do.\nI will find the best people in the world — in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution. And not legislating from the bench.\nSCHIEFFER: But even if it was someone — even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?\nMCCAIN: I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nOBAMA: Well, I think it’s true that we shouldn’t apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\nAnd it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\nNow I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\nBut what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn’t be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\nOBAMA: So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\nI’ll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\nFor years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it’s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn’t know about it until fairly recently.\nWe tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\nI think that it’s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that’s the kind of judge that I want.\nSCHIEFFER: Time’s up.\nMCCAIN: Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyer’s dream.\nLet me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it’s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who’s facing this terribly difficult decision.\nSenator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\nAnd then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.\nThen there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really — one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\nI don’t know how you vote “present” on some of that. I don’t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that’s his record, and that’s a matter of his record.\nAnd he’ll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\nSCHIEFFER: Response?\nOBAMA: Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that’s because it’s not true. The — here are the facts.\nThere was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\nAnd the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\nWith respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there’s an exception for the mother’s health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\nAnd I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that’s why I voted present, because I’m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\nThe last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that — look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to — to reconcile the two views.\nBut there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, “We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.”\nThose are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that’s where we can find some common ground, because nobody’s pro-abortion. I think it’s always a tragic situation.\nOBAMA: We should try to reduce these circumstances.\nSCHIEFFER: Let’s give Senator McCain a short response…\nMCCAIN: Just again…\nSCHIEFFER: … and then…\nMCCAIN: Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. He’s health for the mother. You know, that’s been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\nThat’s the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, “health.” But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. We’ll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.\nBut that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. Of course, we have to come together. Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it’s vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we’ll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we’ll help take care of it.\nSCHIEFFER: Let’s stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I’m afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.\nThe question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.\nThe implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.\nDo you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?\nThe question to Senator Obama first.\nOBAMA: This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there’s never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power. So we’ve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what’s happened is that there’s been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.\nIn some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.\nI think it’s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.\nAnd I think it’s important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they’re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it’s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they’re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.\nAnd that’s why I’ve proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it’s military service, whether it’s Peace Corps, whether it’s working in a community.\nIf we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.\nBut there’s one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that’s parents. We can’t do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They’ve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator McCain?\nMCCAIN: Well, it’s the civil rights issue of the 21st century. There’s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.\nBut what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?\nSo choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that’s already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.\nAnd we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school — their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools aren’t the only answer, but they’re providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools — types of schools.\nNow, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.\nSo I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.\nMCCAIN: We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which — or have the certification that some are required in some states.\nLook, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money?\nOBAMA: Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that’s a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.\nNow we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.\nSo what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.\nCharter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it’s important to foster competition inside the public schools.\nAnd we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly — after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can’t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.\nWhere we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers — give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain’s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.\nRecently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn’t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can’t give money to every interest group that comes along.\nI don’t think America’s youth are interest groups, I think they’re our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can’t say we’re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we’re going to pay for it.\nAnd if we’re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It’s not going to happen on its own.\nSCHIEFFER: What about that, Senator?\nMCCAIN: Well, sure. I’m sure you’re aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there’s a certain number, I think it’s a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.\nBecause they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.\nAnd we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was vouchers, Senator Obama. And I’m frankly surprised you didn’t pay more attention to that example.\nNow as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it.\nBut, again, spending more money isn’t always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, it’s not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren’t any better off than the others.\nLet’s reform it. Let’s reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. It’s a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.\nAnd I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children — precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we’ll find and we’ll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we’ll care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.\nMCCAIN: But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.\nAnd I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But I’m not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And I’ve got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And it’s been proven.\nOBAMA: I’ll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Senator McCain’s absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. And we’ve got a wonderful new superintendent there who’s working very hard with the young mayor there to try…\nMCCAIN: Who supports vouchers.\nOBAMA: … who initiated — actually, supports charters.\nMCCAIN: She supports vouchers, also.\nOBAMA: But the — but here’s the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go — I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn’t show that it actually solves the problem — the centerpiece of Senator McCain’s education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.\nThat leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.\nSo if we are going to be serious about this issue, we’ve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. And that’s what I intend to do as president.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nMCCAIN: Because there’s not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn’t do it, even though it’s working. I got it.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nGentlemen, we have come to the close. Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, I’d like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this evening’s debates and the three that preceded tonight’s debate.\nNow, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Senator McCain goes first.\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you again, Bob.\nThanks to Hofstra.\nAnd it’s great to be with you again. I think we’ve had a very healthy discussion.\nMy friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America. And they were graphically demonstrated again today.\nAmerica needs a new direction. We cannot be satisfied with what we’ve been doing for the last eight years.\nI have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients’ Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in — in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.\nAnd I’ve been a careful steward of your tax dollars. We have to make health care affordable and available. We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.\nWe have to stop the spending. We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children’s futures.\nAll of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base — will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.\nThat’s why I’ve asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.\nI’ve spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. Thereâ€™s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it’s been the great honor of my life, and I’ve been proud to serve.\nAnd I hope you’ll give me an opportunity to serve again. I’d be honored and humbled.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\nOBAMA: Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.\nI think we all know America is going through tough times right now. The policies of the last eight years and — and Washington’s unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\nAnd that’s why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we’ve seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.\nWe need fundamental change in this country, and that’s what I’d like to bring.\nYou know, over the last 20 months, you’ve invited me into your homes. You’ve shared your stories with me. And you’ve confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.\nAnd that’s why I’m sure that our brighter days are still ahead.\nBut we’re going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.\nThese are the policies I have fought for my entire career. And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.\nBut it’s not going to be easy. It’s not going to be quick. It is going to be requiring all of us — Democrats, Republicans, independents — to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.\nI’m absolutely convinced we can do it. I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.\nThank you very much.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator Obama, Senator McCain, thank you very much.\nThis concludes the final debate. I’m Bob Schieffer of CBS News, and I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said — go vote now. It will make you feel big and strong. Good night, everyone.\nEND\nTranscription by: CQ Transcriptions/Morningside\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        [moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News]\nSCHIEFFER: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.\nThe rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.\nI will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion.\nI'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.\nThe audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.\nGentlemen, welcome.\nBy now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard. Let's get to it.\nAnother very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.\nSen. McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.\nSen. Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.\nI will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?\nSen. McCain, you go first.\nMcCain: Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.\nAnd thanks to Hofstra.\nAnd, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.\nIt's good to see you again, Sen. Obama.\nAmericans are hurting right now, and they're angry. They're hurting, and they're angry. They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.\nAnd they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.\nBut we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.\nLet me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.\nThe catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.\nI am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.\nNow, we have allocated $750 billion. Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.\nNow, I know the criticism of this.\nWell, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned. And so we've got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Sen. Obama?\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Sen. McCain again, and thank you, Bob.\nI think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Sen. McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.\nAnd I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.\nNumber one, let's focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.\nNumber two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.\nNow Sen. McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners. That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.\nI disagree with Sen. McCain in how to do it, because the way Sen. McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we don't want to waste taxpayer money. And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.\nLast point I want to make, though. We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away. We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Would you like to ask him a question?\nMCCAIN: No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Sen. Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.\nJoe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.\nYou were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.\nNow Sen. Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.\nAnd I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. That's 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.\nSCHIEFFER: Is that what you want to do?\nMCCAIN: That's what Joe believes.\nOBAMA: He has been watching ads of Sen. McCain's. Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Sen. McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.\nNow, Sen. McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.\nWhat I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime.\nAnd 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Sen. McCain does.\nNow, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, \"Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\"\nAnd what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices.\nThe last point I'll make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.\nMCCAIN: You know, when Sen. Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Sen. Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.\nI want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.\nThe whole premise behind Sen. Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around. I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.\nWho -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.\nI'm not going to...\nOBAMA: OK. Can I...\nMCCAIN: We're not going to do that in my administration.\nOBAMA: If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...\nMCCAIN: We're talking about Joe the plumber.\nOBAMA: ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.\nThen Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.\nSo, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.\nMCCAIN: Nobody likes taxes. Let's not raise anybody's taxes. OK?\nOBAMA: Well, I don't mind paying a little more.\nMCCAIN: The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. Ireland, it's 11 percent.\nWhere are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?\nWe need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business.\nNow, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's go to another topic. It's related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.\nThis question goes to you first, Sen. Obama.\nWe found out yesterday that this year's deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. Some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year.\nBoth of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit.\nAren't you both ignoring reality? Won't some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?\nGive us some specifics on what you're going to cut back.\nSen. Obama?\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.\nBut there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.\nNow, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. I haven't made a promise about...\nSCHIEFFER: But you're going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.\nOBAMA: Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.\nAnd some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better. It's not improving our health care system. It's just a giveaway.\nWe need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better.\nNow, what is true is that Sen. McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier.\nIf we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.\nIf we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.\nIf we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.\nBut what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.\nAnd we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\nSenator?\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.\nAnd they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.\nAnd, by the way, this was a proposal made by Sen. Clinton not too long ago.\nSo, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.\nSCHIEFFER: But what...\nMCCAIN: But -- OK. All right.\nSCHIEFFER: The question was, what are you going to cut?\nMCCAIN: Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Sen. Obama has opposed.\nAnd the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.\nOK, what -- what would I cut? I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK? Some people say that's a hatchet. That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?\nBecause we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.\nGovernment spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.\nI know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.\nSCHIEFFER: Which ones?\nMCCAIN: I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.\nI oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Sen. Obama supported those subsidies.\nI would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.\nI know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.\nBut I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. Sen. Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\nMCCAIN: ... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\nOBAMA: Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It doesn't happen.\nAnd, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.\nNow, Sen. McCain talks a lot about earmarks. That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.\nEarmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem.\nNow, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.\nWhen President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years.\nOBAMA: And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.\nSo one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.\nWe've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.\nSCHIEFFER: Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? You have said previously you thought you could, Sen. McCain.\nMCCAIN: Sure I do. And let me tell you...\nSCHIEFFER: You can still do that?\nMCCAIN: Yes. Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.\nSen. Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. It's completely out of control.\nThe mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City. They're doing it all over America because they have to. Because they have to balance their budgets. I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...\nSCHIEFFER: In four years?\nMCCAIN: ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.\nNow, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.\nSen. Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.\nHe voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, let's look at our records, Sen. Obama. Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.\nI have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.\nSCHIEFFER: Barack.\nOBAMA: Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support...\nMCCAIN: An overwhelming vote.\nOBAMA: I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists. So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.\nNow with respect to a couple of things Sen. McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Sen. McCain keeps on making.\nEven FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.\nNow, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it hasn't worked.\nAnd I think the American people understand it hasn't worked. We need to move in a new direction.\nSCHIEFFER: All right...\nMCCAIN: Let me just say, Bob.\nSCHIEFFER: OK. About 30 seconds.\nMCCAIN: OK. But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration. I have disagreed with leaders of my own party. I've got the scars to prove it.\nWhether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time. Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.\nI have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nMCCAIN: Sen. Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. We're going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Obama, your campaign has used words like \"erratic,\" \"out of touch,\" \"lie,\" \"angry,\" \"losing his bearings\" to describe Sen. McCain.\nSen. McCain, your commercials have included words like \"disrespectful,\" \"dangerous,\" \"dishonorable,\" \"he lied.\" Your running mate said he \"palled around with terrorists.\"\nAre each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?\nAnd, Sen. McCain, you're first.\nMCCAIN: Well, this has been a tough campaign. It's been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Sen. Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.\nWhen Sen. Obama was first asked, he said, \"Any place, any time,\" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.\nAnd the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.\nOne of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful.\nAnd, Sen. Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks. Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Sen. Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.\nSo I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And it's a matter of fact that Sen. Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it.\nAnd, Sen. Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.\nAnd when you looked into the camera in a debate with Sen. Clinton and said, \"I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,\" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't.\nAnd that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Sen. Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up. All right.\nOBAMA: Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Sen. McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.\nAnd 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.\nMCCAIN: It's not true.\nOBAMA: It absolutely is true. And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.\nAnd there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.\nThe notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.\nWhat the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.\nSen. McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.\nAnd I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.\nAnd that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.\nMCCAIN: Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.\nOBAMA: Congratulations.\nMCCAIN: Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said it's not true. You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I don't.\nYou're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Sen. Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.\nAnd of course, I've been talking about the economy. Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around. I'm going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.\nThat's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.\nBut again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...\nOBAMA: I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like \"terrorist\" and \"kill him,\" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say \"Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.\"\nAnd I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.\nNow...\nMCCAIN: You've got to read what he said...\n(CROSSTALK)\nOBAMA: Let -- let -- let...\nMCCAIN: You've got to read what he said.\nOBAMA: Let me -- let me complete...\nSCHIEFFER: Go ahead.\nOBAMA: ... my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.\nAnd, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.\nThe important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.\nMCCAIN: I cannot...\nOBAMA: We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...\nMCCAIN: We do and I hope...\nOBAMA: ... talking about it this evening.\nMCCAIN: Sure.\nOBAMA: But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues. What we're talking about...\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just say I would...\nSCHIEFFER: (inaudible)\nMCCAIN: Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.\nBut to somehow say that group of young women who said \"Military wives for McCain\" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say \"World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,\" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens.\nAnd I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Sen. Obama, that I'm not happy about either.\nIn fact, some T-shirts that are very...\nOBAMA: John, I...\nMCCAIN: ... unacceptable. So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.\nBut the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. I haven't.\nOBAMA: Well, look, Bob, as I said...\nSCHIEFFER: I mean, do you take issue with that?\nOBAMA: You know, here's what I would say. I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns. I suspect we won't agree here tonight.\nWhat I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.\nAnd what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable. And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues. What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people. And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long. And I think...\nMCCAIN: Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.\nSCHIEFFER: Short answer, yes, short answer.\nMCCAIN: Yes, real quick. Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.\nWe need to know the full extent of Sen. Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for \"lighting and site selection.\" So all of these things need to be examined, of course.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. I'm going to let you respond and we'll extend this for a moment.\nOBAMA: Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Sen. McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.\nIn fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Sen. McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let's get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.\nForty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.\nOther members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.\nMr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that's Mr. Ayers.\nNow, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.\nIt had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.\nNow, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Sen. McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.\nLet me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.\nThose are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.\nMCCAIN: Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN. So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.\nOBAMA: That's absolutely not true.\nMCCAIN: And the facts are facts and records are records.\nOBAMA: And that's not the facts.\nMCCAIN: And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Sen. Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Sen. Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.\nAnd my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America. And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Sen. Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. I want to ask both of you about the people that you're going to bring into the government.\nAnd our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.\nSCHIEFFER: So I'll begin by asking both of you this question, and I'll ask you to answer first, Sen. Obama. Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?\nOBAMA: Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.\nBut it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.\nAnd, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.\nThat's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.\nBecause after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to re-prioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.\nSo, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\nMCCAIN: Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin. They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.\nShe's a reformer. She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, \"This can't go on.\"\nShe's given money back to the taxpayers. She's cut the size of government. She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.\nShe's a reformer through and through. And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.\nShe'll be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.\nShe understands that better than almost any American that I know. I'm proud of her.\nAnd she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process. And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.\nHer husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think she's qualified to be president?\nOBAMA: You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people. I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.\nAnd I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs. I agree with that, John.\nI do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research. That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.\nAnd if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it. That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think Sen. Biden is qualified?\nMCCAIN: I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.\nHe voted against the first Gulf War. He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.\nIn Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them. We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.\nThere are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I open and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.\nBut again, I want to come back to, notice every time Sen. Obama says, \"We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer\" -- why do we always have to spend more?\nWhy can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.\nSCHIEFFER: Let's go to -- let's go to a new topic. We're running a little behind.\nLet's talk about energy and climate control. Every president since Nixon has said what both of you...\nMCCAIN: Climate change.\nSCHIEFFER: Climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\nWhen Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil. Now, we're importing more than 60 percent.\nWould each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?\nAnd I believe the first question goes to you, Sen. McCain.\nMCCAIN: I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine.\nBy the way, when Sen. Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, \"Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.\"\nYou don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.\nWe can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess.\nSen. Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.\nLook, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Sen. Obama, no problem.\nSo the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.\nSo I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?\nOBAMA: I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think that's about a realistic timeframe.\nAnd this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It's mortgaging our children's future.\nNow, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.\nNumber one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.\nAnd I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.\nThat's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.\nWe invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.\nNow I just want to make one last point because Sen. McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Sen. McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.\nAnd what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.\nAnd when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. That's all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\nMCCAIN: Well, you know, I admire so much Sen. Obama's eloquence. And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. We've got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. It's doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now.\nNow, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.\nBut let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Sen. Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.\nBecause of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Sen. Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.\nAnd also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.\nFree trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.\nOBAMA: Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.\nAnd what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.\nBut I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.\nAnd the last point I'll make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.\nThat's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.\nAnd Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.\nIf we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Sen. Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.\nFree trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.\nSo I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Sen. Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.\nWe're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.\nSCHIEFFER: All right, let's go to a new topic, health care. Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? The question is first to Sen. Obama.\nOBAMA: We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.\nLook, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance.\nAnd they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.\nSo here's what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything. If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.\nThe only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.\nIf you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Sen. McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.\nWe're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.\nWe are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.\nAnd we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. We've got to put more money into preventive care.\nThis will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nSen. McCain?\nMCCAIN: Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.\nAnd it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.\nWe need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will -- that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics.\nThe rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know what's going on there.\nWe -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.\nBut I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.\nNow, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Sen. Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Sen. Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Sen. Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.\nNow, Sen. Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.\nSen. Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.\nIf you like that, you'll love Canada and England. So the point is...\nSCHIEFFER: So that's your objective?\nOBAMA: It is not and I didn't describe it...\nMCCAIN: No, you stated it.\nOBAMA: I just...\nMCCAIN: Excuse me.\nOBAMA: I just described what my plan is. And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there. Here's your fine -- zero. You won't pay a fine, because...\nMCCAIN: Zero?\nOBAMA: Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.\nI exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.\nRight now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.\nThe average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.\nSo here's what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.\nIf you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.\nNow, what we haven't talked about is Sen. McCain's plan. He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance.\nHere's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.\nOlder folks, let's healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.\nAnd once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Sen. McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.\nAnd this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.\nBy the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.\nLast point about Sen. McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Sen. McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.\nThat, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.\nSCHIEFFER: What about that?\nMCCAIN: Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.\nNow, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Sen. Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.\nThat's big government at its best.\nNow, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.\nAnd the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America. The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800. I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.\nThis will give them availability. This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Sen. Obama and government decide that for them.\nThis really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Sen. Obama wants government to do the job.\nSen. Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job.\nI want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. That's what I'm all about. And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.\nWe can't afford that in the next eight years and Sen. Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. A short response.\nOBAMA: Very briefly. You all just heard my plan. If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. Now, under Sen. McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.\nThat's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. And don't take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\nAll I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs. That includes you, Joe.\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's stop there and go to another question. And this one goes to Sen. McCain. Sen. McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Sen. Obama, you believe it shouldn't.\nCould either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue? Sen. McCain?\nMCCAIN: I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. That's not appropriate to do.\nSCHIEFFER: But you don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?\nMCCAIN: I thought it was a bad decision. I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. I'm a federalist. And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.\nNow, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up. Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.\nWe got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats. You were offered a chance to join. You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, \"conservative judges.\"\nI voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. This is a very important issue we're talking about.\nSen. Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards. That's not the way we should judge these nominees. Elections have consequences. They should be judged on their qualifications. And so that's what I will do.\nI will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution. And not legislating from the bench.\nSCHIEFFER: But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?\nMCCAIN: I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nOBAMA: Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\nAnd it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\nNow I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\nBut what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\nSo this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\nI'll just give you one quick example. Sen. McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\nFor years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.\nWe tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\nI think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that's the kind of judge that I want.\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\nMCCAIN: Obviously, that law waved the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyer's dream.\nLet me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.\nSen. Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\nAnd then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.\nThen there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\nI don't know how you vote \"present\" on some of that. I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.\nAnd he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Sen. Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\nSCHIEFFER: Response?\nOBAMA: Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true. The -- here are the facts.\nThere was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\nAnd the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\nWith respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\nAnd I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\nThe last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that -- look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.\nBut there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \"We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\"\nThose are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation.\nWe should try to reduce these circumstances.\nSCHIEFFER: Let's give Sen. McCain a short response...\nMCCAIN: Just again...\nSCHIEFFER: ... and then...\nMCCAIN: Just again, the example of the eloquence of Sen. Obama. He's health for the mother. You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\nThat's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, \"health.\" But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.\nBut that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. Of course, we have to come together. Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.\nSCHIEFFER: Let's stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I'm afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.\nThe question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.\nThe implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.\nDo you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?\nThe question to Sen. Obama first.\nOBAMA: This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.\nSo we've got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.\nIn some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.\nI think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.\nAnd I think it's important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.\nAnd that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.\nIf we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.\nBut there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents. We can't do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. McCain?\nMCCAIN: Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century. There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.\nBut what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?\nSo choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.\nAnd we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Sen. Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.\nCharter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.\nNow, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.\nSo I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.\nWe need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.\nLook, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money?\nOBAMA: Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.\nNow we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.\nSo what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.\nCharter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.\nAnd we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.\nWhere we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Sen. McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.\nRecently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.\nI don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.\nAnd if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It's not going to happen on its own.\nSCHIEFFER: What about that, Senator?\nMCCAIN: Well, sure. I'm sure you're aware, Sen. Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.\nBecause they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.\nAnd we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was voucher, Sen. Obama. And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.\nNow as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it.\nBut, again, spending more money isn't always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.\nLet's reform it. Let's reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.\nAnd I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we'll care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.\nBut to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.\nAnd I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And it's been proven.\nOBAMA: I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Sen. McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...\nMCCAIN: Who supports vouchers.\nOBAMA: ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.\nMCCAIN: She supports vouchers, also.\nOBAMA: But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Sen. McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Sen. McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.\nThat leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Sen. McCain.\nSo if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. And that's what I intend to do as president.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nMCCAIN: Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working. I got it.\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\nGentlemen, we have come to the close. Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, I'd like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this evening's debates and the three that preceded tonight's debate.\nNow, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Sen. McCain goes first.\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you again, Bob.\nThanks to Hofstra.\nAnd it's great to be with you again. I think we've had a very healthy discussion.\nMy friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America. And they were graphically demonstrated again today.\nAmerica needs a new direction. We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.\nI have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.\nAnd I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars. We have to make health care affordable and available. We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.\nWe have to stop the spending. We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.\nAll of these things and all the promises and commitments that Sen. Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.\nThat's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.\nI've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. As a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.\nAnd I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again. I'd be honored and humbled.\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\nOBAMA: Well, I want to thank Sen. McCain and Bob for moderating.\nI think we all know America is going through tough times right now. The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\nAnd that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.\nWe need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.\nYou know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes. You've shared your stories with me. And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.\nAnd that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.\nBut we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.\nThese are the policies I have fought for my entire career. And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.\nBut it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be quick. It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.\nI'm absolutely convinced we can do it. I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.\nThank you very much.\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Obama, Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\nThis concludes the final debate. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News, and I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said -- go vote now. It will make you feel big and strong. Good night, everyone.\nPresidential Candidate Debates, Presidential Debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

What really happened?\n\"The Clinton family, they are crooks, they are thieves, they are liars,\" says Haitian activist Dahoud Andre.\nHe has been leading protests outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign base in Brooklyn for the last two years.\nHe said protesters from his small activist group, the Committee to Mobilize Against Dictatorship in Haiti, will continue to level their allegations - so far all unproven - if the Democratic candidate wins the White House.\nHaiti honeymoon\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump raised the matter in the third and final presidential debate when he told Mrs Clinton: \"I was at a Little Haiti the other day in Florida.\n\"And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.\"\nMrs Clinton retorted that she was proud of the foundation's work, and pointed out her rival's namesake charity had spent money on a lifesize portrait of himself.\nThe Clintons' history with the world's first black republic dates back to their 1975 honeymoon, when they met a voodoo priest and visited a hotel where Ernest Hemingway once stayed.\nFew could have guessed the two young Americans touring the attractions that December would one day wield such influence over the impoverished Caribbean island nation.\nMr Andre is not alone among his compatriots in blaming the once-and-perhaps-future first couple for a litany of ills in Haiti.\nKim Ives, editor of Haiti Liberte newspaper, told the BBC: \"A lot of Haitians are not big fans of the Clintons, that's for sure.\"\n\"The fact the Clintons kind of took over things after the earthquake and did a pretty poor job of it translates to why the Haitians have a pretty dim view of them,\" he added.\nReplicated mistakes\nMrs Clinton was Secretary of State and Mr Clinton was UN Special Envoy to Haiti when the January 2010 earthquake struck, killing an estimated 220,000 people.\nSome $13.3bn (£10.9bn) was pledged by international donors for Haiti's recovery.\nMr Clinton was appointed co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), along with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive.\nMore from the BBC\nBut the IHRC found itself under fire as frustrations mounted at the slow pace of recovery.\nIts mandate was not renewed by the Haitian parliament in 2011.\nA US Government Accountability Office report discovered no hint of wrongdoing, but concluded the IHRC's decisions were \"not necessarily aligned with Haitian priorities\".\nMr Clinton's own office at the UN found 9% of the foreign aid cash, external went to the Haitian government and 0.6% to local organisations.\nThe bulk of it went to UN agencies, international aid groups, private contractors and donor countries' own civilian and military agencies.\nFor example, the Pentagon billed the State Department hundreds of millions of dollars for sending US troops to hand out bottled water and keep order on the streets of Haiti's ravaged capital, Port-au-Prince.\nJake Johnston, an analyst with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonpartisan group that has studied the quake reconstruction, told the BBC \"it's hard to say it's been anything other than a failure\".\nBut he believes the State Department and IHRC simply replicated the mistakes of the whole foreign aid industry by chasing short-term gains instead of building longer-term capacity on the ground.\n\"They relied too much on outside actors,\" Mr Johnston says, \"and supplanted the role of the Haitian government and domestic producers.\"\nWhile the Clintons in their respective roles clearly had a say over where some of the quake relief cash flowed, their political enemies have wrongly claimed the family foundation directly controlled all the billions in funds.\nThe foundation itself raised a relatively modest $30m for aid projects in Haiti.\nA spokeswoman for the charity told the BBC: \"Every penny of the more than $30m raised was deployed on the ground, with no overhead taken by the Clinton Foundation.\"\n'Friends of Bill'\nMrs Clinton's campaign has said she never did anything at the State Department as a result of donations to the Clinton Foundation.\nBut potential conflicts of interest have emerged.\nAfter the earthquake, disaster capitalists flocked to the nation of 10 million people, which is about the size of the US state of Massachusetts.\nPrivate contractors were eager to sell services, in what one US envoy described in a Wikileaks-disclosed diplomatic cable as a \"gold rush\".\nIn email exchanges with top Clinton Foundation officials, a senior aide to Mrs Clinton, who was then-secretary of state, kept an eye out for those identified by the abbreviations \"FOB\" (friends of Bill Clinton) or \"WJC VIPs\" (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs).\n\"Need you to flag when people are friends of WJC,\" wrote Caitlin Klevorick, a senior State Department official who was vetting incoming offers of assistance coming through the Clinton Foundation.\n\"Most I can probably ID but not all.\"\nMs Klevorick told ABC News she made the comments about Mr Clinton to help pin down whether would-be contractors had a history in Haiti or with disaster relief.\nThe emails, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Republican National Committee, have fuelled claims the Clintons were running a pay-to-play operation, though no hard evidence of this has emerged.\nHouse Republicans are already laying the groundwork for a volley of congressional hearings into the Clinton Foundation in the event the Democratic candidate wins the White House in a week's time.\nPossibly the most enduring criticism of the Clinton Foundation's work in Haiti stems from its signature project, a garment factory known as the Caracol Industrial Park.\nThe foundation, working with the Clinton State Department, helped arrange a US-subsidised deal with the Haitian government to build the $300m factory complex in 2012.\nSeveral hundred farmers were evicted from their land to make way for the 600-acre manufacturing site, which produces clothes for retailers such as Old Navy, Walmart and Target.\nSouth Korean textile giant Sae-A Trading Co, which is the main employer at the facility, subsequently donated between $50,000 to $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\nMr Clinton declared 100,000 jobs would be created \"in short order\".\nBut the Caracol Industrial Park has created only 8,000 jobs.\nSae-A spokeswoman Karen Seo told the BBC: \"The rate of job growth depends both on the efficiency in building facilities, as well as customer demand - including the long tail of the recession. Momentum is growing and we are optimistic.\"\nIn its defence, the Clinton Foundation - which has raised more than $2bn from over 330,000 donors since its 2001 launch - points to its A rating from philanthropic monitors.\nCharity Watch says 88% of the Clinton Foundation's budget was spent last year on programme expenses.\nBut the watchdog's president, Daniel Borochoff, told the BBC the high mark was not intended to reflect whether Mrs Clinton kept donors to her family's foundation at appropriate arm's length, or provided favoured access as secretary of state.\nQuestions 'fester'\nThe Clinton Foundation rebutted any suggestion of special favours, saying that in the aftermath of the Haiti quake they worked with a \"wide range\" of partners to mobilise relief efforts immediately \"and many people they had previously worked with responded to this call to help\".\nThe charity's statement to the BBC continued: \"President Clinton and the Clinton Foundation's only goal in Haiti is to help the people of Haiti.\n\"Since 2010, the Foundation has worked on the ground in Haiti with a range of partners - helping more than 7,500 farmers lift themselves out of poverty; improving the Haitian environment by planting more than 5 million trees and installing more than 400 KW of clean energy; and supporting women through literacy training and job skills for over 2,000 women.\"\nMrs Clinton's presidential campaign did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.\nIn the Little Haiti neighbourhood of Miami that was visited by Mr Trump this September, the head of a local women's advocacy group has questions for Mrs Clinton.\nMarleine Bastien, executive director of Fanm Ayisyen Nan Miyami, believes that Clinton-backed projects have helped global investors more than they have benefited poverty-stricken Haitians.\nShe told the BBC: \"The more Secretary Clinton refrains from responding to the concerns and questions from the people of Haiti, this perception that she's trying to evade responding will continue.\n\"Instead of allowing these questions to linger and fester, why not come clean? The questions will not go away, they will continue.\"\nAs for Mr Trump's attempt to woo Haitian-American voters, it may prove a longshot, given his threats to round up millions of undocumented immigrants.\nThere are an estimated 150,000 members of this electoral bloc in Florida, a crucial swing state where the presidential contest is on a knife-edge.\nJeff Lozama, chairman of the Haitian American Chamber of Commerce of Florida, told the BBC that regardless of misgivings about the Clintons' work in Haiti, his countrymen and women in the diaspora overwhelmingly hope she wins election on 8 November.\nHe says many of them fear what a Trump presidency could mean for their US status.\n\"Haitians cannot afford to have any mass deportation,\" he said.\n\"Immigration is the number one item (among Haitian-Americans) for these candidates.\"\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Clinton Foundation\n| Founded | 2001[3] |\n|---|---|\n| Founder | Bill Clinton |\n| Type | Nonprofit |\n| 31-1580204 | |\n| Legal status | 501(c)(3) organization |\n| Location | |\nKey people | Bill Clinton (2001–present) Hillary Clinton (2013–2015) Chelsea Clinton (2011–present) Donna Shalala (president, 2015–2017) Eric Braverman (president, 2013–2015) Bruce Lindsey (president, 2004–2011) Skip Rutherford (president, 1997–2004) Ira Magaziner (head of Clinton Health Access Initiative) Doug Band (originator of Clinton Global Initiative) |\n| Revenue | $20 million (2018)[3] |\n| Endowment | $292,393,055 (2018)[4] |\n| Employees | 2,000 (2015)[3] |\n| Website | www |\nFormerly called | William J.

Clinton Presidential Foundation,[7] and renamed in 2013 as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation)[8] is a nonprofit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code. It was established by former president of the United States Bill Clinton with the stated mission to \"strengthen the capacity of people in the United States and throughout the world to meet the challenges of global interdependence.\"[9] Its offices are located in New York City and Little Rock, Arkansas.\nThrough 2016, the foundation had raised an estimated $2 billion from U.S. corporations, foreign governments and corporations, political donors, and various other groups and individuals.[10] The acceptance of funds from wealthy donors has been a source of controversy.[10][11] The foundation \"has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support\".[10] Charitable grants are not a major focus of the Clinton Foundation, which instead uses most of its money to carry out its own humanitarian programs.[12]\nThis foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate and is distinct from the Clinton Family Foundation, a private organization for personal Clinton family philanthropy.[13][14]\nAccording to the Clinton Foundation's website, neither Bill Clinton nor his daughter, Chelsea Clinton (both are members of the governing board), draws any salary or receives any income from the foundation. When Hillary Clinton was a board member, she reportedly also received no income from the foundation.[15]\nBeginning in 2015, the foundation was accused of wrongdoing, including a bribery and pay-to-play scheme, but multiple investigations through 2019 found no evidence of malfeasance. The New York Times reported in September 2020 that a federal prosecutor appointed by attorney general Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the 2016 FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation had also sought documents and interviews regarding how the FBI handled an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.[16] In May 2023, it was revealed that the Justice Department had continued to investigate the Foundation until days before the end of the first Trump presidency, when FBI officials insisted the DOJ acknowledge in writing that there was no case to bring.[17]\nHistory\n[edit]The origins of the foundation go back to 1997, when then-president Bill Clinton was focused mostly on fundraising for the future Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.[3] He founded the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, following the completion of his presidency.[18] Longtime Clinton advisor Bruce Lindsey became the CEO in 2004.[19][20] Later, Lindsey moved from being CEO to being chair, largely for health reasons.[19] Other Clinton hands who played an important early role included Doug Band[21] and Ira Magaziner. Additional Clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include John Podesta and Laura Graham.[18]\nThe foundation's success is spurred by Bill Clinton's worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives, celebrities, and government officials.[18] Similarly, the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever Bill suddenly felt an interest in.[18]\nPreceding Barack Obama's 2009 nomination of Hillary Clinton as United States Secretary of State, Bill Clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and the Clinton Global Initiative.[22] Accordingly, a list of donors was released in December 2008.[23]\nBy 2011, Chelsea Clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board.[18][24] To raise money for the foundation, she gave paid speeches, such as her $65,000 2014 address at the University of Missouri in Kansas City for the opening of the Starr Women's Hall of Fame.[25]\nIn 2013, Hillary Clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as Secretary of State. She planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children,[26][27] as well as economic development.[19] Accordingly, at that point, it was renamed the \"Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation\".[18] Extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the 2016 United States presidential election, Hillary resigned from the board of the Clinton Foundation in April 2015.[18][19]\nIn July 2013, Eric Braverman was named CEO of the foundation.[20] He is a friend and former colleague of Chelsea Clinton from McKinsey & Company.[18][19] At the same time, Chelsea Clinton was named vice chair of the foundation's board.[18][20] The foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the Time-Life Building in Midtown Manhattan.[18]\nChelsea Clinton moved the organization to an outside review, conducted by the firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Its conclusions were made public in mid-2013.[19] The main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president's fundraising abilities, how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization, and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond Bill Clinton's lifetime.[18][19] Dennis Cheng, a former Hillary Clinton campaign official and State Department deputy chief, was named to oversee a $250 million endowment drive.[18] The review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements, including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities.[19] Additionally, the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation's conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process.[19]\nIn January 2015, Braverman announced his resignation. Politico attributed the move to being \"partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation.\"[28] He was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary, Maura Pally.[29]\nOn February 18, 2015, The Washington Post reported that, \"the foundation has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support, with members of the George W. Bush administration often participating in its programs.\"[10] In March 2015, former Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration, Donna Shalala, was selected to run the Clinton Foundation.[30] She left in April 2017.[31]\nIn August 2016, The Boston Globe's editorial board suggested that the Clinton Foundation cease accepting donations. The Globe's editorial board offered praise for the foundation's work but added that \"as long as either of the Clintons are in public office, or actively seeking it, they should not operate a charity, too\" because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction.[32]\nIn 2016, Reuters reported that the Clinton Foundation suspected that it had been the target of a cyber security breach. As a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach, Clinton Foundation officials retained a security firm, FireEye, to evaluate its data systems. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.[33]\nIn October 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that four FBI field offices—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock—had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether \"there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling\". In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office was investigating Terry McAuliffe before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation.[34] CNN reported in January 2018, that the FBI is investigating allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation in Arkansas. Sources said that federal prosecutors are checking to see if foundation donors were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state in return for donations and whether tax-exempt funds were misused by the foundation's leadership.[35] The Washington Post reported in January 2020, that an additional Justice Department investigation into the matter, initiated after Donald Trump took office in 2017, was winding down after finding nothing worth pursuing.[36]\nBoard of directors\n[edit]As of January 2018, the board members are:[37]\n- Bill Clinton, chairman\n- Chelsea Clinton, vice chair\n- Frank Giustra\n- Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster\n- Eric Goosby\n- Hadeel Ibrahim\n- Lisa Jackson\n- Bruce Lindsey, counselor to the chair\n- Cheryl Mills\n- Donna Shalala\nPrograms and initiatives\n[edit]Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)\n[edit]As of January 1, 2010, the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, became a separate nonprofit organization called the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI).[18][38] Organizations such as the Clinton Foundation continue to supply anti-malarial drugs to Africa and other affected areas; according to director Inder Singh, in 2011 more than 12 million individuals will be supplied with subsidized anti-malarial drugs.[citation needed]\nIn May 2007, CHAI and UNITAID announced agreements that help middle-income and low-income countries save money on second-line drugs. The partnership also reduced the price of a once-daily first-line treatment to less than $1 per day.[39] To procure these low-cost drugs, Bill Clinton repeatedly visited Indian manufacturers of generic drugs, which helped legitimize India's pharmaceutical industry.[40]\nCHAI was spun off into a separate organization in 2010; Ira Magaziner became its CEO (he had been a key figure in the Clinton health care plan of 1993).[18] Chelsea Clinton joined its board in 2011, as did Tachi Yamada, former President of the Global Health Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[18]\nClinton Global Initiative (CGI) and CGI U\n[edit]The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) was founded in 2005 by Bill Clinton. Doug Band, counselor to Bill, was integral to its formation.[21] Clinton has credited Band with being the originator of CGI and has noted that \"Doug had the idea to do this.\"[41] Band left his paid position at CGI in 2010,[18] preferring to emphasize his Teneo business and family pursuits, but remains on the CGI advisory board.[19] The overlap between CGI and Teneo, of which Bill was a paid advisor, drew criticism.[18] According to his attorneys during 2007 plea negotiations on sex offense charges, financier Jeffrey Epstein also formed \"part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative\", though his name was not mentioned in any of the organization's founding documents.[42][43]\nIn 2007, Bill started CGI U, which expanded the model of CGI to students, universities, and national youth organizations. CGI U has been held at Tulane University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Miami, the University of California, San Diego, The George Washington University, Washington University in St. Louis, Arizona State University, and University of California, Berkeley. Panelists and speakers have included Jon Stewart, Madeleine Albright, Vandana Shiva, Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Stephen Colbert, Jack Dorsey, Greg Stanton, U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, Shane Battier, Salman Khan (founder of Khan Academy), and U.S. Rep. John Lewis.[44][45][46][47][48]\nIn September 2016, it was announced that the Initiative would be winding down to be discontinued and that 74 employees would be let go at the end of the year.[49][50] In January 2017, it was announced that another 22 employees would be let go by April 15, 2017, and that CGI University would be continued.[51][52][needs update]\nClinton Global Citizen Awards\n[edit]The Clinton Global Citizen Awards are a set of awards which have been given by the Clinton Global Initiative every year since 2007.[53] The awards are given to individuals who, in the opinion of the Clinton Foundation, are \"outstanding individuals who exemplify global citizenship through their vision and leadership\".[53] Past recipients of the award include Mexican businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim,[53] Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien,[54] Moroccan entrepreneur Mohammad Abbad Andaloussi,[55] Rwandan President Paul Kagame,[56] Afghan women's rights activist Suraya Pakzad,[57] Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernández,[58] and Pakistani labor rights activist Syeda Ghulam Fatima.[59]\nClinton Climate Initiative (CCI)\n[edit]In August 2006, Bill Clinton started a program to fight climate change, the Clinton Foundation's Climate Initiative (CCI).[60] The CCI directly runs various programs to prevent deforestation and to rehabilitate forests and other landscapes worldwide, develop clean energy, and help island nations threatened by rising ocean levels.[61]\nOn August 1, 2006, the foundation entered into a partnership with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group, agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support.[62]\nIn May 2007, CCI announced its first project which will help some large cities cut greenhouse gas emissions by facilitating retrofitting of existing buildings. Five large banks committed $1 billion each to help cities and building owners make energy-saving improvements aimed at lowering energy use and energy costs.[63] At the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Clinton announced the 1Sky campaign to accelerate bold federal policy on global warming.[64] The 1Sky campaign supports at least an 80% reduction in climate pollution levels by 2050.\nOn May 19, 2009, CCI announced the global Climate Positive Development Program where it will work with the U.S. Green Building Council to promote \"climate positive\" city growth.[65]\nNorway and Germany are among the countries co-financing projects with the CCI in numerous developing and third-world countries.[66][67][68]\nClinton Development Initiative (CDI)\n[edit]The Clinton Development Initiative, originally the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative, was formed in 2006 as a partnership with Scottish philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter's Hunter Foundation to target the root causes of poverty in Africa and promote sustainable economic growth.[69]\nThe Alliance for a Healthier Generation\n[edit]The Alliance for a Healthier Generation is a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association that was working to end the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States by 2010.\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which provided an initial $8 million to start the Healthy Schools Program, awarded a $20 million grant to expand the program to over 8,000 schools in states with the highest obesity rates.[70]\nAt the industry level, the Alliance struck agreements with major food and beverage manufacturers to provide kids with nutritional options, and established nutrition guidelines for school vending machines, stores and cafeterias to promote healthy eating. Some of the companies involved in these efforts are Coca-Cola, Cadbury plc, Campbell Soup Company, Groupe Danone, Kraft Foods, Mars and PepsiCo.[71][72]\nClinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative\n[edit]Established in 2007 with Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra — founder of the petroleum company Pacific Rubiales (renamed Pacific Exploration & Production in 2015) — CGSGI describes itself as \"pioneering an innovative approach to poverty alleviation.\"[73] Giustra's involvement with the Clinton Foundation has been criticized by the International Business Times, The Washington Post, and the American Media Institute because it was accompanied by a sudden reversal in Hillary Clinton's position while Secretary of State concerning the United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, an agreement which she had previously opposed \"as bad for labor rights.\"[74][75][76][77]\nClinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI)\n[edit]In November 2012, Bill Clinton announced the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI). CHMI is a national initiative, building on the Clinton Foundation's work on global health and childhood obesity, that works to improve the health and well-being of people across the United States by activating individuals, communities, and organizations to make meaningful contributions to the health of others. CHMI holds an annual Health Matters conference every January in the Coachella Valley.[78]\nDisaster relief\n[edit]The foundation has funded extensive disaster relief programs following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit, President George W. Bush asked former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to raise funds to help rebuild the Gulf Coast region. The two Presidents, having worked together to assist victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami, established the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund to identify and meet the unmet needs in the region, foster economic opportunity, and to improve the quality of life of those affected.[79] In the first month after the hurricane, the Fund collected over 42,000 online donations alone; approximately $128.4 million has been received to date from all 50 states and $30.9 million from foreign countries.\nBoth the foundation and the Clintons personally have been involved in Haiti before and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[18][80] Bill Clinton was named the head of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC) in 2010 after serving as UN special envoy to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The Clinton Foundation itself raised $30m and played an important part in the creation of the Caracol Industrial Park. The IHRC mandate was removed by the Haitian legislature in 2011.[81]\nNo Ceilings project\n[edit]In 2013, Hillary Clinton established a partnership between the foundation and the Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the United Nations Fourth World Conference On Women in Beijing in 1995.[82][83] This is called \"No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project\".[82][83] The project released a report in March 2015.[84]\nClinton Global Initiative Ukraine Action Network\n[edit]In September 2023, the launch of the Clinton Foundation's initiative for supporting Ukraine — Clinton Global Initiative Ukraine Action Network — was announced to support non-profit organizations working in Ukraine.[85][86]\nFinancials\n[edit]The Clinton Foundation relies on donation from various groups or individuals, donors such as Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated over $25 million over the years[87] Throughout the years, donations have been varying from one year to the other according to their financial reports [88]\n| Year | Revenues |\n| 2004 | 58.7 Archived March 5, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2005 | 71.1 Archived September 27, 2020, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2006 | 112.7 Archived September 27, 2020, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2007 | 131.4 |\n| 2008 | 234.8 Archived January 21, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2009 | 246.2 Archived March 10, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2010 | 313.6 Archived March 10, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2011 | 253.2 Archived January 14, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2012 | 134.2 Archived January 14, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2013 | 294.7 Archived November 11, 2020, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2014 | 338.0 Archived December 10, 2020, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2015 | 298.8 |\n| 2016 | 224.8 |\n| 2017 | 56.8 |\n| 2018 | 20.2 Archived January 14, 2021, at the Wayback Machine |\n| 2019 |\nThis graph was using the legacy Graph extension, which is no longer supported.

It removed the foundation from its watch list in late December of that year.[89] In September 2016, it gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the foundation's financial records and tax statements.[90] A different charity monitor, CharityWatch, said that 88% of the foundation's money goes toward its charitable mission and gave the foundation an A rating for 2016. In 2015, based on revenue of $223 million and an expense ratio of 12% the foundation spent in excess of $26 million to complete its mission.[91]\nPrivate philanthropy\n[edit]The Clinton Foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate. Due to their similar names, the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the Clinton Family Foundation, which is reserved for the Clintons' private philanthropy. The two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources.[13] The significantly smaller Clinton Family Foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving.[14] Headquartered in Chappaqua, New York, it received nearly all of the approximately $14 million the Clintons gave to charity from 2007 to 2013.[13]\nControversies\n[edit]Transparency\n[edit]Around 2007, the Clinton Foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency. Although U.S. law did not require charities, including presidential foundations, to disclose the identities of their contributors, critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because Hillary Clinton was running to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Commentator Matthew Yglesias opined in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the Clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance of impropriety.[92]\nA lengthy donors list was then released by the foundation in December 2008,[23] which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Blackwater Worldwide.[93] The foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that \"not even the appearance of a conflict of interest\" would exist once Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.[93]\nThe foundation has been criticized for receiving donations from Middle-Eastern countries which are seen to oppress women (stoning for adultery, not being able to drive, requiring a male guardian, etc.). This particularly included Saudi Arabia, which donated between $10 million and $25 million. Apart from the Middle Eastern countries like the United Arab Emirates and Oman, other foreign government donations came from Australia, Germany, and a Canadian government agency.[94][95] The foundation accepted these donations even though Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign platform guaranteed to break down barriers that held women back.[96]\nIn November 2016, Reuters reported that \"The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments.\"[97] Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin opined that the Qatari gift \"raised ethical questions\" because of the nation's support for Hamas.[98]\nThe ethics agreement between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation that had been put into force at the beginning of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State in 2009 came under scrutiny from the news media during February 2015 as polls showed her the likely 2016 Democratic nominee for president.[99] The Wall Street Journal reported that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended.[100] Contributions from foreign donors, which are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the U.S., constitute a major portion of the foundation's income. An investigation by The Washington Post of 2014 donations showed that there was \"substantial overlap between the Clinton political machinery and the foundation\". The investigation revealed that almost half of the major donors who had backed Ready for Hillary, a group which supported her 2016 presidency bid, had given at least $10,000 to the foundation, either personally or through foundations or companies they run. The Clinton Foundation's chief communications officer Craig Minassian explained that it is a \"false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldn't also support philanthropic work.\"[10]\nA subsequent Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the Secretary's tenure found, in addition to six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became Secretary as envisioned under the agreement, one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review, but did not.[101] Foundation officials said that if the former Secretary decided to run for president in 2016, they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations.[101] But in general, they stressed that, \"As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way. When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives.\"[101] State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki attested that the foundation's commitment to the ethics agreement in question \"has been over and above the letter of the law\".[102] In August 2016, after Clinton's securing the Democratic nomination, the Clinton Foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if she were elected.[103]\nIn March 2015, Reuters reported that the Clinton Health Access Initiative had failed to publish all of its donors, and to let the State Department review all of its donations from foreign governments after it was spun off from the Clinton Foundation in 2010.[104] In April 2015, The New York Times reported that when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the State Department had approved transactions that allowed Russian state-owned corporation Rosatom to take a majority stake in Uranium One, whose chairman had donated to the Clinton Foundation.[105] The State Department \"was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.\"[106] FactCheck.org stated there is \"no evidence\" that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions or that she was involved in the State Department's decision to approve the deal,[107] and PolitiFact concluded that any \"suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated\".[106]\n2015 State Department subpoena\n[edit]In February 2016, The Washington Post reported that the United States Department of State issued a subpoena to the foundation in the fall of 2015. According to the report, the subpoena focused on \"documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state\" and \"also asked for records related to Huma Abedin, longtime Clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons.\"[108]\nAustralian government donations\n[edit]Donations totalling tens of millions of dollars from successive Australian and New Zealand governments to the Clinton Foundation were the subject of criticism from a number of groups including the Taxpayers union of New Zealand[109] for a perceived lack of accountability and perceived conflicts of interest,[110][111][112] some of the donations were made directly and some through AUSAID.[113]\nIn 2006, the then foreign minister Alexander Downer and former President Clinton jointly signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2006 that gave more than A$25 million to the Clinton Foundation across four years for a project to provide screening and drug treatment to AIDS patients in Asia. The donation was later made through an affiliate of the charity known as the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI).[citation needed] The Australian government ceased funding CHAI in 2016.[114] In 2017 the Specialist Health Service (SHS) in a report commissioned by DFAT noted \"Previously, there appears to have been an over-reliance on the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) for facilitating market access\".[115]\nIn 2011, a pledge of A$270 million was made by Australian Julia Gillard government to the Global Partnership for Education[116] which in 2014 joined the Clinton Global Initiative.[117] Julia Gillard was made a member of the board of Global Partnership for Education in 2014 after losing the Australian federal election[118][119]\nAccording to DFAT, Australia contributed A$340.8 million to the Global partnership for education between 2007 and 2014 [120] including A$90 million in replenishment between 2018 and 2020[121]\nEthics controversies and use of taxpayer funds\n[edit]According to the hacked Podesta emails, Doug Band, an employee of the Clinton Foundation, accused Chelsea Clinton's husband Marc Mezvinsky of being involved in conflicts of interest. According to Band, Mezvinsky used the foundation to raise money for his hedge fund.[122] Band also said that he could name 500 different conflicts of interest involving the foundation and some that involved Bill Clinton.[123]\nUsing the Former Presidents Act Bill Clinton used taxpayer funds to supplement the pay of aides at the Clinton foundation and also used funds for IT equipment. Clinton withdrew 16 million dollars using the president act which was more than any other living president had withdrawn.[124]\nCash for access\n[edit]In 2011, Raj Fernando, who gave between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation, was appointed to the International Security Advisory Board within the State Department despite being unqualified. Fernando's appointment came at the request of Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and Hillary Clinton. Fernando resigned from the position shortly after an inquiry was made by ABC.[125]\nIn 2009, foundation aide Doug Band emailed Huma Abedin requesting a meeting with Hillary Clinton for Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who had donated $32 million to the Clinton Foundation.[126][127] Two days later, the meeting was arranged.[128]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Terms of Use – Clinton Foundation\". clintonfoundation.org.

{"custom_id": "1_extracted-3436.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: Says his bill, HB 97, would prevent the use of taxpayer dollars on abortions.\n        Subject(s): abortion,health-care\n        Speaker: matt-gaetz\n        Speaker's Job Title: State Representative\n        State Info: Florida\n        Party Affiliation: republican\n        Barely-True: 0\n        False: 1\n        Half-True: 1\n        Mostly-True: 1\n        Pants-Fire: 0\n        Context: comments before a House subcommittee\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n

With spending on health programs accounting for a substantial share of federal spending, those programs are an obvious target to achieve overall spending goals in current budget reconciliation discussions. Medicaid has been the primary focus for federal spending cuts, but cuts to Medicare and the Affordable Care Act have also been floated. Cuts to discretionary spending, which includes funding for several federal health agencies, veterans health care, and global health, are not part of the reconciliation process, but the Trump Administration has taken unilateral actions to reduce this spending. Proposed cuts to federal spending on health programs and services have trade-offs and could increase the number of people without insurance; reduce access to health care; increase consumer costs for health care; and reduce payments for hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers. The effects would be felt by people of all incomes but would likely be concentrated among people with low incomes.\nTo provide context for ongoing discussions about federal spending, this brief analyzes current support from the federal government for health programs and services, including both spending and tax subsidies (that is, forgone tax revenues from provisions that reduce tax liability for people and businesses with qualifying health-related spending). The data come from the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Treasury Department, and the Congressional Budget Office (see Methods).\nKey takeaways\n- The federal government spent $1.9 trillion on health care programs and services in fiscal year (FY) 2024, 27% of all federal outlays in that year, and collectively the largest category of federal spending.\n- Forgone tax revenues to the federal government resulting from tax subsidies for employer sponsored insurance coverage (ESI) and a portion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits together totaled $398 billion in FY 2024.\n- Over 80% of all federal support for health programs and services, including spending and tax subsidies, goes to programs that provide or subsidize health insurance coverage, with 36% going to Medicare, 25% going to Medicaid and CHIP, 17% going to employment-based health coverage, and 5% going to subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage.\n- Discretionary spending is a relatively small component of overall federal support for health programs and services. Over half (52% or $128 billion) of discretionary health spending paid for hospital and medical care for veterans. Discretionary health spending also provides funding for agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (19% of discretionary health spending) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (4%), as well as global health (4%).\nHow does the federal budget support health programs and services?\nOver one out of every four dollars in federal spending was used to pay for health programs and services in FY 2024 (Figure 1). The next largest categories are Social Security (21%), national defense (13%), and interest payments on the federal debt (13%). Combined, these four categories account for nearly three quarters of all federal spending.\nSeventy percent of government support for health programs and services comes from mandatory spending, with tax subsidies accounting for 19% and discretionary spending accounting for 11% (Figure 2). There are three ways that the federal government provides support for health programs and services: mandatory spending (outlays), discretionary spending (outlays), and tax subsidies (forgone tax revenue, also called tax expenditures or tax preferences).\n- Mandatory spending, also known as “direct spending,” is governed by regular legislative action in Congress and not determined through the annual appropriations or “spending” bills. Mandatory health spending includes nearly all Medicare spending ($839 billion), federal spending on Medicaid and CHIP ($584 billion in federal funding), and the refundable portion of the health insurance premium tax credit for coverage through the ACA Marketplaces ($111 billion in federal funding) (Appendix Table 1). (This does not include ACA premium tax credits that offset income taxes individuals owe to the federal government.)\n- Discretionary spending is funded through annual appropriations bills. The largest component of discretionary health spending ($128 billion) is for veterans’ health care. Discretionary health spending also provides funding for agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as global health, or international health assistance, much of which is channeled through the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). (For a more detailed discussion of federal funding for global health, including the potential impact of the Trump administration’s executive order pausing foreign aid, see KFF briefs, 10 Things to Know About U.S. Funding for Global Health, How Much Global Health Funding Goes Through USAID?, and The Status of President Trump’s Pause of Foreign Aid and Implications for PEPFAR and other Global Health Programs) (Appendix Table 2).\n- Tax subsidies allow businesses and individuals to reduce the amount of taxes they must pay based on the amount of money they spend on qualifying health programs and services. Most of the foregone revenue to the federal government from health-related tax subsidies (85%) comes from the exclusion of employer contributions for health insurance, which totaled $384 billion in 2024. Other notable tax subsidies that support health care include the non-refundable portion of the tax credit for coverage through the ACA Marketplaces ($14 billion), contributions to medical and health savings accounts ($14 billion), deductions for medical expenses ($13 billion), and deductions for charitable contributions to health institutions ($10 billion) (Appendix Table 3).\nWhat is the budget reconciliation process?\nCongress will likely use reconciliation to make reductions in mandatory spending to help offset some of the cost of extending the expiring tax cuts. Budget reconciliation is a special legislative process used to make changes to taxes and mandatory spending that allows the Senate to pass legislation with only 50 votes rather than the customary 60 votes. There are limits to what kinds of legislation can be passed through budget reconciliation, and it can only be used for policies that make non-incidental changes to mandatory spending or revenues. Congress initially enacted the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through reconciliation, and it is expected that the reconciliation process will be used again for an extension. That law made a set of broad but temporary tax cuts, which expire at varying years starting in 2025. The cost of extending these tax cuts has been estimated at $4.0 trillion between FY 2025 and FY 2034.\nReconciliation was originally intended to reduce budget deficits, and there are several unique rules governing the reconciliation process. The budget reconciliation process begins with the adoption of a budget resolution that is passed in both houses of Congress but not signed by the President. The budget resolution provides each Congressional committee with the dollar amount of budgetary changes that must be achieved over a specified budget “window,” which is usually either a five-year or ten-year period. These budget changes can either increase the deficit or decrease it. Budget resolutions often suggest specific policies to achieve budgetary changes, but those suggestions are not binding or enforceable. Committees of jurisdiction must meet the dollar targets in the budget resolution but have discretion as to how to meet the targets. A bill with all the details developed by committees would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president to become law.\nTo maintain privileged status in the Senate, a reconciliation bill cannot:\n- Increase the deficit in years after the budget period (though it can increase the deficit during the budget period),\n- Change Social Security spending or revenues,\n- Be “extraneous” to the budget, meaning the reconciliation bill cannot include policies that have “merely incidental” fiscal impacts, or\n- Make changes to discretionary spending.\nHow might a budget reconciliation package affect health insurance coverage?\nThere are four primary sources of health insurance coverage in the U.S.: Medicare, Medicaid, ACA Marketplaces, and employer sponsored coverage. Each of these sources of coverage could be subject to changes in a reconciliation bill. Of these four programs, Medicare accounts for the largest share (36%) of total federal support for health programs and services (including both spending and tax expenditures), followed by Medicaid and CHIP (25%), employer coverage (17%), and ACA Marketplaces (5%). Reconciliation could be used to reduce federal financial support for each of these programs because they are all funded through mandatory spending and/or financed with tax subsidies.\nExisting discussions surrounding a reconciliation package have focused on reductions in mandatory federal health spending, the largest components of which are Medicare (52% of mandatory health spending) and Medicaid (36%) (Figure 3, Appendix Table 1). A 50-page menu of options for policies that could be included in a reconciliation package is largely focused on reducing federal spending to finance an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. Medicaid is the largest source of proposed cuts, but there are also options to reduce spending on Medicare and the ACA subsidies.\nMedicaid: Medicaid covers 83 million low-income people, accounts for one fifth of health care spending in the U.S., and covers 61% of long-term care costs. Despite most adults having favorable views of Medicaid and only 13% thinking Medicaid cuts are a top priority, federal Medicaid funding ($584 billion in 2024, see Appendix Table 1) is at significant risk under Republican proposals to reduce federal spending by nearly one third over ten years. Changes to Medicaid under consideration include imposing a per capita cap on federal spending, reducing the federal government’s share of costs for the ACA expansion group, limiting provider taxes states use to help pay for their share of Medicaid costs, and imposing work requirements. Such policy changes would fundamentally alter how Medicaid financing works and large federal spending reductions would force states to make tough choices whether to raise new revenue, restrict the number of people covered, cover fewer benefits, or cut payment rates for physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers. Millions or even tens of millions of people could lose Medicaid coverage depending on how the policy was structured.\nMedicare: Medicare provides health insurance coverage to nearly 68 million older adults and younger people with long-term disabilities and accounted for just over half (52% or $839 billion) of mandatory spending on federal health programs and services in FY 2024. Despite President Trump’s campaign promises not to cut Medicare, Republican lawmakers have put several Medicare savings proposals on the table in recent budget reconciliation talks, including implementing site-neutral payment policies, making changes to Medicare payment of uncompensated care, bad debt, and other hospital payments, and reforming Medicare payment for graduate medical education, among other changes. Altogether, these specific proposals could yield around $500 billion in 10-year savings, and would have the greatest impact on hospitals, with indirect effects on patients, depending on how hospitals responded to payment reductions.\nACA Marketplaces: Healthcare.gov and State-Based Marketplaces cover over 24 million people in 2025 (about 7% of the US population), most of whom are low-income. Federal support totaled $125 billion, including direct spending and tax subsidies in FY 2024, when about 19 million people received a subsidy.\nACA Marketplace subsidies are provided through the tax system, with most subsidized enrollees receiving an advanced payment of the premium tax credit, which they reconcile when they file their taxes the following year. Because incomes can be very volatile for ACA Marketplace enrollees (many of whom work shifts, are self-employed, or gig workers), predicting one’s income a year in advance can be difficult. The ACA currently limits how much an enrollee must pay back in the tax credit if their income is below four times the poverty level. However, a Ways and Means Committee document proposes to remove repayment limits for people who receive excess tax credits.\nSince 2021, enhanced premium tax credits have lowered premium payments across all subsidized enrollees and made middle income people (over four times poverty) newly eligible for subsidies. These enhanced tax credits were originally passed as COVID relief and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, but they are set to expire at the end of 2025. If the enhanced tax credits are not renewed by Congress, out-of-pocket premium payments for enrollees are expected to increase by over 75%, though this amount will vary by income and location. The cost to renew the subsidies would be $335 billion over ten years, according to CBO projections.\nWhat health programs and services are discretionary, and subject to the annual appropriations process?\nOnly 11% of federal support for health care programs and services is discretionary spending, and over half of that amount (52%) pays for veterans’ health care (Figure 4, Appendix Table 2). In FY 2024, $128 billion in federal funding supported care for more than 7 million veterans. The next largest source of discretionary spending is the National Institutes of Health, which received $46 billion in 2024 (19% of discretionary spending). Smaller sources of federal discretionary spending include public health and social services emergency funding ($11 billion; 4%), global health ($10 billion; 4%), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($9 billion; 4%). (Global health totals presented here are outlays, which represent actual cash flows, and therefore do not match those presented in other KFF resources, such as the U.S. Global Health Budget Tracker, which highlight the budget authority totals as provided by Congress in annual appropriations and include some other funding components that are counted elsewhere in this analysis.)\nMaking changes to discretionary health spending through the appropriations process requires 60 votes in the Senate, meaning changes would require Democratic support, unless President Trump takes unilateral actions to reduce federal spending. Congress is supposed to pass appropriations bills by June 30 each year that provide funding for discretionary programs from October 1 through September 31 of the following year (the federal fiscal year). However, in most years, Congress does not pass the appropriations bills on time, and instead uses continuing resolutions to prevent lapses in federal funding for discretionary programs. The current continuing resolution funds the federal government through March 14, 2025. Extending funding for discretionary programs beyond that date will require a majority vote in the House and 60 votes in the Senate.\nIn the early weeks of President Trump’s second term in office, the administration has taken unilateral action to reduce federal funding, such as by laying off federal employees and issuing executive orders to freeze federal funding in various programs. Declining to spend appropriated funds is also known as “impoundment.” In 1974, Congress enacted the Impoundment Control Act in response to President Nixon’s attempts to refuse to spend Congressionally-appropriated funds. During the campaign, President Trump promised to “restore Impoundment Power,” and the administration characterizes the Impoundment Control Act as unconstitutional. The Trump administration also indicates that the current funding freezes are “programmatic delays” rather than deferrals. It is currently unclear the extent to which President Trump will be able to significantly reduce federal spending through these and other unilateral actions.\nThis work was supported in part by Arnold Ventures. KFF maintains full editorial control over all of its policy analysis, polling, and journalism activities.\nMethods\nThis analysis is based on data on federal outlays from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) FY 2025 President’s Budget, tax expenditures from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the tax exclusion for employment-based coverage from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Specifically, we use FY 2024 data on federal outlays from Table 25-1. Budget Authority and Outlays by Budget Function, Category, and Program, FY 2024 data on tax expenditures from Table 1. Estimates of Total Income Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2024-2034, and FY 2024 data on the tax exclusion for employment-based coverage from CBO, Health Insurance and Its Federal Subsidies: CBO and JCT’s June 2024 Baseline Projections.\nThe federal budget groups spending into roughly 20 categories called ‘budget functions,’ which are groups of activities or programs that fulfill specific purposes, such as defense, transportation, and health. This analysis focuses on non-defense health spending, which is defined to include spending in the following categories within four budget functions:\n150: International Affairs:\n151: International development and humanitarian assistance: Global health\n550: Health:\n551: Health care services\n552: Health research and training\n554: Consumer and occupational health and safety\n570: Medicare\n700: Veterans Benefits and Services\n703: Hospital and medical care for veterans\nEach category includes both mandatory and discretionary spending, where applicable.\nSpending totals in this analysis are outlays, which represent actual cash flows, rather than budget authority, which represents the amounts authorized by Congress for new obligations by federal agencies. Global health outlay totals presented here do not match those presented in other KFF resources, such as the U.S. Global Health Budget Tracker, which highlight the budget authority totals as provided by Congress in annual appropriations and include some other funding components that are counted elsewhere in this analysis. As noted above, in this analysis ‘global health’ is a category of spending within budget function 151: International development and assistance, which accounts for the majority of global health funding. Additional global health funding at NIH and CDC is included under budget function 550: Health.\nThis analysis does not include spending by the Department of Health and Human Services that falls outside of the ‘Health’ or ‘Medicare’ budget functions, which consists mainly of spending on social services and income security for children and families through the Administration for Community Living (ACL) and Administration for Children and Families (ACF), which falls within budget functions 500 (Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services) and 600 (Income Security). A separate KFF brief, How Does the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Impact Health and Health Care?, has a more complete description of these operating divisions within HHS.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Leave Without Pay Status and Insufficient Pay\nFEHB Program Handbook Table of Contents\n- Introduction\n- Cost of Insurance\n- Health Plans\n- Eligibility for Health Benefits\n- Enrollment\n- Leave Without Pay Status and Insufficient Pay\n- Termination, Conversion, and Temporary Continuation of Coverage\n- Annuitants\n- Compensationers\n- Military Service\n- Family Members\n- Children's Equity\n- Former Spouses\n- Forms and Brochures\n- Glossary\n- Table of Permissible Changes\n- Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code\n- Search the Handbook\n- Handbook Changes\nLeave Without Pay Status and Insufficient Pay\nCoverage\nContinued Coverage\nGenerally, an employee’s enrollment may continue for up to 365 days of leave without pay (LWOP) unless he/she wants it to terminate or does not respond to his/her employing office's notice about continuing coverage during a period in LWOP status.

He/she will have a 31-day extension of coverage and conversion rights.\n4-Month Rule\nThe 365 days of continued enrollment during LWOP status is not considered to be broken by any period(s) in pay status of less than 4 consecutive months. If the employee is in LWOP status and returns to pay status for less than 4 consecutive months, then returns to LWOP status, he/she does not begin a new 365-day period of continued enrollment. Instead, the second (and any other) period in LWOP status is treated as continuation of the first. If he/she is in a pay status during any part of a pay period, the entire pay period is not counted toward the 365-day limit.\nIf an employee returns to pay status for at least 4 consecutive months during which he/she is paid for at least part of each pay period, he/she is entitled to begin a new 365-day period of continued enrollment while in LWOP status.\nExample 1\nArthur is in leave without pay status on January 1, 2018; returns to pay status on July 1, 2018; returns to leave without pay status on September 1, 2018; returns to pay status on January 1, 2019; and then back to leave without pay status on March 1, 2019. Since each return to pay status was for less than 4 months, his enrollment terminates at the end of the pay period that includes May 1, 2019, the 365th day in continuous leave without pay status.\nExample 2\nFrancine is in leave without pay status and returns to work on one occasion. The period in pay status is over 4 months. She is in leave without pay status on January 1, 2017; pay status on July 1, 2017; and leave without pay status on January 1, 2018 (a new 365-day eligibility period begins).\nHer enrollment terminates at the end of the pay period that includes December 31, 2018, the 365th day in continuous leave without pay status.\nReturn to Pay Status after 365 Days in Leave without Pay Status\nIf an employee’s enrollment terminates because he/she exhausted the 365 days continuation of coverage while in LWOP, he/she must elect to enroll when he/she returns to pay status (if he/she is eligible). If the employee enrolls, and then works less than 4 months, his/her enrollment must again be terminated on the last day of his/her last pay period in pay status. He/she is not eligible for another 365-day period of continued coverage unless he/she is in pay status for at least 4 months.\nThe employee’s employing office should have a follow-up system that will trigger an enrollment termination at the end of the pay period that includes the 365th day of LWOP.\nWhen an Employee Enters Leave Without Pay or Insufficient Pay Status\nEmploying Office Notification\nEmploying offices must be able to identify through timekeeping/payroll data all employees in LWOP status and employees with insufficient pay to cover the premiums. Tracking such employees via the SF 50 is not reliable since one is not issued when an employee enters LWOP status for less than 30 days or when an employee has insufficient pay.\nHis/her employing office must give him/her a written notice as soon as it becomes aware that premium payments cannot be withheld from his/her salary because he/she is in LWOP status or his/her pay is insufficient to cover his/her premiums. The employee’s employing office may use the sample notice provided here or any other notice that adequately explains his/her options. This notice constitutes due process.\nThe notice:\n- informs him/her of his/her options regarding continuing or terminating the enrollment;\n- explains the effect of a termination;\n- explains that if he/she decides to continue coverage, he/she must agree to pay the premium directly, incur a debt, or it may give him/her the option to pre-pay premiums;\n- provides a space for him/her to continue or terminate his/her enrollment; and\n- states that if he/she does not return the notice within 31 days after receiving the notice (45 days if he/she lives overseas), his/her enrollment will automatically terminate.\nIf the employee’s employing office cannot give him/her the written notice in person, it must send the notice by first class mail. Electronic mail cannot be used to give the written notice because the employee may not be at his/her desk to receive it. His/her receipt is especially important because if he/she does not timely respond, his/her coverage will be terminated.\nThe employee’s employing office must keep track of whether he/she signed and returned the notice within the required time frame. A notice that is mailed is considered to be received by him/her 5 days after the date of the notice. When he/she mails the signed form, the date of the postmark is considered to be the date the notice is returned to his/her employing office.\nSample Notice\nFEDERAL EMPLOYEES\nHEALTH BENEFITS (FEHB) OPTIONS\nWHILE IN LEAVE WITHOUT PAY\nOR INSUFFICIENT PAY STATUS\nName of Employee:\nDate:\nYou must respond within 31 days (45 days for employees residing overseas) of this notice or your FEHB enrollment will automatically terminate.\nEach pay period you are enrolled in the FEHB Program, you are responsible for payment of the employee share of the premium. When you enter leave without pay status, or your pay is insufficient to cover the premium, you must:\n- terminate the enrollment; or\n- continue the enrollment and agree to pay the premium or incur a debt or prepay premiums (optional).\nTERMINATING THE ENROLLMENT: If you elect to terminate your enrollment (or the enrollment automatically terminates), the termination will take effect at the end of the last pay period in which premiums were withheld from pay. FEHB coverage will continue at no cost to you for an additional 31 days. During the 31 days, you and your covered family members may convert to an individual contract with your insurance carrier. The termination is not considered a break in the continuous coverage necessary for continuing FEHB coverage into retirement. However, the period during which the termination is in effect does not count toward satisfying the required 5 years of continuous coverage. When you return to pay status, or at the end of the first pay period your pay becomes sufficient to cover your premium, you must reenroll within 60 days if you want FEHB coverage.\nCONTINUING THE ENROLLMENT AND AGREEING TO PAY THE PREMIUM: If you elect to continue your coverage, you must elect to pay the premiums directly or to incur a debt in the amount of the unpaid premiums, or to pre-pay premiums (optional). If you elect to pay directly, mail a check or money order payable to (name). Include on the check your name, social security number, a note that the payment is for \"FEHB premium\", and the pay period for which the payment is being made. Mail to: (address).\nIf you elect to incur a debt, or if you elect to pay directly but fail to pay the entire amount due, you will receive a notice stating the total amount due. The notice will be sent when you return to pay status, your pay becomes sufficient, or you separate from employment. By electing to continue coverage, you agree to repay the resulting debt in full and to allow the debt to be collected by withholdings from any salary payments to you from the Federal Government, up to (amount). If the amount due cannot be withheld in full from salary, it will be recovered from a lump sum payment of accrued leave, income tax refunds, amounts payable under the Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employees Retirement System, or any other source normally available for the recovery of a debt due the United States.\nIf you elect to pre-pay your premiums, the amount you prepay in advance may either be deducted from your pay or you may pay out-of-pocket.\nPlease check the appropriate space(s) below, sign, and return this notice to your employing office at: (address).\nAfter reading and understanding the above, I elect to:\n- Continue the enrollment (Check one):\n(Signature)\n(Date)\n- Terminate the enrollment\n(Signature)\n(Date)\nRefer questions to: (Name), (Telephone)\nWhen an Employee Chooses to Continue Enrollment\nIf an employee elects to continue coverage during LWOP status or insufficient pay, he/she can choose either to pay the premiums directly or to incur a debt. His/her employing office may also offer a pre-pay option.\nThe Employee Must Pay His/Her Share\nThe employee must still pay his/her share of health benefits premiums if he/she is in LWOP status for an entire pay period, or if his/her pay during a pay period doesn't cover the full amount of withholdings due, unless he/she wants the enrollment to terminate. His/her employing office must notify him/her of the choices available to him/her and provide him/her with a method to make direct premium payments.\nIf he/she elects to continue his/her enrollment but he/she doesn't make direct premium payments, the employee’s employing office must advance him/her enough pay to cover the employee share of the premiums, as explained below. See \"Employing Office Notification\" for notification requirements when he/she enters LWOP status or when his/her pay becomes insufficient to make the withholdings.\nPay-As-You-Go Option\nUnder this option, the employee pays his/her share of FEHB premiums directly to his/her employing agency while on LWOP. These payments generally will be made with after-tax monies, since there is no pay from which to make deductions.\nIf he/she chooses this option, he/she is agreeing that if he/she does not pay the premiums, he/she will be incurring a debt to his/her employing office. He/she will have to repay this amount once he/she returns to pay status. If he/she does not return to work or his/her employing office cannot recover the debt in full from his/her salary, it may recover the debt from:\n- a lump sum payment of accrued leave;\n- income tax refunds;\n- amounts payable under the Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employees Retirement System; or\n- any other source normally available for the recovery of a debt due the United States.\nCatch-up Option\nUnder the Catch-up Option, the employee agrees in advance of the LWOP period that:\n- He/she will continue FEHB coverage while on LWOP;\n- His/her employer will advance his/her share of FEHB premiums to OPM during his/her LWOP period; and\n- He/she will repay the advanced amounts when he/she returns from LWOP.\nThe repayment of the amount owed will be treated on a pre-tax basis, if it's deducted from pay and he/she participates in premium conversion at the time the deduction is made.\nIf he/she chooses to repay the amount owed to his/her agency directly out-of-pocket, his/her taxable income is not reduced.\nPrepay Option\nThe employee’s agency may (but is not required to) offer him/her the option to prepay his/her FEHB premiums from salary before he/she goes on a period of LWOP.\nThe amount of FEHB premiums he/she prepays in advance may either be deducted from his/her pay or paid directly \"out-of-pocket\" to his/her agency. Payments made \"out-of-pocket\" do not reduce his/her taxable income. The amount of FEHB premiums that he/she prepays will be treated on a pre-tax basis, if it is deducted from his/her pay and he/she participates in premium conversion.\nIRS rules limit the amount he/she may prepay on a pre-tax basis. If his/her period of LWOP will span two tax years, the amount that he/she may prepay on a pre-tax basis may not exceed the amount of FEHB premiums due for the remainder of the current tax year. If he/she wishes to prepay the amounts due for the subsequent tax year as well, the deductions must be made after-tax. He/she may also use the Pay-As-You-Go or Catch-up Options for amounts due in the subsequent tax year.\nExample\nMax participates in premium conversion and has $100 per month in FEHB premiums deducted from his pay. He will go on leave without pay for three months beginning on October 31, 2018 and opts to continue his FEHB coverage. Max uses the pre-pay option to pay the $300 in FEHB premium payments that will be due while he is on leave without pay. He will receive pre-tax treatment on $200 of his FEHB premium prepayment (the amount he will owe for November and December 2018). The remaining $100 he prepaid (the amount due for January 2019) must be given after-tax treatment.\nEmploying Office Forwards both Government and Employee Shares each Pay Period\nPublic Law 104-208 requires an employee’s employing office to forward the full FEHB premium (both Government and employee contributions) to OPM on a current basis when he/she is in LWOP status or when his/her pay is insufficient to make the withholdings. His/her employing office must advance his/her salary to cover the employee share of his/her health benefits premiums when he/she is in LWOP status and he/she does not make direct premium payments to his/her employing office, effective with the pay period beginning on or after September 30, 1996.\nRecovering Salary Advances for Paying the Employee Share of Premiums\nWhen his/her employing office advances his/her salary (the Catch-up Option) to cover the employee share of his/her health benefits premiums, he/she incurs a debt to his/her employing office for the advance payments. It can recover that amount in the same manner as pay advanced to new appointees under 5 U.S.C. 5524a(c). It can offset against his/her accrued pay, amount of retirement credit, any other amounts due him/her from the U.S. or District of Columbia Governments, or in any other method provided by law.\nThe employing office that advanced his/her salary is permanently responsible for collecting the debt and must retain his/her written notice electing to continue FEHB coverage.\nSince he/she must sign a statement agreeing that his/her debt may be withheld in full from future pay when he/she receives advance salary to cover his/her health benefits premiums, under 5 CFR 550.1102(b) his/her employing office is not required to offer him/her a hearing before it can begin its recovery of advance payments. However, his/her employing office must give him/her a notice that it intends to recover the advanced pay.\nCoordination of Debt Repayments with Retirement or Workers' Compensation\nWhen he/she applies for disability retirement or workers' compensation benefits, his/her annuity or compensation is generally payable from the day following his/her last day of pay. If he/she is eligible to continue health benefits coverage, the employee share is withheld from his/her annuity or compensation retroactive to the beginning date of the annuity or compensation payments.\nIf he/she has not made payments to his/her employing office for coverage during LWOP status (either directly or through collection of the debt), his/her employing office recovers withholdings and contributions for the period in the same way as it adjusts errors in withholdings and contributions.\nIf an employee paid his/her employing office for coverage during LWOP status and withholdings are being made from his/her annuity or compensation benefits for the same period, his/her employing office must refund these amounts to him/her to avoid double payments covering the same period. His/her employing office makes the refund in the same way that it adjusts errors. In retirement cases, his/her employing office must refund the amount it received from him/her for periods after his/her last day in pay because these amounts are withheld from his/her annuity.\nWhen his/her annuity doesn't begin on the day following his/her last day of pay, the employee’s employing office will not refund payments he/she made for time in LWOP status until it receives OPM's notice that his/her disability retirement application was approved. This may happen when he/she doesn't meet the requirements for an annuity on the day after his/her last day of pay (e.g., he/she is receiving a disability annuity under CSRS and he/she doesn't complete 5 years of service until a later date). If his/her employing office isn't able to determine if withholdings from his/her annuity will cover all periods of LWOP status after the last day of pay, it may request that OPM verify the correct period to be covered by the refund. Its request may be attached to his/her health benefits documents when they are sent to OPM with the final Individual Retirement Record (SF 2806 for CSRS or SF 3100 for FERS).\nIn workers' compensation cases, his/her employing office may request that the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs verify the dates that health benefits premiums have been withheld from his/her compensation benefits before it will refund any amounts he/she paid to it.\nWhen he/she is a retiring employee and is indebted to his/her employing office for advanced pay to cover the employee share of his/her health benefits premium for a period that he/she wasn't entitled to annuity or compensation benefits, the debt may be recovered by offset from his/her annuity. See chapter 4 of the CSRS and FERS Handbook for Payroll and Personnel Offices.\nWhen an Employee Allows His/Her Enrollment to Terminate\nHis/her enrollment will terminate if he/she:\n- does not sign and return the written notice within 31 days of receiving the notice (45 days if he/she lives overseas), or\n- returns the signed notice, electing to terminate his/her enrollment.\nIn either event, the employee’s employing office must terminate his/her enrollment on the Notice of Change in Health Benefits Enrollment (SF 2810). It must note in the remarks section: \"Employee (did not timely return written notice) (elected to terminate the enrollment) during a period of (LWOP status) (insufficient pay).\" The file copy of the notice (or if he/she elected to terminate his/her enrollment, his/her signed notice) should be attached to the SF 2810 and filed in the permanent side of the Official Personnel Folder and included in his/her eOPF. His/her employing office will distribute copies of the SF 2810 to his/her payroll office and carrier.\nThe effective date of his/her enrollment termination is retroactive to the end of the last pay period that premiums were withheld from his/her pay.\nEffect of Termination\nIf an employee decides not to continue his/her coverage, his/her enrollment is terminated, not canceled. This means that he/she is entitled to a 31-day extension of coverage and conversion privilege. He/she does not have to wait until the next Open Season to reenroll.\nA termination is not considered a break in the continuous enrollment necessary for continuing coverage during retirement.\nAn employee is not eligible for temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) when his/her coverage terminates during LWOP status or insufficient pay. TCC is only available when his/her coverage terminates because of separation from employment.\nRetroactive Reinstatement of Terminated Coverage\nIf he/she couldn't return the notice within the required time frame for reasons beyond his/her control, the employee may request his/her employing office to reinstate his/her coverage. An employee must file the request within 30 calendar days from the date he/she was given notification of the termination by his/her employing office. He/she must describe the circumstances that prevented him/her from returning the notice on a timely basis and include the signed written notice electing to continue coverage and agreeing to either pay the premium directly or incur a debt.\nIf an employee’s employing office decides to reinstate his/her enrollment, it completes parts A, D, and H of the Notice of Change in Health Benefits Enrollment (SF 2810); notes in the remarks section \"Employee reinstated\"; and distributes copies of the SF 2810 to his/her payroll office and carrier.\nIf the employee’s employing office rejects his/her reinstatement request, it must notify him/her of its decision and provide information about his/her reconsideration rights.\nWhen An Employee may Enroll after Termination\nIf an employee terminated his/her enrollment while he/she was in LWOP status, he/she may reenroll within 60 days of returning to pay status in a position in which he/she is eligible for FEHB coverage.\nIf an employee terminated his/her enrollment while his/her pay was insufficient, he/she may reenroll within 60 days after the end of the first pay period his/her pay becomes sufficient to cover the premium.\nHis/her reenrollment takes effect the first day of the first pay period after his/her employing office receives his/her request to reenroll and that follows a pay period in which he/she was in pay status for any part of that pay period.\nHe/she can reenroll in any plan or option available to him/her. He/she is not restricted to enrolling into the same plan and option he/she had when his/her coverage terminated.\nIf an employee does not reenroll during the 60-day time period, he/she must wait for an Open Season to enroll, unless another qualifying event occurs before the next Open Season. This would be considered a break in the continuous coverage necessary for continuing coverage into retirement.\nEmployees Erroneously Allowed to Continue FEHB Coverage beyond 365 Days of Leave without Pay\nIn the case of an employee who was on LWOP, elected to incur-a debt for the employee portion of the premium, and whose enrollment was erroneously allowed to continue for an extended period of time beyond the 365th day, the premium debt incurred by the employee for coverage may be significant.\nTherefore, in cases where an enrollee on LWOP has been enrolled longer than 365 days, the agency must allow the employee to choose whether to:\n- Terminate the enrollment prospectively effective on the last day of the pay period in which the error was discovered and keep the coverage during the erroneous enrollment period (meaning, if the employee incurred a debt, the employee owes the employee share of the premiums to the agency for that period, but the employee is entitled to full benefits during the period of the erroneous enrollment; or\n- Terminate the enrollment retroactively back to the date the FEHB enrollment should have terminated (meaning the employee owes no premiums for the erroneous enrollment period, but was not covered during that period and is responsible for any claims paid). This allows the employee to avoid a large premium debt due to the agency's error if few or no services were used.\nSpecial Circumstances\nStudent Trainees\nIf he/she is a student trainee with a career or career-conditional appointment, his/her enrollment continues during periods of LWOP status as long as he/she is participating in the Student Career Experience Program (5 CFR 213.3202(b)). If he/she wants to continue his/her enrollment during periods LWOP status, he/she must continue to pay the employee share of the premiums.\nActive Duty Military Service\nUnder the Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), if he/she enters active duty military service for more than 30 days, he/she may continue his/her health benefits enrollment for up to 24 months, unless he/she elects to have his/her enrollment terminated before he/she enters active duty. (He/she is considered to be on military furlough for health benefits purposes.) During the first 365 days in LWOP status, he/she is required to pay only the employee share of the premium and he/she may postpone payment. After the first 365 days, he/she must pay both the employee and Government shares plus a 2 percent administrative charge directly to his/her employing office on a current basis. His/her eligibility under USERRA ends 24 months after his/her absence for active duty military service begins or 90 days after his/her service ends, whichever is earlier.\nWhile Receiving Compensation\nAn employee’s enrollment may continue when he/she receives compensation under the Federal Employees' Compensation law for the first 365 days while in LWOP status. After that period, he/she must meet the same participation requirements as for continuing an enrollment after retirement. OWCP, not his/her employing office, is responsible for determining his/her eligibility.\nPart-time Employees\nIf he/she is a part-time career employee who receives a prorated Government contribution, during periods of LWOP status he/she must pay the same health benefits premiums that are withheld from his/her pay while he/she is in pay status in his/her regularly scheduled tour of duty.\nTemporary Appointments\nIf he/she is a temporary employee (and is not expected to work 130 hours per month for at least 90 days) enrolled for FEHB coverage, during periods of LWOP status he/she must continue to pay both the employee and Government shares of the premiums.\nIf he/she accepts a temporary position while his/her enrollment is continuing during LWOP status, his/her enrollment must be transferred to the employing office for his/her temporary position.\nIf he/she returns to LWOP status when his/her temporary employment ends, the enrollment must be transferred back to his/her original employing office. The original employing office must determine the remaining length of time he/she is entitled to continued coverage while in LWOP status. If he/she is no longer being carried as an employee in his/her original position when his/her temporary position expires, his/her enrollment must be terminated.\nThe two employing offices involved must coordinate these actions so that withholdings and contributions are made timely. The employing office that first becomes aware of the situation must contact the other employing office and arrange for transfer of the enrollment, if appropriate.\nFamily and Medical Leave\nUnder the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 (Public Law 103-3), an employee is entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain medical and family needs. See Pay and Leave and 5 CFR Part 630 for information about family and medical leave.\nFMLA leave usually runs concurrently with the 365 day period of coverage during LWOP status allowed under the FEHB law. In these cases the regular rules for coverage during periods in LWOP status apply. If he/she is granted leave under FMLA that exceeds the 365 days of continued coverage allowed under the FEHB law, he/she must pay his/her share of premiums directly to his/her employing office on a current basis during the period that exceeds 365 days. (This may happen if he/she has already used an extensive amount of LWOP before him/her invokes his/her rights under FMLA).\nIf his/her coverage is terminated for nonpayment during FMLA leave, he/she may reenroll when he/she returns to pay and duty status.\nAppointments to Employee Organizations\nIf an employee goes into LWOP status to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an employee organization, he/she may elect to continue health benefits coverage within 60 days from the start of the LWOP status.\nThe health benefits coverage continues for the length of the appointment, even if the LWOP status lasts longer than 365 days. He/she must pay to his/her employing office the full cost of the health plan premiums. There is no Government contribution. He/she must pay his/her premiums to the employing office before, during, or within three months after the end of each pay period. He/she will be eligible for premium conversion if the employee organization adopts the OPM premium conversion plan.\nHis/her employing office must keep him/her informed of all developments that affect health benefits. It must also adjust his/her share of the premium and the agency contributions when appropriate.\nHis/her coverage will terminate if he/she does not pay his/her premiums within this time frame, subject to the 31-day extension of coverage and conversion right. His/her coverage cannot resume until he/she enters into pay and duty status in Federal service. Exception: his/her coverage will be restored retroactively if his/her employing office finds that he/she was unable to make the premium payments for reasons beyond his/her control and he/she makes the payments at the first opportunity.\nAppointment to State or Local Governments or Institutions of Higher Education, Indian Tribal Government, or other Organizations\nIf an employee goes into LWOP status while assigned to a State or local government, institution of higher education, Indian tribal government, or certain other organizations specified in 5 CFR Part 334 , he/she is entitled to continue health benefits coverage for the length of the assignment, even if the LWOP status lasts longer than 365 days.\nHe/she must elect to continue his/her health benefits coverage and pay the employee share of his/her premiums to his/her employing office before, during, or within three months after the end of each pay period. His/her employing office must continue to pay its contributions as long as he/she makes his/her payments.\nAn employee’s employing office must keep him/her informed of all developments that affect health benefits. It must also adjust his/her share of the premium and the agency contributions when appropriate. His/her coverage will terminate if he/she does not pay his/her premiums, subject to the 31-day extension of coverage and conversion right. His/her coverage cannot resume until he/she enters into pay and duty status in Federal service. Exception: his/her coverage will be restored retroactively if the employing office finds that he/she was unable to make the premium payments for reasons beyond his/her control and he/she makes the payments at the first opportunity.\nIf he/she elects to be covered under a State or local government's health benefits program that OPM determines to be similar to the FEHB Program, he/she is not entitled to continue coverage under the FEHB Program. Send the request for OPM's determination to Office of Personnel Management, Healthcare and Insurance, P.O. Box 436, Washington, D.C. 20044.\nTransfers to International Organizations\nAn employee may continue health benefits coverage if he/she is transferred to an international organization as provided in 5 U.S.C. 3582. He/she must elect to continue health benefits coverage and pay the employee share of his/her premiums to the employing office before, during, or within three months after the end of each pay period. His/her employing office must continue to pay its contributions as long as he/she makes his/her payments. He/she will be eligible for premium conversion if the organization agrees to adopt the OPM premium conversion plan.\nHis/her employing office must keep him/her informed of all developments that affect health benefits. It must also adjust his/her share of the premium and the agency contributions when appropriate.\nAn employee’s coverage will terminate if he/she does not pay premiums, subject to the 31-day extension of coverage and conversion right. His/her coverage cannot resume until he/she enters into pay and duty status in Federal service. Exception: his/her coverage will be restored retroactively if his/her employing office finds that he/she was unable to make the premium payments for reasons beyond his/her control and he/she makes the payments at the first opportunity.\nIf he/she does not elect to continue the health benefits enrollment, he/she is not considered to be a Federal employee for health benefits purposes while employed by the international organization.\nRegulations governing these transfers are in 5 CFR part 352.\nIf An Employee Pays His/Her FEHB Premiums over less than 12 Months\nIf his/her annual salary is normally paid over a period of less than 12 months (such as a teacher on a 10-month contract), his/her employing office will prorate the annual health benefits contributions over the number of salary installments during the year, so that he/she doesn't pay any additional premiums during the expected nonpay period. If he/she enters a LWOP status during his/her normal working period, he/she must pay premiums for that period the same as other employees in LWOP status.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Explaining Health Care Reform: Questions About Health Insurance Subsidies\nHealth insurance is expensive and can be difficult to afford for people with lower or moderate incomes. In response, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides sliding-scale subsidies that lower premiums and insurers offer plans with reduced out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for eligible individuals.\nThis brief provides an overview of the financial assistance provided under the ACA for people purchasing coverage on their own through health insurance Marketplaces (also called exchanges).\nHealth Insurance Marketplace Subsidies\nThere are two types of financial assistance available to Marketplace enrollees. The first type, called the premium tax credit, reduces enrollees’ monthly payments for insurance coverage. The second type of financial assistance, the cost sharing reduction (CSR), reduces enrollees’ deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs when they go to the doctor or have a hospital stay. To receive either type of financial assistance, qualifying individuals and families must enroll in a plan offered through a health insurance Marketplace.\nPremium Tax Credit\nPremium tax credits can be applied to Marketplace plans in any of four “metal” levels of coverage: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Bronze plans tend to have the lowest premiums but have the highest deductibles and other cost sharing, leaving the enrollee to pay more out-of-pocket when they receive covered health care services, while platinum plans have the highest premiums but very low out-of-pocket costs.\nAlso offered on the Marketplace are catastrophic health plans with even lower premiums and higher cost sharing compared to bronze plans. Catastrophic plans are generally only available to individuals younger than 30, and premium tax credits cannot be applied to these plans.\nWho is eligible for the premium tax credit?\nTo receive a premium tax credit for 2025 coverage, a Marketplace enrollee must meet the following criteria:\n- Have a household income at least equal to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which for the 2025 benefit year will be determined based on 2024 poverty guidelines (Table 1).\n- Not have access to an employer plan (including a family member’s employer) that both meets minimum value and is considered affordable. For 2025, the threshold that determines if an employer plan is affordable is if the premium is equal to or less than 9.02 percent of one’s household income.\n- Not be eligible for coverage through Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n- Have U.S. citizenship or proof of legal residency. (Lawfully present immigrants whose household income is below 100 percent FPL can also be eligible for tax subsidies through the Marketplace if they meet all other eligibility requirements.)\n- If married, must file taxes jointly.\nIncome: For the purposes of the premium tax credit, household income is defined as the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) of the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents who are required to file a tax return. The MAGI calculation includes income sources such as wages, salary, foreign income, interest, dividends, and Social Security.\nEmployer coverage: Employer coverage is considered affordable if the required premium contribution is no more than 9.02 percent of household income in 2025. The Marketplace will look at both the required employee contribution for self-only and (if applicable) for family coverage. If the required employee contribution for self-only coverage is affordable, but the required employee contribution is more than 9.02 percent of household income for family coverage, the dependents can purchase subsidized exchange coverage while the employee stays on employer coverage.\nThe employer’s coverage must also meet a minimum value standard that requires the plan to provide substantial coverage for physician services and for inpatient hospital care with an actuarial value of at least 60 percent (meaning the plan pays for an average of at least 60 percent of all enrollees’ combined health spending, similar to a bronze plan). The plan must also have an annual OOP limit on cost sharing of no more than $9,200 for self-only coverage and $18,400 for family coverage in 2025.\nPeople who are offered employer-sponsored coverage that fails to meet either the affordability threshold or minimum value requirements can qualify for Marketplace subsidies if they meet the other criteria listed above.\nEligibility for Medicaid: In states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, adults earning up to 138 percent FPL are generally eligible for Medicaid and not for Marketplace subsidies. In states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, adults with income as low as 100 percent FPL can qualify for Marketplace subsidies. However, those with incomes lower than 100 percent FPL are generally not eligible for tax credits or Medicaid unless they meet other state eligibility criteria. KFF estimates that 1.5 million Americans living in non-expansion states fall into this coverage gap.\nCertain lawfully present immigrants are exempt from the rule restricting tax credit eligibility for adults below the poverty level. Other federal rules restrict Medicaid eligibility for lawfully present immigrants, other than pregnant women, refugees, and asylees, until they have resided in the U.S. for at least five years. Immigrants who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid but have not yet completed their five-year waiting period may instead qualify for tax credits through the Marketplace. If an individual in this circumstance has an income below 100 percent of poverty, for the purposes of tax credit eligibility, his or her income will be treated as though it is equal to the poverty level. Exceptions are also made for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, who became newly eligible for Marketplace coverage after the Biden-Harris administration passed new regulations in May 2024 expanding the definition of lawfully present to include DACA recipients. Immigrants who are not lawfully present are ineligible to enroll in health insurance through the Marketplace, receive tax credits through the Marketplaces, or enroll in non-emergency Medicaid and CHIP.\nWhat amount of premium tax credit is available?\nThe premium tax credit limits an individual’s contribution toward the premium of the “benchmark” plan, the second-lowest cost silver plan in their Marketplace. This “required individual contribution” is set on a sliding income scale. In 2025, for individuals with income up to 150 percent FPL, the required contribution is zero, while at an income of 400 percent FPL or above, the required contribution is 8.5 percent of household income (Table 2). Individuals making above 400 percent FPL whose required contribution for a benchmark silver premium is greater than the actual cost of a benchmark silver plan relative to their household income would be ineligible for subsidies.\nThese contribution amounts were set by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and later temporarily extended by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Prior to the ARPA, the required contribution percentages ranged from about two percent of household income for people with poverty level income to nearly 10 percent of household income for people with income from 300 to 400 percent FPL. In addition, prior to the ARPA, people with incomes above 400 percent FPL were not eligible for premium tax credits.\nThe amount of tax credit is calculated by subtracting the individual’s required contribution from the actual cost of the “benchmark” plan. So, for example, if the benchmark plan costs $6,000 annually, the required contribution for someone with an income of 150 percent FPL ($22,590 in 2025) is zero, resulting in an annual premium tax credit of $6,000. If that same person’s income equals 250 percent FPL (or $37,650 in 2025), the individual contribution is four percent of $37,650, or $1,506 per year, resulting in an annual premium tax credit of $4,494.\nThe premium tax credit can then be applied toward any other plan sold through the Marketplace (except Catastrophic coverage). The amount of the tax credit remains the same, so a person who chooses to purchase a plan that is more expensive than the benchmark plan will have to pay the difference in cost. Conversely, if a person chooses a less expensive plan, such as the lowest-cost silver plan or a bronze plan, the tax credit will cover a greater share of that plan’s premium, and possibly even cover the entire cost, leaving the consumer with a zero-premium plan. When the tax credit exceeds the cost of a plan, it lowers the premium to zero and any remaining tax credit amount is unused.\nFor certain components of a Marketplace plan premium, the premium tax credit will not apply. First, the tax credit cannot be applied to the portion of a person’s premium attributable to covered benefits that are not essential health benefits (EHB). For example, a plan may offer adult dental benefits, which are not currently included in the definition of EHB. In that case, the person would have to pay the portion of the premium attributable to adult dental benefits without financial assistance. In addition, the ACA prohibits applying premium tax credits to the portion of premiums covering “non-Hyde” abortion benefits. Marketplace plans that cover abortion are required to charge a separate $1 monthly premium to cover the cost of this benefit; this means a consumer who is otherwise eligible for a fully subsidized, zero-premium policy would still need to pay $1 per month for a policy that covers abortion benefits. Finally, if the person smokes cigarettes and is charged a higher premium for smoking, the premium tax credit is not applied to the portion of the premium that is the tobacco surcharge.\nHow do people receive the premium tax credit?\nTo receive the premium tax credit, people must apply for coverage through the Marketplace and provide information about their age, address, household size, citizenship status, and estimated income for the coming year. After submitting the application, people will receive a determination letting them know the amount of premium tax credit for which they qualify. The consumer then has the option to have the tax credit paid in advance, claim it later when they file their tax return, or some combination of the two options.\nThe advanced premium tax credit (APTC) option allows consumers to have 1/12 of their tax credit paid directly to their Marketplace plan insurer each month, reducing the monthly amount the consumer owes. However, because the APTC eligibility determination is based on estimated income, the enrollee is required to reconcile their APTC at tax time the following year, once they know what their actual income was. For people receiving an advanced payment of the premium tax credit in 2025, the reconciliation would occur when they file their 2025 tax return in 2026. If the consumer overestimated their income when they applied, they can receive the unclaimed premium tax credit as a refundable tax credit when they file. If the consumer underestimated their income at the time of application and excess APTC was paid on their behalf during the year, they would have to repay some or all of the excess tax credit when they file. There are maximum repayment limits which vary depending on income, shown in Table 3.\nAlternatively, people can opt to pay their entire premium costs each month and wait to receive their tax credit until they file their annual income tax return the following year, although most Marketplace participants cannot afford this option. The premium tax credit is refundable, meaning it is available to qualifying enrollees regardless of whether they otherwise owe any federal income tax. Everyone who receives an APTC in a tax year is required to file a tax return for that year in order to continue receiving financial assistance in the future. People who fail to file and reconcile for two consecutive years will be ineligible for premium tax credits the following year.\nCost Sharing Reduction\nThe second form of financial assistance available to Marketplace enrollees is a cost sharing reduction. Cost sharing reductions lower enrollees’ out-of-pocket cost due to deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance when they use covered health care services.\nWho is eligible for the cost sharing reduction?\nPeople eligible for premium tax credits and have household incomes between 100 to 250 percent of poverty are eligible for cost sharing reductions.\nHow are cost sharing reductions provided?\nUnlike the premium tax credit (which can be applied toward any metal level of coverage), cost sharing reductions (CSR) are only offered through silver plans. For eligible individuals, cost sharing reductions are applied to a silver plan, essentially making deductibles and other cost sharing under that plan more similar to that under a gold or platinum plan. Individuals with income between 100 and 250 percent FPL can continue to apply their premium tax credit to any metal level plan, but they can only receive plans with reduced cost sharing if they pick a silver-level plan.\nWhat amount of cost sharing reductions are available to people?\nCost sharing reductions are determined on a sliding scale based on income. The most generous cost sharing reductions are available for people with income between 100 and 150 percent FPL. For these enrollees, silver plans that otherwise typically have higher cost sharing are modified to be more similar to a platinum plan by substantially reducing the silver plan deductibles, copays, and other cost sharing. For example, in 2024, the average annual deductible under a silver plan was just over $5,000, while the average annual deductible under a platinum plan was $97. Silver plans with the most generous level of cost sharing reductions are sometimes called CSR 94 silver plans (with 94 percent actuarial value, which represents the average share of health spending paid by the health plan, compared to 70 percent actuarial value for a silver plan with no cost sharing reductions).\nSomewhat less generous cost sharing reductions are available for people with incomes above 150 and up to 200 percent FPL. These reduce cost sharing under silver plans to 87 percent actuarial value (CSR 87 plans). In 2024, the average annual deductible under a CSR 87 silver plan was about $700.\nFor people with incomes above 200 and up to 250 percent FPL, cost sharing reductions are available to modestly reduce deductibles and copays to 73 percent actuarial value (sometimes called CSR 73 plans). In 2024, the average annual deductible under a CSR 73 silver plan was about $4,500.\nInsurers have flexibility in how they set deductibles and copays to achieve actuarial value benchmarks set by the ACA for Marketplace plans, including CSR plans, so actual deductibles may vary from these averages.\nThe ACA also requires maximum annual out-of-pocket spending limits on cost sharing under Marketplace plans, with reduced limits for CSR plans. In 2025, the maximum OOP limit will be $9,200 ($18,400 family) for all QHPs with lower maximum OOP limits permitted under cost sharing reduction plans (Table 4).\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Barack Obama (IL);\nSen. Hillary Clinton (NY);\nFmr. Sen. John Edwards (NC);\nGov. Bill Richardson (NM);\nSen. Joseph Biden, Jr. (DE);\nRep. Dennis Kucinich (OH);\nSen. Christopher Dodd (CT);\nFmr. Sen. Mike Gravel (AK)\nMODERATOR:\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (ABC-News)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this special edition of \"This Week.\" We're back here at Drake University in Iowa for the first Democratic presidential debate in Iowa. It's been sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee. All of our guests here have been invited by the Iowa Democratic Party, and all eight Democratic candidates are here.\nThe podium order was determined by lot, but here's where they stand in Iowa, according to our latest ABC News poll.\nAt 27 percent, Illinois Senator Barack Obama. New York Senator Hillary Clinton is at 26 percent, as is former North Carolina Senator John Edwards, also at 26 percent. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson is at 11 percent. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware is at 2 percent, along with Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich, also at 2 percent. Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd is at 1 percent. And former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel, no support registered.\nCandidates, welcome.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(CROSSTALK)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Not so bad, Senator Gravel. Maybe it'll go up after today.\nI'm joined here in the questioning by David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register, and we want to cover a lot of ground today. We want to cover the economy, health care, education, and of course the war.\nBut let's start with the two questions that have really been dominating this race so far. I think Democrats across the country are struggling with these questions. It comes up in the dialogue between your campaigns.\nAnd the first one is: Is Barack Obama ready to be president, experienced enough to be president?\nAnd can Senator Clinton, Hillary Clinton, in part because of your experience, bring the country together and bring about the kind of change that all of you say the country needs?\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Biden, you stepped into this last week. You told Newsweek magazine that Senator Obama is \"not yet ready\" to be president.\nSenator Clinton, is he right?\n(LAUGHTER)\nCLINTON: Well, George, I was going to say good morning...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... and, as soon as I wake up, I'll answer your question.\n(LAUGHTER)\nYou know, I'm running on my own qualifications and experience. It's really up to the voters to make these decisions.\nAnd I'm excited because I have a campaign that is growing in support, because we do need to make big changes. And I've set big goals for my presidency. I want to have universal health care and move toward energy independence and do what we need to do in education and reform our government, and, of course, end the war in Iraq.\nSo I think we have a great group of candidates. You don't have to be against anybody. This is a great problem to have. You can choose who you're for.\nAnd I hope people will choose to be for me based on my experience, my qualifications and my plan for the future as to what I will do as president.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But, Senator Clinton, you did tell the Quad City Times that Senator Obama's views on meeting with foreign dictators are naive and irresponsible. Doesn't that imply that he's not ready for the office?\nCLINTON: Well, George, we had a specific disagreement, because I do not think that a president should give away the bargaining chip of a personal meeting with any leader, unless you know what you're going to get out of that.\nIt takes a lot of planning to move an agenda forward, particularly with our adversaries. I think the next president will face some of the most difficult international dangerous threats and challenges that any president has faced in a very long time.\nCLINTON: We're going to have to mend fences with our allies. We're going to have to deal with global warming. We're going to have to get back on the track of trying to prevent nuclear proliferation -- and so much else.\nSo I think that, when you've got that big an agenda facing you, you should not telegraph to our adversaries that you're willing to meet with them without preconditions during the first year in office.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd, you've called Senator Obama's views confusing and confused, dangerous and irresponsible. Do you think he's ready to be president?\nDODD: Well, again, I'd certainly underscore the point that Senator Clinton has made here. The point I'd make on that, when I disagreed with my colleague from Illinois, was about the issue of whether or not a speech, a prepared speech, which suggested here a hypothetical situation and a hypothetical solution here -- that raised serious issues within Pakistan.\nAs I pointed out before, the only person that separates us from a jihadist government in Pakistan with nuclear weapons is President Musharraf. And, therefore, I thought it was irresponsible to engage in that kind of a suggestion here. That's dangerous. Words mean something in campaigns.\nAnd so I think it's an important distinction to make here. We're asking Democrats across the country to choose amongst us here who is best able to lead.\nThe experience, the background, the demonstrated success in dealing with both domestic and foreign policy issues are critical questions. You're not going to have time in January of '09 to get ready for this job.\nYou've got to be ready immediately for it and bringing back the experience over the years to deal with these issues, as I have, both on the Foreign Relations Committee, dealing with every major foreign policy debate -- sitting there working with children and family issues over the last quarter of the century -- I think demonstrated a background and an experience and ability with proven success to deal with the issues...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Biden, it seems like your colleagues here don't want to reach the judgment that you've made. Why isn't Senator Obama ready?\nBIDEN: Look, I think he's a wonderful guy, to start off, number one. It was about Pakistan we were talking about. The fact of the matter is, Pakistan is the most dangerous, potentially the most dangerous country in the world. A significant minority of jihadists with nuclear weapons. We have -- and I disagree with all three of my friends -- we have a Pakistan -- we have no Pakistan policy; we have a Musharraf policy. That's a bad policy. The policy should be based upon a long-term relationship with Pakistan and stability.\nWe should be encouraging free elections. There is an overwhelming majority of moderates in that country. They should have their day. Otherwise, they're going to go underground.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator Biden, you did go beyond talking about Pakistan. You were asked: Is he ready? You said, \"I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.\"\nBIDEN: I think I stand by the statement.\nRICHARDSON: You know, I think that Senator Obama does represent change. Senator Clinton has experience. Change and experience: With me, you get both.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd you know, my point -- and, here, we're going to need change to become energy independent. We're going to need experience to deal with foreign leaders, as I have.\nRICHARDSON: You know, it's interesting. You talk about the dispute between the two senators over dictators that -- should we; should we not meet?\nI've met them already, most of them. All my life I've been a diplomat, trying to bring people together. This campaign is...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Is Senator Obama ready?\nGRAVEL: Senator Obama represents change and he's an enormously fresh voice in the political process.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Your answer?\n(LAUGHTER)\nOBAMA: Well, you know, to prepare for this debate, I rode in the bumper cars at the state fair, and...\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut, George, I don't actually see that much difference or people criticizing me on the substance of my positions. I think that there's been some political maneuvering taking place over the last couple of weeks.\nI do think that there's a substantive difference between myself and Senator Clinton when it comes to meeting with our adversaries. I think that strong countries and strong presidents meet and talk with our adversaries. We shouldn't be afraid to do so.\nWe've tried the other way. It didn't work.\nI think that, if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and we've exhausted all other options, we should take him out before he plans to kill another 3,000 Americans. I think that's common sense.\nSo there's one other thing that I believe.\nOBAMA: And that is that we should describe for the American people both in presidential debates, as well as president, what our foreign policy is and what we're going to do. We shouldn't have strategic ambiguity with the American people when it comes to describing how we're going to deal with the most serious national security issues that we face.\nAnd it is my belief that we need a fundamental change if we're going to dig ourselves out of the hole that George Bush has placed us in. And that's going to require the kind of aggressive diplomacy -- preparation, yes, but aggressive diplomacy, the personal diplomacy of the next president -- to transform how the world sees us. That us ultimately going to make us safer.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Clinton, one of the areas that -- one of the things that Senator Obama just talked about is that he thinks that some of your differences aren't as great as people have said.\nYour campaign criticized Senator Obama after he made a comment ruling out the use of nuclear weapons against Al Qaida, yet, here's what you said last year when asked about Bush administration reports that they might use tactical nuclear weapons in Iran. Take a look.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: No option should be off the table, but I would certainly take nuclear weapons off the table. And this administration has been very willing to talk about using nuclear weapons in a way we haven't seen since the dawn of the nuclear age. I think that's a terrible mistake.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So Senator Obama rules out using them against Al Qaida. You rule out using them against Iran. What's the principal difference there?\nCLINTON: Well, George, you've got to put it into context. I was asked specifically about what was, very clearly, an effort by the Bush-Cheney administration to drum up support for military action against Iran.\nCLINTON: Combine that with their continuing effort to try to get what are called bunker-buster bombs, nuclear bombs that could penetrate into the earth to go after deeply buried nuclear sites.\nAnd I thought it was very important. This was not a hypothetical, this was a brushback against this administration which has been reckless and provocative -- to America's damage, in my opinion.\nSo I think there's a big difference, and I think it's a difference that really goes to the heart of whether we should be using hypotheticals. I mean, one thing that I agree with is we shouldn't use hypotheticals. You know, words do matter.\nAnd this campaign, just like every other things that happens in the United States, is looked at and followed with very great interest. And, you know, Pakistan is on a knife's edge. It is easily, unfortunately, a target for the jihadists. And, therefore, you've got to be very careful about what it is you say with respect to Pakistan.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you accept that distinction?\nOBAMA: There was no difference. It is not hypothetical that Al Qaida has established base camps in the hills between Afghanistan and Pakistan. That was acknowledged in the national intelligence estimates. And every foreign policy understands that.\nNo military expert would advise that we use nuclear weapons to deal with them, but we do have to deal with that problem.\nAnd so, this is part of what I think Americans get frustrated about in politics, where we have gamesmanship and we manufacture issues and controversies instead of talking about the serious problem that we have, a problem that this administration has made worse and that our invasion of Iraq has made worse, but a problem that the next president is going to have to deal with. And the American people deserve to hear what we're going to do.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Edwards, is there a difference or not?\nEDWARDS: How about a little hope and optimism? Where did it go? You know, I listened to this debate, and this is what I hear.\nEDWARDS: First of all, I think we have a clear path for America and for our friends on Iran, which Senator Clinton just spoke about. And that path is to work with our friends in Europe to put up a choice between carrots and sticks on the table for the Iranian people. Because there is a division between the Iranian people and their radical leader, Ahmadinejad. There's no question about that. We can take advantage of that. We should take advantage of that, drive a wedge between the two.\nIn the case of Pakistan, the truth of the matter is: Musharraf is not a wonderful leader, but he provides some stability in Pakistan. And there is a great risk, if he's overthrown, about a radical government taking over.\nThey have a nuclear weapon. They're in constant tension with India, which also has a nuclear weapon, over Kashmir. I mean, it's a dangerous, volatile situation.\nBut the last thing I want to say about this is it's not shocking that -- first of all, I think Senator Obama is entitled to express his view. And it's not shocking that people who have been in Washington a long time criticize him when he comes along and expresses his view.\nEDWARDS: I think his view adds something to this debate, and I think he ought to be able to express it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But is he right or wrong?\nEDWARDS: On which issue?\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The one I just asked, was there a difference between Senator Clinton and Senator Obama on this issue.\nEDWARDS: I personally think, and I would as president, not talk about hypotheticals in nuclear weapons. I think that's not a healthy thing to do. I think what it does for the president of the United States is it effectively limits your options. And I do not want to limit my options, and I don't want to talk about hypothetical use of nuclear weapons.\nI would add to that that I think what the president of the United States should actually do, beyond stopping bunker-buster nuclear weapons, which this administration's moving forward with, is what America should do and what I would do as president, is to actually lead an international effort over time to eliminate nuclear weapons from the planet. That's the way to make the planet more secure.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Gravel, then Governor Richardson.\nGRAVEL: That's very good but, under the last 25 years, this nation has continued to expand its nuclear capability.\nGRAVEL: I would say that, essentially, they're all wrong on this. They're, sort of, leading up -- the administration is cooking the books, the intelligence on Iran.\nAnd we're playing into this. And I'm very concerned. I would hope the Congress would pass a resolution saying, under no circumstances do you invade Iran.\nStop and think. What have we -- what have they done to us?\nThey're giving us intelligence, saying that they're destroying our troops. Well, what about our trying to destabilize their government, which we've been doing for the last 25 years?\nWe destroyed their democracy. And now we're looking at them as an excuse to expand the war, which is the plan the neocons had back in 1997. And so, when Democrats buy into the problem of Iran, they just help Vice President Cheney, who should be committed, with his recent statements...\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nRICHARDSON: You know, when a president talks about foreign policy, a president has to be clear.\nRICHARDSON: And this talk about hypotheticals, I think, is what's gotten us in trouble. Here's what I would do on nuclear weapons: I wouldn't, as an American president, use nuclear weapons first. However, you can never take the military option off the table.\nThe key is that in our foreign policy today, this administration has used the military option preemption. It should be diplomacy first, negotiation, build international support for our goals, find ways that America can get allies in our fight against terrorism, against nuclear proliferation.\nWe should have a treaty on fissionable material, loose nuclear weapons -- that's even more dangerous today than nuclear weapons.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me turn now to the second question I raised, the topic question about Senator Clinton. And outgoing White House counsel Karl Rove opined on that this week. He was on Rush Limbaugh. Here's what he had to say.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nKARL ROVE: There is no front-runner who has entered the primary season with negatives as high as she has in the history of modern polling. She's going into the general election with, depending on what poll you're looking at, in the high forties on the negative side and just below that on the positive side.\nAnd there's nobody who's ever won the presidency who started out in that kind of position.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now, Senator Obama, I know you're loathe to agree with Karl Rove on just about anything.\n(LAUGHTER)\nOBAMA: I am.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But the Associated Press this week wrote an article. They talked to 40 Democratic activists and officeholders across the country. It led to the series of headlines across the country: \"Democrats worry Clinton may weigh down lesser candidates\"; \"Democrats worry Clinton may hurt the rest of the ticket.\"\nAre they right to be worried?\nOBAMA: You know, I think Senator Clinton and all the candidates up here are capable. And whoever wins the general election I believe -- whoever wins the primary I believe is going to win the general election.\nBut I think there's something bigger at stake here. We all agree that the last six years have been disastrous for America, both at home and abroad. But the fact is that the big challenges we face, whether it's health care or a bold energy strategy or schools that aren't producing young people that can compete on the global stage, those are problems that pre-date the Bush administration.\nOBAMA: They're not just Republican problems. They're Democratic problems and American problems. And, you know, I think a winning strategy is not crafted by a political calculus that divides the country into red states and blue states.\nSo what I've been trying to express in my campaign is that if you believe that part of the problem is the failed politics of Washington and the conventional thinking in Washington, if you're tired of the backbiting and the score keeping and the special-interest-driven politics of Washington, if you want somebody who can bring the country together around a common purpose and rally us around a common destiny, then I'm your guy.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But when you say that, are you saying that Senator Clinton is part of the failed politics of Washington, or not?\nOBAMA: What I'm suggesting is that we're going to need somebody who can break out of the political patterns that we've been in over the last 20 years. And part of that is the notion that half the country's on one side; the other half's on the other.\nOBAMA: You maybe have a few people in Iowa or a few people in Ohio and Florida who we're all battling over, and afterwards, we can't govern.\nAnd what I'm interested in is not only winning the election, but also providing relief to people who don't have health care, making sure that we're tackling climate change in a serious way. And I think that's going to require building a new majority, getting new people involved in the process, and I wouldn't be running if I didn't believe that I was the person best equipped to do that.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So the answer is yes?\nOBAMA: The answer is: I would not be running if I did not believe that I was the best person to do this.\nEDWARDS: Well, let me just say -- I have a slightly different view. Here's what I believe. I think we were out of power in the Congress for 13 years. In November of 2006, the Democrats took over the Congress again. I think there was a reason for that. Because the Democrats in November of 2006 stood for change.\nAmerica wants change in the most serious way. And if we become the party of status quo in 2008, that's a loser.\nEDWARDS: If we...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that is the fundamental question, though.\nEDWARDS: ... maintain -- but let me finish. If we maintain the momentum of change, yes, we will win again in 2008. I think that's the question. And the real question for Democratic caucus-goers and voters across this country is, \"Who's most likely to bring about change?\"\nHere's what I believe: I don't believe you can change this country without taking on very entrenched interests in Washington, including lobbyists, that stand between us and the change America needs. And I don't believe you can do it by sitting at a table, negotiating with them and trying to bring them together.\nThese people will never give away their power voluntarily. We have to take their power away from them. This is what I've been doing my whole life, and that is why I believe I am the candidate who can bring change to this country.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And you're seeing that Senator Clinton is not?\nEDWARDS: Listen, Senator Clinton, both as first lady and as a United States senator, has done a terrific job. She's been in Washington a long time. I've asked -- Senator, I have never taken money from Washington lobbyists.\nEDWARDS: Senator Obama is not taking it in this campaign. I applaud him for that. And I've said: Why don't we all make an absolutely clear statement that we are the Democratic Party; we're the party of the people; we are not the party of Washington insiders?\nAnd we can say it clearly and unequivocally, by saying we will never take another dime from a Washington lobbyist.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI've asked the other candidates to join me in that.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd at least, until now, Senator Clinton's not done it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Clinton, will you do it?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't think Karl Rove's going to endorse me. That becomes more and more obvious. But I find it interesting he's so obsessed with me. And I think the reason is because...\n(LAUGHTER)\n... we know how to win. I mean, you know, I have been fighting against these people for longer than anybody else up here. I've taken them on and we've beaten them.\nAnd I'm very excited about my campaign. I had 18 wonderful years in Arkansas. I'll be there tomorrow, where the governor will be endorsing me.\nI've had wonderful experiences in upstate New York, where many of the people who voted for me had never voted for a Democrat before.\nAnd you know, the idea that you're going to escape the Republican attack machine and not have high negatives by the time they're through with you, I think, is just missing what's been going on in American politics for the last 20 years.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCLINTON: And the reason -- the reason why we're going to win is because we have a better vision for America, we know how to bring about change, and I know how to beat them.\nSo, yes, they're going to be driving up negatives and making all these comments. Doesn't matter to me a bit.\nWhat's important is what's happening in the lives of the American people. And the kind of change I'm interested in is how we help more Americans get to the American dream.\nAnd that means universal health care. That means new jobs for the middle class with rising incomes. It means what I have fought for, for more than 35 years.\nAnd I am proud of my campaign, and it's getting better every single day.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Clinton...\nCLINTON: So I'm looking forward to going up against whoever the Republicans nominate.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about this point, though, that Senator Edwards raises? He says the fact that you're taking money from lobbyists symbolizes that you're part of the status quo, part of the failed politics of Washington.\nCLINTON: Well, George, I believe we have to change Washington. I've stood up against the special interests, I've taken them on. I took them on, on health care. I took them on and voted against a lot of their special interest legislation, like class action reform, which is just really another way of lining the pockets of big business.\nCLINTON: I've taken them on on so many different fronts.\nBut there is this artificial distinction that people are trying to make. Don't take money from lobbyists, but take money from the people who employ and hire lobbyists and give them their marching orders. Those are the people that are really going to be pushing back.\nI think we can do a much better job if we say we have got to move toward public financing, get the money out of American politics, because it's the people who employ the lobbyists who are behind all the money in American politics.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI think what we need to do is go after a better agenda of reform.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Back to you, Senator. She says the distinction is artificial.\nEDWARDS: The distinction is not artificial. But first of all, Senator Clinton did a terrific job in the 1990s trying to do something about health care in this country. She deserves credit for that.\nBut here's what I believe: The reason we don't have universal health care in America today is because of the insurance industry, the drug companies and their lobbyists.\nEDWARDS: It's that simple.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd, George, we need -- and there's a fundamental question here: Whether you believe, whether voters believe the way we're going to have universal health care is to deal with those people, to make a deal with them. I don't. I don't think it'll work.\nI don't think we should be taking their money. I think we ought to make it absolutely clear that we're not going to take money from insurance company lobbyists or drug company lobbyists, these big corporate lobbies, that actually killed -- killed -- the health care effort that was done in the 1990s.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd, I want to ask you...\nEDWARDS: Let me finish. Let me finish.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to ask...\nEDWARDS: The question is -- the question is: What will bring change? What will bring change?\nMy belief is you have to take these people on and beat them to bring change. You can't sit at a table and negotiate with them.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd, will you accept the challenge from Senator Edwards?\nDODD: Well, look, first of all, I find this sort of situational ethics here. I mean, over the years, the fine people taking money from one group or the other were sort of competing with each other as to which group is a good or bad group here.\nThe fact of the matter is: I've been supporting, for years and years, public financing of federal offices.\nDODD: That's what needed in this country.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWe're never going to solve this problem, unless we move in that direction.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd, certainly, it's not only the money you take, but what are you doing? How are you casting your votes? Where were you on bankruptcy? Where were you on dealing with the estate tax reform?\nThose critical questions that affect people in this country are very important considerations. But public financing is where we need to be.\nAnd let me point out as well, George, here, if I may as well here, it's about getting this job done. We don't elect a king or a queen or a dictator in November, we elect a president. The margins are thin. No one political party is going to write all of this. It takes leadership that knows how to bring people together.\nIt's what I've done for 26 years. When I wrote the Family and Medical Leave Act -- three presidents, two vetoes to go through in seven years. But I brought Republicans to the table around a Democratic principle.\nThe idea we're going to go down there, any one of us is elected president, and write all the rules and decide what it's going to be is not the case. It's not how it happens.\nWe need leadership that's been tested and proven to bring success between the political parties to get the job done for America.\nDODD: That's the kind of leadership that's needed in 2008.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Kucinich, is this debate over lobbyists real or artificial?\nKUCINICH: Actually, George, this debate is insufficient, because you're really not including all the candidates here...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Just called on you.\nKUCINICH: ... and polarize -- you're trying to polarize people out of the race. Now, let me talk about an issue that concerns the people of Iowa, and that is health care. The Iowa AF of L-CIO, two days ago endorsed H.R. 676, a not-for-profit health care system, a bill that I'm the coauthor of.\nAnd Senator Edwards said that, you know, we're talking about challenging the insurance companies. Well, actually, every other health care plan represented by everyone else here on stage keeps the private insurers in charge.\nMatter of fact, according to an article in the Nation, Humana, which participates in a hedge fund called Fortress, is in a position to just clean up with the privatization of Medicare.\nI'm the only one up here who challenges this system of premiums, co-pays and deductibles.\nKUCINICH: So let's give the American people a real choice, not a conditioned choice, based on polls, but a choice that's based on their practical aspirations for health care for their families, for a not- for-profit system.\nWe have to break the hold, which the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies have on health care.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to move on to another issue we're hearing about a lot from the voters from Iowa in the poll. More voters wrote in questions for us on the issue of Iraq than any other single issue.\nThey all wanted to know what your plans were to get out of Iraq, and to get out safely from Iraq.\nSenator Biden, you've put up an ad, just this morning, here in Iowa, on that subject. Here's part of it.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBIDEN: We were leaving Baghdad and it was pitch black. As I climbed into the C-130, strapped into the middle of that cargo bay was a flag-draped coffin. It turned that cargo bay into a cathedral. And all I could think of was the parents waiting at the other end.\nWe must end this war in a way that doesn't require us to send their grandchild back.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me turn the questioning, now, to David Yepsen.\nYEPSEN: Governor Richardson, is that ad right, that Senator Biden is the only candidate with a plan?\nRICHARDSON: No. I have a plan. Here's my plan: My plan is that, to end this war, we have to get all the troops out, all of them. Our kids are dying. Our troops have become targets.\nMy plan has diplomacy, a tri-partite entity within Iraq, a reconciliation among the three groups. I would have a division of oil revenues. I'd have an all-Muslim peacekeeping force, headed by the United Nations, a donor conference.\nBut none of this peace and peace building can begin until all of our troops are out.\nWe have different positions here. I believe that if you leave any residual forces, then none of the peace that we are trying to bring can happen. And it's important.\nRICHARDSON: And it's critically important that we do this with an orderly timetable. But what is key is all of the troops out -- no residual forces. You leave residual forces behind, the peace cannot begin.\nYEPSEN: You're right. We do want to have a debate.\nSenator Biden, what's your reaction to that?\nBIDEN: My reaction is that it's time to start to level with the American people. This administration hasn't been doing it for seven years. We should.\nThe fact of the matter is, there's much more at stake in our security in the region depending on how we leave Iraq.\nIf we leave Iraq and we leave it in chaos, there'll be regional war. The regional war will engulf us for a generation. It'll bring in the Shia, it'll bring in the Saudis, it'll bring in the Iranians, it'll bring in the Turks.\nI laid out a plan a year ago with Leslie Gelb. It said that what we should do is separate the parties, give them breathing room in order to establish some stability.\nI notice most of my colleagues are coming around to that plan these days. But the bottom line is it's going to one full year, if you argued tomorrow to get every single troop out.\nAnd when you begin to take the troops out, what are you going to do with the 4,000 or 5,000 civilians that are left inside the Green Zone?\nYEPSEN: Governor, quickly?\nRICHARDSON: Well, Anthony Cordesman from ABC News, a distinguished military expert -- many generals agree with me that we can complete this withdrawal within six to eight months.\nLet me give you an example. Today in the Iraq war, through Kuwait over a three-month period, we have moved 250,000 of our troops. We would move them through roads in Kuwait. We would move them in roads through Turkey. We can do this negotiating with the Turks.\nYEPSEN: Senator Clinton, help a Democrat out. You've got the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee saying one thing, and I've got a former U.N. ambassador saying something else. Who's right?\nCLINTON: Well, let me tell you what I would do, because I think that we need to do three things. We need to begin moving our troops out, and we have to do it carefully and responsibly. Joe is absolutely right.\nMoving troops out cannot happen without careful planning, which is why I've been pushing the Pentagon to make sure they're actually planning because they've been resistant to doing so.\nSecondly, we need much stronger pressure on the Iraqi government than this administration has been willing to bring.\nCLINTON: And I would certainly condition any aid of any kind on their actually making the political decisions that they have been reluctant and unwilling to do so far. There is no...\n(CROSSTALK)\nCLINTON: There is no military solution. Everybody agrees with that. And the political solutions seem to be out of the grasp of the Iraqis, because they're still jockeying for power.\nAnd then of course, we would have, as Bill suggested, an intensive regional and international diplomatic effort.\nBut I think that, you know, this is going to be very dangerous and very difficult. A lot of people don't like to hear that.\nBut, if you look at how we would have to take our troops out, plus the equipment, which we would not want to leave, plus what we do with the people in the Green Zone, plus what we do with the Iraqis who sided with us -- thousands of them -- plus, what we do with the more than 100,000 American contractors who are there -- this is a massive, complicated undertaking.\nCLINTON: And we do have to do it as carefully and responsibly as possible, and I think my plan takes all of that into account.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So does that mean that Governor Richardson just is wrong when he says that all troops, all troops, except for protection of the embassy, can be out by the end of the year?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that based on the conversations I've had with military planners and outside experts, Joe is right, that this is going to take a while. People say you can move maybe a brigade to two brigades a month.\nIt is so important that we not oversell this. We've got to move them as quickly as possible, but you also have to move out the equipment. There has been no indication that the Turks are willing to let us move out. They wouldn't let us move in.\nThat means we go back down through the south. And if you remember, when we were supposedly on the road to liberation, we were attacked by Shiites back in March and April of 2003. So this...\nGRAVEL: George, could I respond?\nCLINTON: ... is not going to be easy or safe.\nCLINTON: And we've got to be very careful about how we do it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get everybody in on this question. First let me just find out if anybody agrees with Governor Richardson on this question.\nSenator Gravel, do you agree with Governor Richardson?\nGRAVEL: No, I disagree with him. And I disagree with Joe Biden. And I disagree with Hillary.\n(LAUGHTER)\nWell, stop and think here. Why do we think that we can rule that country?\nThis is American imperialism you're hearing up here. And that hasn't worked and it will never work.\nWho are we to tell the Iraqis -- we're trying to make them the fall guy, not our stupid mistakes. Oh, it's the Iraqis won't stand up.\nI'll tell you what. Pull everybody out and turn to the Iranians, who helped us defeat the Taliban initially. It was the Iranians. So if we don't bring the Iranians to help us, or the Syrians, or Saudi Arabia, of course it's going to be a disaster.\nThey have more at stake in that area of the world than we do.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you would pull out. Senator Edwards...\n(CROSSTALK)\nGRAVEL: ... would do is pull back and use diplomacy.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you.\nSenator Edwards, can all the troops be out, except for protection of the embassy, by December?\nEDWARDS: I couldn't hear the...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: By December. By Governor Richardson's plan.\nEDWARDS: I think it would be hard to do by December. I think we can responsibly and in a very orderly way bring our troops out over the next nine or 10 months.\nBut one thing I want to say, as I'm listening -- I know you're trying to create a fight up here, I understand that, but any...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to find out what you all think.\nEDWARDS: ... any -- any Democratic president will end this war. That's what we know.\nAnd secondly...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... the differences between us, whether it's Senator Clinton or Senator Dodd or Governor Richardson or Senator Biden, all of whom I have enormous respect for, the differences between all of us are very small compared to the differences between us and the Republican candidates, who the best I can tell are George Bush on steroids.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThey're going to keep this war going as long as it can possibly go. That's exactly what's going to happen.\nRICHARDSON: With all due respect, I'd like to ask Senator Clinton, Senator Biden, you're saying you're going to leave residual troops behind. I don't know, is it 25,000, 50,000, 75,000?\nRICHARDSON: You're also saying, I think, Senator Clinton, that all combat troops should come out. Now, for the non-combat troops, how are they going to protect themselves?\nMy point is that by taking them all out, all our troops are no longer targets. And then Al Qaida and the insurgents, both that see American troops as their prey, will now turn on each other.\nAnd so, what we are now to do is force this negotiation, this reconciliation process, which I believe Joe Biden's plan has potential, a possible partition. Or division of oil revenues. An all-Muslim peacekeeping force. Get Turkey, get Jordan, get Egypt. Talk to Iran and Syria. Bring them in.\nWhat is needed here is stability, and I think that all of these countries can be invested in a plan for stability. Nobody wants a civil war or a sectarian conflict -- and by the way, it's already happening. And what we need is stability.\nRICHARDSON: But you can't have stability without any American troop there. That's my point. So I'd like my question answered. What is the purpose of the residual force?\nBIDEN: I'll answer that, if I may.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And I also want Senator Clinton and Senator Obama on that question. You go first.\nBIDEN: Look, the fundamental disagreement I have with my colleagues up here is that they seem to cling to the fundamental strategic mistake that everyone on both sides plays to, and that is that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the Iraqis get together, have a unity government in Baghdad that pulls the country together.\nThat will not happen, George. It will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here.\nSecondly, the point is that you have to separate the parties to give them breathing room. You have to get them out of each other's face, just like we did in the Balkans, the same exact thing.\nThird piece I'd make to you is that there's much more at stake here. This war must end, but there's much more at stake as to how it ends.\nBIDEN: If it ends with this country splintering, we will have, for a generation, our grandchildren, engaged in a regional war that will be consequential far beyond -- far beyond Iraq.\nAmerica's security interests are at stake. You will see Turkey move in and take on the Kurds. You will see the Iranians move in and pick sides among the Shias. You will see Saudi Arabia and Syria continue to fund the most radical extreme elements of the jihadis.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Biden, I think everyone agrees, everyone is afraid of the things you just outlined right there.\nBut this is a fundamental difference with respect, Senator Edwards.\nGovernor Richardson says that every troop except for protection of the embassy can be out by December, and if they're not, then the conflict is going to continue.\nBIDEN: They cannot be out by December...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Wait...\nBIDEN: Look, we've had 20,000 Western troops in a place where there's more sectarian violence -- from Vlad the Impaler to Milosevic -- than in 5,000 years of history in Iraq.\nBIDEN: And what did we do? We separated the parties. There's not one single troop has been killed, not one, in the last 10 years. There is peace. There is a circumstance where the genocide is ended. They're becoming part of Europe.\nEvery troop must be out over time if there is not a political agreement.\nRICHARDSON: Joe, answer my question.\nBIDEN: But if there is a political -- yes.\nRICHARDSON: Why do you leave residual troops behind? Maybe if it's six months or eight months...\nBIDEN: I leave residual troops behind because you're going to have a minimum of 4,000 civilians there. The military will tell my friend here it takes...\n(CROSSTALK)\nBIDEN: ... it takes -- no, no, I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that. You need combat troops, and you need them to protect...\n(CROSSTALK)\nBIDEN: ... the 5,000 troops that are there.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama, where do you come down on this question? How many troops are going to have to stay for how long?\nOBAMA: I think Joe is right on the issue of how long this is going to take. This is not going to be a simple operation. I think Senator Clinton laid out some of the challenges that were out there. I agree with John Edwards that all of us on this stage I think would begin to bring this war to an end.\nI think we also can all agree that it's going to be messy, that there are no good options.\nOBAMA: There are only bad options and worse options, and we're going to have to exercise judgment in terms of how we execute this. But the thing I wish had happened was that all the people on this stage had asked these questions before they authorized us getting in.\nAnd I make that point...\n(APPLAUSE)\n... because earlier on we were talking about the issue of experience. Nobody had more experience than Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney and many of the people on this stage that authorized this war.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd it indicates how we get into trouble when we engage in the sort of conventional thinking that has become the habit in Washington. Now, that judgment is going to have to be exercised moving forward, and I actually think that Joe's point about partition might be the right one.\nThe only area I disagree with -- with Joe on that -- is that it is important for the Iraqis to arrive at the conclusion that partition makes sense, as opposed to it being imposed by the United States government.\nOBAMA: Because I think if that happens, if the perception is that we are carving up the country as opposed to the parties arriving at a decision, then that could antagonize some of the factions and actually make the problem worse.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama, you've invoked the idea of conventional thinking a few times here, yet when I listen to what you're saying about what you would do in Iraq, now it sounds very similar to what Senator Clinton would do.\nIs there any difference between you and Senator Clinton on what you would do right now?\nOBAMA: My sense is that what all of us need to do over the next 16, 18 months is focus on putting pressure on Republicans to stop giving George Bush a blank check, because if we have to wait for 16, 18 months, that's going to make the situation that much worse.\nIf we have not began a withdrawal by the time I'm sworn into office, then the next task is to call together the Joint Chief of Staff and to give them the mission, which is to begin an orderly, phased withdrawal, so that we can begin the diplomacy that Joe and Bill and others are talking about.\nBut look, as I said, there are no good options at this point.\nOBAMA: This is the equivalent of George Bush drove the bus into the ditch, and there are only so many ways you can pull that bus out of the ditch. That doesn't mean you don't fire the driver, and it doesn't mean that you don't evaluate how we avoid getting in these same problems in the future.\n(APPLAUSE)\nKUCINICH: We can talk about George Bush driving a bus into a ditch, but let's not forget there was a Democratic Senate in charge that OK'ed the war. And those senators who are up on this stage helped to authorize that war and they have to take responsibility for that.\nLikewise, they have to take responsibility for funding the war. You say you're opposed to it, but you keep funding it.\nI think the American people have to look at that and ask, What's going on?\nNow, I've had a plan on the table for four years to get out of Iraq, and Democrats in Congress have to stand up to the pledge they made in 2006 to take us out of that war. They have to tell the president now, \"Bring the troops home. We're not going to give you any more money for that war.\"\nKUCINICH: The American people have a right to expect that we're going to take a new direction. But, frankly, you cannot expect a new direction with the same kind of thinking that took us into war in the first place.\nWe cannot leave more troops there. We cannot privatize Iraq's oil. We cannot partition that country and expect there's going to be peace.\nWe need a president who understands that, one who's been right from the start, and one who has shown the judgment, the wisdom, and the maturity to take the right stand at the time that it counted most, when the American people needed someone to stand up. And I'm the one who did that.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me move on now. We've got a question -- we've got an e-mail question from Seth Ford of South Jordan, Utah.\nAnd he said, \"My question is to understand each candidates' view of a personal God. Do they believe that, through the power of prayer, disasters like Hurricane Katrina or the Minnesota bridge collapse could have been prevented or lessened?\"\nI'd like each of you to answer it. Let me start with you, Senator Clinton.\nCLINTON: You know, it's hard to hear you up here, George. I apologize.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We'll keep it up, and I'll just repeat it again.\nMy question is to understand each candidate's view of a personal God. Do they believe that, through the power of prayer, disasters like Hurricane Katrina or the Minnesota bridge collapse could've been prevented or lessened?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't pretend to understand the wisdom and the power of God. I do believe in prayer. And I have relied on prayer consistently throughout my life. You know, I like to say that, if I had not been a praying person before I got to the White House, after having been there for just a few days I would've become one.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSo I am very dependent on my faith, and prayer is a big part of that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd?\nDODD: I agree with what Hillary has just said here. I would not want to try and second-guess the lord's intentions here and to assume that part of his great plan includes some of these actions we see, for a variety of different reasons, here.\nDODD: And the power of prayer I think is important to all of us. I hope it is, recognizing that we don't do anything without His approval.\nEDWARDS: I have prayed most of my life; pray daily now. He's enormously important to me.\nBut the answer to the question is: No, I don't -- I prayed before my 16-year-old son died; I prayed before Elizabeth was diagnosed with cancer. I think there are some things that are beyond our control.\nAnd I think it is enormously important to look to God -- and, in my case, Christ -- for guidance and for wisdom. But I don't think you can prevent bad things from happening through prayer.\nGRAVEL: What I believe in is love. And love implements courage. And courage permits us all to apply the virtues that are important in life.\nAnd so you can pray -- I was always persuaded or struck by the fact that many people who pray are the ones who want to go to war, who want to kill fellow human beings. That disturbs me.\nI think what we need is more love between one human being and another human being.\nGRAVEL: And then we'll find the courage to dispel many of the problems we have in governance. The answer to governance is not up here on the dais. The answer is with the American people and the people of Iowa. That's where the answer is.\nAnd I have a proposal, and it's the only one that talks of change. The change is to empower the American people with a national initiative.\nAnd my colleagues, with all due respect, don't even understand the principle of the people having the power.\n(APPLAUSE)\nRICHARDSON: I pray. I'm a Roman Catholic. My sense of social justice, I believe, comes from being a Roman Catholic.\nBut, in my judgment, prayer is personal. And how I pray and how any American prays, for what reason, is their own decision. And it should be respected.\nAnd so, in my view, I think it's important that we have faith, that we have values, but if I'm president, I'm not going to wear my religion on my sleeve and impose it on anybody.\nBIDEN: George, my mom has an expression. She says that, \"God sends no cross you're unable to bear.\"\nBIDEN: The time to pray is to pray whether or not you're told, as John was and I was, that my wife and daughter are dead, to have the courage to be able to bear the cross.\nThe time to pray is to pray not only before, but pray that you have the courage, pray that God can give you the strength to deal with what everyone is faced with in their life, serious crosses, serious crosses to bear.\nThe answer to the gentleman's question is, no, all the prayer in the world will not stop a hurricane. But prayer will give you the courage to be able to respond to the devastation that's caused in your life and with others to deal with the devastation.\nOBAMA: I believe in the power of prayer. And part of what I believe in is that, through prayer, not only can we strengthen ourselves in adversity, but that we can also find the empathy and the compassion and the will to deal with the problems that we do control.\nOBAMA: Most of the issues that we're debating here today are ones that we have the power to change.\nWe don't have the power to prevent illness in all cases, but we do have the power to make sure that every child gets a regular checkup and isn't going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.\nWe may not have the power to prevent a hurricane, but we do have the power to make sure that the levees are properly reinforced and we've got a sound emergency plan.\nAnd so, part of what I pray for is the strength and the wisdom to be able to act on those things that I can control. And that's what I think has been lacking sometimes in our government.\nOBAMA: We've got to express those values through our government, not just through our religious institutions.\n(APPLAUSE)\nKUCINICH: George, I've been standing here for the last 45 minutes praying to God you were going to call on me. And my...\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd I come from a spiritual insight which says that...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You have a direct pipeline, Congressman.\n(LAUGHTER)\nKUCINICH: I come from a spiritual insight which says that we have to have faith but also have good works.\nKUCINICH: So when we think of the scriptures, Isaiah making justice the measuring line; Matthew 25, \"whatever you do for the least of our brethren\"; where the biblical injunction, \"make peace with your brother\" -- all of these things relate to my philosophy.\nNow, the founders meant to have separation of church and state, but they never meant America to be separate from spiritual values. As president, I'll bring strong spiritual values into the White House, and I'll bring values that value peace, social and economic justice, values that remember where I came from.\nThank you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you, Congressman.\nLet's turn to another question from here in Iowa. It's on the subject of agriculture, close to a lot of Iowans' hearts. And it comes from Mr. Blaine Baincon (ph).\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nQUESTION: I'm Blaine Baincon (ph), a farmer from Massena, Iowa. I was wondering how you plan to help small farms as the large companies take over more farms.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd?\nDODD: Well, George, listen, one of the areas we've got to have is a Justice Department that starts dealing with some of the antitrust issues in our country. It just doesn't cover agriculture, but also a variety of other things, including media concentration here.\nThe ability today of just concentrating power, allowing so much to be accumulated, is making it very difficult for the kind of independents and smaller interests, including small business and small farmers, to be able to grow and to have the kind of economic success they'd like to have.\nDODD: Rural America needs additional attention, as well, here. I'm a great believer that we need to extend the broadband access to our rural communities.\nOpportunity shouldn't require that you leave rural America to come to opportunity, but opportunity ought to be able to come to rural America, by taking advantage of the technologies we have today, so that people can stay on these farms and stay in rural parts of our country, including Iowa.\nYEPSEN: Senator Edwards, you have criticized U.S. trade agreements. How do you fashion trade agreements to protect American workers, without in turn creating trade wars that hurt American farmers, Iowa farmers and what they're trying to sell abroad?\nEDWARDS: Well, the first thing I'd say is I think we've had a failed trade policy in America.\nThe question seems to have been, on past trade agreements like NAFTA: Is this trade agreement good for the profits of big multinational corporations?\nAnd the answer to those questions on the trade agreements we've entered into has been yes.\nEDWARDS: It's been very good for multinational corporations. It has not been good for American workers. And in an Edwards administration, the first question I will ask in every single trade agreement we're considering is: Is this good for middle-class working families in America? That would be the threshold question.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd, second, we will have real labor and environmental standards in the text of the agreement, which I will enforce. We will have protections against currency manipulation, which the Chinese are engaged in right now.\nAnd then finally -- finally -- we will end these loopholes that actually create tax incentives for companies to leave America and take jobs somewhere else.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThat needs to be brought to an end.\nYEPSEN: Senator Clinton, how do you come down on that question of how do you protect American jobs in America without setting up a situation where other countries discriminate against the things we're trying to export, particularly agricultural exports?\nCLINTON: Well, I agree with everything John said, with the additional point that your question really raised, and that is that we do export a lot of agricultural goods, many of that through trade agreements.\nAnd I think we've got to do three things. Number one, we have to have more focus on family farms, like the gentleman who asked the question. We have 34,000 family farms, largely, in New York. I've tried to become a real advocate for them because they get lost in the shuffle.\nSo I've created ways of working with them. I've issued a report about how much difficulty they have getting their products across the border into Canada.\nSo we've got to do more to make sure trade agreements are not only good for the exporting of agricultural products from great, big agribusiness, but also for small farmers.\nCLINTON: Secondly, we've got to do more, as Chris said, to build up the agricultural and rural areas of our country. And thirdly, you know, trade needs to become a win-win.\nPeople ask me, am I a free trader or a fair trader? I want to be a smart, pro-American trader. And that means we look for ways to maximize the impact of what we're trying to export and quit being taken advantage of by other countries.\nYEPSEN: Senator Obama, how do you balance -- how do you protect jobs without hurting farmers?\nOBAMA: Well, I think that many of the recommendations that have been made are the right ones. There's one other thing, though, that we've got to talk about. And that is that our Congress subsidizes these big megafarms and hurts family farmers oftentimes in the process.\nAnd we've got to, I think, cap those subsidies so that we don't have continued concentration of agriculture in the hands of a few large agribusiness interests. But, on the trade issue generally, we're not going to suddenly cordon off America from the world.\nOBAMA: Globalization is here, and I don't think Americans are afraid to compete. And we have the goods and the services and the skills and the innovation to compete anywhere in the world.\nBut what we've got to make absolutely certain of is that, in that competition, we are hard bargainers.\nYou know, I'm always struck by the Bush administration touting that this is the MBA president and they're such great businessmen, and they get taken to the cleaners in a lot of these trade agreements.\nAnd we've got to have somebody who's negotiating on behalf of workers and family farmers right here in Iowa, as opposed to someplace else.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Richardson, we have 20 seconds left until a commercial.\nDo you agree with Senator Obama's position that we should cap the subsidies to farms?\nRICHARDSON: I want to find a way to make sure that the big agribusiness interests don't hurt the small farmer, the family farmer.\nWhat we also need to do is to promote conservation. We need to promote, besides subsidy reform, renewable fuels and technology.\nOur farm policy, if we have renewable fuel...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You're going to get cut off by a commercial.\n(CROSSTALK)\nRICHARDSON: ... enormous exports, trade, jobs.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You have no idea what's been going on behind me in the last 30 seconds, but welcome back to \"This Week.\" We're continuing this Democratic debate here in Iowa.\nAnd I want to go to a question that came in over e-mail. It was from Robert Malzarek (ph) of Montgomery, Alabama.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nQUESTION: This question is for all the candidates.\nUnlike many others, I think that candidates may tell the truth, just not the whole truth and nothing but the truth. For example, when advocating a position or action, candidates downplay or simply ignore the likely negative side effects.\nCan you name a major issue where you didn't tell the whole truth and describe what you left out?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Gravel?\nGRAVEL: Yes, I can tell one issue that they're not living up to. My colleagues have all said that they want public financing...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about you, though, Senator?\n(CROSSTALK)\nGRAVEL: Well, no, I'm part of it, and I'm telling the truth.\nThey can do this right now. There's nothing -- and I asked for a pledge from all of them to immediately obey the law we have on the books to use public financing.\nThey can store their money, their millions, for the general election. But right now, in the primaries, why can't they say what they promised and they said they're for? Otherwise, it means there's a little hypocrisy abroad here.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Biden, what's your answer to that question?\nBIDEN: In my public life, there hasn't been a time I haven't said what I thought.\nI'm sure there's times in my whole life I haven't said everything I've thought, and many times that I've said too much of what I did think.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut my problem isn't saying what I think. My problem is saying too much about what I think.\nI honestly can't think of an issue in the United States Congress where I haven't straightforwardly said why I was voting, why I was voting that way, and I said it straight up.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Kucinich, you?\nKUCINICH: My entire life I've been saying things that other people were afraid to say, and I've been consistently proven right. So this is what I do.\nAnd in the White House, I'll let the American people know exactly what's going on, our path to peace, to not-for-profit health care, to education for all. That's the kind president that the American people want, straight from the shoulder.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama?\nOBAMA: I think there are a number of issues where there are going to be some choices we've got to make and some sacrifices involved. I'll give you one specific example, and that's on energy. All of us on this stage have talked about global warming and how it is a moral imperative for us to do something about this, to ensure that we're passing on a livable planet to our children and our grandchildren.\nThere will be some costs involved. It's not -- we can't do it on the cheap. There are some things that we can do to conserve energy, but all of those steps are going to require a little bit of hardship and a little bit of pinching, and that's something that we don't have enough of a discussion about.\nI've tried to. I went to Detroit, and in front of a bunch of auto makers, I said we've got to raise fuel efficiency standards on cars. And the silence was deafening in the room.\nBut those are the kinds of choices, I think, that the next president is going to have to advance and have an honest conversation with the American people about.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Edwards?\nEDWARDS: Wasn't the question whether there's ever been anything that we didn't say?\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That's what I'm asking you, the question -- right.\nEDWARDS: That's what I thought it was.\nI think, in my case, that would be true about my vote on the war in Iraq.\nEDWARDS: I was wrong to vote for this war. But, beyond that, I had huge internal conflict at the time about giving George Bush this authority.\nAnd I did talk about -- as all these other candidates have just said, I did talk about the things that persuaded me to cast the vote. But what I didn't express was the huge conflict I had, because I did not trust George Bush.\nIt turns out I was right not to have trusted him, and I cast the wrong vote. But that's the one time, and probably the single biggest time that I can think of.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I, too, regret giving George Bush the authority that he misused and abused. It was a very difficult decision, and I tried to weigh it as carefully as possible, talking to a lot of different people and being assured, both publicly and privately, by President Bush and the people close to him that they would use the authority to go in and get inspectors and try to find out if there were weapons of mass destruction and pursue diplomacy.\nSo, you know, looking back on it, I wouldn't have voted that way again, certainly, because obviously President Bush had no intention of doing what he said he was going to do. And obviously for me that is a great regret.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But did you tell the whole truth when discussing it?\nCLINTON: Well, as I saw it, yes, you know, similar to John. You know, when the president of the United States says, as he said publicly, and then as people around him said privately over and over again, \"We're going to use this authority to get inspectors back in, \"We're going to go to the United Nations,\" you know, at some point, you do have to make that evaluation.\nAnd I thought that, based on what he had said and what we were talking about at the time in the Congress, that that would be an appropriate approach.\nKUCINICH: Were you tricked?\nCLINTON: I would never have diverted our attention to Iraq, and I never would have pursued this war. I think that has been a terrible mistake for our country.\nKUCINICH: Were you tricked, Senator Clinton?\nRICHARDSON: You know, I think the question was about past regrets and mistakes. I'm making, at this rate, about one mistake a week.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd, you know, I make a lot of misstatements. I'm not the scripted candidate. But I think when the chips are down, when the time comes to get hostages out from Saddam Hussein or persuade the North Koreans to reduce their nuclear arsenal, or bring back the remains of American servicemen, I perform.\nBut the reality is, what the American people want is a president who says, \"I will follow the Constitution of the United States; I will not go to war unless the Congress authorizes me to go to war.\"\nRICHARDSON: And we're going to get rid of those blemishes that America has, like Guantanamo, like eavesdropping on our citizens, like policies of torture, like returning habeas corpus.\nI think if we simply say that we are in an America of checks and balances, where the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches have an equal role, that we're honoring the principles of freedom, where America stands.\nThen that's what that enormous confidence that people will have in our country will come back.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd, where didn't you tell the whole truth?\nDODD: Well, I'll tell you one issue that I wish I had done more on, recently. And, I think, maybe one of the worst votes cast in the Congress, maybe in the last 20 years, was last fall, on the Military Commissions Act, in which we allowed the abandonment of habeas corpus, returning to torture, and abandoning the Geneva Convention.\nI thought about filibustering that bill, and I didn't do it. I regret that deeply. I can't think of a worse vote we cast, to walk away from the Constitution of the United States.\n(APPLAUSE)\nAnd I'm committed, on January 20, to bring that...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd, thank you. Let me turn, now, to an issue that hasn't been discussed enough in these debates so far. It's the issue of education. And, for that, let me bring David Yepsen back.\nYEPSEN: Senator Dodd, should more effective -- I'm going to ask you about so-called performance-based pay. Should more effective teachers be paid less than effective ones?\nDODD: I wouldn't use that approach. What I've suggested here -- this is a huge issue here. We've got to reexamine our whole education process, from beginning to the top here, and I'm a believer that we need to have fundamental reform of No Child Left Behind, and start measuring growth, not abandoning schools that aren't doing well, and providing far less rigid criteria when it comes to highly qualified teachers.\nWhere I would like to go here is see that we apply additional resources to teachers who will go into the tougher schools in rural or urban America, where they need better teachers coming in, and provide some additional incentives for them, including pay and including the criteria that they have to meet to do so.\nBut I'm not in favor necessarily of giving more preference for a teacher that's performing somewhat better. Measuring that I think is the wrong direction we're going in.\nDODD: Taking snapshots of schools and teachers and students is not measuring how we're doing here. We need a far better approach on No Child Left Behind. I'm offering those ideas. The idea of discriminating one group of teachers against another in that regard, I think is a huge mistake and I'd oppose it.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYEPSEN: Senator Obama, performance-based pay. How would you do that without alienating the teacher's unions?\nOBAMA: Well, I've had a lot of discussions with teachers all throughout Iowa. And they feel betrayed and frustrated by No Child Left Behind. And Chris is right: We shouldn't reauthorize it without changing it fundamentally.\nWe left the money behind for No Child Left Behind, and so there are school districts all across the state and all across the country that are having a difficult time implementing No Child Left Behind. And teachers are extraordinarily frustrated about how their performance is assessed.\nAnd not just their own performance, but the school's performance generally. So they're teaching to the tests all the time. What I have said is that we should be able to get buy-in from teachers in terms of how to measure progress.\nOBAMA: Every teacher I think wants to succeed. And if we give them a pathway to professional development, where we're creating master teachers, they are helping with apprenticeships for young new teachers, they are doing more work, they are involved in a variety of other activities, that are really adding value to the schools, then we should be able to give them more money for it.\nBut we should only do it if the teachers themselves have some buy-in in terms of how they're measured. They can't be judged simply on standardized tests that don't take into account whether children are prepared before they get to school or not, which is also one of the reasons why we've got to put more money into early childhood education.\n(APPLAUSE)\nYEPSEN: Senator Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I have long supported incentive pay for school wide performance. You know, what we're trying to do is to change the culture within schools and to provide the resources, the training and the support that teachers need to do the job they do want to do.\nAnd particularly focusing on kids who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, I think you have to start with preschool, even before pre-kindergarten.\nCLINTON: I've advocated universal pre-kindergarten. I think you have to start even earlier to try to help the family be the best school and teaching opportunity for their own children.\nYou have to reform No Child Left Behind. We're going to try to do that and begin to make it much more in line with the reality of teaching.\nBut I think that we've got to have a real conversation with our teachers, our students and our parents, because basically you can walk in a classroom today and it looks very much like the classroom I walked into, you know, 50 years ago.\nAnd we have changed as a nation. We don't live and work the same way. But we act as though our schools are somehow off limits to trying to bring technology and other changes to them.\nYEPSEN: Governor Richardson?\nRICHARDSON: Well, you asked the question, are we for merit pay for teachers? No, I'm not for it. But what we need to do is pay our teachers better. They are disrespected.\n(APPLAUSE)\nRICHARDSON: I have proposed a minimum wage for our teachers, $40,000 per year.\nI also have a one-point plan, like I do on Iraq, on No Child Left Behind: Scrap it. It's a mess; it's a disaster.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWhat I would also do is have -- you know, we are 29th in the world in math and science. We need to have 100,000 new math and science teachers. We have to be number one again.\nI would have preschool for every child. I would have full-day kindergarten. I'd revise our high school curriculums -- science, math, languages, civics, and an arts-in-the-schools programs to unlock our kids...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to...\nRICHARDSON: ... when they -- science and math...\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to move on to health care now. It sounds like -- and let me just sum this up -- no one on the stage is for merit pay for teachers, specifically.\n(UNKNOWN): I am.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You are? OK, thank you.\n(UNKNOWN): Well, and, George, I...\nGRAVEL: Can I expand upon that since I've said I'm for merit pay?\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Go for it.\nGRAVEL: Don't leave me hanging.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK.\nGRAVEL: No, stop and think: They're all talking business as usual, politics as usual.\nThis country, we're so proud. We think we're number one.\nGRAVEL: He just gave you a statistic of how bad we are.\nI'll give you another one: We're 46th in literacy in the world -- in the world. Thirty percent of our children do not graduate from high school. What does that mean for the future of this country?\nAnd all we get are the same old nostrums, that we need competition in education. Stop and think: Here, Iran -- not Iran -- Spain, Norway, Finland -- these countries, they're not the superpower of the world, but they pay for their children, from childhood to Ph.D. levels.\nWhy can't Americans put education as the top priority? And you can't do it when you want to expand, as he wants to expand, 100,000 more troops. Who are we going to nuke, who are we going to fight next?\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Senator Gravel.\nGo ahead.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nOBAMA: I want to be clear, George. I actually think that we can implement a performance-based system that teachers buy in to. But I don't think it can be imposed on teachers. I think it has to be one that is developed with teachers so that they have a sense -- Bill is exactly right.\nTeachers, across the board, have to be paid more. My sister's a teacher, and I know how hard they work and what they go through.\nBut we've got to give them a pathway so that they can make more money, as they are developing more experience, as they are putting more into the classroom.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Kucinich, Senator Biden, both on this quickly.\nKUCINICH: Let me be the one who tells you how we're going to do this. I've sponsored a universal pre-kindergarten bill that will be paid for by a 15 percent cut in that bloated, wasteful Pentagon budget, which will yield $75 billion a year that we will put right into education.\nWe will create a universal pre-kindergarten program with a qualitative emphasis for education -- not quantitative so we make our children good little test-takers, but qualitative so our children learn real skills, learning skills, language, arts, and help them grow.\nLearning theorists know this. Child psychologists understand this. Piaget talked all about this. Let's give our children the chance to grow, but let's put the money there. And I know where to get it...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Biden...\nKUCINICH: ... and I'm ready to take that action. Thank you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBIDEN: Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, my wife will walk into a classroom and teach for the 30th year in a row.\nBIDEN: And the one thing any teacher can tell you is that the last person you want to base your performance on, judge your performance, is the administrator of the school. That's the first thing everybody figures out if you teach.\nThere needs to be performance-based pay. The way to do it is start at the front end. Pay those people who perform in undergraduate school. Give them the alternative to be able to go. They'd get the same pay as an engineer gets to go in and work in a math student -- as a math teacher, as a science teacher, et cetera.\nSo you start performance-based pay by, in fact, paying the best- performing students who want to teach and give them a chance. Every other major country in the world is starting their kids at the same salary they start -- these students, the same salary they start their engineers. We should be able to do that.\nMy father used to say, \"Don't tell me what you value; show me your budget.\" If you, in fact, value education, then it should be equally as important as engineering or anything else.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We're running toward the end of the 90 minutes. I have a couple of quick questions, and then a final question.\nThis is -- this is basically a yes-no question. We've seem all this turmoil in the markets over the last couple of weeks, caused by the credit crunch and the crisis in the mortgage markets.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We saw, on Friday, the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate for banks. Should they lower rates for everyone else, yes or no?\nCLINTON: I'm glad they did what they did. But it can't be just left to a bail-out for the banks. We've got to figure out how we're going to figure out people facing foreclosures.\nAnd I think a number of us have recommendations on that, that do not lend themselves to an easy yes or no.\nDODD: Yes, I think it will happen in September. But we also need more liquidity. And they ought to be allowing Fannie and Freddie Mac to put more liquidity in the market.\nIt has seized up. You can't get a mortgage in America today.\nEDWARDS: I agree with that. But we also need a home rescue fund for all the millions of Americans who are worried about losing their homes.\nGRAVEL: All I would say is that there's no answer to that question. Just follow the money of the people on this dais and you'll see a response.\n(LAUGHTER)\nRICHARDSON: This is the Katrina of the mortgage-lending industry.\nRICHARDSON: The answer to your question is yes, there has to be more liquidity, more funds in the market. What we need is more transparency between those that are making this business happen.\nAnd what we also need to do is to not appoint officials that are in the industry to regulate that specific industry. The mortgage industry, they've become -- a lot of them -- a bunch of loan sharks.\nBIDEN: The answer is yes. But we need, as the governor says, more transparency, particularly with regard to hedge funds and private equity funds. They are the ones that are causing this thing to go under. And there's no transparency, no accountability. We don't know how deep this problem is.\nChris will take care of it in the Banking Committee, and I mean that sincerely.\nBut we don't know how deep this problem is. But I think it's much deeper. It's almost as deep in terms of dollars, not liability, as the savings and loan crisis.\nOBAMA: We do need more liquidity, but we're going to have to not only help home owners who are going to be losing their homes as a consequence of this; we're going to have to go forward and make sure that we've got the kinds of tough regulation when it comes to financial instruments to make sure that people who have saved and are trying to get their own home for the first time are not hoodwinked out of it.\nOBAMA: And, unfortunately, the reason that we haven't had tougher regulation in part goes back to the issue of lobbying. This is where special interests have been driving the agenda. We have not had the kinds of consumer protections that are in place.\nAnd that's why, when we have this debate about lobbying, we have to remind ourselves it has very real consequences for the people of Iowa and the people around the country.\n(APPLAUSE)\nKUCINICH: The answer is no. The Fed is actually looking at bailing out the creditors. And what we're looking at is a continuation of the problem and a postponement of the day of reckoning.\nWe need to have a government take strong action where we'll loan money to those who are in trouble. But we need to do that in exchange for having the power, the money-lending power that the banks have right now, come back to the government; government spends money into circulation; and then government can maintain control over the economy.\nKUCINICH: Unless we take this action, we're looking at a situation of the collapse of our economy, and we're looking at a situation where these hedge funds will try to get a bail-out while millions of Americans lose their homes. Save the American homeowners.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Final round, final question, about 30 seconds each, please.\nYou know, presidential biographers are always looking at the turning point in a life, the moment where an ordinary person went on the path to the presidency, the decisive moment.\nCongressman Kucinich, what's the decisive moment in your life?\nKUCINICH: I would say the decisive moment in my life was when my family was living in a car in the inner city and I thought about all the dreams that I could have as a child. And I decided, at an early age, that I was going to be someone.\nAnd I've had a lot of help along the way to get to this stage, but I can tell you, as president, the American people will have someone who remembers where he came from and has the compassion in his heart to lift up everyone to make sure everyone has a chance.\nThank you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nOBAMA: A decisive moment in my life was the transition from high school to college, because I had gone through a difficult time, not knowing my father, and was, at times, an angry young man.\nOBAMA: And partly because of the values my mother had instilled in me, those were reawakened in college.\nAnd it made me serious about, not just what I could do for myself, but what I could do for other people. It's what led me to become a community organizer. It's what led me to go into public service. And ultimately, it's what led me to this stage.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBIDEN: George, there's a lot of things in my life that led me to be engaged in politics. I worked in the African-American community, east side of my city, as the only white employee for a long while when I was a kid. And I got involved in the civil rights movement.\nI thought the question was, what made me run for president.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Decisive moment in your life that put you on the broader path.\nBIDEN: Well, the decisive moment in me life that put me on the broader path was the civil rights movement. When I really -- I found out and realized that it does make a difference if you're engaged. You actually can change people's lives. You can actually change the state of the nation.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Richardson?\nRICHARDSON: The decisive moment in my life was when my wife, Barbara, decided and agreed to marry me, because it was the best decision I ever made and, hopefully, she ever made. We've had 35 years of marriage. It has given me strength and has been an anchor in my life.\nA decisive moment for me to return to public life was 9/11. When it happened, I wanted to get back in public life.\nAnd I just want to make one -- I resent that...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I've got to move on. We're going to run out of time. Sorry.\nGRAVEL: The decisive moment in my life came with the insightfulness of realizing that human governance is extremely complex and that representative government is broken.\nAnd so, there's only two venues for change: One is the government, where the problem lies, or the people.\nGRAVEL: And so the people must be equipped as lawmakers, the central power of government, in order to make decisions on all the policy issues that affect their lives, working in partnership with elected government.\nIt's a win-win. The people make the policy decisions, and we then would make the day-to-day operation of government work better.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Edwards?\nEDWARDS: When I was a young boy, I came downstairs one morning. It was still dark outside. My father, who worked in mills all his life, was sitting at the kitchen table. The television was on. He was watching public television. And he'd never been able to go to college. And he was trying to learn from public television so he could get a better job in the mill.\nAnd I worked in the mill, myself, part-time, when I was younger. And I made the decision then, whatever I did with my life -- didn't know that I'd be running for president -- but whatever I did with my life, those are the people that I would fight for, as long as I was breathing.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Dodd?\nDODD: Well, there were two moments. One was the decision to join the Peace Corps, getting excited about John Kennedy inviting a generation of us to be a part of things larger than ourselves.\nDODD: And the second was, about a week before my father died, when he was asked the question, \"Had he known how his life would end, would he do it all over again?,\" I'll never forget him saying he'd do it in a minute, because you can never do as much for the public good as you can through a public life.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Last week, Senator Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, when I was growing up I didn't think I would run for president, but I could not be standing here without the women's movement, without generations of women who broke down barriers, the civil rights movement that gave women and people of color the feeling that they were really part of the American dream.\nSo I owe the opportunity that I have here today to many people; some of whom are known to history and many who aren't.\nBut more personally, I owe it to my mother, who never got a chance to go to college, who had a very difficult childhood, but who gave me a belief that I could do whatever I set my mind...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And that is the last word.\nThank you all very much.\nPresidential Candidate Debates, Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American president. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\nBorn in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate, a position he held until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2008 presidential election, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and defeated Republican nominee John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin.\nObama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts in international diplomacy, a decision which drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the 2008 financial crisis with measures including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to address the Great Recession; a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts; legislation to reform health care; and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. Obama also oversaw the end of the Iraq War and ordered Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks. He downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model by expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. Obama also ordered the 2011 military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.\nObama defeated Republican opponent Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan in the 2012 presidential election. In his second term, Obama advocated for gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. He took steps to combat climate change by signing the Paris Agreement on climate change and an executive order to limit carbon emissions, and presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term. Obama initiated sanctions against Russia following its invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. He also ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (a nuclear agreement with Iran), and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan decreased during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage.\nObama left office in 2017 with high approval ratings both within the United States and among foreign advisories. He continues to reside in Washington, D.C.,[2] and remains politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including in Biden's successful presidential bid in the 2020 presidential election. Outside of politics, Obama has published three books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006), and A Promised Land (2020). His presidential library began construction in the South Side of Chicago in 2021. Historians and political scientists rank Obama highly in historical rankings of U.S. presidents.\nEarly life and career\nBarack Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[3] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[4][5][6][7] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[8] He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850.[9] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[10][11][12] Obama has described the ancestors of his grandparents as Scotch-Irish mostly.[13] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982),[14] was a married[15][16][17] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[15][18] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[19] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[20][21] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[22][23]\nIn late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[24] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[25][page needed] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[26] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[27] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"[21] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[28]\nIn 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaiʻi; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[29] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta.[30]\nEducation\nWhen he was six years old, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as \"Barry\"[31] and attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[32][33] As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[34] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\".[35]\nIn 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[36] In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname \"Barry\" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.[37] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[38] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[39] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[40]\nOf his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[41] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind\".[42] Obama was also a member of the \"Choom Gang\" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana.[43][44]\nCollege and research jobs\nAfter graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[45] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks.[45] Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[46] and in English literature[47] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[48] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[49][50] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[51][52][53]\nCommunity organizer and Harvard Law School\nTwo years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[52][54] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[55] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[56] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[57][58]\n| External videos | |\n|---|---|\n| Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34, Boston TV Digital Archive[59] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25. |\nDespite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[60] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[61] president of the journal in his second year,[55][62] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard.[63] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[64] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[55][62] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[65] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[65] Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude.[66][61]\nUniversity of Chicago Law School\nIn 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[65][67] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[68]\nFrom April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.[69]\nFamily and personal life\nIn a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.\"[70] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living.[71] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[72] until her death on November 2, 2008,[73] two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[74] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.[75][76][77]\nObama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[78] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[78][79] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[79]\nIn June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed at Sidley Austin.[80] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[81] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[82] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children.[83] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[84] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.[85] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[86] The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[87] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[88] Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.[89]\nObama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[90] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[91] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.[92] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[93] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,[94] and he is left-handed.[95]\nIn 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.6 million in 2024) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[96] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[97]\nIn December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $2 million in 2024).[98] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[99][100] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[101][102] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[103]\nReligious views\nObama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[104] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known\", and \"a lonely witness for secular humanism.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"[105]\nIn January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"[106] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying:\nI'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.[107][108]\nObama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[109] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized.[110] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[111][112][113]\nIn 2016, Obama said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him \"of all the different people I've met along the way\", adding: \"I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times.\" The items, \"a whole bowl full\", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.[114][115]\nLegal career\nFrom 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the Joyce Foundation.[52] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[52] Obama's law license became inactive in 2007.[116][117]\nLegislative career\nIllinois Senate (1997–2004)\nObama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic state senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[118] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[119][120] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[121] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican governor George Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[122][123]\nHe was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[124][125] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[126]\nIn January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[127] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[121][128][129][130] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[131] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[132]\n2004 U.S. Senate campaign in Illinois\nIn May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[133]\nObama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[134] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[135] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[136] and spoke out against the war.[137] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.[138]\nDecisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[139] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[140] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[141] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[142]\nObama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[143] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[144] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history.[145] He took 92 of the state's 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not perform well.[146]\nU.S. Senate (2005–2008)\nObama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[147] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[148] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[149] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[150] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[151] He also cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[152]\nIn December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[153][154] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[155][156]\nLater in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[157] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[158] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;[159] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[160] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[161]\nObama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works, and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.[162] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[163] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs.[164] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[165] Obama resigned his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[166]\nPresidential campaigns\n2008 presidential candidacy\nOn February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[167][168] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic, as it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.[167][169] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system.[170]\nNumerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but Obama gained a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[171] On June 2, 2008, Obama had received enough votes to clinch his nomination. After an initial hesitation to concede, on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[172] On August 23, 2008, Obama announced his selection of Delaware senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[173] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana governor and senator Evan Bayh and Virginia governor Tim Kaine.[173] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[174][175] Obama delivered his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide.[176][177][178] During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[179] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[180]\nJohn McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. Obama and McCain engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[181] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[182] Obama won 52.9 percent of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7 percent.[183] He became the first African-American to be elected president.[184] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.[185][186] He is one of the three United States senators moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House, the others being Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy.[187]\n2012 presidential candidacy\nOn April 4, 2011, Obama filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission and then announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website.[188][189][190] As the incumbent president, he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[191] and on April 3, 2012, Obama secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[192] At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former president Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[193]\nOn November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[194][195][196] With 51.1 percent of the popular vote,[197] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[198][199] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"[200][201]\nPresidency (2009–2017)\n| Part of a series on |\n| Modern liberalism in the United States |\n|---|\nFirst 100 days\nThe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[202] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[203] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[204][205] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee.[206] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[207] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[208]\nDomestic policy\nThe first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[209] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children.[210] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.[211]\nObama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring associate justice David Souter. She was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[212] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent.[213] Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history.[214]\nOn March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.\nIn July 2009, Obama launched the Priority Enforcement Program, an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W. Bush, and the Secure Communities fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.[215]\nIn a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding earth science projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[216]\nOn January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[217] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[218] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[219] In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.\nIn 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[220] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[221] but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy.[222][223] Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms.[224] He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).[224]\nRacial issues\nIn his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[225][226] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[227]\nFollowing Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a \"post-racial America\".[228][229] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent,[228][230] and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama.[231] The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that \"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\"[232] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a wave of protests.[233] These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people.[233] Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.[234]\nSeveral incidents during Obama's presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police.[235] In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried \"a great deal\" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.[236]\nLGBT rights\nOn October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[237] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[238] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[239][240] to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[241]\nSame-sex marriage\nAs a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[242] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[243] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"[244] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[245][246] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[201] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[247][248] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[249] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[250]\nEconomic policy\nOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion (equivalent to $1153 billion in 2024) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[252] In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the 2008 financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets.[253]\nObama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[254] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[255] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.[256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[257] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers\", which temporarily boosted the economy.[258][259][260]\nThe Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.[261] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.[262] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[263]\nThe unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[264] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[265] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent,[266] decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013.[267] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter.[267] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter.[268] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[268] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain\".[269] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.[270]\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[272][273] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,[273][274][275] while conceding that \"it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"[272] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[276] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[277] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.[278]\nWithin a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[279] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2024) Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[280]\nIn December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[281] Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[282]\nEnvironmental policy\nOn April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[283] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[284] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.[285]\nIn July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions.\"[286][287] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.[288] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[289]\nIn December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.[290][291][292]\nObama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[293][294][295]\nHealth care reform\nObama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[296] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[297][298]\nOn July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[296] After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[300] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[301]\nOn November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[302][303] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[304] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, colloquially \"Obamacare\") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[305]\nThe ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[306] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income,[307] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[308]\nThe costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[310] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[311] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[312]\nThe law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[313] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State\", as the statute reads.[314]\nForeign policy\nIn February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[315] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya.[316] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[317][318] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[319] On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election.[320]\nIn 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam suspected of being a leading Al-Qaeda organizer. al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike. The Department of Justice released a memo justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war,[321] while civil liberties advocates described it as a violation of al-Awlaki's constitutional right to due process. The killing led to significant controversy.[322] His teenage son and young daughter, also Americans, were later killed in separate U.S. military actions, although they were not targeted specifically.[323][321]\nIn March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.[324][325] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.[326] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.[327]\nIn September 2016 Obama was snubbed by Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party as he descended from Air Force One to the tarmac of Hangzhou International Airport for the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit without the usual red carpet welcome.[328]\nWar in Iraq\nOn February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months.[329] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[330][331] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[332] On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"[333]\nIn June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIL, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[334][335] In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL.[336] By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[337] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[338] In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400,[339] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[340]\nAfghanistan and Pakistan\nIn his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a \"dangerous distraction\" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan,[341] the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again.[342] Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan\", an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"[343] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[344] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[345] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[346] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[347] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[348]\nRegarding neighboring Pakistan, Obama called its tribal border region the \"greatest threat\" to the security of Afghanistan and Americans, saying that he \"cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary.\" In the same speech, Obama claimed that the U.S. \"cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy.\"[349]\nDeath of Osama bin Laden\nStarting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad.[350] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[350] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[350] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[351][352] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[353] which was buried at sea several hours later.[354] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[351][355] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[356]\nRelations with Cuba\nSince the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[357] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[358] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[359]\nIn December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.[360] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"[361] On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[362] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[363] Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[364]\nIsrael\nDuring the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.–Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[365] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[366] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[367][368] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[369] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[370]\nIn 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"[371] In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"[372] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[373] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"[374]\nOn December 23, 2016, under the Obama administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[375] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration's actions,[376][377] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.[378] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[379][380]\nLibya\nIn February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[381] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[382] In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire. However Gaddafi's forces continued to attack the rebels.[383]\nOn March 19, a multinational coalition led by France and the United Kingdom with Italian and U.S. support, approved by Obama, took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[384] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[385][386][387] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[388] Some members of Congress[389] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[390][391] In 2016 Obama said \"Our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind\" and that it was \"a mess\".[392] He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency.[393]\nSyrian civil war\nOn August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\"[394] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[395] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[396] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[397][398]\nIn the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged[399] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[400][401] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL.[402]\nIran nuclear talks\nOn October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[403][404][405] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"[406] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[407][408] On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.[409]\nRussia\nIn March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[410] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[411] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[412] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against homosexual people,[413] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[414]\nAfter Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[415] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West\", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[416]\nPost-presidency (2017–present)\nObama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump.[417][418] The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[419] On March 2, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"[420] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.[421] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[422] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation,[423] which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[424]\nBarack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas' newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions.[425][426] Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020.[427] On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to Obama was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been mailed out to Democratic lawmakers and officials.[428] In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck.[429] On October 29, Obama criticized \"wokeness\" and call-out culture at the Obama Foundation's annual summit.[430][431]\nObama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee.[432] On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, for president in the presidential election, stating that he has \"all the qualities we need in a president right now.\"[433][434] In May, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis \"an absolute chaotic disaster\", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been \"our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.\"[435] On November 17, Obama's presidential memoir, A Promised Land, was released.[436][437][438]\nObama and his wife attended the inauguration of Joe Biden in January 2021.\nIn February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about \"their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'\"[439][440] Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.[441]\nOn March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir A Promised Land.[442] On April 5, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.[443][444][445] In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with Audible.[446][447] In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle's official White House portraits.[448] Around the same time, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator[449] for his narration in the Netflix documentary series Our Great National Parks.[450]\nIn 2022, Obama opposed expanding the Supreme Court beyond the present nine Justices.[451]\nIn March 2023, Obama traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, Obama met with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and visited Melbourne for the first time.[452] Obama was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.[453][454]\nIn October 2023, during the Gaza war, Obama declared that Israel must dismantle Hamas in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on Israel.[455] Weeks later, Obama warned Israel that its actions could \"harden Palestinian attitudes for generations\" and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war's human costs \"could ultimately backfire.\"[456]\nIn July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden's campaign viability after his critically maligned debate performance against former president Trump.[457] On July 21, Biden withdrew his candidacy and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee. Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention formally endorsing her.[458] He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, senator, and vice president and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets.[459][460] After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice President–elect JD Vance while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.[461]\nObama attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump in January 2025.[462]\nCultural and political image\nObama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who rose to prominence in the 1960s through their involvement in the civil rights movement.[463] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"[464] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, remarking: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"[465] Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator.[466] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly video addresses on YouTube.[467]\nJob approval\nAccording to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating,[468] the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in.[469] His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009[470] and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s,[471] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[472] Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50–53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s.[473][474][475]\nHis approval rating fell to 38 percent on several occasions in late 2011[476] before recovering in mid-2012 with polls showing an average approval of 50 percent.[477] After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama's approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent[478] before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December.[473] In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections, Obama's approval ratings were at their lowest[479][480] with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent.[473][481][482] His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year.[473][483] According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013.[473][484] In polling conducted January 16–19, 2017, Obama's final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.[485]\nObama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency.[486] In Gallup's retrospective approval polls of former presidents, Obama garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II.[487][488]\nForeign perceptions\nPolls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[489][490][491] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[492] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[493][494]\nOn October 9, 2009—only nine months into his first term—the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\",[495] which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[496][497][498][499] He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[500] He himself called it a \"call to action\" and remarked: \"I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations\".[501]\nLegacy and recognition\nObama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.[502][503][504] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\" Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act. Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama \"turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.\" Zeitzer calls this the \"defining paradox of Obama's presidency\".[505]\nThe Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed \"only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.\"[506] David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short \"in areas many Progressives hold dear\", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama's legacy that of \"a disappointingly conventional president\".[507]\nObama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a \"skinny repeal\", have thus far failed.[508] However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.[509] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[510][511][512][513]\nMany commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[508] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term.[514] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[515]\nIn 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[516]\nAs president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[517] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year.[518] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[519][241] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.[520]\nObama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[521] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[522][523] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[524]\nAccording to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody of any president since Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[525]\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama's human rights record \"mixed\", adding that \"he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest—nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.\"[224]\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.[526][527] He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.[528] In Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.[487]\nPresidential library\nThe Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library. It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago.[529]\nAwards and honors\nObama received the Norwegian Nobel Committee's Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, The Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education's Ambassador of Humanity Award in 2014, the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2017, and the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Ripple of Hope Award in 2018. He was named TIME Magazine's Time Person of the Year in 2008 and 2012. He also received two Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word Album for Dreams from My Father (2006), and The Audacity of Hope (2008) as well as three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narrator for Our Great National Parks (2022), Working: What We Do All Day (2023), and Our Oceans (2025). He also won two Children's and Family Emmy Awards. In 2024 he became the first and so far only President from the Democratic Party to win the Sylvanus Thayer Award.\nEponymy\nBibliography\nBooks\n- Obama, Barack (1995). Dreams from My Father.

WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, we'll begin with you.\nYou gave an interview to The New York Times over the weekend pledging in it to be more aggressive, to be tougher in your campaign against your chief rival for the nomination, the leader among Democrats so far, Senator Clinton, who is here next to you tonight.\nTo that end, Senator, you said that Senator Clinton was trying to sound Republican, trying to vote Republican on national security issues, and that was, quote, \"bad for the country and ultimately bad for the Democrats.\" That is a strong charge, as you're aware.\nSpecifically, what are the issues where you, Senator Obama, and Senator Clinton have differed, where you think she has sounded or voted like a Republican?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think some of this stuff gets overhyped. In fact, I think this has been the most hyped fight since Rocky fought Apollo Creed, although the amazing thing is I'm Rocky in this situation. (Laughter.)\nBut look, we have big challenges. We're at war. The country is struggling with issues like rising health care. We've got major global challenges like climate change. And that's going to require big meaningful change, and I'm running for president because I think that the way to bring about that change is to offer some sharp contrasts with the other party. I think it means that we bring people together to get things done. I think it means that we push against the special interests that are holding us back, and most importantly, I think it requires us to be honest about the challenges that we face.\nIt does not mean, I think, changing positions whenever it's political convenient.\nAnd Senator Clinton in her campaign, I think, has been for NAFTA previously, now she's against it. She has taken one position on torture several months ago and then most recently has taken a different position. She voted for a war, to authorize sending troops into Iraq, and then later said this was a war for diplomacy.\nI don't think that -- now, that may be politically savvy, but I don't think that it offers the clear contrast that we need. I think what we need right now is honestly with the American people about where we would take the country. That's how I'm trying to run my campaign. That's how I will be as president.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, rebuttal?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I don't think the Republicans got the message that I'm voting and sounding like them. If you watched their debate last week, I seemed to be the topic of great conversation and consternation, and that's for a reason, because I have stood against George Bush and his failed policies.\nThey want to continue the war in Iraq; I want to end it. The Republicans are waving their sabers and talking about going after Iran. I want to prevent a rush to war. On every issue from health care for children to an energy policy that puts us on the right track to deal with climate change and make us more secure, I have been standing against the Republicans, George Bush and Dick Cheney, and I will continue to do so. And I think Democrats know that.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nTim Russert.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Edwards, you issued a press release, your campaign, and the headline is \"Edwards to Clinton: American People Deserve the Truth, Not More Double-Talk on Iran.\" What double-talk are you suggesting that Senator Clinton's been engaging in on Iran?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Well, first, good evening. (Chuckles.) It's wonderful to be here. Let me talk a little bit about what I see as the choice that voters have. I think that from my perspective, President Bush over the last seven years has destroyed the trust relationship between America and its president. In fact, I think he's destroyed the trust relationship between the president of the United States and the rest of the world. And I think it is crucial for Democratic voters and caucus-goers to determine who they can trust, who's honest, who's sincere, who has integrity.\nAnd I think it's fair, in that regard, to look at what people have said. Senator Clinton says that she believes she can be the candidate for change, but she defends a broken system that's corrupt in Washington, D.C. She says she will end the war, but she continues to say she'll keep combat troops in Iraq and continue combat missions in Iraq. To me, that's not ending the war; that's the continuation of the war.\nShe says she'll stand up to George Bush on Iran. She just said it again. And in fact, she voted to give George Bush the first step in moving militarily on Iran, and he's taken it. Bush and Cheney have taken it. They've now declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. I think we have to stand up to this president.\nAnd then finally she said in our last debate that she was against any changes on Social Security -- benefits, retirement age or raising the cap on the Social Security tax. But apparently it's been reported that she said privately something different than that. And I think the American people, given this historic moment in our country's history, deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth, and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time.\nMR. RUSSERT: Do you stand behind the word \"double-talk\"?\nSEN. EDWARDS: I do.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I think that anyone who's looked at my record of 35 years fighting, for women and children and people who feel invisible and left out in this country, knows my record. I fought for expanded education and health care in Arkansas. I helped to bring health care to 6 million children while in the White House. And now, in the Senate, I've been standing up against the Republicans on everything from preventing them from privatizing Social Security to standing up against President Bush's veto of children's health.\nYou know, I have a long record of standing up and fighting, and I take on the special interests. I've been taking them on for many years. And I think all you have to do is go back and -- and read the media to know that.\nBut on specific issues I've come out with very specific plans.\nWith respect to Social Security, I do have a plan. It's called start with fiscal responsibility. That's what we were doing in the 1990s, and we had Social Security on a much better path than it is today because of the irresponsible spending policies of George Bush and the Republican Congress.\nIf there are some of the long-term challenges that we need to address, let's do it in the context of having fiscal responsibility, and then let's put together a bipartisan commission and look at how we're going to deal with these long-term challenges. But I am not going to balance Social Security on the backs of seniors and hardworking middle-class Americans. Let's start taking the tax cuts away from the wealthy. Let's take away the no-bid contracts from Halliburton before we start imposing a trillion-dollar tax increase on the elderly and on middle-class workers. I don't think that's necessary.\nSo I have a very specific plan. My friends may not agree with it, but I've been saying it and talking about it for many months.\nMR. RUSSERT: We're going to get to Social Security in a little bit, but I want to stay on Iran, Senator Clinton.\nAs you know, you voted for the Kyl-Lieberman amendment, the only member on the stage here who did that. Senator, Jim Webb of Virginia said it is for all practical purposes mandating the military option, that it is a clearly worded sense of Congress that could be interpreted as a declaration of war.\nWhy did you vote for that amendment, which would -- calls upon the president to structure our military forces in Iraq with regard to the capability of Iran?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I am against a rush to war. I was the first person on this stage and one of the very first in the Congress to go to the floor of the Senate back in February and say George Bush had no authority to take any military action in Iran.\nSecondly, I am not in favor of this rush for war, but I'm also not in favor of doing nothing. Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is in the forefront of that, as they are in the sponsorship of terrorism. So some may want a false choice between rushing to war -- which is the way the Republicans sound; it's not even a question of whether, it's a question of when and what weapons to use -- and doing nothing. I prefer vigorous diplomacy, and I happen to think economic sanctions are part of vigorous diplomacy. We use them with respect to North Korea. We use them with respect to Libya. And many of us who voted for that resolution said that this is not anything other than an expression of support for using economic sanctions with respect to diplomacy.\nYou know, several people who were adamantly opposed to the war in Iraq, like Senator Durbin, voted the same way I did and said at the time that if he thought there was even the pretense that could be used from the language in that non-binding resolution to give George Bush any support to go to war, he wouldn't have voted for it. Neither would I.\nSo we can argue about what is a non-binding sense of the Senate, and I think that we are missing the point, which is we've got to do everything we can to prevent George Bush and the Republicans from doing something on their own to take offensive military action against Iran. I'm prepared to pass legislation that -- with my colleagues who are here in the Congress, to try to get some Republicans to join us, to make it abundantly clear that sanctions and diplomacy are the way to go; we reject and do not believe George Bush has any authority to do anything else.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Dodd, you said that vote was a justification for war in Iran.\nSEN. DODD: Well, Tim, I believe that this issue is going to come back to haunt us. We all learned, some of us here painfully, back in 2002 that by voting for an authorization regarding Iraq, that despite the language of that resolution, which called for diplomacy at the time, this administration used that resolution, obviously, to pursue a very aggressive action in Iraq.\nI'm of a view here -- what you didn't learn back in '02, you should have learned by now. And you don't have to just listen to this resolution. There's been a series of drumbeats by this administration, by Dick Cheney, by the president, by others clearly pointing in the direction that would call for military action in Iran. It is a dangerous move, in my view, and therefore I thought it was incumbent upon us.\nIt was interesting that people like Dick Lugar, the former Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Chuck Hagel, of Nebraska, Republicans, also had serious reservations and voted against that resolution the other day, on September 26th. I'm very concerned that we're going to see those 76 votes come back, being waved in front of us here as a justification when the Bush administration decides to take military action in Iran.\nSo it was a moment -- it's critical moment when I think leadership is called for here. If you're going to seek the leadership of our country, this is the most serious time in a generation. You have an ascending China. You have an Iranian that's ambitious to acquire nuclear weapons. You have obviously a $4 trillion economy that's in trouble, a health care crisis in this country, energy and other issues that are going to confront the next president. Good judgment and leadership at critical moments must be a part of this debate and discussion. That was a critical moment, and the wrong decision was made, in my view.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Biden, do you agree with Senator Webb it was de facto a declaration of war?\nSEN. BIDEN: I think it can be used as a fact -- a declaration.\nBut look, we have a -- we have a problem in the Senate -- and I'm not just directing this at Hillary; all -- there were 75 other people who voted with her, we're in a minority -- that there are consequences for what we do. And it's not even about going to war.\nLet's look at what happened from the moment that vote took place.\nOil prices went up to $90 a barrel. Who benefits from that? All this talk of war, all this talk of declaring people to be terrorists, drove up the price of oil.\nSecondly, we have emboldened Bush at a minimum. His talk of World War III, totally irresponsible talk. We've emboldened him, Tim, to be able to move if he chooses to move. They're terrorists. The fact that they're terrorists on one side of the border or the other, we've just declared them terrorists. That gives him the color of right to move against them.\nThirdly, this has incredible consequences for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Nobody talks about this. Do 75 of our colleagues not understand? We have now driven underground every moderate in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. This literally -- literally -- puts Karzai, as well as Musharraf, in jeopardy.\nThe notion here is it plays into this whole urban legend that America is on a crusade against Islam. This was bad -- if nothing else happens, not another single thing, this was bad policy.\nThe president had the ability to do everything that that amendment, that resolution called for without us talking to it. And all it has done is hurt us, even if not another single action is taken. Actions have consequences. Big nations can't bluff.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, let's get at this another way. Red line is the current expression of the moment where Iran is concerned in Washington. What would your red line be concerning when to, if to attack Iran? What would make it crystal clear in your mind that the United States should attack Iran?\nSEN. OBAMA: I don't think we should be talking about attacking Iran at this point, for some of the reasons that Chris and Joe just talked about. Look, we have been seeing, during the Republican debates, the drumbeat of war. The president has been talking about World War III. That is a continuation of the kinds of foreign policy that rejects diplomacy and sees military action as the only tool available to us to influence the region. And what we should be doing is reaching out aggressively to our allies but also talking to our enemies and focusing on those areas where we do not accept their actions, whether it be terrorism or developing nuclear weapons, but also talking to Iran directly about the potential carrots that we can provide, in terms of them being involved in the World Trade Organization, or beginning to look at the possibilities of diplomatic relations being normalized.\nWe have not made those serious attempts. This kind of resolution does not send the right signal to the region. It doesn't send the right signal to our allies or our enemies, and as a consequence, I think over the long term it weakens our capacity to influence Iran.\nNow, there may come a point where those measures have been exhausted and Iran is on the verge of obtaining a nuclear weapon, where we have to consider other options, but we shouldn't talk about those options now when we haven't tried what would be a much more effective approach.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Same question to Senator Clinton. What would be your red line?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, first of all, we have to try diplomacy, and I see economic sanctions as part of diplomacy. We've used it with other very difficult situations, like Libya, like North Korea, and I think that what we're trying to do here is put pressure on the Bush administration. Joe's absolutely right -- George Bush can do all of this without anybody. You know, that's the great tragedy, and that's why we've got to rein him in, and that's why we need Republican support in the Congress to help us do so. And I invite all of our colleagues to pass something immediately that makes it very clear he has no authority and we will not permit him to go take offensive action against Iran.\nBut what we're trying to do is push forward on vigorous diplomacy. That has been lacking.\nI believe we should be engaged in diplomacy right now with the Iranians. Everything should be on the table, not just their nuclear program. I've been advocating this for several years, I believe it strongly, but I also think when you go to the table to negotiate with an adversarial regime, you need both carrots and sticks. The Revolutionary Guard is deeply involved in the commercial activities of Iran. Having those economic sanctions hanging over their heads gives our negotiators one of the set of sticks that we need to try to make progress in dealing with a very complicated complicated situation.\nEverybody agrees up here that President Bush has made a total mess out of the situation with Iran. What we're trying to do is to sort our way through to try to put diplomacy, with some carrots and some sticks, into the mix and get the president to begin to do that.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Respectfully, Senator, same question, though: Do you have a threshold, a red line beyond which?\nSEN. CLINTON: I want to start diplomacy. You know, I am not going to speculate about when or if they get nuclear weapons. We're trying to prevent them from getting so. We're not, in my view, rushing to war. We should not be doing that. But we shouldn't be doing nothing.\nAnd that means we should not let them acquire nuclear weapons, and the best way to prevent that is a full-court press on the diplomatic front.\nMR. WILLIAMS: I've noted all of our candidates want in on this. Senator Edwards, you next.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Thank you very much.\nWell, I just listened to what Senator Clinton said, and she said she wanted to maximize pressure on the Bush administration. So the way to do that is to vote yes on a resolution that looks like it was written literally by the neocons? I mean, has anyone read this thing? I mean, it literally gave Bush and Cheney exactly what they wanted.\nIt didn't just give them what they wanted; they acted on it. A few weeks later, they declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and -- this is going to sound very familiar; remember from Iraq, the prelude to Iraq? -- proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. The way you put pressure on this administration is you stand up to -- you say no.\nA lot of us on this stage have learned our lessons the hard way, that you give this president an inch and he will take a mile. And this is about such an important issue, and we have to stand up to this president. We need to make it absolutely clear that we have no intention of letting Bush, Cheney or this administration invade Iraq (sic) because they have been rattling the saber over and over and over.\nAnd what this resolution did, written literally in the language of the neocons, is it enables this president to do exactly what he wants to do. He continues to march forward. He continues to say this is a terrorist organization. He continues to say these are proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. How in the world is that Democrats? We're not talking about Republicans now, Chris and Joe -- Democrats standing up to this president and saying no, we are not going to allow this; we are not going to allow this march to war in Iran.\nMR. RUSSERT: Governor Richardson, would you negotiate with Iran without any conditions?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Yes, I would, and I'm the only one on this stage that has actually negotiated with a foreign country with Iran.\nREP. KUCINICH: That's not true. (Laughs.)\nGOV. RICHARDSON: And I want to just say to you that, in my judgment, we have to use diplomacy, and there is a red line. We cannot permit Iran to use nuclear weapons, and I do believe what you do is -- Ahmadinejad, it's very difficult to deal with him, but there are moderate elements in Iran. There are moderate clerics, there are students, there's a business community, and I believe that we can achieve a compromise on the nuclear issue in exchange for them having a nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear power; they don't develop nuclear weapons -- carrot and sticks, diplomatic initiatives, economic incentives.\nThe problem is, we saber rattle, and this resolution in the Senate saber rattles.\nI was U.N. ambassador. I know this region, and I do believe that it's critically important that we talk to North Korea, that we talk to Syria, that we talk to Iran. And it's going to take skilled diplomacy, and what we have in this administration is a policy of preemption, of saber rattling, of leaking out potential targets in Iran. That's not going to get diplomacy started.\nAnd I believe it's critical, if we're going to resolve the situation in the Middle East, if we're going to get Iraq to stop Iran's helping terrorists, we have to engage them, vigorously, potentially also with sanctions. And we need to get European allies, who refuse generally to help us with sanctions, as well as Russia. And what you saw recently is Russia and Iran embracing each other. That is not healthy.\nMR. RUSSERT: Congressman Kucinich, your opinion of this resolution?\nREP. KUCINICH: Well, first of all, we need to adamantly reject any kind of a move towards war with Iran. There's no basis for it whatsoever.\nBut we have to realize, Tim, that we have a number of enablers, who happen to be Democrats, who have said over the last year, with respect to Iran, all options are on the table.\nAnd when you say all options are on the table, you are licensing President Bush. When -- and I'm the only one up here on the stage who not only voted against the war in Iraq, voted against funding the war, but also led the effort against Bush's drive towards war.\nThe problem is, these policies of preemption license a war. Preemption, by virtue of international law, is illegal. Our president has already violated international law. The war in Iraq is illegal. Even planning for the war against Iran is illegal.\nTim, we're here in Philadelphia, the birthplace of democracy. I want to know when this Democratic Congress is going to stand up for the Constitution and hold the president accountable with Article II, Section 4: an impeachment act. I think that our democracy is in peril. And unless the Democrats and the Congress stand up for the Constitution, we are going to lose our country.\nWe need to challenge him on this war but we need to challenge him at his core. And the core is, there needs to be a separation of powers, a balance of powers. Things are out of balance. It is time for us to stand up for the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.)\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask each of you the same question.\nSenator Clinton, would you pledge to the American people that Iran will not develop a nuclear bomb while you are president?\nSEN. CLINTON: I intend to do everything I can to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.\nMR. RUSSERT: But you won't pledge?\nSEN. CLINTON: I am pledging I will do everything I can to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.\nMR. RUSSERT: But they may.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, you know, Tim, you asked me if I would pledge, and I have pledged that I will do everything I can -- (laughter) -- to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Edwards.\nSEN. EDWARDS: What I will do is take all the responsible steps that can be taken to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama.\nSEN. OBAMA: I think all of us are committed to Iran not having nuclear weapons. And -- and so, you know, we -- we -- we could potentially short-circuit this. (Laughter.)\nBut -- but I think there is a larger point at stake, Tim, and that is we have been governed by fear for the last six years, and this president has used the fear of terrorism to launch a war that should have never been authorized. We are seeing the same pattern now. We are seeing the Republican nominees do the same thing. And it is very important for us to draw a clear line and say we are not going to be governed by fear.\nWe will take threats seriously. We will take action to make sure that the United States is secure. As president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to keep us safe.\nBut what we cannot continue to do is operate as if we are the weakest nation in the world instead of the strongest one, because that's not who we are. And that's not what America has been about historically, and it is starting to warp our domestic policies, as well. We haven't even talked about civil liberties and the impact of that politics of fear, what that has done to us in terms of undermining basic civil liberties in this country, what it has done in terms of our reputation around the world.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Biden, would you pledge to the American people that Iran would not build a nuclear bomb on your watch?\nSEN. BIDEN: I would pledge to keep us safe. If you told me, Tim -- and this is not -- this is complicated stuff. We talk about this in isolation. The fact of the matter is the Iranians may get 2.6 kilograms of highly enriched uranium; the Pakistanis have hundreds, thousands of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.\nIf by attacking Iran to stop them from getting 2.6 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, the government in Pakistan falls, who has missiles already deployed, with nuclear weapons on them, that can already reach Israel, already reach India, then that's a bad bargain.\nPresidents make wise decisions informed not by a vacuum in which they operate, by the situation they find themselves in the world. I will do all in my power to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, but I will never take my eye off the ball.\nWhat is the greatest threat to the United States of America: 2.6 kilograms of highly enriched uranium in Tehran or an out of control Pakistan? It's not close.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Dodd.\nSEN. DODD: Well, listen, I -- there's a deeper question here because not only with the pledge you make, but this audience and others here make a determination which of us here have the experience, the background here to manage the situation. It's a critical question.\nAs I said at the outset of my -- the first question you gave me here, this is the most critical time in a generation in this country. The problems are in the Middle East and what's going on in the Far East, as well as in Latin America and elsewhere, and which of us here brings the background, the experience, the ability to make a difference on these issues, including the question of Iran.\nI agree with, Joe. I think the more immediate problem is Pakistan, the one that needs to be addressed, but certainly bringing that experience together so that you're able to marshal the resources, put together the kind of team and demonstrate as a result of what you've been able to accomplish over the years that you can actually handle this situation. Results matter. Experience matters. Having to demonstrate an ability to deal with these issues is critical.\nSo certainly, I would make a pledge, obviously, to do everything we can to avoid this problem, but I would suggest to you, Tim, that the more immediate issue is the one exactly that Joe has identified here. Pakistan does pose a more serious issue for this country and one that needs to be addressed. That's what I did in Latin American when I negotiated the settlements in El Salvador and Nicaragua, going back 20 years ago -- deeply involved in the process, working day after day with various elements, to bring about the kind of results that today has reduced the threats of violence in that part of the world.\nThat's what's needed here -- a leader that has the experience and the background to grapple with these issues.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Governor Richardson.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, I would make the pledge, and it would be through diplomacy. And what we're also talking about is not just Pakistan. We're talking about enriched uranium, a loose nuclear weapon, nuclear materials, fissionable material throughout the world. Even more of a threat than nuclear weapons is a loose nuclear weapon crossing the border. So what we need is an international agreement, but the key has to be diplomacy.\nAnd I have -- in the fourth row there's a man named Bill Barloon, who I rescued from an Iraqi prison in Abu Ghraib. And it's going to take leadership, and it's going to take diplomacy. It's going to take negotiation. I went head to head with Saddam Hussein, and I brought two Americans out. Bill Barloon is one. And the greatest words I heard after I got them out was, \"Thank you.\" And then I said, \"I'm taking you home.\" That's diplomacy. That means talking to the Irans, to the Syrias, to the North Korea. I've done it all my life as a diplomat, as a U.N. ambassador, as a special envoy, as a hostage negotiator. I've got the most international experience here, with all due respect. There's a lot of good international experience here, but I've gone head to head in North Korea, and we got back -- we got back six remains of our soldiers six months ago.\nWe got the North Koreans to stop their nuclear reactor. And so I believe it's important that we have a leader not just that can bring people together, but could resolve some of the thorniest problems we have.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Congressman Kucinich, same question.\nREP. KUCINICH: With all due respect to our friends from the media here, the media itself has to be careful how you frame these questions. We don't want to be put in a position where we are taking this country to the threshold of war. The media did play a role in taking us into war in Iraq, and I'm urging the members of the media to urge restraint upon you and our president, whose rhetoric is out of control.\nI would go to Iran and I would urge Iran not just to not have nuclear weapons; I would urge them to give up nuclear power because nuclear power is the most expensive type of power there is. It is not a sustainable type of power because of the cost of it. It -- it is unsafe. I would urge Iran to give up nuclear power.\nBut I would also do -- do something further. It is time that the United States government enforced and -- and participated in fully the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which calls for the abolition of all nuclear weapons.\nWe must lead the way and we must have a president who understands the danger of these nuclear weapons, and have America lead the way among all nations towards nuclear abolition. When we do that, we will have the credibility to go to an Iran, and any other nation that may have desire for a nuclear power, to say, look, we want to take it in a different direction; we are not going to stand by and watch our country lost because we are ratcheting up the rhetoric towards war against Iran.\nWe have to stop this, Tim. We have to stop ratcheting up the rhetoric for war. We really need to stop it.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, elsewhere in the region, let's talk about Iraq. One of your military advisers, retired Lieutenant General Claudia Kennedy, while campaigning for you in New Hampshire, was recently quoted saying, quote, \"I don't oppose the war. I have never heard Senator Clinton say, I oppose the war,\" closed quote.\nSenator Clinton, do you oppose the war in Iraq?\nSEN. CLINTON: Absolutely but I do not, and I don't think any of us do, oppose the brave young men and women who have fought this war with such distinction and heroism.\nYou know, I have said repeatedly that I will begin to bring our troops home as soon as I am president, because it is abundantly clear that President Bush does not intend to end the war while he is still president. In order to do that, we're going to have to get the Joint Chiefs and my secretary of Defense and advisers together to start the planning, to move as quickly as possible, because I don't believe that the planning has been sufficiently undertaken in the Pentagon under this administration. But we've got to do more. We have to try to get the Iraqi government to understand its obligations, because there is no military solution, and they have thus far failed to do so.\nAnd finally, we need to engage in diplomacy with respect to Iraq. You know, we have a big diplomatic apparatus. This president doesn't use it. He relies on a very small group of people. I think that's a terrible mistake. In addition to the Foreign Service officers, I would bring in a lot of other distinguished Americans who have experience, people, you know, like my colleagues Bill and Joe and Chris.\nWe need a lot of Americans trying to fan out across the world following President Bush because he's going to leave so many problems. His policies have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies. And Iraq and Iran are tinderboxes, the Middle East, Pakistan. I agree with Joe. The Afghanistan situation. Everywhere you look in the world, we've got work to do. And I think we've got to do more than just send our young men and women out. That is not an appropriate use of their power.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, was Senator Clinton's answer to the opposition of the Iraq war question consistent, in your view?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I don't think it's consistent with the Iran resolution, for example, which specifically stated that we should structure our forces in Iraq with an eye towards blunting Iranian influence. It is yet another rationale for what we're doing in Iraq, and I think that's a mistake.\nNow, I agree that we've got to focus on diplomacy. The president has to lead that diplomacy, which is why I've said I would convene a meeting of Muslim leaders upon taking office because I think we have to send a strong signal that we are willing to listen and not just talk, and certainly not just dictate or engage in military action.\nBut the -- the real key for the next president is someone who has the credibility of not having been one of the co-authors of this engagement in Iraq. And I think I am in a strong position to be able to say I thought this was a bad idea from the first -- in the first place, we now have to fix it, we have to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in, but we nevertheless have to take steps that are not only engaging Iraqis -- the Shi'a, the Sunni and the Kurds -- but also engaging Iran, Syria and other powers in the region.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Edwards, same question.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Well, I -- here's what I want. I want to make certain that voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and all across America -- Democrats, independents -- understand that you have choices in this election, very clear choices. If you believe that combat missions should be continued in Iraq over the long term, if you believe that combat troops should remain stationed in Iraq, and if you believe there should be no actual timetable for withdrawal, then Senator Clinton's your candidate.\nI don't. I think that we need to end combat missions; we need to get combat troops out of Iraq. As president of the United States, I will do that. I think it's a requirement of leadership as president, and I will do it in my first year in office. Combat missions ended, combat troops out of Iraq, period. So there's a very clear choice here between the candidates.\nAnd the second thing that I want to be certain that voters are aware of, when we talk -- we've had long discussion about Iran, and Barack just made the connection to Iran, and there is a very clear connection, because we need to learn from the past. And what we've learned from the past is you cannot trust this president, and what I worry about is if Bush invades Iran six months from now, I mean, are we going to hear, \"If I only I had known then what I know now\"? Well, we know enough now to know we have to stand up to this president.\nAnd the second point I would make is, I was surprised by Senator Clinton's vote, I'll be honest about that, and then I saw an explanation of it in The New York Times for her vote, which basically said she was moving from primary mode to general election mode. I think that our responsibility as presidential candidates is to be in tell-the-truth mode all the time. We should not be saying something different in the primary than we say in the general election.\nI think that's what Americans have been hearing from George Bush, and I think they're looking for something different, and voters have a choice in this election.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, 30-second rebuttal.\nSEN. CLINTON: May I -- well, I -- I need to rebut this. I don't know where to start.\nNumber one, when we talk about combat missions in Iraq, my understanding is that we had the same agreement, most of us, on this stage, that we would bring out combat troops, but we would pursue a mission against al Qaeda in Iraq if they remained a threat. Now, I don't know how you pursue al Qaeda without engaging them in combat. So I think we're having a semantic difference here.\nI think we should get as many of the combat troops out as quickly as possible. If we leave any troops in, like Special Operations, to go after al Qaeda in Iraq, I assume that we don't want them just sitting around and watching them; we want them to engage them. That is a very limited mission. That is what I have said consistently.\nAnd you know, when it comes to where I stand, I have been explaining that to the American people. I stand for ending the war in Iraq, bringing our troops home. But I also know it's going to be complicated, and it's going to take time. And I intend to do it in a responsible manner that is as safe for our troops as possible. We're going to have troops remaining there, guarding our embassy. We may have a continuing training mission, and we may have a mission against al Qaeda in Iraq. So that's a very big difference than having the 160,000 troops that George Bush has there today.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. And a brief housekeeping note here: we have built two or three rather short breaks into tonight's program, this two-hour debate tonight.\nAnd we're going to choose to take the first of them right now, mostly so everyone can take a breath, on this hot stage, on this otherwise cool night in Philadelphia. We will continue with our debate, from the campus of Drexel University in Philadelphia, right after this.\n(Announcements.)\nMR. WILLIAMS: We are back from the campus of Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, resuming what will be tonight a two- hour debate.\nAnd we're going to start with another subject at the top of this segment. Senator Clinton, it will go to you. It speaks to electability.\nEarlier this month, Republican presidential front-runner Rudolph Giuliani said this about you, quote, \"I don't know Hillary's experience. She's never run a city. She's never run a state. She's never run a business. She's never met a payroll. She's never been responsible for the safety and security of millions of people, much less even hundreds of people. So I'm trying to figure out where the experience is here.\" End of quote.\nSenator, how do you respond to the former mayor of New York?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I think the kind of experience that the Republican nominees are exhibiting is the kind of experience we don't need. And I think my experience of 35 years as an advocate for children and families, as a citizen activist, as someone who helped to bring educational reform and health care reform to Arkansas, bringing the Children's Health Insurance Program to fruition during the years in the White House, my time in the Senate, I think my experience on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue -- but it's really about what's at stake in this election and who can deliver the change that we all know this country desperately needs.\nAnd in a perverse way, I think that, you know, the Republicans and their constant obsession with me demonstrates clearly that they obviously think that I am communicating effectively about what I will do as president.\nAnd I am trying to do that because it matters greatly. We've got to turn the page on George Bush and Dick Cheney. In fact, we have to throw the whole book away. This has been a disastrous period in American history, and we hope it will be aberration. Then we need to get back to doing what will work again here at home and around the world.\nAnd I've set forth big goals to restore America's leadership, to once again rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class, to reform our government, and to reclaim the future for our children, and that means ending the war in Iraq, having an energy policy that works and creates jobs, having health care for everyone, having an education system from pre-kindergarten to college affordability and so much more.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, I'd like to follow up because, in terms of your experience as first lady, in order to give the American people an opportunity to make a judgment about your experience, would you allow the National Archives to release the documents about your communications with the president, the advice you gave, because, as you well know, President Clinton has asked the National Archives not to do anything until 2012?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, actually, Tim, the Archives is moving as rapidly as the Archives moves. There's about 20 million pieces of paper there and they are moving, and they are releasing as they do their process. And I am fully in favor of that.\nNow, all of the records, as far as I know, about what we did with health care, those are already available. Others are becoming available. And I think that, you know, the Archives will continue to move as rapidly as the circumstances and processes demand.\nMR. RUSSERT: But there was a letter written by President Clinton specifically asking that any communication between you and the president not be made available to the public until 2012. Would you lift that ban?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, that's not my decision to make. And I don't believe that any president or first lady has. But certainly we'll move as quickly as our circumstances and the processes of the National Archives permits.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, your hand's up?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, look, I'm glad that Hillary took the phrase \"turn the page.\" It's a good one. But this is an example of not turning the page. We have just gone through one of the most secretive administrations in our history, and not releasing, I think, these records at the same time, Hillary, as you're making the claim that this is the basis for your experience, I think, is a problem.\nPart of what we have to do is invite the American people back to participate in their government again. Part of what we need to do is rebuild trust in our government again.\nAnd that means being open and transparent and accountable to the American people.\nAnd that's one of the hallmarks of my previous work in the state legislature, in the United States Senate -- making sure that Americans know where our money's going, what earmarks are out there, what kinds of pork barrel spending is being done, who's bundling money for who. And that, I think, is part of the job of the next president, is making Americans believe that our government is working for them because right now, they don't feel like it's working for them. They feel like it's working for special interests, and it's working for corporations.\nOne last point I want to make: Part of the reason that Republicans, I think, are obsessed with you, Hillary, is because that's a fight they're very comfortable having. It is the fight that we've been through since the '90s. And part of the job of the next president is to break the gridlock and to get Democrats and independents and Republicans to start working together to solve these big problems, like health care or climate change or energy.\nAnd what we don't need is another eight years of bickering. And that's precisely why I'm running for president. Because one of the things I've been able to do throughout my political career is to bring people together to get things done.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Edwards had his hand up. Then I want to give Senator Clinton the chance to respond.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Thank you very much.\nI mean, another perspective on why the Republicans keep talking about Senator Clinton is, Senator, she -- they may actually want to run against you, and that's the reason they keep bringing you up.\nWhat I would say is Senator Clinton just said that she believes we desperately need change in this country, and I -- I agree with that. I actually think we have a system that's broken. It's rigged, it's corrupt, and it does not work for the American people, and it's time we start telling the truth about that. Too much influence from entrenched interests -- insurance companies, drug companies, oil companies. Too much influence from Washington lobbyists.\nAnd so the question I think that voters have to ask themselves is, do you believe that the candidate who's raised the most money from Washington lobbyists, Democrat or Republican; the candidate who's raised the most money from the health industry -- drug companies, health insurance companies; the candidate who's raised the most money from the defense industry, Republican or Democrat; who -- and the answer to all those questions is that's Senator Clinton -- will she be the person who brings about the change in this country? You know, I -- I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in the Tooth Fairy, but I don't think that's going to happen. I really don't.\nAnd I -- I think that if people want the status quo, Senator Clinton's your candidate. That's what I believe. If they want real change, then they need somebody who tells the truth about a system that doesn't work, who believes that this may actually be the first generation -- we're all worried about this being the first generation that doesn't leave the world and America better for our children, unlike 20 generations that came before us.\nThis is not an abstract thing. This is not about lobbyists. Matter of fact, it's not about any of us. The truth is, when this election is over, I'm going to be fine. Senator Clinton's going to be fine. Senator Obama's going to be fine. The question is, will America be fine? And will we ensure -- and I think this is the great moral test of our generation -- will we ensure that our children have a better life than we've had? That's the responsibility we have.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, please.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I think we were making progress in the 1990s, and I'm very proud of the progress we're making until, unfortunately, the Supreme Court handed the presidency to George Bush. And we have been living with the consequences ever since. And I think it is time for us to step up and say we're going to change the way Washington works. And I've laid out very specific plans about how to do that. I'm going to take $10 billion away from a lot of these industries, starting with money from the HMOs that are getting too much out of Medicare, starting with the no-bid contracts for Halliburton, starting with the defense industry that needs to be pared down and reined in. I've been very clear about that, and I intend to implement that.\nYou know, change is just a word if you don't have the strength and experience to actually make it happen.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, to you let's apply the -- what we'll call the Giuliani question about having run a city, a state, a payroll.\nWhat specifically is your relevant experience for being president?\nSEN. OBAMA: The experience I have in politics is primarily legislative, but here's the experience that I think the next president needs. I think the next president has to be able to get people to work together to get things done even when they disagree, and I've done that. You know, when I was in Illinois we brought police officers and civil rights advocates together to reform a death penalty system that had sent 13 innocent men to death row, and we ended up passing it unanimously, even though originally people had said it couldn't be done.\nDennis earlier was talking about the need to work on nonproliferation issues. I've worked with Dick Lugar, Republican spokesperson for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to focus on the next generation of nonproliferation efforts. Now that I think is critical experience.\nI also think it is critical for the next president to be experienced to stand up to special interests. I'm glad Hillary's talking about it, but I'm the only person on this stage who has worked actively just last year passing -- along with Russ Feingold -- some of the toughest ethics reforms since Watergate -- making sure that lobbyists could not provide gifts and meals to congressman, making sure the bundling of monies by lobbyists was disclosed.\nAnd finally, I think we've got to have a president who has the experience of standing up even when it's not easy, which is what I did in 2002 when I stood up against this war in Iraq 10 days before the authorization. It is -- that is the kind of judgment that I'm displaying during this campaign when I go to Detroit and I say to the automakers that they need to raise fuel efficiency standards; not in front of some environmental group.\nThat kind of consistency and principled leadership, I think, is what is going to move us in the next direction. That's what I'll provide as president.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Governor Richardson, though there was broad disagreement on this panel about you having the only negotiation experience, you did raise your qualifications earlier. Is your contention that, say, the top three front-runners in this race are less qualified than you are to be president?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: No. And I'm positive -- you know what I'm hearing here, I'm hearing this holier-than-thou attitude toward Senator Clinton. That it's bothering me because it's pretty close to personal attacks that we don't need. Do we trust her? Do we -- she takes money from special interests.\nWe need to be positive in this campaign. Yes, we need to point out our differences, and I have big differences with her. Over the war. I would get all our troops out. Over No Child Left Behind. I'd get rid of it.\nI also have differences over Iran. I think that was the wrong vote for her to cast, because I think it was saber-rattling.\nBut I think it's important that we save the ammunition for the Republicans. If we continue, I believe, harping on the past and not focusing on the future, look, the reality on the electability issue is, the last senator that was elected president was 40 years ago. His name was John F. Kennedy.\nWe elect governors as president. 7 out of the last 8 have been either governors or ex-governors. And my view is that I know how to bring people together. More than all the issues that we're talking about, it's who can govern, who can manage.\nI'm the only CEO in this race. I've balanced budgets. I've provided health care to kids under 12. I've improved education. I've got foreign policy experience. I've negotiated with foreign countries as a diplomat, as a hostage negotiator.\nYeah, I do think it is substantially more than my colleagues, although they have a strong record. But the important thing is that we need to stay positive. We need to have disagreements on the issues, not on whether you can trust. I trust Senator Clinton but I don't agree with her on a majority of issues.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Dodd, you gave an interview to our local NBC station here today alluding to problems with Senator Clinton's national electability. What is the point you want to make on that score?\nSEN. DODD: Well, first of all, I think electability is a very critical issue. Look, at the end of this process here, we need to have a Democrat in the White House come January 20th, 2009.\nThat is essential, in my view, to get this country back on its feet again, to restore our moral authority in the world. It is a critical question.\nWhether it's fair or not fair, the fact of the matter is that my colleague from -- from New York, Senator Clinton, there are 50 percent of the American public that say they're not going to vote for her. I'm not saying that people don't know already. I don't necessarily like it, but those are the facts. We as a party certainly have to take that into consideration.\nBut let me add, since the matter's been brought up here, as well here, this situation -- ethics situation does bother me in a sense, what Bill Richardson has alluded to. Our friend John Edwards here, certainly taking money from the trial bar, special interest group, here to be condemning one candidate for taking money from one group as opposed to another.\nI happen to believe we ought to have public financing for our campaigns. I've supported that for 25 years. I managed the McCain- Feingold legislation on the floor of the United States Senate several years ago. I won't take a backseat to anybody on trying to reform our political process.\nBut let's remember what's at stake here. We need to elect a Democrat -- a Democrat that's electable and a Democrat that can bring to the country together. For 26 years I have, in every major landmark piece of legislation, had a Republican as my cosponsor because no one party is going to straighten all of this out. When I started the Children's Caucus in 1981, I did it with Arlen Specter of this state. When I wrote the Family and Medical Leave bill, I did it with Kit Bond and Dan Coats.\nWhen I wrote the first childcare legislation since World War II, I did it with Orrin Hatch -- not because I agreed with him on any other issue, but because I knew in order to move our country forward we had to have leadership in this country that understood the value of reaching out and finding common ground with people.\nSo electability and the ability to govern and to do so immediately are important, but don't discount the importance of electability. It's a very important hurdle.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Edwards, do you want to take 30 seconds and respond on situational ethics?\nSEN. EDWARDS: I do.\nFirst of all, let me be absolutely clear about this. I think I said it a few minutes ago. Nobody on this stage is pure, and that absolutely includes me. And I am not perfect, nor do I claim to be. It is true that I, like Senator Obama, have taken no money from Washington lobbyists in this campaign and no money from special interest PACs, but I'm not interested in patting myself on the back or actually talking about anybody personally on this stage.\nAnd I completely disagree with what Bill said. This is not about the past. This is about the future. This is about whether we believe this system works. I mean, we are here in Philadelphia where the Founding Fathers decided that the power, the sovereign power in this government should not reside with the rich and the powerful; it ought to reside with the people. And everybody in America can see what's happening now. We don't have universal health care because of drug companies, insurance companies and their lobbyists.\nWell, the reason we haven't tackled global warming is because of oil companies, power companies and their lobbyists.\nAnd the question is, what are we going to do for our children? I mean, are -- I'll say this to every voter who's watching this debate: Are you -- listen, we've all stood by and watched this happen. That includes me. I'm guilty, guilty as charged.\nBut the question is, are you willing to look your children in the eye tonight and say, \"I'm going to turn this mess over to you\"? Because if you turn your back on the incompetence and the corruption that exists in Washington today, that's exactly what you're saying. You're saying, \"I'm going to let my children and my grandchildren take care of that.\" I'm not willing to do that.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Congressman Kucinich, you're smiling. Why?\nREP. KUCINICH: Well, I'm -- I'm glad to hear people take a stand for integrity. When people get money from New York hedge funds and then they attack another person for getting money from Washington interest groups, you know what? They're both right. So I'm not going to get in the middle of that one.\nNow, I want to go beyond that. The American people have a right to know what's different here among all these candidates. We haven't really established that, I don't think. And I'm the only one up here who stands for a not-for-profit health care system, which means that the insurance industry has enormous influence. In this race, why shouldn't Democrats stand for universal single-payer not-for-profit, with 46 million Americans under- -- uninsured and 50 million Americans underinsured?\nTim, I want to tell you something. There's got to be people watching this at home saying, \"Hey, you haven't talked about me losing my job because of NAFTA.\" Well, I'll cancel NAFTA and -- and -- and the WTO and have trade that's based on workers' rights, human rights and environmental quality principles.\nSomebody's got to be saying, \"Wait a minute, who's talking about whether I'm going to have health care?\" I've introduced the bill, H.R. 676.\nYou have somebody worried about losing their home. We need to cancel Bush's tax cuts and flip them so we give the benefit to the 80 percent while currently it's going to the top 1 percent so people will have more money so they can save their homes.\nI mean, we have to talk about people's practical aspirations here. And if we don't do that tonight, this debate is a total flop.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Biden, you said recently, \"While Mrs. Clinton was meeting socially with the prime minister of a country, I was sitting down and negotiating with them. I know my experience is considerably deeper and more relevant.\" Do you stand by that quote? And is your inference that she is less qualified than you to be president?\nSEN. BIDEN: I'm not running against Hillary Clinton. I'm running to lead the free world. I'm running to lead this country.\nAnd the irony is Rudy -- Rudy Giuliani, probably the most underqualified man since George Bush to seek the presidency -- (laughter, scattered applause) -- is here talking about any of the people here. Rudy Giuliani. I mean, think about it. Rudy Giuliani. There's -- there's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun and a verb and 9/11. I mean, there's nothing else. (Laughter.)\nThere's nothing else. (Applause.) And I mean it sincerely. He is genuinely not qualified to be president.\nHere's a man who brags about how he made the city safe. It was the Biden crime bill, that became the Clinton crime bill, that allowed him to do that. They wipe it out; he's remained silent. The 9/11 commission comes along and says the way to keep your city safe is to do the following things. He's been silent. He's been -- done nothing.\nAnd now he's talking about he's going to go in and he will demonstrate to Iran he's going to in fact lay down the law. This man is truly not qualified to be president. I'm looking forward to running against Rudy Giuliani. (Laughter.)\nAnd with regard to my experience, hey, Bill, 1979 I was -- I led a delegation of 19 senators negotiating the START agreement with Brezhnev. I was deeply involved in Bosnia, as the first lady and now Senator Clinton will tell you. I've been negotiating while you were still in Congress, man.\nAnd so the point is -- and I introduced the first public financing bill. If you all had been around long enough, you may -- no, maybe have been around too long, they forget all the wonderful things I've done here.\nBut anyway -- (laughter) -- all kidding aside -- (laughter) -- I'm running not against Hillary Clinton or anybody on this stage. I'm running to be the leader of this country, to put it back on track and to regain control in the world which is lost.\nMR. WILLIAMS: On that note, Tim Russert's going to take us into a segment on Social Security.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, I want to clear something up, which goes to the issue of credibility.\nYou were asked at the AARP debate whether or not you would consider taxing -- lifting the cap from 97,500, taxing that, raising more money for Social Security. You said, quote, \"It's a no.\" I asked you the same question in New Hampshire. You said no. Then you went to Iowa and you went up to Tod Bowman, a teacher, and had a conversation with him, saying, I would consider a -- lifting the cap perhaps above 200,000. You were overheard by an Associated Press reporter saying that.\nWhy do you have one public position and one private position?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, Tim, I don't. I have said consistently that my plan for Social Security is fiscal responsibility first, then to deal with any long-term challenges which, I agree, are ones that we're going to have to address. We would have a bipartisan commission. In the context of that, I think all of these would be considered.\nBut personally I do not want to balance Social Security on the backs of our seniors and middle class families. That's why I put fiscal responsibility first, because we have to change the Bush tax cuts, which I am committed to doing. We have to move back toward a more fair and progressive tax system and begin once again to move toward a balanced budget with a surplus.\nYou know, part of the idea in the '90s was not just so Bill would have a check mark next to his name in history, but so that we would have the resources to deal with a lot of these entitlement problems. George Bush understood that, the Republicans understood that. They wanted to decimate that balanced budget and a surplus because they knew that that would give them a free hand to try to privatize Social Security. I am not going to be repeating Republican talking points.\nSo when somebody asks me, would something like this be considered? Well, anything can be considered when we get to a bipartisan commission, but personally, I am not going to be advocating any specific fix until I am seriously approaching fiscal responsibility.\nMR. RUSSERT: But you did raise it as a possibility with Tod Boman.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but everybody knows what the possibilities are, Tim. Everybody knows that. But I do not -- I do not advocate it, I do not support it. I have laid out what I do believe, and I'm going to continue to emphasize that. I think for us to act like Social Security is in crisis is a Republican trap. We're playing on the Republican field, and I don't intend to do that.\nMR. RUSSERT: You called it a Republican talking point. Georgetown University, February 9th, 1998: We are in a -- you're heading to a looming fiscal crisis in Social Security. If nothing is done, it will require a huge tax increase in the payroll tax or 25 percent in Social Security benefits, Bill Clinton, 1998.\nThat's recent history, only two years to go in his term. Is that a Republican talking point?\nSEN. CLINTON: No, but what he did was to move us toward a balanced budget and a surplus. And if you go back and you look at the numbers, they really took off, starting in '98, '99, 2000, 2001. And that would have given a president who actually believed in Social Security, which George Bush does not, the resources and the options to make decisions, but not the kind of draconian decisions and certainly not the move toward privatization, which is what the Republicans have been advocating for as long as I can remember.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, you said in May that, quote, \"Everything is on the table\" when it comes to Social Security. You now have an ad up in Iowa which says that any benefit cuts are off, and raising retirement age are off. Why have you changed your mind?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, what I say is, is that that is not my plan.\nNow, I just want to go back to -- to what Senator Clinton said, because I think it's important for us not to engage in business as usual on Social Security, and talk straight. Everybody on this stage is against privatization, and we all fought against it, everybody.\nI absolutely agree that Social Security is not in crisis. It is a fundamentally sound system, but it does have a problem, long term.\nEven if we deal with the issue of fiscal responsibility, the trust fund is no longer being raided -- that's something that all of us are in favor of -- we've got 78 million baby boomers who are going to be retiring over the next couple of decades. That means more retirees, fewer workers to support those retirees. It is common sense that we are going to have to do something about it. That is not a Republican talking point. And if we don't deal with it now, it will get harder to deal with later.\nSo what I've said -- and I know some others on this stage have said -- is that among the options that are available, the best one is to lift the cap on the payroll tax, potentially exempting folks in the middle -- middle-class folks -- but making sure that the wealthy are paying more of their fair share, a little bit more.\nNow, it is important, if we are going to lead this country, to be clear to the American people about what our intentions are. And this is part of the politics that we have been playing, which is to try to muddle though, give convoluted answers. Ultimately, we then don't have a mandate and we can't bring about change, in part because we're afraid to give Republicans talking points. I am not fearful, just as Joe isn't, to have a debate about this with Rudy Giuliani because we've got the facts on our side. But we've got to be clear about those facts and not pretend that those facts don't exist.\nMR. RUSSERT: But when asked by The New York Times whether Senator Clinton has been truthful, you said no.\nSEN. OBAMA: What I said is that she has not been truthful and clear about this point that I just made, which is, we can talk about fiscal responsibility, and all of us agree with it. All of us oppose privatization. But even after we deal with those issues, we are still going to have an actuarial gap that has to be dealt with. It is not going to vanish. And if we have a moral responsibility to the next generation to make sure that Social Security is there -- the most successful program to lift seniors out of poverty that we've ever devised -- then we need to start acting now and having a serious conversation about it.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, Tim, I don't see any difference here.\nYou know, my view is we go toward fiscal responsibility, which is hard. It's not going to be easy inheriting what we're going to be inheriting from Bush and the Republicans. And there are some long- term challenges. I have no disagreement with that.\nBut I think the best way to handle them is within the context of a bipartisan commission. That's what worked in 1983, when Social Security was on the ropes. Our colleagues in the Senate had a hearing today talking about how they could move toward a bipartisan commission.\nAnd once there's a bipartisan commission, then we can see what we need to do. But I don't want these decisions to be made in a vacuum.\nI want it to be made in the face of moving back toward fiscal responsibility because that will influence which choices are actually better, and I certainly don't want to impose a trillion dollar tax increase in middle-class families or any kind of additional burdens our seniors.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, we're going to transfer into a new area here, a question specifically for you because you're in a rather unique position. It's about religion and misinformation.\nGovernor Romney misspoke twice on the same day confusing your name with that of Osama bin Laden. Your party is fond of talking about a potential swift-boating. Are you fearful of what happened to John McCain, for example, in South Carolina a few years back, confusion on the basis of things like names and religion?\nSEN. OBAMA: No, because I have confidence in the American people, and I don't pay much attention to what Mitt Romney has to say -- at least what he says this week; it may be different next week.\nBut there is no doubt that my background is not typical of a presidential candidate. I think everybody understands that, but that's part of what is so powerful about America is that it gives all of us the opportunity -- a woman, a Latino, myself -- the opportunity to run.\nAnd listen, when I was running for the United States Senate, everybody said, \"Nobody's going to vote for a black guy named Barack Obama. They can't even pronounce it.\" And we ended up winning by 20 points in the primary and 30 points in the general election.\nThe way to respond to swiftboating is to respond forcefully, rapidly and truthfully. And I have absolute confidence in the American people's capacity to absorb the truth as long as we are forceful in that presentation. And we are seeing it as we travel all across the country. We have received enormous support in states where, frankly, there aren't a lot of African Americans and there aren't a lot of Obamas.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let's take this opportunity to fit in what will be the second of three breaks tonight. We'll be back with more from the campus of Drexel University in Philadelphia right after this. (Applause.)\n(Announcements.)\nMR. WILLIAMS: We are back from the campus of Drexel University here in Philadelphia. Our debate continues.\nNow we're going to introduce some rule changes as we go. And for this next question alone in this segment, we're going to enforce a -- or try to -- a 30-second limit on responses. We're going to begin with Senator Dodd and go right down the panel.\nMost experts believe we're looking at $100 a barrel oil prices, perhaps very soon. Most experts further believe there are some folks in America who may be paying 50 percent more for things like heating oil this winter, let's say where winters are difficult in two states that come to mind, Iowa and New Hampshire, say nothing of your home state of Connecticut. As a member of the U.S. Senate, are these people doomed to paying more, to suffering through these energy costs this winter, Senator? Aside from blue-ribbon panels, what can be done right now about what afflicts the United States on this issue of energy?\nSEN. DODD: Well, I would suggest here what Senator Byron Dorgan and I have offered twice in the last couple of years, and that was to say that any increase in price over $40 a barrel either to be reinvested in alternative energies or new exploration here, or provide a direct rebate to consumers across the country to reduce the costs that you've exactly described here, with these increases in the price of a barrel of oil. That would provide some immediate relief. Low- Income Energy Assistance and other programs, which I and others have championed over the years to provide assistance to those who are going to be in desperate conditions, with help as well. But that's the short-term answer to this problem.\nThe longer-term answer's obviously how to stop what we do every single day, and that is borrow a billion dollars every single day to buy foreign oil offshore here. We ought to be moving more directly, obviously, to energy independence here. I'd invite people to ChrisDodd.com to get a long, detailed explanation of exactly how do that.\nMR. WILLIAMS: We're going to try to enforce this time limit.\nSenator Biden.\nSEN. BIDEN: A big piece of that cost is risk. People are betting on things getting worse. That old joke -- you know, when you're in a hole, you should stop digging. Why do we continue to cause the price of oil to rise by continuing to rattle a saber with Iran? Why do we continue to cause the price of oil to rise by a foreign policy that is (absolutely moribund ?) of any center? And what we have to do immediately to take care of those people in Iowa and New Hampshire, provide for emergency fuel assistance.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Edwards.\nSEN. EDWARDS: Well, what we can do in the short term and I will do as president is ensure that my Justice Department investigates what these oil companies who are vertically integrated, you know, from refinery to pump, are doing.\nBut I think there's something else. And we've talked a lot about being straight with people tonight. I think it's really important -- every four years, the presidential candidates roll through Iowa and New Hampshire, promise this, promise that, promise this. Here's the truth. We need to ask Americans to be patriotic about something other than war. And I want to be the president who says to America: We're in this together.\nWe're going to have to be willing to sacrifice. If we love this country enough, we're going to have to conserve in our homes and our work places and through our behavior to make America what it's capable of being.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I agree with everything that my colleagues have just said. I think it's important that we do have enough money in LIHEAP. It's a battle we fight every year against the Republicans -- that's the program to help consumers pay their bills. We should have a crash program on weatherization, which will help to drive those bills down. We need to do more to investigate, as John says, and we might even have to look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which the Bush administration has been filling up beyond any expectation of need, for the short term at least. But we also have to have a serious move toward energy efficiency and conservation, and that is where we need to get people to be more conscious to do it for themselves.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama.\nSEN. OBAMA: As Joe pointed out, out of the $90 that it's costing right now for a barrel, about 30 percent of that is just risk; it's not dictated by supply and demand. If we can lower the rhetoric with respect to military action in the Middle East, that will have an immediate impact. All the other suggestions that have been made are sound, but one of the things that we have to do with respect to conservation is increase fuel efficiency standards on cars. And we have to make that commitment not just by going to environmentalist groups and saying we're going to do it, but doing what I did, which is go to Detroit, talking to the automakers. Joe and I have been working on legislation that would provide them the incentives to start making those shifts.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Congressman Kucinich.\nREP. KUCINICH: Everyone knows that the war against Iraq was about oil. This administration is trying to gain control of Iraq's oil with the help of Congress. It's time we had a president who stood for the Constitution and international law, and that's exactly what I'll do. Everyone knows that the saber-rattling against Iran is driving up the price of oil.\nWe have to stop the war in Iraq, bring our troops home, end the occupation, have an international security and peacekeeping force that moves in as our troops leave. We have to stop planning for war against Iran. We have to insist that we enforce the Constitution of the United States, which this president continues to violate. And again I state that the president and the vice president should be subject to impeachment. Then we can start to get control of our energy policies by rejecting this doctrine of preemption, which is not worthy of this nation.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you, Congressman.\nGovernor Richardson.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: You need an energy revolution in this country, an Apollo program that does the following.\nOne: reduces consumption of fossil fuels by 50 percent by 2020. Fuel efficiency: I'm going to be specific -- 50 miles per gallon. A renewable portfolio standard -- in other words, all our electricity in America, 30 percent renewable sources. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2040, by 30 percent by 2020, a cap-and- trade system, energy efficiency.\nTwo: You've got to ask the American people to sacrifice a little bit.\nWhat does that mean? That means when we use appliances, mass transit, air conditioning, that we all bound together to reduce this dependence on foreign oil that affects our national security. When 65 percent of your oil is imported, when the planet -- when the planet is polluted by fossil fuels and man-made pollution, it is American leadership and it's presidential leadership, and it has to be an energy revolution, not these little energy bills that the Congress keeps passing that are meaningless.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you, Governor.\nA question for Senator Dodd, a question to you alone, Senator, about this intersection of environment and sacrifice. So many people have been saddened by the pictures these past few days from Southern California. There are reports that major cities in the state of Georgia are threatened with running out of drinking water in a matter of days. Are you truly prepared to lead on a national scale the kind of sacrifice it would require where it intersects with the environment?\nSEN. DODD: Well, I think you've got to -- I find it somewhat startling here that Ronald Reagan's former secretary of State and George Bush's first economic -- chief economic adviser are, frankly, more courageous and bold on energy policy than my fellow competitors here for this job, the presidency.\nI've called for a corporate carbon tax. All of us share the same goals here of achieving energy independence, reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and the carbons they emit. But you're not going to achieve that unless you deal with price, quite frankly, here. And there's a direct correlation between continuing a policy that produces the CO2 emissions and the health hazards to our country and the climate change problems here.\nYou've got to deal with price because, frankly, consumers are not going to be in a position where they can afford the more expensive fuels, the alternative fuels and technologies. So the corporate carbon tax, taxing carbon, is a critical element if you're going to achieve this kind of energy change we need in our country.\nThat directly bears on the kinds of problems we're seeing. There's no doubt in my mind that there's a correlation between what you've just described, Brian, and energy policy here, not to mention the national security and economic security risks as a result of our continuing dependence on fossil fuels, particularly oil out of the Middle East.\nSo those are things that I advocate that no one else does on this stage here this evening. Al Gore has called it the most bold and honest plans. It's been called the blue ribbon -- or the gold standard, rather, by any of the energy policies that have been suggested by presidential candidates.\nThis is a major issue. It requires a hardship. A corporate carbon tax is not without a cost to it. I understand that. But the status quo of continuing borrowing a billion dollars every day to buy foreign oil, continuing the risk to our country, I think is unacceptable. That's why I'm advocating it.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Edwards, should there be a bottomless well of federal dollars for people who knowingly live in areas of this country that are disaster prone to rebuild their homes if lost in a disaster?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Well, I think that when families are devastated -- and we've lived with this in North Carolina because we've been regularly hit by hurricanes, and I've spent an awful lot of time in New Orleans. When families are hit by natural disasters, I think it is for the national community to be there for them. I think that's our joint responsibility as a national community to be there for them.\nAnd my view about what's happened, particularly in New Orleans, is it's absolutely heartbreaking to see what's happened there because this is a perfect example of a government that's a mess and the American people who are absolutely extraordinary. I mean, you look at how America has responded to this strategy. They have been volunteering, contributing; I took 700 college kids down to New Orleans who gave up their spring break to go down there and work to help rehabilitate houses. I was so inspired and proud of those young kids.\nBut the government has been a complete disaster, and contracts have been let to these multinational corporations instead of allowing the people of New Orleans to rebuild their own city. My view is we didn't need a surge in Baghdad, we need a surge in New Orleans. We need to be there for our people who are struggling.\nAnd I do think we can be smart about planning. I think actually in the case of New Orleans there was an extraordinary opportunity to rebuild a city that was more economically integrated, more racially integrated. Those pictures that we saw coming out of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans I think broke a lot of people's hearts, and I think actually was a wake-up call to a lot of Americans who didn't realize that kind of problem existed in New Orleans.\nMR. WILLIAMS: So does smarter mean any limits? Let's just take 20 seconds more here. From Malibu to the Outer Banks down to Florida, should there be unlimited federal dollars?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Of course, we have to be smart. We have to be environmentally sensitive. There's actually -- on the coast of North Carolina we've done a great deal to do that, to preserve wetlands for example, which are a crucial barrier to help protect our coasts. But yes, smart, but when a -- when a natural disaster comes, our country needs to be there for our people.\nMR. WILLIAMS: To Tim Russert.\nMR. RUSSERT: I'd like to talk about taxes. Senator Clinton, I'd like to start with you because the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Charlie Rangel, is strong supporter of your campaign. He wants to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, but he also wants to have a 4 percent surtax on a single $150,000 income or a $200,000 married couple. You went to Harlem with your husband, with Charlie Rangel, and the former president said, quote, \"Charlie Rangel wants me to pay more taxes so you can pay less, and I think that's a good idea.\" Is that also your view?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, I am a great admirer of Chairman Rangel, and what he's trying to do is deal with a very serious problem. You know, the Alternative Minimum Tax was never intended to hit people who are in middle income, upper-middle income. It was meant for people who are rich and evading taxes.\nNow, I don't know all the details of what Charlie is recommending, but I certainly agree with the goal. We've got to do something with the Alternative Minimum Tax. There are a lot of ways of getting there. I want it to be fair and progressive. It starts in the House. It starts in the Ways and Means Committee, which he chairs.\nBut I think my husband was expressing an opinion that a lot of people who have been very fortunate and blessed over the last six years feel. You know, we've not been asked to sacrifice anything. You know, young men and women wearing the uniform of our country are dying and being maimed. We have the average American family losing $1,000 in income, and George Bush and his cronies can't figure out how they can give even more tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans.\nNow, I never thought Bill and I would be in that category, to be honest with you. So it's kind of a new experience but it's not one that makes us very comfortable, because we should be investing in new energy. We should be investing in college affordability, universal pre-K, the kind of health care plan that I've outlined. That's what we intend to do.\nBut we're going to have to deal with the AMT, something that the Republicans have refused to do because, very frankly, it hits people who are below their concern. They're concerned about the real top wage-earners. This hits people that are -- you know, the police chief. This hits people that are, you know, two-income families that are doing well.\nSo we're going to have to do something about it. I think Charlie's being very courageous in moving forward. I don't agree with all the details, but he's on the right track to say we've got to do something about the AMT.\nMR. RUSSERT: So in principle, you would be in favor of looking at a 4 percent surtax --\nSEN. CLINTON: No, I didn't say that, Tim. I said that I'm in favor of doing something about the AMT. How we do it and how we put the package together, everybody knows, is extremely complicated. It's not going to happen while George Bush is president; everybody knows that. I want to get to a fair and progressive tax system. The AMT has to be part of what we try to change when I'm president.\nAnd there are a lot of moving pieces here. You know, there are kinds of issues we're going to deal with as the tax cuts expire. I want to freeze the estate tax at the 2009 level of 7 million (dollars) for a couple. There's a lot of moving parts.\nSo I'm not going to get committed to a specific approach, but I applaud Chairman Rangel for beginning the conversation.\nMR. RUSSERT: But you will not campaign on the Rangel plan?\nSEN. CLINTON: No. No, I -- that's Charlie Rangel's plan, and as I say, I support and admire his willingness to take this on.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, would campaign on the Rangel plan?\nSEN. OBAMA: No, because I don't know all the details of it, and I may not agree with some aspects of it.\nBut let's broaden the conversation here. We're all traveling all across the country -- Iowa, New Hampshire. Everywhere you go you'll meet a single mother who is raising her kids, working at the same time, trying to go to college, and every one of her costs from health care to college tuition has gone up; home heating oil is going up. She can't even imagine the idea of saving.\nNow, in the meantime, we've got a 10,000-page tax code that is rife with corporate loopholes. There's a building in the Cayman Islands that supposedly houses 12,000 U.S. corporations, which means it's either the largest building in the world or the biggest tax rip- off in the world, and I think we know which one it is. So there has to be a restoration of balance in our tax code to help that single mom, to help a two-parent working family that are struggling to make ends meet.\nAnd so I put forward a very specific plan. I've said we are going to offset some of the payroll taxes that people are experiencing so that families who are making less than $50,000 a year get a larger break.\nI want to make sure that seniors who are making less than $50,000, that they get some relief in terms of the taxes on their Social Security.\nThose kinds of progressive tax steps, while closing loopholes and rolling back the Bush tax cuts to the top 1 percent, simply restores some fairness and a sense that we're all in this together as opposed to each of us being in it on our own.\nMR. RUSSERT: Congressman Kucinich, I want to move to the issue of hedge funds.\nREP. KUCINICH: Of?\nMR. RUSSERT: Hedge funds. Managers of hedge funds.\nREP. KUCINICH:\nMR. RUSSERT: There's a listing in the paper the other day of the hundred top managers of hedge funds. (Clearing his throat.) Excuse me. At the top, $1.5 billion. Number 100 makes $50 million. They pay a tax rate of 16 percent rather than ordinary income of 31, 32 percent.\nThe Democrats took control of Congress in November of '06. The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, said, \"We're not going to change it this year.\" Your reaction?\nREP. KUCINICH: It's one of the reasons why the American people are so distressed with the current condition of the Democratic Party. They won't stand up to Wall Street, with its over a trillion dollars of unregulated capital with hedge funds. They won't end the war, as our party promised to do in the 2006 election. They won't stand up to the insurance companies, the for-profit insurance companies, by joining me in a not-for-profit system.\nSo people are asking, then, what's the difference between Democrats and Republicans? Tim, my candidacy is a candidacy which will protect the interests of Main Street: no privatization of Social Security, make the hedge funds accountable, protect the small investors who are at risk with these public offerings of these hedge funds. My domestic policy subcommittee's been looking at this. I was one of the first ones on Capitol Hill to look at it.\nRight now, it's all about a redistribution of the wealth upwards, Tim. You know, the tax system is about redistributing the wealth upwards. The health care system redistributes the wealth upwards. Our energy policies redistribute the wealth upwards. We have to have a president who is independent enough to be able to stand up to these interest groups and push the Democratic Congress to defend the American people by -- by standing for the end of the war in Iraq; by standing for a universal, not-for-profit health care system; by standing for control of these oil companies, which are out of control; and finally, by standing for the Constitution.\nI will say it one more time: It's time for the Democratic Party to take a position on impeachment and for the House of Representatives to move the bill that I've introduced.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Edwards, you work for a hedge fund. By every estimate, we could save $25 billion over 10 years, new revenue--\nSEN. EDWARDS: Yes.\nMR. RUSSERT: -- to be used for a whole variety of programs. Why won't the Democratic Party act on this issue?\nSEN. EDWARDS: They should. I mean, this is an example of the extraordinary corruption that still exists in the system and the government.\nWhat happened was the Congress started to move to act, the lobbyists for the hedge funds descended and managed to kill it. It's just that simple. This is one, unfortunately, of a whole series of things that indicate that our government doesn't work the way it should and that corruption has crept into it. I wish it was the only thing. It's not the only thing.\nI mean, we have young men and women serving this country patriotically and heroically in Iraq, and we got a bunch of paid mercenaries moving around over there working for Blackwater and others who gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bush and the Republican Party. We've got politically connected people at home making millions of dollars while our men and women serve and put their lives on the line in Iraq.\nWe decided to try to keep the country safer by inspecting containers that come into this country, and who lobbied against it? The biggest company in America -- Wal-Mart. We've had trade deals that have cost us millions of jobs, and what did America get in return? We got millions of dangerous Chinese toys. These things are all evidence of a system that doesn't work.\nNow we can turn our backs on it and pretend it's not true and, as I said earlier, leave this mess to our children and our grandchildren.\nOr we can do what the founding fathers said we should do, and what has happened over and over in American history when this happened.\nThere is nothing the American people can't do. There's nothing wrong with the American people. They are strong, heroic, passionate, but their voice needs to be heard. The government belongs to them. It doesn't belong to this crowd of powerful, monied interest in Washington, D.C. And we have to be willing to say the truth about it and to change this system, so that our children actually can have a better life than we've had.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nWe're going to introduce the concept of a lightning round here. Take one question; go down the line. 30 seconds each -- a time we're going to enforce.\nAnd Governor Richardson, we're going to start with you. This is about something called Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. It's called TIMSS. A number of overseas nations took part in it. It found that overseas students spend an average of 193 days annually in school. The deficit compared to the U.S., where it's 180 days -- over 12 years, that adds up to one-year gap between education in the U.S. and overseas.\nDo you believe we in this country need to extend the school day and/or extend the school year? And will you commit to it?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Yes, I'd commit to it.\nAnd I'm glad finally education is coming up in a major debate. This is what I would do. We are 29th in the world in science and math compared to the EU, to countries in China and India. They graduate four or five times more engineers. There is a competitiveness gap here.\nThis is what I would do. One, I'd have 100,000 new science and math teachers. But we have to pay our teachers what they deserve, a minimum wage, what I believe, of $40,000 per year. I'd get rid of No Child Left Behind. I would have science and math academies.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Time.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: But in the high school curriculum, it's critically important --\nMR. WILLIAMS: Time.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- that we have more civics, more language, and art in the schools --\nMR. WILLIAMS: Governor?\nGOV. RICHARDSON: -- to provoke creativity in science and math proficiency.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thirty-second limit on these.\nCongressman?\nREP. KUCINICH: There's a statue above the House of Representatives of a woman whose arm is outstretched, and she is protecting a child sitting next to a pile of books. The title of this statue is Peace Protecting Genius. We need to have a country that stands for peace, that gets us out of the wars. We see the connection between global warring and global warming; we cut the Pentagon budget (15/50 ?) percent; $75 billion will go into a universal pre- kindergarten program so our children ages 3, 4 and 5 will have access to full-time day care, and more money would go into elementary and secondary education.\nIn addition to that, our college-age students need to know that with a Kucinich administration, they're guaranteed a two- or four-year college, tuition-free, that will be paid for by the government investing in our young people. That's the kind of approach I'll take to education.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you, Congressman.\nSenator.\nSEN. OBAMA: I do think that we have to have more instruction in the classroom. We're going to have to pay for that, and the federal government has to help strapped local districts in order to make that happen.\nWe also have to -- if we want to develop math and science curriculums, we've got to make math and science jobs attractive, which means increasing research grants. And this is something that is important not just for our competitiveness but also for our long-term national security. And when George Bush requests $196 billion for next year's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and is seeing a flat-lining of investment in science research, that makes it more difficult for us to encourage our children to go into sciences.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, thank you.\nSenator Clinton.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, very quickly, I would start at the very beginning. We need to do more to help our families prepare their children. A family is a child's first school. The parents are a child's first teacher. This is something that I've worked on for many years.\nWe need to really support it through nurse visitation or social worker, child care. We need to do more with the pre-Kindergarten program that I have proposed.\nIn addition, though, this has to fit into an overall innovation agenda which I have also set forth because we can't just say go to school longer. We need to do what happened when I was in school and Sputnik went up and our teacher said, your president wants you study math and science. That's what I want kids today to feel, that it's part of making sure we maintain our quality of life and our standard of living.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Edwards.\nSEN. EDWARDS: I think it's -- I think we still have two public school system in many way in -- ways in America. We have one for affluent communities and one for everybody else.\nI think the things that we need to do specifically: We should have universal pre-K for all four-year-olds. We ought to deal with nutritional and health care needs for younger children, younger than four years of age, starting at about age two. We should have a national teaching university so that we attract our most talented young people, send them out across America to teach in the toughest places to teach. We should give incentive pay to teachers who are willing to teach in the most difficult places. We should have second- chance schools for kids who are dropping out and college for any kid who's willing to work when they're in college.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nSenator Biden.\nSEN. BIDEN: Yes, I proposed it in 1987. We should go to school longer. We either have to assume that our kids are natively brighter than every other child in the world or that somehow we have to go to school longer.\nSecondly, we should have a minimum of 16 years of education.\nThirdly, we should be focusing on the socially economic disadvantaged, mostly minorities in inner cities. That's something we've ignored. We've paid no attention to it. We pretend they're the same circumstances every other kid in America. They start off with a half; half of the education gap exists before they set foot in the first classroom. That should be the focus.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Dodd.\nSEN. DODD: Well, Brian, this is a -- I've often said the single most important issue, and I've been asked the question over the years, what's the single most important issue? I always say education because it is the answer to every other problem we confront as a people here. We've got to begin -- I'm proud to have been named as Senator of the Decade by the Head Start association. All the ideas that are being advocated -- early childhood education -- are critical.\nThe federal government needs to be a better partner in all of this, not take away control locally. But -- well, a child's quality of education shouldn't depend on the accident of birth, and that's what happens too often in our country. The children in Philadelphia or in Connecticut or whoever else are going to be competing with children in Johannesburg, in Sydney, in Moscow and Beijing. We need to make the kind of investments jointly with our local communities. Higher education community colleges need to be more tuition free. I have an idea on how to do that, so that we provide that continuum from the earliest ages through higher education to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Keep you -- I have to keep you to time, Senator. Thank you.\nWe're going to continue this notion of a lightning round.\nAfter a quick break, we're going to start our next segment with a question handed to me by a student here at Drexel today. So again, our last break now, and a short one -- we will continue from Philadelphia right after this.\n(Announcements.)\nMR. WILLIAMS: We are back in Drexel University in Philadelphia.\nSomething we'd like to institute as the lightning round. We've put a clock and a noise, perhaps not loud or severe enough, on the screen. (Laughter.) As we tried this out in the previous segment, we're going to get try to get tougher and heavier concerning our enforcement.\nI promised to begin with a question handed me by a Drexel student today. It dovetails -- and Senator Dodd, we'll start with you -- it dovetails with what physicians have asked me to ask in this room, to this group here tonight.\nWith so many young people choosing not to go into medicine, so many veteran physicians choosing to get out or losing heart because their ability to earn an income is going down, how do you expect this nation to attract, to continue to attract quality people to medicine, Senator?\nSEN. DODD: Well, a couple of things, very quickly -- again, 30 seconds here. But first, obviously, providing some benefits to people who choose to get into that educational field and profession, so we can attract them to work in areas that they're needed in. That certainly needs to be done.\nI believe there's an answer to the medical malpractice issue, not the ones the Republicans have been proposing, but that's one of the issues that people are concerned about and, as part of a larger health care plan, ought to be a part of that, as we consider universality and other elements here, to make sure that this profession becomes one where the cost of insurance, the cost of other items here are not going to be so excessive that you'd be discouraged from going in that direction.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nSenator Biden.\nSEN. BIDEN: You got to help them pay off their -- they start off in the hole. They graduate and they have these gigantic bills, 40,000 bucks a year. They graduate hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. You got to give them the ability to write that off if they engage in public service, move into areas where they need doctors, number one.\nNow, number two, you got to get the insurance company out of looking over their soldiers in everything. They know the decisions to make. They know what they should be doing, and they should be rewarded for their decisions.\nThe light's on, and I want you to know I stay inside my time.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Very good. It's our new \"tough guy\" policy. (Laughter.)\nSEN. BIDEN: (Laughs.)\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nSenator Edwards.\nSEN. EDWARDS: What we need is a universal health care system that gets doctors out of the business of having to deal with insurance companies on a daily basis, to protect them from that.\nBut I want to talk about another piece of this, which is we have a nursing crisis in America, a serious nursing crisis. So what we need to do is expand our nursing schools, give scholarships to young people who are willing, when they go to nursing school, to commit to come out and go to the places that are underserved. We need to get rid of things like mandatory overtime. We need to have safer staff- to-patient ratios so that we can deal with this crisis for the men and women who actually provide a huge amount of the health care in this country.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nSenator Clinton.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, again, I agree with everything that has been said. In my proposal for the American Health Choices plan, we basically give the insurance companies an ultimatum. They have to get into the business of actually providing insurance instead of trying to avoid covering people. They cannot deny people coverage; they cannot exist -- have a pre-existing condition which is not covered. That is one of the biggest problems that doctors face. They face this constant barrage of harassment and bureaucratization from the private insurance world.\nWe also need to clean up Medicare and Medicaid. They're not as friendly as they need to be either.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nSenator Obama.\nSEN. OBAMA: We need to deal with the insurance companies. On Medicare and Medicaid, the reimbursement system is not working the way it should. And by the way, instituting a universal health care system that emphasizes prevention will free up dollars that potentially then can go to reimbursing doctors a little bit more, but we've got to deal with the cost of medical education. We have to deal with college costs generally. And that's why I've put forward proposals to get banks and middlemen out of the process and expand national service to encourage young people to go into these helping professions where we need a lot more (work ?).\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nCongressman?\nREP. KUCINICH: I'm the co-author of the bill H.R. 676, that establishes Medicare for all.\nAs long as you have the private insurance companies involved in providing health services, people aren't going to get care. Doctors know that the insurance companies want to substitute their judgment for their practice. Everyone knows that the insurance companies make money not providing health care.\nI'm standing for Medicare for all. There is no one else on this stage who is ready to take on the insurance companies directly by saying, you know, we should join every other industrialized nation in the world by caring for our people, by having a not-for-profit health care system. Just because you say it's universal doesn't mean it's not for profit. Even the insurance companies want a universal health care system.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Congressman.\nGovernor Richardson.\nGOV. RICHARDSON: Well, I have a specific proposal. Here it is. In exchange for two years of tuition paid by the government or loans, you give one year of national service to the country. This will attract more doctors and will enable students to afford a college education, when it's taken them 7 years to pay for this.\nGet rid of the student loan and bank agencies that are ripping off the system. Reestablish, on a general basis, doctor-patient relationship. Deal with Medicare reimbursement. Deal with ways that we also not forget health professionals, and that's nurses. That's others that, in our health care system, are not given the same opportunity.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Governor -- Governor, thank you.\nSenator Obama, a question to you. More than one columnist covering the field of transportation has compared our current commercial aviation business to Aeroflot in the old Soviet Union. One writer said, hold on, that's insulting to Aeroflot. They have raised their service.\nThe question to you is: How did this country get into a state where point to point air travel is no longer truly dependable? But more important, what would you be truly willing to do as president to fix it?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, this is a problem that's been building for a long time. The airlines got into trouble after deregulation, and it has continued and compounded. And they have now tried to make more money, and they're seeing better solvency, but they've done it on the backs of consumers. And anybody who's flying commercial knows that service has gone down and deteriorated further and further and further.\nSo as president of the United States, we have to look at making sure that there's enough airport capacity. We've got to place, potentially, some restrictions on some flights and encourage airlines to deal with the problems of remote areas that are having difficulty, in terms of making connections.\nBut this is going to require the kind of leadership that we have not seen from this president not just on transportation in the airlines industry, but in transportation generally. We haven't seen that kind of commitment on --\nMR. WILLIAMS: Time.\nSEN. OBAMA: -- Amtrak -- I'm sorry; I didn't realize this was the lightning round.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Yeah. Yeah, sorry, the rules --\nSEN. OBAMA: But generally speaking, this president has failed on this issue. We've got to keep -- we have to make much bigger progress than we've done.\nMR. WILLIAMS: We should probably repeat: the lighting round continues with my colleague, Tim Russert. (Laughter.)\nMR. RUSSERT: Thank you, Brian.\nSenator Clinton, Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer has proposed giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. You told the Nashua, New Hampshire editorial board it makes a lot of sense. Why does it make a lot of sense to give an illegal immigrant a driver's license?\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer is trying to do is fill the vacuum left by the failure of this administration to bring about comprehensive immigration reform. We know in New York we have several million at any one time who are in New York illegally. They are undocumented workers. They are driving on our roads. The possibility of them having an accident that harms themselves or others is just a matter of the odds. It's probability. So what Governor Spitzer is trying to do is to fill the vacuum.\nI believe we need to get back to comprehensive immigration reform because no state, no matter how well-intentioned, can fill this gap.\nThere needs to be federal action on immigration reform.\nMR. RUSSERT: Does anyone here believe an illegal immigrant should not have a driver's license?\nREP. KUCINICH: Believe what?\nMR. RUSSERT: An illegal immigrant should not have a driver's license.\nSEN. DODD: This is a privilege. And look, I'm as forthright and progressive on immigration policy as anyone here, but we're dealing with a serious problem here, we need to have people come forward. The idea that we're going to extend this privilege here of a driver's license, I think, is troublesome. And I think the American people are reacting to it.\nWe need to deal with security on our borders, we need to deal with the attraction that draws people here, we need to deal fairly with those who are here; but this is a privilege. Talk about health care, I have a different opinion. That affects the public health of all of us. But a license is a privilege, and that ought not to be extended, in my view.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Who else? Senator --\nSEN. CLINTON: I just want to add, I did not say that it should be done, but I certainly recognize why Governor Spitzer is trying to do it. And we have failed --\nSEN. DODD: Wait a minute. No, no, no. You said yes, you thought it made sense to do it.\nSEN. CLINTON: No, I didn't, Chris. But the point is, what are we going to do with all these illegal immigrants who are (driving ?) -- (inaudible)?\nSEN. DODD: Well, that's a legitimate issue. But driver's license goes too far, in my view.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, you may say that, but what is the identification if somebody runs into you today who is an undocumented worker --\nSEN. DODD: There's ways of dealing with that.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but --\nSEN. DODD: This is a privilege, not a right.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer has agreed to do is to have three different licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies the people who would be on the road.\nSEN. DODD: That's a bureaucratic nightmare.\nSEN. CLINTON: So it's not the full privilege.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, I just want to make sure what I heard. Do you, the New York Senator Hillary Clinton, support the New York governor's plan to give illegal immigrants a driver's license? You told the Nashua, New Hampshire, paper it made a lot of sense.\nSEN. CLINTON: It --\nMR. RUSSERT: Do you support his plan?\nSEN. CLINTON: You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. What is the governor supposed to do? He is dealing with a serious problem. We have failed, and George Bush has failed.\nDo I think this is the best thing for any governor to do? No. But do I understand the sense of real desperation, trying to get a handle on this? Remember, in New York we want to know who's in New York. We want people to come out of the shadows. He's making an honest effort to do it. We should have passed immigration reform.\nMR. WILLIAMS: New subject.\nSenator Edwards, you have young children. As you know, the Internet can be a bit of a cultural Wild West. Assuming a lot of homes don't have parental support, would you be in favor of any government guidelines on Internet content?\nSEN. EDWARDS: For children and try to protect children and using technology to protect children? I would.\nI want to add something that Chris Dodd just said a minute ago, because I don't want it to go unnoticed. Unless I missed something, Senator Clinton said two different things in the course of about two minutes just a few minutes ago, and I think this is a real issue for the country.\nI mean, America is looking for a president who will say the same thing, who will be consistent, who will be straight with them. Because what we've had for seven years is double-talk from Bush and from Cheney, and I think America deserves us to be straight.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, why are you nodding your head?\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I was confused on Senator Clinton's answer. I can't tell whether she was for it or against it, and I do think that is important. You know, one of the things that we have to do in this country is to be honest about the challenges that we face.\nImmigration is a difficult issue. But part of leadership is not just looking backwards and seeing what's popular, or trying to gauge popular sentiment. It's about setting a direction for the country, and that's what I intend to do as president.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Are you for it or against it?\nSEN. OBAMA: I think that it is a -- the right idea. And I disagree with Chris, because there is a public safety concern. We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer. That doesn't negate the need for us to reform illegal immigration.\nSEN. DODD: Governor Spitzer's idea --\nMR. RUSSERT: Congressman Kucinich, I want to move to a different area, because this is a serious question.\nThe godmother of your daughter, Shirley MacLaine, writes in her new book that you've cited a UFO over her home in Washington state -- (laughter) -- that you found the encounter extremely moving, that it was a triangular craft silent and hovering, that you felt a connection to your heart and heard direction in your mind.\nNow, did you see a UFO? (Laughter.)\nREP. KUCINICH: I did. And the rest of the account -- (interrupted by laughter) -- I didn't -- I -- it was unidentified flying object, okay. It's like -- it's unidentified. I saw something.\nNow, to answer your question, I'm moving my -- and I'm also going to move my campaign office to Roswell, New Mexico and another one, an extra, to New Hampshire, okay. (Laughter.) And also, you have to keep in mind that more -- that Jimmy Carter saw a UFO, and also that more people in this country have seen UFOs than, I think, approve of George Bush's presidency. (Laughter.)\nMR. RUSSERT: Actually --\nREP. KUCINICH: And so -- (laughter) -- wait. We're just getting started here.\nMR. RUSSERT: No, no. Let me -- 14 percent of Americans say they have seen UFOs.\nI'm going to move --\nREP. KUCINICH: What was the percentage?\nMR. RUSSERT: Fourteen percent.\nREP. KUCINICH: What was that percentage?\nMR. RUSSERT: Fourteen.\nREP. KUCINICH: Thank you.\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to see -- (laughter) -- I'm going to ask Senator Obama a question in the same line.\nThe three astronauts of Apollo 11 who went to the moon back in 1969 all said that they believe there is life beyond Earth. Do you agree?\nSEN. OBAMA: You know, I don't know, and I don't presume to know. What I know is there is life here on Earth -- (laughter) -- and -- and that we're not attending to life here on Earth. We're not taking care of kids who are alive and, unfortunately, are not getting health care. We're not taking care of senior citizens who are alive and are seeing their heating prices go up. So as president, those are the people I will be attending to first. (Laughter.) There may be some other folks on their way. (Applause, laughs.)\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let's talk about life on Earth. Senator Clinton, Lance Armstrong called here today with a question. He made the point, as he often has, 3,000 people, roughly, killed on 9/11, roughly a trillion dollars spent in the years since; about that many people die of cancer every two days. He wanted us to ask any of you, are you willing to be the president or are you willing to pledge to be the president who knocks cancer down from its status as number one killer of Americans under the age of 85?\nSEN. CLINTON: I'm going to do everything I can to do that. I went to Lance Armstrong's cancer symposium in Iowa and it was a very moving experience -- not only people like us speaking but a lot of cancer survivors, a lot of researchers.\nIt's just outrageous that under President Bush, the National Institutes of Health has been basically decreased in funding. We are on the brink of so many medical breakthroughs, and I will once again fund that research, get those applications processed, get those young researchers in those labs to know that we're going to tackle cancer and try to do everything we can to drive its death rate down.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\nTim Russert.\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Dodd, you went on the Bill Marr show last month and said that you were for decriminalizing marijuana. Is there anyone here who disagrees with Senator Dodd in decriminalization marijuana? Senator Biden?\nSEN. BIDEN (?): (Inaudible.)\nMR. RUSSERT: Senator Edwards? Why?\nSEN. EDWARDS: Because I think it sends the wrong signal to young people. And I think the president of the United States has a responsibility to ensure that we're sending the right signals to young people.\nSEN. DODD: Can I respond, I mean just why I think it ought to be? We're locking up too many people in our system here today. We've got mandatory minimum sentences that are filling our jails with people who don't belong there. My idea is to decriminalize this, reduce that problem here. We've gone from 800,000 to 2 million people in our penal institutions in this country.\nWe've go to get a lot smarter about this issue than we are, and as president, I'd try and achieve that.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, Senator Biden, I introduce a new subject here. Christmas shopping season, holiday hoping, almost upon us, as there is a chill in the air. Would you advise Americans against buying imported toys from China, in light of the recent health and safety problems?\nSEN. BIDEN: If I were president, I'd shut down, flat shut down any imports from China, period, in terms of toys -- flat shut it down, number one. (Applause.)\nNumber two, imagine if this -- Morocco was selling these -- these toys. We would have shut it down a year ago.\nThey have mortgage on our house because Bush mortgaged us to a trillion dollars to them. He is responsible for this. This is outrageous.\nAnd by the way, where is Rudy when we need him here? (Laughter.) He could have helped you on this. You know what I mean? On the UFOs. I don't -- (laughter) -- I don't know.\nMR. WILLIAMS: This is what happens late at night in a hot room. (Laughter.)\nSenator Obama, we started with you. Let's take a stab at this one. Tomorrow, of course, is Halloween. (Laughter.) You will go as what? (Laughter.)\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, we haven't decided on the costume yet. I know my 9-year-old is going as a math professor, and my 6-year-old's going as a witch. I will be accompanying them. I am thinking about wearing a Mitt Romney mask, which I think -- (laughter) -- will really -- but it has two sides to it.\nIt goes in both directions at once. (Laughter.)\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let's perhaps try to end on that note. (Laughter.) Along with this: If you didn't hear your question asked or answered here tonight, we are guessing there will be ample opportunity. We, among others, will be back at this pursuit with now 65 days to go until the Iowa caucuses.\nI want to thank my partner first and foremost, Tim Russert, in the questioning here tonight.\nWe, of course, want to thank our hosts at Drexel University, the great city of Philadelphia, and the candidates in the race for the Democratic nomination for being with us here tonight.\nOn behalf of all of us at NBC News, especially our road crew here who makes these all possible, good night from Philadelphia. Thank you for being with us.

It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, walked offstage at an event Wednesday evening after his remarks in support of Israel drew boos from some members of the audience.\nCruz was speaking at a dinner for In Defense of Christians (IDC), a group that aims to raise awareness of persecuted minority communities in the Middle East, particularly Christians.\nAccording to The Daily Caller, it was Cruz's assertion that \"Christians have no greater ally than Israel\" which drew the first negative reaction from some in the crowd, who booed and yelled, \"stop it!\"\nAs Cruz doubled down on his point - \"those who hate Israel hate America,\" he said - the interruptions grew.\n\"If you will not stand with Israel and the Jews,\" Cruz said. \"Then I will not stand with you. Good night, and God bless.\" He left the stage.\n\"I came to this event [Wednesday] to help shine a light on the tragic persecution and slaughter of Christians by ISIS and Islamic radicals throughout the Middle East. American leaders have been far too silent as to this horrific evil,\" Cruz said in a statement released after the event. \"But bigotry and hatred have no place in this discussion. Anti-Semitism is a corrosive evil, and it reared its ugly head.\"\nHe blamed a \"vocal and angry minority of attendees\" for what he called a \"shameful display of bigotry and hatred\" and said he had no choice but to leave.\nIDC issued its own statement reprimanding \"a few politically motivated opportunists\" for choosing to cause division in the room.\n\"Tonight's injection of politics when the focus should have been on unity and faith, momentarily played into the hands of a few who do not adhere to IDC's principles. They were made no longer welcome,\" IDC President Toufic Baaklini said.\nDuring his less than two years in the Senate, Cruz has often displayed a talent for making his points with flare. A day before the speech, he was on the Senate floor to protest a constitutional amendment proposed by Democrats that would undo two Supreme Court decisions striking down limits on campaign spending.\nHis argument: the constitutional amendment would criminalize political speech - including the satire that pokes fun at politicians on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL).\n\"Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician. That is extraordinary, it is breathtaking, and it is dangerous,\" said, referencing the SNL creator and producer. \"Who can forget in 2008 Saturday Night Live's wickedly funny characterization of the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin? It was wickedly funny and also had a profound effect on people's assessment of Governor Palin, who's a friend of mine.\"\nTo underscore his point, Cruz did a brief impression of comedian Dana Carvey imitating former President George H.W. Bush on the show, saying, \"Not gonna do it.\"\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Medal of Freedom\n\"The Presidential Medal of Freedom is not just our nation's highest civilian honor—it's a tribute to the idea that all of us, no matter where we come from, have the opportunity to change this country for the better.

Dayton posted a gain of 3,400, while most other metro areas had small gains or losses.\nCincinnati’s metro area, which extends into northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana, posted the biggest increase: 24,000 jobs, a growth rate of a solid 2.1%.\nColumbus added 13,800 jobs and Cleveland 12,400 — growth rates of about 1.2%.\nThe three metros have led job creation over the past decade, with a greater focus on service-oriented jobs.\nIn contrast, many of the state’s smaller metro areas have struggled with job creation and population growth, particularly the areas tied to manufacturing, said economist Bill LaFayette, owner of economic-consulting firm Regionomics.\n“I would argue that the weak population growth is a function of weak employment growth. It’s a really tough nut to crack,” he said.\nOften, the smaller metro areas rely on a handful of employers, he said.\n“You’ve got all these industries whose main focus is in the local area. If the local area population isn’t growing, neither can those industries. It’s kind of a double whammy,” he said.\nCincinnati and Columbus had the lowest unemployment rates among the metro areas last month at 3.2%, the state data shows.\nCentral Ohio’s jobless rate in November was 3.3%. The area’s 3.2% rate last month was the second-lowest of 2019, trailing only the 2.7% rate posted in April. That rate was a post-recession low. The local-unemployment data isn’t seasonally adjusted so it can produce rates that vary widely during the year.\nLaFayette’s seasonal adjustments show that central Ohio had an unemployment rate of 3.3% last month, down from 3.6% in November.\nDelaware County posted a 2.8% unemployment rate in December, the lowest in the metro area, according to Job and Family Services data released Tuesday. Union County’s rate was 2.9%.\nThose two counties were among nine in the state with unemployment rates at or below 3.0% in December.\nRates increased in 38 counties in December, fell in 29 and were unchanged in 21.\nMercer County in northwestern Ohio had the lowest unemployment rate, 2.5%, while Monroe County in eastern Ohio had the highest, 8.9%.\nmawilliams@dispatch.com\n@BizMarkWilliams\nCounty;November;December\nDelaware;3.0%;2.8%\nFairfield;3.5%;3.4%\nFranklin;3.3%;3.1%\nHocking;4.0%;4.5%\nLicking;3.5%;3.4%\nMadison;3.1%;3.1%\nMorrow;3.7%;3.9%\nPerry;5.0%;5.0%\nPickaway;3.6%;3.7%\nUnion;3.1%;2.9%\nSource: Ohio Department of Job and Family Services\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

A member of the Democratic Party, he has led the Senate Democratic Caucus since 2017 and served as Senate Majority Leader from 2021 to 2025.[1] He has served two stints as Senate Minority Leader, from 2017 to 2021 and since 2025. He became New York's senior senator in 2001, upon Daniel Patrick Moynihan's retirement. Elected to a fifth term in 2022, Schumer surpassed Moynihan and Jacob K. Javits as the longest-serving U.S. senator from New York. He is the dean of New York's congressional delegation.\nA native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Schumer was a three-term member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1980. He served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1999, first representing New York's 16th congressional district before being redistricted to the 10th congressional district in 1983 and 9th congressional district 10 years later. In 1998, Schumer was elected to the Senate, defeating three-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato. He was reelected in 2004 with 71% of the vote, in 2010 with 66% of the vote, in 2016 with 70% of the vote, and in 2022 with 56% of the vote.\nSchumer chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2009, overseeing 14 Democratic gains in the Senate in the 2006 and 2008 elections. He was the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, behind Senate majority leader Harry Reid and Majority Whip Dick Durbin. He served as Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus in the Senate from 2007 to 2017[2] and chaired the Senate Democratic Policy Committee from 2011 to 2017.[3] Schumer won his fourth term in the Senate in 2016 and was then unanimously elected Democratic leader to succeed Reid, who was retiring.[4][5]\nIn January 2021, Schumer became Senate majority leader, becoming the first Jewish Senate leader in U.S. history. As majority leader, Schumer shepherded through the Senate some of the Biden administration's major legislative initiatives, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Respect for Marriage Act. Under his leadership, the Senate confirmed the most federal judges during the first two years of any presidency since John F. Kennedy's, and the most diverse slate of federal judicial nominations in American history,[6] including Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\nEarly life and education (1950–1974)\nSchumer was born on November 23, 1950, in Midwood, Brooklyn, the son of Selma (née Rosen) and Abraham Schumer.[7] His father ran an exterminating business, and his mother was a homemaker.[8][9] He and his family are Jewish,[10] and he is a second cousin, once removed, of comedian Amy Schumer.[11][12][13] His ancestors originated from the town of Chortkiv, Galicia, in what is now western Ukraine.[14]\nSchumer attended Brooklyn public schools, scoring 1600 on the SAT and graduating as the valedictorian of James Madison High School in 1967. He competed for Madison High on the television quiz show It's Academic.[15] He attended Harvard College, where he originally majored in chemistry before switching to social studies after volunteering on Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign in 1968.[16] After graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1971, Schumer attended Harvard Law School, earning his Juris Doctor with honors in 1974. He passed the New York state bar exam in early 1975, but never practiced law, opting rather for a career in politics.[17][9]\nEarly career (1975–1998)\nIn 1974, Schumer ran for and was elected to the New York State Assembly, filling a seat previously held by Schumer's mentor, U.S. representative Stephen Solarz.[18] Schumer served three terms, from 1975 to 1981, sitting in the 181st, 182nd and 183rd New York State Legislatures.[19][20][21][18]\nIn 1980, 16th district U.S. representative Elizabeth Holtzman won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat of Republican Jacob Javits. Schumer ran for Holtzman's vacated House seat and won.[18] He was reelected eight times from the Brooklyn and Queens-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was numbered the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993, and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, as a result of redistricting, Schumer faced a potential matchup with Solarz, but the matchup did not materialize.[18][22] In preparation, Schumer \"set about making friends on Wall Street, tapping the city's top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. 'I told them I looked like I had a very difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,' he would later tell the Associated Press.\"[22]\nSchumer introduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (also known as RFRA) on March 11, 1993.[23]\nAs a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Schumer was one of four members of Congress who oversaw the House investigation (leading the Democratic party's defense of the Clinton administration),[24] of the Waco siege hearings in 1995.[25]\nU.S. Senate (1999–present)\nIn 1998, Schumer ran for the Senate. He won the Democratic primary with 51% of the vote against Geraldine Ferraro (21%) and Mark Green (19%). He received 54% of the vote in the general election,[26] defeating three-term incumbent Republican Al D'Amato (44%).\nIn 2004, Schumer was reelected with 71% of the vote, defeating the Republican nominee, Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown, and conservative Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were dismayed by the selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization.[27] Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process.[27] Schumer defeated Mills by 2.8 million votes.[28] He won every county in the state except Hamilton County, in the Adirondacks, the least populous and most Republican county.[28] Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.[28]\nAn April 2009 SurveyUSA poll placed Schumer's approval rating at 62%, with 31% disapproving.[29]\nNotable former aides to Schumer include former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, former New York state senator Daniel Squadron, and New York state assemblymembers Phil Goldfeder and Victor M. Pichardo.[30][31]\nBefore the 2016 United States presidential election, Schumer said, \"For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\" This assertion was criticized by left-wing and conservative voices.[32][33][34][35][36][37]\nAfter the 2016 election, Schumer said the Democrats lost because they lacked \"a strong, bold economic message\" and he called on Democrats to push for reforms in the affordability of college and trade laws.[38]\nSenate Democratic Leader\nThe Senate Democratic Caucus elected Schumer minority leader in November 2016. Schumer had been widely expected to lead Senate Democrats after Reid announced his retirement in 2015. He is the first New Yorker, as well as the first Jewish person, to serve as a Senate leader.[39] On January 20, 2021, Democrats gained control of the Senate with the swearing-in of newly elected Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, following the 2020–21 election runoff and special election runoff, making Schumer the majority leader, replacing Republican Mitch McConnell.[40]\nMarch 2025 conflict over funding bill\nOn March 12, 2025, Schumer announced his opposition to the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) to fund the 2025 United States federal budget until September 30, 2025. The next day, he reversed his position, writing in The New York Times that \"a shutdown would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk permission to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate\".[41] This drew the ire of many House Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi.[42][43] This alone caused his book tour to be postponed for security reasons.[44] He ultimately voted to advance the budget proposal, along with nine other Democrats.[45] After the vote, Schumer faced pressure to step down as Senate leader, but he said he has no intention to do so.[46]\nPolitical style\nSchumer's propensity for publicity is the subject of a running joke among many commentators. He has been called an \"incorrigible publicity hound\".[47] Bob Dole once quipped, \"the most dangerous place in Washington is between Charles Schumer and a television camera\";[48] Barack Obama joked that Schumer brought the press to a banquet as his \"loved ones\".[49][50][51][52][53] Schumer often schedules media appearances on Sundays. Some have cited his use of media as a successful way to raise a politician's profile nationally and among his constituents.[54] Schumer has appeared on The Daily Show seven times.[55]\nIn Washington, Schumer has been a lead consensus-builder on the difficult issues of health care, immigration, and financial regulation.[56]\nAs chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the second inauguration of Barack Obama, Schumer played a key role in organizing the event, gave the opening speech and served as master of ceremonies.[57] A photograph of a smiling Schumer peering from behind Malia Obama as Obama took the oath of office went viral and became a meme.[58] Although it was called a \"photobomb\",[59] it was not technically one as he was standing in the correct place.[60][58] The Huffington Post quipped, \"clearly, inauguration day belonged to Chuck Schumer.\"[61]\nSchumer has long claimed that his political decisions are guided by an imaginary middle-class couple, Joe and Eileen Bailey (initially O'Reilly), swing voters living in the Long Island suburb of Massapequa; he described them in his 2007 book Positively American.[62][63] They were the focus of a 2025 segment on Last Week Tonight in which John Oliver mocked the idea of the Baileys and criticized Schumer for using them as guidance. Pointing out that Schumer has claimed that the Baileys had either voted for Trump or abstained from voting for president since 2016, Oliver criticized Schumer for attempting to tailor Democratic policy toward right-wing suburban voters like the Baileys while alienating other parts of the Democratic base and additional non-voters in the process.[64][65]\nLocal issues\nSchumer prides himself on visiting each of New York's 62 counties every year and has done so in each of the years he has served in the Senate, the only New York senator to have done so.[66] He has a reputation for focusing on local issues important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism to local taxes to job creation.[67][68][69][70] When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant.[71]\nWhen it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate that New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island.[72] Along with his House and Senate colleagues, Schumer successfully worked to kill a Bush-era privatization plan for custodial and utility workers at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The plan would have called for turning over custodial and utility work to a Georgia company.[73]\nIn November 2017, Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced $1,908,486 in funding for Head Start and Early Head Start programs at the Community Action Organization of Erie County, Schumer saying the federal funding would yield \"real results to young students in Western New York by providing them with the resources they need to succeed both in and out of the classroom\".[74]\nIn January 2018, Schumer requested that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs complete final acquisitions for two 60-acre and 77-acre parcels in Pembroke, New York, and initiate construction of the New Western New York National Veterans Cemetery, saying the completion of the cemetery would ensure \"Western New York's military veterans will have the proper burial, at a site close to the homes, families, and the very communities they dedicated their lives to defend and serve.\"[75]\nDrugs\nIn May 2001, Schumer and Senator John McCain introduced legislation intended to make it more difficult for makers of brand-name drugs to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market.[76] A coalition of consumer groups supported the legislation and Schumer told reporters its enactment would reduce prescription drug costs by over 60% per prescription in addition to saving consumers $71 billion over the next decade.[77]\nIn October 2001, during a press conference, Schumer stated his desire that generic ciprofloxacin be available for government use. At that time, Bayer held exclusive patent rights for its commercial product, Cipro. Schumer also said he believed the federal government had the authority to order the immediate production of generic ciproflaxin to expand the government stockpile of the drug.[78]\nIn July 2002, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Schumer and McCain that could lower the costs of generic drugs more rapidly available to U.S. consumers and thereby lead to savings of billions of dollars in drug costs.[79] The legislation also attempted to prevent frivolous lawsuits by brand-name drug manufacturers claiming generic drugs infringed their patents.[80] An identical bill was introduced in the House but did not pass.[81]\nFBI\nIn November 2001, Schumer joined fellow New York senator Hillary Clinton to call for legislation encouraging the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share information on terrorism with local and state police by removing legal barriers to such cooperation, citing reports by New York mayor Rudy Giuliani that federal authorities did not tell city police what they were aware of. Schumer joined Patrick Leahy to report that the Justice Department supported the legislation.[82]\nIn October 2016, after FBI director James Comey announced the reopening of an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic presidential nominee, mishandled classified emails during her tenure at the State Department, Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey.[83] In May 2017, after President Donald Trump fired Comey, Schumer told reporters they were aware the FBI had been investigating whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and pondered whether the investigation was \"getting too close to home for the president\".[84] In a Senate floor speech, Schumer called for an \"impartial and independent\" investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, announcing the Democrats had agreed that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would not be able to appoint a special prosecutor for an investigation into Russia's meddling; that Comey meet with the Senate; and that Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions meet separately with senators.[85]\nIn January 2018, Schumer said that since Mueller's investigation began, the United States \"has had to endure conspiracy after conspiracy from the right wing, Republican congressmen, senators and of course the right-wing press, which acts in total cahoots\" in regard to their views on the FBI, and that the Republicans' effort to discredit Mueller \"has now devolved into delusional, self-serving paranoia\".[86] In May, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who made contact with the Trump campaign,[87] Schumer and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Christopher A. Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[88]\nSupreme Court\nIn September 2005, after President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States, Schumer praised Roberts's brilliance, his being \"a lawyer above all\", and his \"judicial philosophy and modesty and stability\" during the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings for Roberts, but Schumer said Roberts's \"compassion and humanity\" was questionable, and objected to the Bush administration's refusal to show documents Roberts wrote during his tenure as deputy solicitor general and to Roberts's refusal to answer many questions the committee asked him.[89] In June 2018, Schumer said Roberts was demeaning the Supreme Court as it became more political, citing the court ruling in favor of anti-abortion clinics in California. Schumer said the court had \"affirmed a plainly discriminatory travel ban, unleashed a flood of dark unlimited money in our politics and has scrapped a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act\" and thereby aligned itself with goals of what he called \"the hard right\".[90]\nIn October 2005, Schumer said Bush Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers \"would not get a majority either in the Judiciary Committee or the floor\" and that her confirmation hearings would cause her to gather either support or opposition in a way that had not been seen by any other nominee in recent memory.[91]\nIn May 2009, he told reporters the confirmation process for Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor would be \"more of a test of the Republican Party than it is of Judge Sotomayor\", calling Sotomayor a \"mainstream justice\" whom Republicans had no reason to oppose.[92]\nIn March 2016, after Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia, Schumer called for Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley to hold hearings \"so America can make its own judgment as to whether Merrick Garland belongs on the court\".[93] In July 2018, it was reported Schumer had advocated that Trump nominate Garland as a way to attract bipartisan support, as opposed to nominating someone opposed to the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade who would be more controversial.[94] In November 2016, Schumer said the Democrats would \"go at\" President-elect Trump if he did not nominate Supreme Court justices who were mainstream and the Republicans did not have \"clean hands\" for having blocked the Garland nomination for months.[95]\nIn March 2017, at the end of Senate hearings for Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Schumer said he would vote against confirmation and called on Democrats to join him in blocking an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch. In his floor speech, Schumer said, \"If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes—a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees—the answer isn't to change the rules. It's to change the nominee.\"[96] The Democrats conducted the filibuster, but Republicans broke it using the \"nuclear option\", and Gorsuch was confirmed the next day.[97]\nIn July 2018, after Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy, Schumer said Kavanaugh should be asked direct questions about the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and other cases. Schumer noted Kavanaugh's expressed opinion on the possible incorrect decision in United States v. Nixon and that this could mean he would not hold Trump accountable as a justice.[98]\nOn August 21, Schumer said he was requesting that documents from Kavanaugh's White House tenure be shared with the Senate, arguing that \"withholding documents from the Senate and the American people under the bogus label of committee confidential is a dark development for the Senate.\"[99] After meeting with Kavanaugh, Schumer said he had asked him whether he believed Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood were properly decided and that Kavanaugh had not responded and the lack of an answer \"should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women\". He also said Kavanaugh had a special obligation to make his views clear due to his unique position as the only person nominated to the Supreme Court by a president who said, \"I will only nominate someone who overturns Roe v Wade.\"[100] Schumer subsequently called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty to charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and campaign finance law violations, calling the plea \"a game changer\".[101]\n2020 comments about Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch\nIn March 2020, Schumer was criticized for statements he made about Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were nominated by Trump. At a rally outside the United States Capitol while the Supreme Court was hearing an abortion-related case, Schumer said that if Kavanaugh and Gorsuch voted against abortion rights, they would have \"unleashed a whirlwind\" (echoing Kavanaugh's own comments during his 2018 confirmation hearings)[102] and would \"pay the price\". He then said, \"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\" Republicans and Democrats, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, condemned these comments as inciting violence. Senator Josh Hawley called for a censure.[103] A spokesman for Schumer said the comments were in reference to the political price Senate Republicans would pay, and criticized Roberts for following a \"right-wing\" attack to misinterpret the comments.[104] Schumer later apologized for the comments.[105]\nIn February 2025, interim U.S. Attorney for Washington D.C. Ed Martin announced the Department of Justice was launching an investigation into the matter.[106]\nNet neutrality\nIn November 2017, Schumer said, \"Just as our free highway system helped build jobs in America in the 20th century, net neutrality will help build jobs in the 21st century. To take a step back hurts our economy, our job growth and middle-class and working people. It is a disaster.\"[107] In December, after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules, Schumer said the internet could start resembling \"a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private 'fast lanes' while the rest of us inch along a single, traffic-choked public lane; and we could be forced to purchase internet packages much like cable packages, paying more for popular sites\", and that the resolution he was introducing would undo the effects of the vote.[108]\nIn January 2018, Schumer announced all 49 members of the Democratic caucus supported a resolution overturning the FCC vote on net neutrality and said congressional Republicans \"have the opportunity to right the administration's wrong and show the American people whose side they're on: big ISPs' and major corporations' or consumers', entrepreneurs', and small business owners'.\"[109] In May, the Senate adopted a measure to revive Obama-era internet regulations enforcing equal treatment for all web traffic. Schumer called the vote \"our best chance to make sure the internet stays accessible and affordable to all Americans\".[110] In June, in response to the Republican-controlled House not taking up the Senate resolution restoring net neutrality rules, Schumer said, \"House Republican leaders gave a green light to the big ISPs to charge middle-class Americans, small business owners, schools, rural Americans, and communities of color more to use the internet.\"[111]\nCommittee assignments\nSource:[112]\n- Committee on Rules and Administration\n- Select Committee on Intelligence (ex officio as Minority Leader)\n- Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (2024)\nCaucus memberships\nPolitical positions\n| Part of a series on |\n| Liberalism in the United States |\n|---|\n| Part of a series on |\n| Modern liberalism in the United States |\n|---|\nAbortion\nSchumer is pro-choice, and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.[116]\nIn 2002, Schumer authored a provision to an industry-sponsored bill intended to make it harder for people to erase their debts by filing for bankruptcy. Anti-abortion activists opposed the measure, claiming it restricted their ability to use bankruptcy courts to write off court fines. After the bill appeared to die in May, J. Dennis Hastert spokesman John Feehery opined, \"Schumer really was pretty obnoxious about how this provision was going to hurt people who were pro-life and that really got some of our folks ginned up.\" In response, Schumer said the provision was a compromise with Henry Hyde and other colleagues and it was opposed by people who did not properly read the law.[117]\nAfter Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018, Schumer voiced concern about Trump's choice of replacement, believing they would try to overturn Roe v. Wade.[118]\nAgriculture\nIn March 2019, Schumer was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to U.S. secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program\".[119]\nBicycle safety\nSchumer is noted for his love of cycling in New York City, especially around his home in Brooklyn.[120] In 2011, he was reported to have joined a group of neighbors on his street in Park Slope, near Prospect Park. They attempted to remove a new \"parking-protected\" bicycle path on their street,[121] which ran adjacent to the curb, with a protection buffer provided by parallel-parked cars next to the bike lane.[122] While Schumer has not taken a public position on the traffic-calming project, whose most prominent feature is a two-way protected bike path, his wife, Iris Weinshall, is a prominent opponent of the project, and the New York Post reported that Schumer has lobbied against the bike path behind the scenes.[123] In addition, a major Schumer campaign contributor[124] has fought a controversial pro bono legal battle against the project, drawing criticism.[125]\nBush administration judicial nominations\nIn January 2004, after President Bush renominated Charles Pickering to the federal appeals court along with 30 other nominees who had failed to win confirmation under the previous Democratic-controlled Senate, Schumer stated his intent to prevent Pickering's confirmation and said the US could do better.[126]\nIn 2007, after Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey to become attorney general of the United States (replacing Gonzales, who had resigned), Schumer expressed support for Mukasey. Despite appearing troubled by Mukasey's refusal to declare in public that waterboarding was illegal torture, Schumer announced on November 2 that he would vote to confirm Mukasey.[127] He said Mukasey had assured him in a private meeting that he would enforce any law declaring waterboarding illegal, and that Mukasey had told him Bush would have \"no legal authority\" to ignore such a law.[128]\nCannabis\nIn April 2018, Schumer said that he would back efforts to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level.[129] On April 20, a day known as 4/20, he announced his sponsorship of legislation to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would also provide funding for women and minority-owned businesses and for research into the public health effects of cannabis.[130] On June 27, 2018, Schumer formally introduced the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act.[131]\nOn July 14, 2021, Schumer, along with senators Ron Wyden and Cory Booker, released for public comment a comprehensive federal legalization bill known as the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act.[132][133] On July 21, 2022, he formally introduced the bill.[134]\nClinton impeachment\nSchumer voted on the impeachment charges of President Bill Clinton in both houses of Congress. Schumer was a member of the House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 lame-duck session of Congress, voting \"no\" on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House. In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted \"not guilty\" on the two impeachment charges.[135]\nConsumer issues\nSchumer has given legislative attention to consumer issues. He passed legislation that required uniform disclosure information on the back of credit card applications, notifying prospective cardholders of annual fees and interest rates. This standardized information is now known as the \"Schumer box\". Schumer has also aggressively pushed to end the practice whereby customers can be charged two ATM fees, one by their own bank and one by the bank that owns the ATM, if the ATM is outside their bank's network.[136]\nWith Representative Nita Lowey, Schumer has been working to ban the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), often found in baby bottles and plastic children's food containers.[137] The Canadian government has already banned BPA in baby bottles and children's products.[138] Schumer is also seeking a ban on the use of cadmium, a carcinogen known to impair brain development in children, in toys and children's jewelry.[139] When companies began selling gloves, pills, inhalers, diuretics, shampoos and other products during the 2009 swine flu scare, Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation. In the end, the FTC put ten companies on notice and identified a total of 140 scams.[140]\nSchumer has championed college tuition tax credits, calling for and passing a $4,000 tuition tax credit for students as part of a host of tax credits and cuts passed to stimulate the economy in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.[141]\nSchumer received an \"A\" grade on the 2008 Drum Major Institute's Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[142]\nIn October 2013, Schumer announced his support for a proposal ending restrictions on shipping beer, wine, and spirits through the U.S. Postal Service, saying it would \"help keep local post offices open by bringing in an estimated $225 million in new revenues to the USPS\" and broaden the availability of beers and wines to consumers.[143]\nDeath penalty\nIn 2013, Schumer said the death penalty would be \"appropriate\" in the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing. \"The federal law allows the death penalty. ... I wrote the law in 1994 when I was head of the crime subcommittee in the House. This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to.\"[144][145]\nDisaster relief\nIn 2014, Schumer was recognized for helping to achieve the award of $700,000 in compensation from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Gowanda, New York, as a result of the devastating flood there in 2009.[146][147] A flash flood devastated the village, causing two deaths. Four feet of flood waters swept through the village, and caused much damage.[146][147] Gowanda was declared both a state and federal disaster site.[146][147]\nOf the anticipated disbursement of FEMA monies to Gowanda, Schumer said:\nFEMA and the state were sitting on Gowanda's money for way too long. It's about time that they made the village of Gowanda whole for the damage done in this flood. I've been advocating for this for months and months and months; I'm glad everyone came together and finally did the right thing.[146][147]\nDonald Trump\nIn a November 2016 interview conducted in the weeks after Trump's election to the presidency, Schumer said that he and Trump were not friends and had had \"civil conversations a couple of times\" when Trump had contacted him. Trump had said earlier that year that he believed he would get along with Schumer and that he was \"close to Schumer in many ways\".[148] In December 2016, Schumer called on Trump cabinet nominees to release their tax returns and in doing so follow the precedent set by Steve Mnuchin and Tom Price.[149]\nIn February 2017, before Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress, Schumer predicted that the speech would be less memorable than ones delivered by Trump's predecessors due to what he called \"a yawning gap between what he says and what his administration actually does for working Americans\". Though acknowledging Trump's populist campaigning style, Schumer said Trump \"governs like a pro-corporate, pro-elite, hard-right ideologue\".[150]\nIn March 2017, Schumer released a statement calling on Trump to apologize for claiming the Obama administration had wiretapped him during his presidential campaign. He advocated that Trump stop tweeting to better focus on working on behalf of the United States and said Trump had \"severely damaged his credibility\" by promoting conspiracy theories.[151]\nIn June 2018, Schumer delivered a Senate floor speech decrying Representative Maxine Waters's call to harass members of the Trump administration as protest of the administration's policies: \"I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That's not right. That's not American.\"[152]\nIn August 2018, in response to Trump's charge that American Jews who vote for Democrats are \"disloyal\", Schumer tweeted, \"When he [Trump] uses a trope that's been used against the Jewish people for centuries with dire consequences, he is encouraging—wittingly or unwittingly—anti-Semites throughout the country and world.\"[153]\nSchumer was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Schumer and other members of Congress were removed from the Senate chambers. He and Mitch McConnell joined Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer in an undisclosed location. As the attack persisted, Schumer and Pelosi released a joint statement calling on Trump to demand the rioters leave the Capitol and its grounds immediately.[154] When the Senate reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Schumer gave remarks, calling it a day \"that will live forever in infamy\".[155] Later that day, he blamed Trump for the attack, calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office. He also said he would support impeachment.[156]\nElection reform\nIn March 2002, as the Senate worked on a compromise to save an election reform bill that stalled due to Republicans' believing it was not combative enough against voter fraud, Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden led a successful effort in protecting an amendment allowing first-time voters to be verified with only a signature.[157]\nEqual pay\nIn April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), a bill aimed at addressing the gender pay gap in the United States.[158] Republicans argued that the Democrats were attempting to use the votes on this bill and the issue of equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections.[158] Schumer backed the measure and told reporters, \"pay equity, that's women, that's 53 percent of the vote\".[158]\nFinancial industry regulation\nIn 1987, then-Representative Schumer wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, titled \"Don't Let Banks Become Casinos\".[159] In 1999, Schumer supported Congress's repeal of Glass–Steagall, saying: \"There are many reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S. financial firms remain competitive.\"[160] Since 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer's senatorial campaigns.[161]\nAccording to a December 14, 2008, article in The New York Times Schumer embraced the free-market and deregulatory agenda more than any other Democrat in Congress, and supported measures blamed for the 2008 financial crisis. A review of his record showed that he took steps to protect the investment banking industry from government oversight and tougher rules. Over the years, he helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in taxes or fees. The article claimed that Schumer succeeded in limiting efforts to reform and regulate credit-rating agencies the George W. Bush administration and the SEC had proposed.[162]\nThe Charles Schumer-Rob Portman Senate bill of 2015[163] proposed to tax the $2.2 trillion multinational corporations are holding outside the country in tax-haven subsidiaries, on which 35% was already owed, as a one-time tax \"at a rate significantly lower than the statutory corporate rate\".[164]\nIn his book released in March 2010, No One Would Listen, Bernie Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos passed along an unsourced claim that Schumer called the SEC for information about the Madoff investigation. Schumer denied this.[165]\nIn response to The American Prospect's Day One Agenda,[166] Schumer announced a new stance on eliminating student debt. In November 2020, he said, \"I have a proposal with Elizabeth Warren that the first $50,000 of debt be vanquished, and we believe that Joe Biden can do that with the pen as opposed to legislation\".[167]\nForeign policy\nIn 2009, Schumer criticized Scotland's release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and called for the United States to impose economic sanctions on the United Kingdom if Megrahi's release was tied to a massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and Libya.[168]\nIn April 2017, after the Shayrat missile strike, Schumer said a \"pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate\" while warning against the United States becoming further involved in Syria.[169]\nIn July 2017, Schumer voted for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.[170]\nIn July 2018, after Trump criticized Germany's decision to approve a new Russian-German gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea bypassing Poland and Ukraine, Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi released a joint statement condemning Trump's comments as an embarrassment and his behavior as \"another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies\".[171]\nIn October 2020, Schumer called on the Trump administration to immediately suspend U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan,[172][173] sent through the Pentagon's \"building partner assistance program\".[173][174] According to critics, the aid could be used in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.[173][175] He co-signed a letter stating:\nWe have been very critical of U.S. security assistance to Azerbaijan given the country's human rights record and aggression in the region. Earlier this year, at Senator Menendez's request, the Government Accountability Office agreed to conduct a review of security assistance to the country to ensure that it aligns with U.S. interests; this violence indicates that it does not.[173]\nAfghanistan\nIn March 2006, the House Appropriations Committee voted to block an amendment allowing Dubai Ports World to operate some terminals at U.S. ports, an amendment that was inserted into the emergency supplemental funding bill for military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The same day, Schumer introduced an amendment barring a company from operating in a U.S. port if the company was owned by a country that recognized the Taliban's regime in Afghanistan, the amendment being touted as similar to the House measure. Senate majority leader Bill Frist subsequently asked for a quorum call that effectively gnarled proceedings, Schumer afterward opining that the Democrats had \"bent over backwards to try and accommodate the Republican schedule\" and that Frist's move meant Republicans did not want a vote at all.[176]\nIn October 2009, Schumer said, \"It cost us $6 trillion and 4,500 lives, approximately, to bring stability to Iraq. Just in terms of the loss of life and treasure, do we want to do the same exercise in Afghanistan?\" He said the United States could potentially be able to keep itself safe without bringing stability to Afghanistan and advocated that American forces be scaled back in Afghanistan in favor of more reliance on unmanned drone attacks.[177]\nIn April 2017, Schumer called for caution in Afghanistan, noting the casualties in Iraq, and said the military would have to come to Congress if it wanted more American soldiers in Afghanistan.[178]\nChina\nIn 2006, NPR reported that Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham were highly critical of the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, and its alleged cause of Chinese currency intervention.[179]\nIn 2017, Schumer wrote to Trump advocating for a block on China that would prevent it from purchasing more American companies to increase pressure on Beijing to help rein in North Korea's nuclear missile program.[180] In May 2018, after Trump signaled his willingness to ease sanctions on ZTE in a bid for a trade deal with Beijing, Schumer observed, \"This seems to be an area where Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate are coming together and telling the president, you've got to be tough on China, you have to have your actions match your rhetoric.\"[181]\nBefore the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Schumer and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China. Schumer said, \"China has stolen millions of jobs and trillions of dollars [but] administrations from both parties haven't been strong enough to fight back.\"[182][183][184]\nIn October 2023, Schumer led a bipartisan congressional delegation's visit to China that included a meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping. In a press conference, Schumer said the two sides spoke about their \"respective priorities\" and that he told Xi that \"America wants fairness and stability. At the foundation of the relationship must be a level playing field for American businesses and workers, as well as responsible competition\". The delegation also met Foreign Minister Wang Yi, National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji, and Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Chen Jining.[185]\nIran nuclear deal\nOn August 6, 2015, Schumer announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran.[186] He planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an \"apparent attempt to limit coverage\".[187] Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities.[188] In what The Guardian described as a \"shot across Schumer's bow\", White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats might remember Schumer's decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader.[189]\nIraq\nSchumer was a supporter of the Iraq War Resolution but was very critical of President George W. Bush's strategy in the Iraq War; he suggested that a commission of ex-generals be appointed to review it.[190]\nIn April 2002, during a Senate speech, Schumer called the Bush administration's Middle East policy \"muddled, confused and inconsistent\" and said the planned meeting between Secretary of State Colin Powell and Yasser Arafat would contradict Bush's stated stand against terrorists and those harboring them.[191] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice wrote in November 2006 that \"the loquacious Schumer has been indifferent to the administration's war on the Constitution and on our laws and treaties\", particularly on the issue of torture.[192]\nIn July 2006, Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iraq was urging the international community \"to take a quick and firm stance to stop this aggression against Lebanon, to stop the killing of innocent people and to stop the destruction of infrastructure\". In response, Schumer, Harry Reid, and Dick Durbin signed a letter to al-Maliki in which they charged him with failing to condemn the aggression of Hezbollah as well as Israel's right to defend itself, arguing the oversight raised serious concern about whether Iraq under his rule could \"play a constructive role in resolving the current crisis and bringing stability to the Middle East\".[193]\nSchumer was the first senator to call for U.S. support for Kurdish independence after the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum, releasing a resolution calling for the U.S. government to change its policy to \"support a political process that addresses the aspirations of the Kurds for an independent state\". He called upon Iraq to \"engage in a dialogue and peacefully determine the best way to accommodate the well-deserved and legitimate aspirations of the Iraqi Kurds\".[194]\nIsrael\nSchumer has called himself \"Shomer Yisrael\" or \"Guardian of Israel\", an epithet he has used for years.[195][196][197][198]\nIn 1994, Schumer joined the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress in a campaign to get the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Palestinian-American charity the Holy Land Foundation, which by the time it was shut down in 2001 was the country's largest Muslim charity.[199]\nIn June 2010, while speaking at an Orthodox Union event in Washington D.C., Schumer made comments about Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip that were later criticized.[200] He said that statistics show that the Palestinian citizens of the West Bank were experiencing \"economic prosperity\", crediting this to their government's cooperation with the Israeli government on combating terrorists.[201] He then criticized the Palestinian citizens of the Gaza Strip for voting for the Hamas militant organization, calling on Israel to \"strangle them economically until they see that's not the way to go\", while also stating that Israel should continue providing \"humanitarian aid\" to Palestinian civilians. He argued that the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is justified not only because it keeps weapons out of the Palestinian territory, but also because it shows Palestinians living there that \"when there's some moderation and cooperation, they can have an economic advancement.\"[200][202] Schumer added, \"The Palestinian people still don't believe in a Jewish state, in a two-state solution. More do than before, but a majority still do not ... They don't believe in the Torah. They don't believe in King David. So they don't think it's our land\".[201]\nSchumer supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[203] In March 2018, he told AIPAC's delegates that Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have nothing to do with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[204][205]\nSchumer is a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement-building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law. He criticized Obama, saying: \"past administrations—both Democrat and Republican—have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution [the U.N.]. Unfortunately, by abstaining on United Nations Resolution 2334, this administration has not followed in that path.\"[206]\nIn May 2017, Schumer co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[207] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government. The bill would make it legal for U.S. states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel.[208]\nSchumer introduced a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem.[209]\nIn May 2018, Schumer praised Trump for opening the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, saying, \"I sponsored legislation to do this two decades ago, and I applaud President Trump for doing it.\"[210][211] He had previously accused Trump of \"indecisiveness\" for his delays in implementing the move by waiving the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, as previous presidents had done.[212]\nIn a March 14, 2024, Senate speech, Schumer said Israeli prime minister Netanyahu was an impediment to peace in the Middle East and called for elections to replace him when the Gaza war abated. Schumer said the many civilian deaths in Gaza were causing international support for Israel to fall to historic lows.[213][214] Netanyahu responded by arranging to address a Senate GOP conference by video.[215]\nIn a March 2025 interview with Bret Stephens, Schumer said, \"My job is to keep the left pro-Israel.\" He said that his Democratic caucus remains \"overwhelmingly pro-Israel\" and pointed out that during a Senate vote on the largest aid package to Israel in history in 2024, only three Democrats opposed it, including Bernie Sanders. Schumer warned that \"the greatest danger to Israel, long-term\" is if they lose the support of the United States' liberal half. Recalling a past conversation with Netanyahu, Schumer said he advised him to appear on progressive platforms like The Rachel Maddow Show rather than only conservative ones like The Sean Hannity Show, advice Netanyahu ignored. Schumer later called for new elections in Israel during a Senate speech, a move he said he was \"fiercely proud\" of, as he said it signaled to Democrats that one can oppose Netanyahu while supporting Israel. Schumer also drew attention to right-wing antisemitism, saying that just as some anti-Israel demonstrators on the left use \"Zionist\" as a substitute for \"Jew\", elements on the right employ coded antisemitic language such as \"neocons\" or \"globalists\". Of a remark by Trump questioning his Jewish identity, Schumer said, \"There's a long and dark history of non-Jewish people trying to decide who gets to be Jewish\" and urged Trump to \"spend less time trafficking in bigotry and focus more on rooting the antisemites out of his administration\". Schumer warned of a \"pincer\" movement—antisemitism emerging from both the extreme left and the extreme right that could align in \"strange and dangerous ways\". He compared the situation to those of France during the Dreyfus affair and Germany in the leadup to the Third Reich. While insisting that his outlook stems from \"nervousness rather than pessimism\", Schumer also pointed to the enduring strength of American values, saying, \"the roots of America's warmth toward Jews run deep\". But he cautioned, quoting Irish diplomat Conor Cruise O'Brien, that \"antisemitism is a light sleeper\".[216][217][218]\nSchumer did not endorse Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee in the 2025 New York City mayoral election, citing his criticism of Israel.[219][198]\nNorth Korea\nIn February 2017, Schumer said that North Korea had proved itself to be \"an irresponsible nation in every way\" and that China could be used to curtail North Korea as most of North Korea's imports and exports go through China. He advocated that the United States tell China \"they have to put the wood to North Korea in a much more serious way than they have done so far.\"[220] In August, after Trump said North Korea would be \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of continued threats against the United States, Schumer released a statement advocating that the United States be \"firm and deliberate with North Korea, but reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe.\"[221]\nIn May 2018, Schumer called for Kim Jong-un to be removed from the commemorative coin memorializing the 2018 North Korea–United States summit, calling Kim a \"brutal dictator\" and offering the Peace House as a more appropriate alternative.[222] In June, Schumer was one of seven senior Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump outlining the conditions of their caucus's support for any deal resulting from the North Korea-US summit.[223] After Kim and Trump issued a joint statement, Schumer said the meeting between the two had given \"a brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it has long craved\" and that the agreement lacked details on achieving a pathway to the Korean peninsula being denuclearized, how the United States would verify North Korea's disarming, and an assurance of cessation for enrichment of plutonium and uranium from North Korea.[224] In a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer questioned what the United States had gained from the summit and added that the country had \"won far stronger language on denuclearization\" in previous agreements with North Korea. In response, Trump tweeted,\nThank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. Hostages already back, hero remains coming home & much more![225]\nRussia\nIn a June 3, 2008, Wall Street Journal op-ed, Schumer wrote that cooperative economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran's theocratic government. In discussing the importance of Russia's cooperation, Schumer wrote, \"Mr. Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before the fall of the Soviet Union.\" He added, \"The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground. It mocks Mr. Putin's dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.\"[226] On June 10, the East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter about his article, writing, \"As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under 'Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe', your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia is troubling, inexplicable and unacceptable.\"[227]\nIn August 2013, after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, Schumer said Putin was behaving like a \"schoolyard bully\", adding, \"The relationship between the United States and Russia is more poisonous than any time since the Cold War because of all of this.\"[228]\nIn December 2016, Schumer joined John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Jack Reed in a letter to Majority Leader McConnell urging the formation of a Senate select committee on cyber. Schumer said the panel would focus on Russian meddling and potential threats from other countries such as China and Iran.[229]\nIn December 2016, Schumer demanded a congressional inquiry into Russian meddling in U.S. affairs.[230] In January 2017, in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments, he said, \"Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you\".[231] Later that month, he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.[232]\nIn a May 2017 Senate floor speech, Schumer called on the White House to release unedited transcripts of the meeting between Trump and Russian officials the previous week, saying the continued confidentiality would ensure \"the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation's most closely kept secrets.\"[233] In July, Schumer disavowed claims that the Democratic Party considered Russia its top priority and named health care and economic stability for working-class families as its primary concerns. \"Obviously Russia is in the news. Obviously we want Bob Mueller to be able to pursue and our committees to be able to pursue their investigations unimpeded.\"[234]\nSchumer spearheaded a non-binding resolution in July 2018 \"warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials\". The resolution stated the United States \"should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of Vladimir Putin\". It passed 98–0.[235]\nGun laws\nIn 1994, then-representative Schumer and Senator Dianne Feinstein authored the Assault Weapons Ban. Supporters of gun control legislation give Schumer much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.[236] The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.[237]\nWhile a target of gun rights organizations, Schumer has supported hunters, sponsoring legislation to provide millions in outdoor recreation grants to landowners who allow hunting and fishing on their private property. For these efforts, Field and Stream magazine honored Schumer in its \"Hero Awards\" in 2008.[238] He supports tax deductions for hunters who donate venison and other game to feeding programs.[239] In response to a question at a debate during his 2010 reelection campaign, Schumer denied having a handgun or a permit for one. He has produced a letter from the NYPD stating that neither he nor his wife, Iris Weinshall, has a handgun license from NYC. Schumer aide Brian Fallon said, \"except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one\".[240]\nIn February 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Schumer was one of four Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump asserting that were he \"to endorse legislation to require a background check on every gun purchase, without other poison pill provisions attached, we could finally move much closer towards the comprehensive system that you called for after the Stoneman Douglas attack\" and that there was no justification for allowing people denied firearms by federally licensed dealers to \"simply visit a gun show or go online to purchase the same gun that they were denied at the store\".[241]\nIn January 2019, Schumer was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, which would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.[242]\nHealth care\nIn March 2004, Schumer, Jon Corzine, Ted Kennedy, and Frank Lautenberg signed a letter to President Bush urging him to instruct staff to avoid taking action against whistleblower Richard Foster after Foster spoke out on the subject of White House efforts intended to keep Congress unaware of alternative higher cost estimates for the new Medicare prescription drug program.[243]\nSchumer supported Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009[244] and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[245]\nIn 2009, Schumer proposed that any new government-run health insurance programs follow all the standards applicable to private insurance. He did this to \"address fears that a public program would drive private insurers from the market\". Schumer said he wanted \"a level playing field for competition\".[246]\nIn May 2017, in response to an amendment by Fred Upton to the American Health Care Act, Schumer released a statement saying the amendment \"leaves Americans with pre-existing conditions as vulnerable as they were before under this bill\" and compared it to \"administering cough medicine to someone with stage 4 cancer\".[247] After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed the American Health Care Act would cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, Schumer said, \"Republicans in Washington and the president should read this report cover to cover, throw their bill in the trash can and begin working with Democrats on a real plan to lower costs for the American people.\"[248] In June, Schumer sent McConnell a letter requesting that all senators meet to discuss the American Health Care Act, citing the need for both parties to \"come together to find solutions to America's challenges\".[249] Later that month, Schumer estimated the bill had a 50% chance of passing the Senate and added that Democrats were doing everything they could to fight the measure, calling the legislation \"devastating for the middle class\".[250]\nHomeland security\nIn 1995, Schumer sponsored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 (H.R. 896) in the House of Representatives.[251]\nAs a senator, Schumer has worked to secure homeland security funds for the New York State and New York City and provide resources to its first responders. He delivered over $20 billion to support New York's security and recovery efforts after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York City and worked to deliver $200 million in Homeland Security funds to protect New York City mass transit.[252][253][254]\nIn November 2001, Schumer announced hearings on George W. Bush's decision to try terrorists in military tribunals amid Washington concerns that Bush would skip the American legal system in handling such cases. Schumer said the hearing's two goals were to ascertain whether Bush had the power to form a tribunal apart from an attempt at interacting with Congress and whether a military tribunal was the most efficient instrument.[255]\nIn August 2004, after American officials leaked the arrest of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan to reporters, Schumer said he was troubled by the decision to reveal Khan's identity, citing the fact that the public had learned little of Khan's role in providing the information that led Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to announce a higher terror alert level.[256]\nSchumer supported continuing to fully fund the FIRE Grant program[257] the Federal Emergency Management Agency administered. The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.[258]\nIn March 2018, Schumer said the bipartisan legislation sponsored by Bob Casey and Pat Toomey would assist the children of deceased first respondents afford college by increasing the availability of Pell grant funding.[259]\nIn August 2018, Schumer announced that the Senate had passed $1 million in FY2019 funding for the national firefighter cancer registry as an amendment to the upcoming FY2019 Health and Human Services minibus appropriations bill. He said firefighters needed \"first-rate medical care and treatment\" for the work they did and the registry would help \"researchers track, treat, and eventually prevent firefighters being stricken by cancer\".[260]\nImmigration\nWhile discussing an immigration bill on the Senate floor in 2010, Schumer likened Indian tech giant Infosys Technologies to a \"chop shop\". When his statement set off a wave of outrage in India, he acknowledged his characterization was incorrect.[261][262] The remark was also called \"outrageous\" by U.S.-India Business Council head Ron Somers.[262]\nSchumer is one of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who wrote and sponsored a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. At the time, Schumer was the chairman of the Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.[263] In June 2013, the immigration bill passed the Senate with a strong majority—68–32, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats—but the House of Representatives under Speaker John Boehner refused to take up the bill, and the legislation died.[264]\nIn April 2012, Schumer introduced SB 1070, a bill that would kill Arizona's anti-immigration law, and ones like it if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: \"States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they are simply 'helping the federal government' to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant.\"[265]\nIn January 2018, Schumer stated that any agreement on the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals before its March expiration would have to be included in the spending bill.[266] Schumer offered Trump congressional approval of more than $20 billion for his border wall in exchange for protecting recipients of DACA. Trump declined the offer. A week later, Schumer announced that conversations on immigration and border security were resuming between the White House and himself.[267] In a March CNN op-ed, Schumer wrote that Trump had stood in the way of progress on \"compromise proposals that both sides should be proud of\" and charged Trump and the White House with using Dreamers as \"bargaining chips to push forward their anti-immigrant agenda\". He called on Trump to change course and said Americans would be aware that he was behind the prevention of Congress from settling the matter.[268] In June, before a planned meeting between Trump and House Republicans for discussions on the compromise immigration bill, Schumer warned that House moderates would lose credibility if they succumbed to pressure and enacted \"the hard right's agenda\".[269]\nIndyMac Bank controversy\nOn June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators about IndyMac Bank, the country's seventh-largest savings and loan association and ninth-largest originator of mortgage loans, which he considered a severely troubled institution. Schumer wrote that he was \"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac.\" Many IndyMac depositors either panicked or, from another perspective, justifiably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed.[270]\nA Treasury Department's inspector general audit found that the primary causes of IndyMac's failure were associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a \"run\" on the thrift after the public release of Schumer's letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.[271]\nOffice of Thrift Supervision (OTS) director John Reich immediately blamed IndyMac's failure on the letter's release. Reich said Schumer gave the bank a \"heart attack\", saying, \"Would the institution have failed without the deposit run? We'll never know the answer to that question.\"[272] Reich and top deputies later resigned or were removed amid a Treasury Department audit and investigation revealing that Indymac had been allowed to backdate its financial reports.[273]\nSchumer conceded his actions might have caused some depositors to withdraw their money prematurely, but said, \"if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today. Instead of pointing false fingers of blame, OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs.\" He added, \"IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks ... It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we're now in.\"[274][275]\nDespite IndyMac's condition before the failure, the financial media sharply criticized Schumer. CNBC financial analyst Jerry Bowyer charged that he was responsible for the \"second largest bank failure in US history\".[276] While opining that IndyMac's failure was only a matter of time, banking consultant Bert Ely called Schumer's actions \"wrong and irresponsible\".[277]\nOn October 18, 2008, The Wall Street Journal published an article suggesting that an investment company's interest in IndyMac might have prompted Schumer's letter.[278] His reported close ties to the founders of OneWest Bank have long been of interest to many action groups. On December 22, 2008, The Washington Post reported that the OTS regional director in charge had been removed from his position for allowing IndyMac to falsify its financial reporting.[279][280] The same day, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh continued to blame Schumer and recast IndyMac's July bankruptcy as an \"October Surprise\" planned by Democrats to help win the 2008 election.[281]\nSame-sex marriage\nSchumer voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996.[282] He opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, saying in 2004 that DOMA made it obsolete.[283]\nIn March 2009, Schumer announced his support for same-sex marriage, noting that it \"was time\".[284] He previously supported civil unions. At a private dinner with gay leaders on March 22, 2009, Schumer said he not only supported same-sex marriage, he also backed a full reversal of DOMA.[285] When the New York State Senate took up a bill to legalize gay marriage in December 2009, Schumer and other statewide officials aggressively lobbied wavering senators to support the legislation.[286]\nStudent loan forgiveness\nSchumer supports the cancellation of $50,000 or more in federal student loan debt for every borrower by executive action.[287]\nSubprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis\nIn September 2007, Schumer proposed that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan (\"affordable\") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment.[288]\nAfter the March 2007 meltdown of the subprime mortgage industry, Schumer proposed a federal government bailout of subprime borrowers to save homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values.[289] As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to move from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.[290]\nSchumer's top nine campaign contributors are all financial institutions that have contributed over $2.5 million.[291]\nTaxes on high incomes\nSchumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the mid-2000s, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry. Then serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income.[292] But in 2010, he suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry.[293]\nIn February 2012, Schumer at first said he disagreed with the Obama administration's call to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year, calling for a million-dollar floor instead. According to Schumer, \"in large parts of the country, that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that is associated with wealth.\"[294] He later stood by the assertion but also said that raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 was necessary to bring in enough revenue.[294]\nTechnology and the Internet\nIn June 2011, Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin sought a crackdown on Bitcoin, saying it facilitated illegal drug trade transactions. \"The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,\" which used the anonymizing network Tor.[295] One opinion website said the senators wanted \"to disrupt [the] Silk Road drug website\".[296]\nSchumer was a sponsor of S. 968, the controversial PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights.[297] On January 18, 2012, the NY Tech Meetup and other cybertech organizations held a demonstration with 2,000 protesters in front of the offices of Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who also supported the bill.[298][299] Some demonstrators complained that the bill had originated with wealthy campaign contributors who would reward legislators for passing the bill.[300]\nIn March 2012, Schumer and Senator Richard Blumenthal gained national attention after they called upon Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to investigate practices by employers to require Facebook passwords for employee applicants and workers.[301]\nSchumer has offered political support to Facebook, acting as an ally and seeking to advance the company's interests in Senate debates about regulating it or probing its involvement in various controversies, including Russian interference in the 2016 election.[302] In July 2018, he confronted Senator Mark Warner, and urged him not to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.[302] As of 2018, one of Schumer's daughters worked as a marketing manager at Facebook.[302]\nU.S. attorney firings\nAs chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the investigation of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy.[303] Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, such criticism was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.[304][305]\nOn March 11, 2007, Schumer became the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign for firing eight United States Attorneys. In an interview on CBS News's Face the Nation, Schumer said that Gonzales \"doesn't accept or doesn't understand that he is no longer just the president's lawyer\".[306] When Gonzales's chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, resigned on March 13, Schumer said during a press conference that Gonzales was \"carrying out the political wishes of the president\" and declared that Sampson would \"not be the next Scooter Libby\", meaning that he did not accept that Sampson had sole responsibility for the controversy.[307]\nLike other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both parties, Schumer was angered during Gonzales's testimony on April 19, 2007; Gonzales answered many times that he did not know or could not recall details about the controversy. When Schumer's turn came to ask his last round of questions, he instead repeated his call for Gonzales to resign, saying that there was no point to further questioning since Gonzales had \"answered 'I don't know' or 'I can't recall' to close to a hundred questions\" about the firings (most press reports counted 71 instances) and did not seem to know about the inner workings of his department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give \"a full, complete and convincing explanation\" for why the eight attorneys were fired.[308]\nOther work\nIn January 2007, Schumer published a book, Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time, outlining strategies by which Democrats could court middle-class voters. One of his aides at the time, Daniel Squadron, helped write it, and they drew from Schumer's experience helping his party win in the 2006 midterm elections.[30][309]\nOn November 21, 2023, Schumer made his Broadway debut in a one-night performance as the Producer in Gutenberg! The Musical!.[310]\nPersonal life\nSchumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, were married on September 21, 1980. The ceremony took place at Windows on the World atop the north tower of the World Trade Center.[311] Weinshall was New York City's commissioner of transportation from 2000 to 2007.[312] Schumer and Weinshall live in Park Slope near Grand Army Plaza.[313]\nThe Schumers have two children, Jessica and Alison, both graduates of their father's alma mater, Harvard College. Jessica served as chief of staff and general counsel of the Council of Economic Advisers from May 2013 to August 2015.[314] Alison is a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office.[315] In 2018, Jessica gave birth to a son, making Schumer a grandfather.[316]\nElectoral history\n| Year | Office | Type | Party | Main opponent | Party | Votes for Schumer | Total | Result | Swing | ||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Total | % | P. | ±% | Votes | % | ±% | |||||||||||\n| 1998 | Senator | Dem. primary | Democratic | Geraldine Ferraro | Democratic | 388,701 | 50.84% | 1st | N/A | N/A | Won | N/A | |||||\n| Ind. primary | Independence | Mark Green | Independence | 2,562 | 58.04% | 1st | N/A | N/A | Won | N/A | |||||||\n| General | Democratic | Al D'Amato (inc.) | Republican | 2,386,314 | 51.09% | 1st | +5.52% | 2,551,065 | 54.62% | +6.82% | Won | Gain | |||||\n| Independence | Conservative | 109,027 | 2.33% | 4th | N/A | ||||||||||||\n| Liberal | Right to Life | 55,724 | 1.19% | 6th | −1.03% | ||||||||||||\n| 2004 | General | Democratic | Howard Mills | Republican | 4,384,907 | 65.42% | 1st | +14.33% | 4,769,824 | 71.2% | +16.58% | Won | Hold | ||||\n| Independence | 216,198 | 3.23% | 4th | +0.9% | |||||||||||||\n| Working Families | 168,719 | 2.52% | 5th | N/A | |||||||||||||\n| 2010 | General | Democratic | Jay Townsend | Republican | 2,686,043 | 58.47% | 1st | −6.95% | 3,047,111 | 66.33% | -4.87% | Won | Hold | ||||\n| Working Families | 183,672 | 4.00% | 4th | +1.48% | |||||||||||||\n| Independence | Conservative | 177,396 | 3.86% | 5th | +0.63% | ||||||||||||\n| 2016 | General | Democratic | Wendy Long | Republican | 4,784,218 | 64.72% | 1st | +6.25% | 5,221,945 | 70.64% | +4.31% | Won | Hold | ||||\n| Working Families | 241,672 | 3.27% | 4th | −0.73% | |||||||||||||\n| Independence | Conservative | 150,654 | 2.04% | 5th | −1.82% | ||||||||||||\n| Women's Equality | Reform | 45,401 | 0.61% | 6th | N/A | ||||||||||||\n| 2022 | General | Democratic | Joe Pinion | Republican | 3,022,822 | 51.69% | 1st | −13.03% | 3,320,561 | 56.78% | -13.86 | Won | Hold | ||||\n| Working Families | Conservative | 297,739 | 5.09% | 3rd | +1.82% | ||||||||||||\nHonorary degrees\nSchumer has been awarded several honorary degrees in recognition of his political career.

And that's not right.\"\nWith the Senate set to begin debate on new gun measures as soon as this week, it remains uncertain how much of Obama's broad gun-control agenda — laid out less than a month after the tragedy in Newtown, Conn. — will be enacted.\nThe current version of the Senate gun bill would strengthen current laws on gun trafficking and straw purchasers, increase grants for improvements in school safety and expand background checks to nearly every gun purchase.\nSens. Chuck Schumer, D-.N.Y., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., have been working for months to put together support for compromise background check legislation that would allow unchecked purchases for certain private gun transfers. Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., is the latest Republican to consider signing onto the legislation and continues to negotiate with Manchin on the details of the bill. But no deal has yet been reached\nMeasures to bar high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons — crucial parts of Obama's original package — have been left out of the main bill and are expected to be voted on as amendments.\nStill, the gun bill is facing increasing opposition from the GOP.\n\"Senators have an obligation both to uphold the Constitution and to promote solutions that effectively address national problems,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of the 14 who have threatened a filibuster. \"The current gun-control proposals fail both tests.\"\nReid also expressed frustration on Monday with the Republican senators and called on them to rescind their threat to block votes.\n\"I'm deeply troubled that a number of my Republican colleagues went so far as to send me a letter saying we will agree to nothing, there will be no debate, there will be nothing, we want you to do zero on anything dealing with stricter gun measures,\" Reid said. \"There is simply no reason for this blatant obstruction except for the fear of considering anti-violence proposals in full view.\"\nThe White House said Obama traveled back to Connecticut on Monday — he hadn't been in the state since a vigil held days after the tragedy for the 20 young children and six adults who died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy — to call on Americans to put pressure on Congress to act.\nAfter his speech, Obama returned to Washington on Monday night with 11 family members of Sandy Hook victims who planned to lobby lawmakers on Capitol Hill to take up the president's gun agenda. The White House extended the invitation to the Sandy Hook families so they could attend Obama's speech and still get to Washington in time to meet lawmakers, according to White House press secretary Jay Carney.\nIn recent weeks, Obama's traveled to Denver, Chicago and Minneapolis to amplify to try to win public support for his gun-control agenda. But Obama has left much of the heavy lifting of pushing his legislation to Vice President Biden, and senior aides.\nOn Monday, Obama chafed against the suggestion that failure to pass significant parts of his gun legislation would amount to a political failure for him.\n\"This isn't about me,\" Obama said. \"And it shouldn't be about politics. This is about doing the right thing for families like yours that have been torn apart by gun violence, and families going forward.\"\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In the days leading up to last month’s crucial votes on the most significant gun control legislation to come before the Senate in nearly two decades, polls showed that about 90 percent of Americans supported background checks for all gun purchases. But when the clerk called the roll, the centerpiece amendment — requiring background checks for firearm sales at gun shows, through classified ads and on the Internet — got just 54 “yea’s,” six votes short of the 60 vote super-majority required.\nJust four months after Adam Lanza killed 26 people at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and President Obama promised tougher gun laws, the vote proved to be the latest in a long-running string of victories for gun rights activists, the firearms industry and particularly the National Rifle Association, the nation’s pre-eminent gun lobby.\nThe power of the gun lobby is rooted in multiple factors, among them the pure passion and single-mindedness of many gun owners, the NRA’s demonstrated ability to motivate its most fervent members to swarm their elected representatives, and the lobby’s ability to get out the vote on election day. But there’s little doubt that money, the political power it represents, and the fear of that power and money, which the NRA deftly exploits, have a lot to do with the group’s ability to repeatedly control the national debate about guns. Whether that fear is justified is an intriguing question —but it clearly exists. That has, perhaps, never been clearer than it was last month on Capitol Hill.\nBig money, big gaps\nFor starters, the dollars and cents disparities are nothing short of staggering. The NRA and its allies in the firearms industries, along with the even more militant Gun Owners of America, have together poured nearly $81 million into House, Senate and presidential races since the 2000 election cycle, according to federal disclosures and a Center for Responsive Politics analysis done for the Center for Public Integrity.\nThe bulk of the cash — more than $46 million — has come in the form of independent expenditures made since court decisions in 2010 (especially the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision) essentially redefined electoral politics. Those decisions allowed individuals, corporations, associations and unions to make unlimited “independent” expenditures aimed at electing or defeating candidates in federal elections, so long as the expenditures were not “coordinated” with a candidate’s actual campaign.\n“Members of Congress pay attention to these numbers, and they know that in the last election cycle the NRA spent $18.6 million on various campaigns,” says Lee Drutman, who has studied the role of gun money in politics for the Sunlight Foundation. “They know what the NRA is capable of doing and the kinds of ads they’re capable of running, and especially if you’re someone facing a close election, you don’t want hundreds of thousands and potentially millions of dollars in advertising to go against you.”\nIn the decade before Citizens United, from the 2000 election cycle to 2010, much of the money was donated directly to campaigns. During that period, pro-gun interests so thoroughly dominated electoral spending as to render gun control forces all but irrelevant, having directly donated fully 28 times the amount of their opponents in House and Senate races, $7 million on the pro-gun side compared to $245,000 on the gun control side. Of the total expended by gun rights interests, fully $3.9 million was delivered by the NRA. Since the Citizens United decision, gun control interests have gained new financial muscle, thanks largely to independent expenditures totaling at least $11.6 million by activist New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and groups tied to Bloomberg — nothing to sneeze at, but still just a fraction of that $46 million in post-2010 gun rights money.\nTOP RECIPIENTS OF DIRECT DONATIONS FROM GUN RIGHTS GROUPS SINCE 2000*\n| Rank | Candidate | Money | No. of Races |\n| 1 | John Thune, R-S.D. | $137,755 | 3 |\n| 2 | Dean Heller, R-Nev. | $85,215 | 4 (3 House, 1 Senate) |\n| 3 | Pat Toomey, R-Pa. | $83,169 | 4 (2 House, 2 Senate) |\n| 4 | Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga. | $79,950 | 2 |\n| 5 | Roy Blunt, R-Mo. | $77,935 | 6 (5 House, 1 Senate) |\n| 6 | Ted Cruz, R-Texas | $69,279 | 1 |\n| 7 | Richard Burr, R-N.C. | $67,300 | 4 (2 House, 2 Senate) |\n| 8 | David Vitter, R-La. | $64,561 | 2 |\n| 9 | Marco Rubio, R-Fla. | $59,439 | 1 |\n| 10 | Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. | $55,800 | 2 |\n*Gun rights figures include contributions made by political action committees that advocate for firearm freedoms, as well as identifiable gun rights group leaders and activists.

NRA expenditures ranged anywhere from a $95 contribution in one race to more than $2.6 million spent on the 2010 election of Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. A total of 38 of those senators have gotten $15,000 or more in overall NRA help since 2000. Among the leaders: Ron Johnson, R-Wis., $1.2 million, Rob Portman R-Ohio, $1.35 million, Richard Burr, R-N.C., $852,000, John Thune, R-S.D., $717,000, and Saxby Chambliss R-Ga., $355,000. In several races, gun rights groups spent independent money both for one candidate and against his opponent (see chart). Forty-one of the 46 who voted with gun rights groups against expanded background checks were Republican.\nFive Democrats also voted against the background check amendment, although Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did so to preserve his right under the Senate’s arcane rules to bring the measure up again. Reid, who has a B rating from the NRA, has benefited from $30,200 from gun rights groups since 2000, including $18,400 from the NRA. The other four Democrats who bucked their party and voted with the NRA, have benefited from a mere $30,830 in total funding from gun rights groups since 2000. Max Baucus of Montana (NRA A+) was the beneficiary of $28,830 while Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor (NRA C-) got $2,000. Mark Begich of Alaska (NRA A) and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota (NRA A) have received no money from gun rights groups.\nAs for the 54 senators who voted in favor of expanding background checks, at least 18 of them have also benefited from gun rights group help since 2000. By far the largest chunk — $1.7 million — benefited a single NRA “defector,” Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., the co-author of the background check amendment. The money those 54 have received since 2000 from gun control groups totals just $608,827.\nMayor Mike and his forces\nBloomberg, who founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006, is a relatively new player in the gun debate but apparently wants to level the playing field. With a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at about $27 billion, he has taken on the issue with great deliberation, organizing political allies, financing sophisticated research and, more recently, spending sizable amounts of his own money on pro-gun control television ads and elections. Prior to the most recent Senate votes Bloomberg said he would spend $12 million on issue ads aimed at 13 key senators, only four of whom ended up supporting his position. He has reportedly made a six-figure donation to Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group run by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband Mark Kelly, which financed television ads encouraging senators to vote for tougher background checks. And Mayors Against Illegal Guns is contemplating an ad campaign to make an example of Arkansas Democrat Mark Pryor because of his vote against the background check proposal.\nMost of Bloomberg’s campaign money so far has gone to House races; his Independence USA PAC, a super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited money, has spent more than $11 million on six such races, mostly in 2012, with victories in half. In February, the PAC scored a major victory when it spent $2.8 million in Illinois to defeat NRA-endorsed former Rep. Deborah Halvorson and elect Robin Kelly, both Democrats, in a race to fill the vacant seat of former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. Halvorson had an “A” rating from the NRA during her one term in Congress. Independence USA PAC also scored a victory in California where it spent $3.3 million to defeat an NRA A-rated Republican, Joe Baca, for a House seat; and it helped unseat A-rated and NRA-endorsed Republican Ann Marie Buerkle in New York. In Orlando, Fla., Bloomberg’s super PAC spent $2 million in an unsuccessful effort to unseat Republican Daniel Webster. Webster had an A rating from the NRA, which endorsed his candidacy. His opponent, Val Demings, was rated F. In Illinois, Bloomberg spent nearly $1 million in a failed bid to keep Republican Robert Dold (NRA rating of D) in the House. Dold lost by less than 3000 votes. Bloomberg has also spent nearly $60,000 of his own money on 16 Senate candidates since 2007, and Bloomberg also contributed $500,000 to a political action committee supporting the 2012 Senate election of Maine Independent Angus King.\nBloomberg has said he’s prepared to tap his personal fortune to support gun control — or what he prefers to call “anti-crime” — candidates and defeat those aligned with the NRA. And he recently announced that the mayors’ group will publish its own NRA-style ratings of senators on the gun issue. He hasn’t said how much he’s willing to spend, but if the races he’s gotten involved in so far are any indication, it’s going to be a lot. Stefan Friedman, the spokesman for Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC, said the NRA has had “a wide open playing field for decades” and that’s no longer the case. “The Mayor’s been relatively clear in the wake of last [month’s] decisions in Washington and in other comments that this is an issue he cares passionately about.” So far, Bloomerg’s Independence USA PAC may only be batting 50 percent, but no one seriously doubts that a few million dollars thrown at a race for a House seat or a state legislative contest could have a huge effect. If Bloomberg is serious about staying in this game, he will undoubtedly make a difference. Says NRA President David Keene, “We can’t outspend Bloomberg.”\nComplex calculus\nThat remains to be seen. But a closer look at the background check vote — and NRA influence generally — reveals that there’s more at play than just cash. A lot more. The backgrounds and histories of the two sponsors of the background check amendment — Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican — illustrate some of those complexities.\nBoth Manchin and Toomey have “A” ratings from the NRA — or at least they did until last month. Both represent states with large numbers of gun owners. Pennsylvania has more NRA members than any other state, and sells more hunting licenses each year (2.5 million in 2012) than any state except Wisconsin. And Toomey has been the Senate’s leading beneficiary of NRA largesse. In 2010 the NRA spent more than $1.79 million to elect him and an additional $1.15 million on negative advertising to defeat his Democratic opponent Joe Sestak Jr. Thanks in part to those court decisions that loosened campaign finance limits, the nearly $3 million the NRA spent on the Toomey race was more than three times the total amount spent by the NRA for all of Toomey’s Senate colleagues combined between 2000 and 2010.\nAsked about its spending on Toomey — the most the NRA has ever spent on any candidate — NRA President Keene joked, “It just shows what money can do for you.” The reality, however, as Keene acknowledged, is that the NRA’s spending on that particular race — in which Toomey spent a total of $17 million against his opponent’s $12 million — may have very well made a critical difference. Toomey won by only two percent of the vote.\nBut when it came to Toomey’s vote on expanded background checks, other factors were at play. “The Manchin-Toomey proposal,” says G. Terry Madonna, a political scientist and pollster at Franklin & Marshall College, “is very similar to a Pennsylvania law which was approved by a legislature that was Republican controlled, and signed into law by Republican Governor Tom Ridge with the support of the NRA.” According to Madonna, Pennsylvania’s expanded background checks, first approved in 1995 and amended in 1998, were non-controversial.\nDefending his proposal on the Senate floor, Toomey was careful to affirm his pro-gun credentials, insisting that “there is absolutely no way that this can be construed as an infringement on Second Amendment rights.” He argued that his proposal was a modest effort “to make it a little bit more difficult for criminals and the dangerously mentally ill to purchase handguns.” Toomey noted that under current Pennsylvania law, “anyone who buys a handgun anywhere at any time has a background check.” Having lived with such checks for more than a decade, Toomey apparently agrees with Madonna that they have been a non-issue for most of his constituents.\nNevertheless, the history of the background check issue still speaks to the power of the NRA. The organization knows it can’t win every race or every vote. But it can turn what was once a total non-issue — expanded background checks — into a matter of existential concern for senators. Making that case at the national level was particularly audacious because the NRA not only endorsed background checks for Pennsylvania back in 1995, in 1999 it supported them for the nation at large. Testifying before Congress following the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre testified that “it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone.”\nAsked about the contradiction at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January, LaPierre equivocated, but said the NRA believes the current law is not being enforced and therefore should not be expanded. “I think the National Instant [Criminal Background] Check System the way it’s working now is a failure because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch” when they fail a background check.\nA multi-pronged approach\nWhatever the reasoning, clearly the NRA’s gifts were not a key factor for Toomey in deciding to sponsor the background check amendment. A total of 14 other senators who have benefited from gun lobby money also supported his amendment. On the other hand, three senators who never received a single dollar from gun rights interests — Begich and Heitkamp, the two Democrats mentioned earlier, as well as Republican Dan Coats of Indiana — nonetheless voted against expanded background checks last month. Overall, at least 60 of the Senate’s 100 members have benefited from at least $1,000 from the gun lobby during their careers.\nOf course the background check amendment was not the only gun control proposal NRA supporters helped defeat. Senators also voted down a ban on assault weapons (40-60), a limit on large capacity magazines (46-54), and what might have seemed a thoroughly noncontroversial measure to make gun trafficking a crime (58-42). On top of that, they nearly passed (57-43) what is probably the NRA’s top legislative priority, a “reciprocity” measure that would have allowed citizens holding concealed weapons permits from any state to legally carry them in any other state that allows for concealed carry, even those with much tougher rules.\nNRA President Keene says claims that his organization simply buys votes with campaign contributions completely misunderstand the way the lobby works. The NRA, he says, is active in every state on a wide range of gun issues, and uses a broad range of tactics. “In a typical state we represent 10 percent of the persuadable Second Amendment voters” on any given gun issue, Keene says. Those voters, he says, include Democrats, independents and union members who are not only passionate about gun rights, but who rely on NRA ratings of members and endorsements of candidates at the ballot box. Keene says these gun owners are willing to pick up a phone and make a call when asked and cited one senator who he said got 5,000 phone calls opposing expanded background checks prior to the Senate vote. “It isn’t the money but the endorsements” that motivate lawmakers, Keene said. And those endorsements come from voting the NRA line.\nAmong the 42 Republicans who voted against stronger background checks, 40 are rated A or A+ by the NRA, meaning they virtually always vote with the NRA. Among the 41 Democrats who voted in favor of stronger background checks, 35 received ratings of D or F from the gun organization.\nGregg Lee Carter, a professor of sociology at Bryant College in Rhode Island and the editor of Guns in American Society, generally agrees with Keene’s view on the role of money, although he states the case differently. “The issue is not so much how much the NRA gives any senator or member of the House, it’s how they can make their lives miserable. And how they make their lives miserable is they e-mail ’em, they call ’em, they fax ’em, they show up at meetings. The typical person who is for gun control is very different from the [pro-gun] person calling you or being right there, being an annoyance, hassling you personally. They’re much more activist than the other side and that’s what really produces their gains.”\nYet when it comes to campaign contributions, Carter says that the amount contributed by the NRA is most often a minuscule percentage of a House or Senate candidate’s overall campaign budget. “Money is important,” he says, “but that’s not what it’s really about.”\nIt is difficult to say with any precision how often lawmakers are swayed by the gun lobby’s money or its endorsements. But there’s no question some fear the NRA’s ability to make their lives miserable. Suffice to say that at least two Democrats who are up for reelection in 2014 and voted with the NRA against tighter background checks — Begich of Alaska and Pryor of Arkansas — were probably unwilling to test their luck.\nThere are 26 senators up for reelection in 2014. Since none of these lawmakers have run since the Citizens United decision, the amounts they’ve received from both sides have been modest. In reality, the number of those who are actually vulnerable to pressure from either pro- or anti-gun money and lobbying is probably relatively small, and neither the NRA nor Bloomberg can be expected to throw large amounts of money at either Senate or House races where they have little chance of winning. What makes an incumbent fearful of pressure on gun issues is an inexact science, but a recent analysis by New York Times data guru Nate Silver suggests that a key factor to look at is the rate of gun ownership in a given state. Silver found that among the 26 senators up next year, there was a “near perfect” correlation between gun ownership in their states and how those senators voted on the background check amendment. Where gun ownership in a state was 42 percent or above, 13 of 14 senators voted “No”; where ownership was below 42 percent, 11 of 12 voted yes.\nWins and losses\nBut not all fear — even fear of the NRA — is rational. And it is by no means evident from the record that the average senator or congressman should fear the NRA anywhere as much as many apparently do. In 2012, the NRA invested $4.3 million in 16 senate races, but won in only 3. It endorsed 20 candidates, but only nine of them were victorious. In 15 Senate races during 2010 and 2012 in which the NRA made its largest contributions — $200,000 or more either to support a candidate it favored or to defeat one it opposed — it won only six times. The NRA also spent $13.6 million last year to elect Mitt Romney and to convince voters, as LaPierre told a conservative audience in 2011, that President Obama, once re-elected, planned to “get busy dismantling and destroying our firearms freedom — erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights and exorcise it from the U.S. Constitution.” Most Americans were unconvinced.\nThe NRA may be losing a lot of elections but, as it noted in a statement last November, “both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House will continue to have pro-gun majorities.” The NRA’s genius for convincing a substantial number of gun owners that they are at Armageddon’s doorstep at any given moment has also been terrific for the group’s bottom line. Although its critics have long challenged the NRA’s claim to four million members, Keene now says the NRA has added an additional million since President Obama pleaded for new gun laws in the wake of the Newtown murders.\nMeanwhile the NRA’s most recent lobbying report shows that the organization and its legislative affiliate spent at least $800,000 lobbying the federal government during the first three months of 2013. In the previous year, the NRA spent $2.5 million on lobbying, 62 times as much money as the $40,000 spent by the leading pro-gun control advocacy organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\nRegardless of which side you’re on, it hardly seems like a fair fight. But it is a decisive fight. The NRA was victorious on every gun vote cast in the recent Senate debate and may have buried the chances for any gun control this year. It was by almost any measure an impressive performance — whatever the reason.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

In a direct and candid message, Collins refuted several rumors he described as “whoppers.”\nCollins began by reaffirming VA’s commitment to prioritizing Veterans.\n“We’re putting Veterans number one back at the VA,” he said. He acknowledged that changes can generate friction, but emphasized that these reforms are aimed at strengthening VA services for Veterans.\nAmong the rumors he challenged was the claim that VA health care would suffer. Collins categorically denied this, stating that the department has reinforced health care and benefits by safeguarding 300,000 mission-critical positions to ensure uninterrupted services.\nAnother rumor he addressed was that Veterans’ benefits were being cut.\n“They’re not,” he said, explaining that VA had redirected nearly $98 million toward Veterans’ care and services rather than reducing them.\nFinally, Collins addressed the rumor that VA was laying off Veterans Crisis Line responders.\n“We did not lay off any Veteran Crisis Line responders,” he stated firmly, assuring that those answering crisis calls remain in place to support Veterans in need.\nCollins concluded by urging Veterans to seek information directly from VA rather than relying on misinformation circulating in political discourse. “When you want the truth, come to me, not the Whopper line up on Capitol Hill.”\nVeterans are encouraged to visit news.va.gov or contact their local VA offices.\nTopics in this story\nMore Stories\nVA tests ambient AI scribe technology, an AI-powered tool that listens, records, and processes the conversation between health care providers and patients. Early results show improved efficiency, more accurate records, and a better overall care experience for both Veterans and VA providers.\nSecretary Collins and Deputy Secretary Lawrence have made deploying the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) a top priority.\nHome-Based Primary Care (HBPC) teams now have a faster and more secure way to support Veterans in remote areas, even those without internet access, thanks to the recent implementation of the Oracle Health Community Care app, formerly known as Mobile Care.\nDear Honorable Denis Mcdonough,\nAs a proud veteran, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the reported proposals by the Department of Veterans Affairs to reduce disability benefits by up to 30% for veterans once they reach the age of 67.\nThese proposed cuts would represent a profound betrayal of the commitment our nation has made to its veterans. Disability compensation is not a retirement benefit—it is a lifeline for those of us who live every day with the physical and psychological wounds of military service. Age does not lessen the impact of service-connected conditions; in many cases, it makes them worse.\nI served my country with honor, and like many others, I continue to bear the consequences of that service. These benefits are a recognition of sacrifice—not a luxury to be withdrawn arbitrarily based on age.\nI respectfully urge you to take a firm stand against this proposal and use your platform to protect the rights and dignity of California veterans. Please advocate against any policy that seeks to reduce disability benefits for aging veterans, and help ensure California leads the way in defending those who served.\nThank you for your time and for your continued service to our Country.\nRespectfully,\nVeteran, U.S. Marine Corps\nThis is false crises responders and dispatchers who were on probation were let go the same as numerous federal employee who were on probation across the federal government. The VA was already understaffed.\nDoug Collins is sucking Trump’s dick and he can fuk the fuk off because they are fuking with people…. my dad cannot renew his subscriptions through the VA now because everything is fukd up so Doug Collins while you continue to sit there and twiddle Trump’s balls stick your nose in his ass crack and breathe\nreal deep and suck his fukin cock…veterans are losing their lives…\nI hope they find yours soon\nSecretary of Veteran Administration\nOur Veteran who fought for our Country are dieing because of you people and the people are all suffering because of Our Government federal employees who have not completed there jobs.\nI kinda believed him until he started spewing Trump propaganda. That’s when I knew it was all bullshit. Trump despises veterans. He has said so himself. After hearing this, I’m more worried than ever.\nI suspect this “Comment” board is being invaded by far-left-wacos that are not happy with the election or maybe they are just to dense to understand what is being done to save our country. Anyway, thank you for setting the record straight. I am looking forward to doing my part in helping to Make America Great Again.\nMr. Secretary,\nI thank you for your service.\nI am an attorney with some involvement with 2 Camp LeJeune claimants.\nKindly address the snails pace of the VA resolving the claims.\nGood informative video from Secretary Collin’s, and I’ll Trust him until we can prove a lie has been told. Until, I support their efforts on Fraud, Waste and abuse. In the end, it just might mean an increase of benefits for Veterans. Pray for it !\nYou are just a talking head for the new regime and you are twisting facts in this statement.\nI am sorry, but I don’t believe you. As the CR has shown, VA benefits are being removed. You serve Trump, not the Veterans. Trump and his republican cult followers do not care about Veterans, as anyone who has listened to Trump can tell you. The removal of anything to do with BIPOC from federal agencies websites, Including the VA, shows how little this administration cares about veterans who are not white.\nAs a woman veteran, I am especially scared of what the next step is after the erasure of BIPOC/women from Army, Navy and other branches websites. Will my service be removed? Will I lose my disability because I am considered to be a DEI hire? Will my contributions to my country be null and void because I am not a male? With this administration, anything seems to be possible if it suits their ideology.\nTo be candid, the Trump administration is White Washing history and that seems to include any reference to the sacrifices and service of those who don’t fit the image that is apparently the “superior” race (i.e. white, cis-gender men).\nI cannot believe anyone who supports Trump to be an honest broker. Sorry – not sorry.\nCollins is full of shit. President heel spurs doesn’t care about vets. He called McCain a loser. This country is going to hell-I would move to Canada but I’m 77 and just too tired.\nProud of my late air force husband and father and navy father in law.\n.\nThanks for the update. Not knowing is a burden but knowing is a blessing.\nWhat about now? Still saying this? Crisis hotline still intact? Hiring freeze still in place? In general – veterans aren’t being impacted? What a disgrace you are.\nThere are 9 million veterans in the United States who voluntarily served and took an oath to the constitution, volunteered their lives for the nation. They continue to live, service before self, integrity, always faithful to our nation and its people. Cutting the budget and personnel at the VA is going to make 9million people and their friends, families and patriotic supporters very unhappy. That’s ALOT of votes ?️ in the military, all differences were put aside when we needed to have each other’s backs. That’s why we still return to recover our dead to bring them home with honor from WWI/WWII to Vietnam and Korea to OIF/OEF. No veteran left behind – ever. The VA budget and personnel should be increased and that should be the only change made – the only question the administration should be asking is how can we do more to support our veterans.\nSpin, hyperbole and deception: How Trump claimed credit for an Obama veterans achievement!!\nFor 28 years Ive put veterans ahead of myself. Sacrificed everything I had to\nbe in DC decade after decade. Watching things get worse. Been so very hard.\nCost me everything I had. Could have paid off a home many times over by\nnow on what it cost me. Never giving up. Hard damn life.\nBut, Ive never seen any Sec of VA do more damage in the first 30 days as Ive\nseen you do here. Slash and burn is enough? What do we know?\nYou never even gave vets like me a chance while I wrote you. Im not even worth\na proper letter response. Insult is all you have. You didnt do better without me.\nI have experience, decades of it. VA federal advisory committee as well.\nGuess what, insults are all you will get from here out. Be paranoid about that.\nRumors? Seems like the rumors are right since we cant expect hard facts from\nyou or any admission of them. Leave everyone guessing, only job safe is your\nown.\nToo late to fix any of that.\nIm looking forward to the Senate hearing that removes you from office. It wont\nbe far off. 2 years after that, no one will give you the time of day including Trump.\nYour a unremarkable person, undeserving of the position you filled. Your not\neven a good villain, your a mediocre person bluffing people. Boy do those people\nfind there not even welcome on LinkedIn.\nJust resign, and find yourself a nice 7-11 job out of veterans view. You had your\nchance, and the longer you delay the worse it gets when you do resign.\nThe level of incompetence and corruption at the bloated VA is unsustainable. There are 473,000 employees so laying off 15% of non-essential staff is a start. The Electronic Forms project cost $10 billion and is only implemented at 6 of 71 facilities. Making employees work in-person not remotely. Ending racist DEI program spending. All of them are common sense business practices that need to be properly managed. It’s only been 60 days you can’t pass judgement yet.\nIf this administration is talking, they are telling lies. Why should anyone in their right mind believe a single word you say?\nI think that at the moment you have no idea of what’s coming your way. I hear you but don’t believe you….your boss Elon Musk is coming to you soon. When this happens the veterans past and current will stand up and resist\nThank you for clearing this up.\nYou keep telling us that benefits and critical staff are not being cut, but who are you cutting and where are you cutting. Somethings are going to be reduced, so please lay out your plan and the impact to us Veterans.\nThank you\nWhen the so-called Commander-in- Chief calls individuals in the military “LOSERS AND SUCKERS” you can bet he is NOT, and I repeat NOT a fan of anyone in the Military. So why should or would we believe, he’d do ANYTHING for the Veterans????\nI know a lie when I see one. Take this chaplain out back and explain to him what real veterans think of him. We don’t need cult fealty to a king in our VA. Go fuck yourself you buddy fragger. This guy touched the military through the only “job” in uniform that shouldn’t exist. I’ve got news for you, two cults isn’t better than none.\nWOW, Thank you for this very informative video. It answered every question that this retired Marine Vet had. Question, is there any way to remove that BK Whopper stand from Capital Hill. All that thing is doing is causing miss information, confusion and heartaches. Thank you again for this update and I will look forward for more positive things from this new and improve VA with the Patriot, President Trumps seal of approval. Semper Fi!\nKeep following the cult. jarhead. We’re all soo very proud of you.\nSemper fi in this instance means always faithful to a cult.\nI’m so very sorry this is so true.\nAre you serious or are\nyou being sarcastic?\nIt is hard to tell sometimes.\nVeterans deserve a leader with backbone, not someone who merely toes the political line. When will he find his own center and truly advocate for those he claims to serve?\nThese people dont have “centers”. That’s literally the entire prob in a nutshell. If you think a “man of god” should talk down to other people, follow a rapist cult leader, and call another man daddy. I’d say you’ve been perverted a touch. Men and women who trade thier values for perceived comfort are exactly the opposite of what we should all want in a soldier, doubly for those who lead them.\nYou fired 26 support employees from the veterans crisis line. You say no “responder” has been fired, but you fired their support staff. All 26 were rehired only after the press and senator Duckworth pressured you on it. Don’t use VCL as a token talking point when you blindly cut it like you did everywhere else, claiming that support staff are waste. VA needs more support staff, that’s why veteran care suffers. VA hasn’t been able to fill its clinical vacancies for years because no one wants to work in a place that has no support. To “protect” vacant, abused, and unwanted clinical positions while firing their support staff is a cheap ruse and a double cut to Veteran care. All so that you can suck the president’s dick and usher in the ACCESS act for your corporate cronies to empty the VA coffers even further and reduce the VA to a federal insurance provider. There’s a reason the VA was made, because Veterans health is not best served by community providers who know nothing about military exposure. When you’re done sucking why don’t you bend over for him too.\nThis is ridiculous. Why do you find it necessary to disparage any predecessor? What good does that do? “Motion causes friction”. Maybe you could expound on that and address what is being cut or even looked at? If you were searching for waste, you’d be using auditors and inspectors general. This is not what is being done.\nI don’t believe anything from the failing Democrat news source\nWhy does anyone who does not watch the biased Republican news source, like Fox news, as Democrat new sources? I am not a democrat, but I find Fox news as inaccurate. Besides, Fox news consider themselves as an entertainment service rather than an “accredited news station” in the courts regarding lawsuits against Fox news.\n.\n40% of the population trust Fox news, 40% distrust Fox news. The population or people following Fox news is nearly the population of the Republicans. Independents and Democrats prefer other news sources.\n.\nOther new sources are more unbiased than Fox news, and are not Democrat news.\n.\nWhat do you consider as unbiased news often watched, and not the entertainment Fox service?\nand the funny thing about this is that ONLY Faux entertainment channel had to pay out 787 million dollars for lies and defamation.\nDo you believe mouth breathing talk radio with gems like Buck Sexton, Dana Loesch, nutcase Wendy Bell, Dan Mangina and the list goes on. Keep your stupid comments off of here.\nNow I hear that the funding going forward will be at levels prior to the Pact Act. I also hear on the news that Republicans want to repeal the Pact act altogether. Is that true?\nThank you for the update. It’s very important to Veterans to hear direct from the VA. The news is so biased and untruthful. I find it difficult to\nbelieve what I hear any more. We need to continue helping our true hero’s. For years men and woman have joined our Military Service to protect our country. They have been treated disrespectfully and believe under paid for their service. Even family members that are left at home while our service men and woman fight to protect us, are not always treated well. They deserve our respect. We still have to many Veterans that are homeless and struggling to get over issues causes by serving our country. I am proud to be a wife of a dedicated Marine who served and retired. Thank you again for letting people know the true facts.\nWhy at 30% disability do they take it out of my retirement that I get for 20 years service and put the taxes back on it and then put it back into my retirement check and say that is my payment or 30%, so it’s like I’m paying myself for my disability.\nI watched your interview with Maria Bartiromo this morning on Fox.\nMy experience with the VA is very good and has been for the last 30+ years.\nI would rather visit my primary doctor at the VA than the one on the big list from Medicare\nMy primary care takes time to discuss my issues and I feel confident of the diagnosis and service\nThank you for the reassurance that you are in control of the situation.\nOf course Jethro appears on Fox, it’s friendly and he does not have to answer for his or that joke of an administration’s BS. He’s another bootlicker and is completely in lockstep with DJT and that illegal immigrant Iranian terrorist Musk.\n“President Donald Trump claimed to receive a 2016 award from military veterans that didn’t exist and falsely denigrated the record of the late Republican Sen.

How to you terminate 72,000 VA workers to make it better for the veterans.\nHow does firing veterans from the DVA “make it better for the veterans”? I think the fire veterans would not agree with Mr. Collins, especially the Disabled veterans.\nAnd they can sue as well! Collins should be more supportive of employees especially vets. Kick the non-vets out of DVA first if you have to do cuts. Less chance for recourse\nRep. Greg Murphy (R-NC) said it is possible that the Republicans’ budget proposal will cut veterans’ care and benefits.\nLast week, the House narrowly passed the spending blueprint 217-215. If enacted into law, the measure will cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and $1.5 trillion in spending over the next 10 years. The measure comes as President Donald Trump and White House adviser Elon Musk have made sweeping cuts to staff at several departments in the name of “efficiency.” Among the jobs cut were more than 1,400 employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nOn Monday’s CNN News Central, Brianna Keilar asked Murphy, who serves on the Veterans Affairs Committee, if he has heard from voters regarding the cuts. The lawmaker responded by saying the department had “over-hired”\n“Again, the word that we’re finding, really, in the lexicon today is ‘accountability,’” he said. “And we really need to get the nation’s finances under control. Everybody is, of course, up in arms because they don’t want their issue or their particular agency dealt with. But this is a national emergency to try to get our finances under control.”\nKeilar pressed her guest on whether he has heard from constituents over the issue, and Murphy said he had. The host then asked whether benefits would be cut for veterans.\nI am a Vietnam veteran, and a friend of mine, who is a democrat, sent me a poster today that’s announcing they’re going to have a demonstration at our County courthouse on Friday at noon protesting project 2025 and taking benefits away from veterans. So I had to research that and I’m glad I did because I found this website that denounced those rumors.\ni have been trying to get my civilian doctor to be set up as my VA provider for a while and here are my reasons:\n1 he has been a certified Dr for 30 years and my Dr for 13 years. he has a waiting list for patients.\n2 i have had 6 VA Drs in 12 years and 1 civilian DR in 13 years\n3 if the Va starts letting us use civilian DRs (of course they should be verified to be good doctors and not prescription writers or scammers) it would mean the VA would not need to employ as many DRs.\n4 and final My first 2 and current VA Drs Send/Sent me prescriptions that i know nothing about. meaning they did not tell me they were going to send them. my first 2 sent me pain pills and muscle relaxers and my current has send me vitamins and pain ointments which is better, but i should be told about recommended meds so i can have input. my civilian Doctor has never sent me anything he did not 100% agree was needed and that he had not explained to me why i needed it.\nI appreciate the openness and direct response to scaremongering. As a veteran, I have experienced disrespect by those holding a position in the VA for a paycheck without truly caring about the individuals they were there to support. So thank you for looking out for us!\nMarilyn T Henderson\nTSgt, USAF (Ret.)\nDoug Collins, back in action, hasn’t skipped a beat with his condescending dear leader jive.\nI am just not buying this.\nI am a DAV Chapter Commander and a DAV CSO. There is some understandable concern being expressed by staff at our VA facilities. Change is always concerning and certainly, disabled vets don’t want to see the physicians and staff we rely on for our health and welfare adversely impacted. But rumors don’t help, they hurt. I work with hundreds of disabled vets and family members of disabled vets. These folks have been through enough and don’t need to live in fear that their lives are about to change. I appreciate that the Secretary has addressed these rumors. I addressed them with membership at our monthly meeting last week. If any vet experiences a problem they should address it immediately with a Patient Advocate or, if necessary, the VA’s IG Office. You should also inform leadership of the veteran groups you support through your membership. Organizations like the DAV, American Legion, VFW etc. exist to serve and protect veterans through advocacy and representation. Trust me, if things start to impact on vets, we are going to speak up. Until then, we should support leadership as they tackle the tough assignment of providing uninterrupted service to vets and their families while also identifying and eliminating waste and bad staff.\nThe VA IG was fired by Trump. There is no hope for discussing concerns to a VA IG.\nThe va didn’t work before trump. If you think a 3 month waiting list to see a doctor is going to get better, I’ve got this stick of dynamite, I mean , this candle I’d like to sell you. What makes you think the guy that bankrupted 7 businesses and fucked the rest he worked with, or a billionaire who destroyed tesla and Twitter are equipped to pull off any of these falsely stated goals. Get retards out of government. Start with the separation of church and state and fire this Jesus cuckhold.\nUmm, I would prefer not to be spoken to in such a “hunky dory” way, it belittles our veteran concerns. Responding so cavalier is disrespectful and shows one of 2 things (not that they are mutually exclusive). 1. This is the type/level of professionalism that we can expect from Mr. Collins. or… 2. Mr. Collins behavior/approach to speaking directly with veterans is that we are “folks” not that bright or intelligent for real dialogue opposed to simplified speech delivered with silly colloquial demeanor.\nNeither one or two reflect well on Mr. Collin or the VA at the moment, please do better!\nMichelle,\nHe will use sign language next time. There is that better? Come down off your high horse. I didn’t consider myself belittled. So maybe it might just be you. Look at it this way, you could have had clown Kamala break it down to you in a thousand-word statement, and for all the burden it might have been, you still would not understand what the hell she said. Have a good day!\nCharles,\nGo outside and touch some grass, please. When you can learn to grow up, come back and have civil discourse with the rest of the adults.\nMichelle, never mind Mr. Harris. It’s not just you! We all know how long it takes to be seen, and there’s a good chance it will be rescheduled before you are! This has happened more and more, and is directly due to staffing shortages. I don’t hear anyone saying it’s going to make things better, only that it will save money. We already know why he is so desperate to save money, he has to fund those giant tax cuts for his rich family and friends. Once they have reduced staff to bare bones, I fully expect that they will begin to cull eligible veterans, starting with lower Priorities in order to “improve service”. I did feel talked down to by a Trump appointees as well.\nDEBORAH\nYea!!!!!!! you tell them. OH and how do you know it is directly due to staffing shortages? Let me guess, you know a friend who said so. You do know that staffing shortages is the excuse every employee will use or every customer will use when things don’t go there way. Its like losing the super bowl and saying we lost because our best player was hurt not because the other 55 players played bad. Every losing team will give that excuse. case in point, mayyyyybe the process could be streamlined and actually work better and more efficient. The VA may not need all the bloated personnel. But i am sure you have insider information and know EXACTLY how to fix it. lol\nCPT? Captain of what? What high speed combat unit were you a company commander in?\nSo rude guy, what are you veteran of?\nExcept how can we trust a word you say? trump is a traitor who has planned (project 2025) to reduce benefits, to deny access, and to send veterans out to community care (which does NOT have the ability to absorb all these new patients nor do they understand veteran needs. As it is, I have never dealt with a VA system that wasn’t already understaffed and overworked (they do great work, but there’s too much!). I am currently waiting on a VERY BASIC admin change and my claim has been ‘in progress’ since December of last year! The VA needs to be hiring more people, not firing the few we have.\nAmen, yo are right on. I appreciate your candor\nConnie,\nCould you please tell me when TRUMP said he was going to enact Project 2025? You cant, i already know you cant, so stop telling lies and actually try to listen better. The ONLY people talking about project 2025 are the lefty liberals pushing an agenda such as yourself. So, if Trump is a traitor just because you decided to spew that suck out of your mouth, then i guess you are a traitor. See how that works? I have no basis to say that and neither did you, but you decided to say it on a forum to once again push a false narrative. Get a life and quit making false accusations. Oh and TRUMP had nothing to do with your VERY BASIC admin change in December. That was your sleepy/dead corpse Joe and his Kamala Clown. I am sure you were real proud of that clown show of an administration…..but by all means, keep spewing your false suck out of your liberal mouth. You make me laugh.\nWhat does Biden/Harris have to do with the Trump/Collins adverse policies? Trump is the president now. The House has already voted on massive cuts taking from the Project 2025 Rule Book, still awaiting Senate approval. Trump numerously shunned Senator McCain, a Republican because he was a POW. This shows how much Trump hates veterans and attempting to cut IU for disabled veterans, shows how much he cares for the disabled veterans. Veterans need to be concerned regarding the Trump/Collins anti-veteran policies. Senator McCain asked for VA hiring increase to help with the issue veterans were dying while waiting for DVA medical appointments, not Biden/Harris. You need to use the facts instead of your political hatred to appease you hate for Democrats. Keep this forum concerning veterans, not the previous people who cannot further affect the veterans.\n“keep spewing your false suck out of your liberal mouth” has noting to do with veteran concerns or issues.\nI am not a Democrat, but a 100% disabled veteran, VFW and DAV lifetime member. You are nothing but a hateful anti-Democrat political Troll. Take your politics somewhere else.\nCutting over 80,000 jobs at VA while veterans have to wait over 3 months to be seen just doesn’t make sense.\nVeterans working at VA getting fired is just irresponsible. Trump obviously does noy care for veterans.\nSusi,\nWho did you vote for? NVM, I already know. The corpse and his clown Harris. The 80,000 jobs cut, could have been all the janitorial jobs within the VA. Did you ever think of that? You have no clue, even if you worked at one of the VA’s. Now what? I work at one of the ALC’s and there are over 60,000 that took the buyout or was terminated, but I can only tell you of about 4-5 that I know. You must be talking directly with Mr. Musk since you know how that 80,000 fired personnel are going to affect your VA appointment scheduling. And remember, this was already the norm under that joke of a President sleepy Joe Biden. OOPS, DIDNT THINK ABOUT THAT DID YA? President Trump is one of only 2 or 3 Presidents we have EVER had that cared about the VA and its veterans. Biden and his clown show worried about DEI and hiring the WOKE and keeping the BORDER wide open. But I digress. Please, carry on with the ignorance.\nThat is why he dodged the draft five times. Get a grip, it does not matter who anyone voted for ole spur heals, draft dodging dump give tax cuts to who, his rich buddies that never served a day in their lives.\nDVA does not have 80,000 janitors. In Trumps last term, veterans died waiting for appointments, Senator John McCain, a Republican POW, helped fixed this with VA hiring bills. Trump tried to disgrace this POW veteran, publicly. This website is for the helping veterans, not for a democratic hater who also cares less for veterans. Collins wrote the memo to fire DVA employees, not the democrats. What does DEI, Woke, and the Border have to do with DVA? Trump’s last term was to cut IU vet benefits to veterans also receiving Social security on a dollar for dollar ratio to pay for his border wall. Veterans should be concerned about loss of VA benefits as in the Project 2025 excepts already voted for in the House. You hateful comments towards veterans is unwelcomed.\nDale, thank you, US Army & US Air Force, Lt. Colonel Retired\nWow. You sure have been watching a lot of the Faux entertainment channel Charlies, I guess you think it was the P…. y grabber in chief that signed this…. It is a sad day in America.\nPresident Obama Signs Bill to Give the VA the Resources It Needs\nAugust 7, 2014 at 1:44 PM ET by Cameron Brenchley\nI heard that!!!!\nThank you for the Whopper – no/cheese.\nI’m lactose intolerant :)\nSo weird. The VA scheduled an appointment for me in April to “re-evaluate” my benefits. What are the odds they increase my benefits?\nWatch what this man does, not what he says. I won’t believe anything this man says until he can prove to us veterans with actual actions that prove that these whoppers he speaks of are not happening.\nThanks, Secretary Collins. Glad you are at the helm! Veterans can be proud again.\nDon’t put words or feelings in any other veterans mouths. You don’t speak for any sane veteran. If you watched donald send a mob to attack your capital and still support him, you are not a hero but a clear enemy of america. We Shouldnt have to brush shoulders with anti american cult members In the va. You are the opposite of a hero and a terrible example for your children.\nSo you found you could get Burger King to sponsor you BS\nHow about doing something for the Veterans that never served in combat zones or got out with a personal injury that makes them eligible under the rules for the last 50 years. I served 09/1975 thru 05/1985 plus reserve duty time. I am in a group that served but got a GI Bill but no medical benefits. I guess raising my right hand several times didn’t mean anything to the Greatful Nation!!\nWhat can you do to bring my service age bracket of 68-78 year olds that served an equal chance for VA healthcare.\nRichard Charles,\nI too served 1975-79 + 2yrs reserves I signed up for healthcare benefits about three years ago: no issues. I’ve had good healthcare ever since. Wonder why you’re not getting it? Inconsistencies are rife in our VA. Fight it! I have no confidence in our current President or his appointees; Fight for what is yours.\nYou didn’t earn it.\nAnybody who signs and knows their lives is on the line and can be carried at any given time DESERVES it and has EARNED it!\nSo you are saying that a Veteran who served his or her country can only get benefits if they were in combat? Well Trump didn’t even serve, in fact ole spur heals, dodged the draft five times. Get a life\nHate Keith all you want but he is correct for retirement purposes you didn’t earn it. However, the VA is a different story/ issue. You need to talk to them.\nIf you ain’t combat infantry, you ain’t shit.\nNo CIB, or even CAB? Then you didn’t do shit, therefore, you didn’t earn shit. Stay out of the VA system so you don’t clog it up for the actual warriors who did actual warrior shit.\nWhat a crock of crap, If you didn’t serve in multiple branches, then you ain’t crap, you are just a looser\nSo you are not changing anything…..and that is reason for a commercial endorsement of Trump. Collins along with being a brown nose is an embarrassments to Veterans that served our country and not the Orange Messiah.\nYou accused anti-Trumpers from creating whoppers, but Trump lies as proven by 34x fraud convictions. You did not respond to my questions listed in my last post with thousands of other disabled veterans questions. Your statements in both video still lacks proof and is opinionated.\nFact: You increased DVA firing from 70,000 personnel to 80,000 personnel, approximating a forth of the DVA employees.\nFact: Reduction in Employees will result in the same problems during Senator McCain’s (Republican) era, where veterans died waiting for there appointments.\nFact: Appointments are taking longer.\nFact: Surgeries have been cancelled in DVA.\nFact: DVA clinics reduced staff and appointment availability has started Tele-appointments. Professional doctors lack the staff at DVA clinics and hospitals and now use doctor from other locations to cover for the missing doctor at my location. My physiatrist is stationed in Alaska and I am in Arizona.\nFact: There is a bill in Congress creating a concurrent receipt between DVA and Social Security disability payments. Trump tried this in his last term to help pay for his wall at disable veterans costs. For every dollar a disabled veteran received from Social Security, a dollar will be remove from a disable veteran’s disability compensation.\nFact: Congress wants to reduce DVA budget, also reducing disabled veterans benefits.\nProve me wrong with specific facts in your next video or stop the lying with your opinionated videos. Respond to the questions after this video and you previous video. You create PTSD in disabled veterans and DVA employees. Be truthful.\nYour insult the disabled veterans with you lies,\nDale,\nHave you ever heard the saying “More is not always better”? It is called doing more with less and getting better results with less payments going out. Yea, efficiency is the term for it. Look it up. But you will have to take your biased leftist views out of it and pick your battles that actually mean something. VA ran awesome under Trumps first term, and it will again, after they get the WOKE out of the VA all together. Funny how I get what you get and probably more, yet, I am not worried about losing it, why are you?\nHave you ever heard the saying “Less is not always better”? It is called, hollowing out, which happens to many companies and countries following your ideology. So take your right wing biases out of it and look at what is actually happening. Your benefits are being degraded, why are you being willfully blind to it?\nMark,\nNever heard of the business term hollowing out. So Mark, what is actually happening, since you are so well versed into ideology. What specific ideology is that? UM, how have my benefits been degraded, i can still get into see the VA doctors and dental ANYTIME i need to, never had a problem and i am still receiving my monthly payments right on schedule. SOOOOOOOOO, I FAIL to see your analogy here. What benefits of mine got degraded? Please, i need to know so that i can blame it on Trump since your corpse and clown show was ousted out of the white house this past November. That Joe was something else wasn’t he. I sure do miss that clown, as well as, not being burdened by what has been. lololol\nAre you a moron?\nGlenn,\nI will take it as, that is all you can say, Glenn. No substance to back it up or anything to prove that what is happening within the VA, as of today, will not make it better. I GUESS YOU CAN “SAY YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU DONT KNOW”. But as all the LIB-TARDS on here keep saying, ITS TRUMPS FAULT. keep telling yourself that, maybe it makes you feel better. Guess what, He is still your President over the next 4 years. lololololol. See how comical this has become? All the bit**ing in the world will not change that fact. Oh and please let me know when my benefits change. For all you crying wolf, i still have not seen any benefits or money lost. Have a great week knowing your President is President Trump. Thank GOD for that. I rest better at night knowing he has my back. :) Truth 100!\nCharles can’t define woke and keeps deflecting to the former administration.

My benefits are fine, not sure what the hell you are complaining about. AAAAAND YOU DO KNOW, the VA issues that are happening now are coming off the corpse and clown decisions from the last 4 years of running the VA into the ground. As i said above, for all you READERS out there, you have no idea what areas within the VA were cut so how the hell do you know how it is going to affect you going forward, Mr. Psychic? They could have cut all the landscaping contractors, janitors, and fake tree waterers (yea, that one cracks me up, but i am sure you are real worried about them as well you lib-tard) MY BENEFITS HAVE NOT CHANGED but please keep running with this narrative. I am sure you will start with PROJECT 2025 because that is all you lefties can boast about even though not one of you can send a video or statement from Trump that said he was enacting Project 2025. But keep spewing it, i am sure you can get some people to believe it over the next 4 years. lolololol\nWow, facts not fiction here in these URLs. Draft dodging, “President Donald Trump claimed to receive a 2016 award from military veterans that didn’t exist and falsely denigrated the record of the late Republican Sen. John McCain on veterans affairs”.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/john-mccain-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-veterans-veterans-affairs-f322b3774b773cc29a527bc6f9b204ad\nBiden supported the PACT Act to help disabled veterans. Trump tried to reduce IU disable veterans compensation to hurt the disabled veterans and cursed Senator McCain, a Republican, for being a POW and supporting VA. Between the three, I pick Senator McCain first and Trump last.\nAlso, I am not a Democrat.\nMuch like with the address that Trump made to Congress, I would recommend you become literate as to what WOKE actually means before you refer to it. “WOKE” is the concept of being actively aware of the political environment and policies, especially those dealing with Race, Gender and Religion, and how they will have an impact on your daily life. Of course it has more recently been used in a derogatory manner to describe those who have jumped on certain political band wagons, or suddenly become over-enthusiastic about a cause that is based in popular politics, as being “WOKE”. In reality nothing has changed, except that there is a convenient term that few know the proper usage of that has been touted in the headlines and become popular to use.\nEven the attention on the term WOKE, and wanting to get rid of it (even though not knowing what it is), is in itself being WOKE…so kind of silly don’t you think?\nHey George, i know enough about WOKE to know that i dont want to have any part of any one ACTIVELY AWARE of race, gender, and religion in politics from the left side. By the way, when did the LIB TARDS finally decide that they were actually going to come to terms about gender? LET ME GUESS GEORGE, he/him she/they /them/horse/cat/us/we/non binary, you and your left radicals are so much more advanced than us MAGA’s on all the new WOKE terms and agenda. WE Maga’s had no idea how dumb we were. Thank goodness people/douches like you and the left are so much smarter and can lead us blind dumb dumbs to see the radical left agenda and truth. AND just think, it was just 4 months ago, that more than half the country was thinking as dumb as me. Thank you George for setting us all straight. By the way, much like WOKE, people using the term MAGA, as a derogatory term, not truly knowing what it means, which stands for MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, is kinda silly don’t you think? Especially coming from a bunch of VETS! But I digress. Now run along and keep pushing that agenda. How is that working out for you and the radical left so far. BUT there s hope, you can still let men beat women in sports. Keep on pushing that agenda. I like 8 more years of JD Vance after Trump.\nYawn. Go back to bed with your stupidity and bigotry. Bullying transgenders because you are a coward. You still can’t define woke and yes, you people are uneducated and ignorant. Get off of here.\nCharles Harris Pls stop sniffing glue. Nothing you say makes sense.\nAs a former employee of the VA I can think of many ways to cut the budget other than this hatchet job that is being done. Many probationary personnel fired for no reason. Nobody bothered to check their performance records before letting them go. Many of them on probation because they got a promotion or changed jobs where the the probationary period begins again. This has been done with no discernment whatsoever. Shame on you for allowing this to occur.\nKandis,\nCutting employees to save money is not a reason? AND here I thought for all these years, that major corporations were firing people to save money. Little did I know they were doing it just to do it, “FOR NOOOOOOOOOO REASON AT ALL”. How dare they, try to run a business more efficiently. Shame on them. :/ Think about what you are saying before saying it.\nThe VA is not a business\nJohn,\nAbsolutely it is, the money has to come from somewhere, congress maybe? Therefore, Congress is the MONEY and Trump is the CEO. VA still has to operate under the same principles. Spend the money unwisely and Let the money dry up and what would happen to it? Just like a business the doors would close for good. OHHHHHHHHHH, YOU are one of those lefties that thinks money can be printed anytime the US wants to or runs short and we will never run out. Now i see your logic. Yep! Same logic that is going to keep all the illegals getting free healthcare, food, housing, cars. Just print more money and keep pushing forward. lol, you are kind of funny aaaaaaaaaaaaaand a little dumb. :)\nThe VA is not a service. I earned by doing two tours in Vietnam and one is Iraq.\nTerry,\nIf it is not a service OR a business as you stated further down in another post, what the hell is it? lol\nYour boy is a cult leader implant with 100% fealty to a king. You are not “hearing directly from the va” you are hearing the donald trumps lies through his cuckholds mouth like a ventriliquist. This guy is a partisan plant with distorted Christian nationalism as a guiding light. He has no business being anywhere near. REAL SOLDIERS. If you cant tell a liar when you see one, shame on your ignorance it’s not a legal defense and it’s social poison, good luck with that.\nA lot of hype and short on specifics like we are all stupid!\nAre They Going Privatize The VA Health Care The Secretary Said He Wasn’ t Going Lay People Off What If Elon Musk Decide To\nHow does this make sense? VA needs the staff to attend to a growing population. I worked in the va as a supervisor and all the issues we had were due to not having enough staff to process the large amount consults being sent out. There is only so much one person can do in a 8hr tour of duty. The same staff that schedules must schedule within 7 days, confirm pt went to appt, request med recs, answer phones, get preferences, and put records into pt rec system. Each of those task take a considerate amount of time as these require an individual to actually answer the phine when we call. Just saying, looking into actual ways to improve the system such as systems that actually communicate with community recs or find ways to use AI to assist with timeliness .\nI really like Sec. Doug Collins! He speaks my language and tells it like it is without the typical politician gobbly-gook. I look forward to more of Sec. Collins video feeds!\nComparing Congresspersons to BK Whoppers is nothing but ” politician gobbly-gook”.\nToo bad he doesn’t speak coherent English for the rest of us, LOL.\nThat’s why they should have appointed somebody from NYC, New Jersey or Philly. Someone with some balls\nThe VA here in Boise treats all vets incredibly well. I have always had top notch care here. Not sure about other VA facilities across the nation, but kudos for the Boise VA. The VA has come a long way to provide the services that all vets deserve. Cuts are necessary in the government to be able to sustain services across the board, so the citizens need to understand this.\nI don’t believe that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is being fully truthful or transparent. How can veterans feel comfortable when on his watch he is not disclosing the breadth and scope of veterans personal and confidential data that has been given over to DOGE and Elon Musk?\nHe, and the Department of Veterans Affairs refuses to share and discuss this truly outrageous breach of trust and confidentiality.\nWhen I called both local VA officials and DC officials they say it is “not in the VA’s ability to give out that information.” Also, they give us the White House phone number to call and request it. When I did, the White House, instead of letting me know, hung up.\nIs this the how the VA respects veterans, their concerns and most of all their confidential records?\nAnswer this for me please if you will:\n1) Why is our data in the hands of DOGE? What was the purpose of veterans data being released to an unauthorized (by congress) to a 3rd party that is not an official department.\n2) Where is that data? Is it still in the hands of DOGE when there are lawsuits pending and they were asked by courts to destroy it.\n3) If Doge currently is holding the data, what is the Secretary doing to get it back?\n4) What measures are being put in place to future proof further breaches to our supposedly protected and private data?\nDavid,\nDo you really think, be honest, that DOGE, gives a damn about your information. They are cleaning up the waste and fraud, plain and simple. If Elon wanted to use your information to steal from you, he would have accomplished that with PAYPAL. HE IS THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD!!!!!! Let that sink in for a moment. Try giving the man that could be on a beach somewhere not giving two thoughts about America or its citizens a little gratitude and a thank you. He is the reason we will continue to receive our benefits in the future because he is going to save our government and country from going bankrupt. Just think about it. Quit letting your leftist political view and hatred for President Trump get in the way of your main concern. THESE TWO are the reason you will get your payments and benefits in the future. Relax. :)\nWhy does DOGE require our personal information. Yes, Trump has a history of using personnel information to guide trollers to harass his victims. Just look at DOGE firing of all prosecutors and investigators involved with investigations of Jan 6.\nDavid is right to be concerned about this.\nDale,\nI think you and David must view yourself as someone REALLLLLLY IMPORTANT. You Sir are just another click in the clicker. They could care less about what you got. NOW, if you got something to hide and they find it, that is on you, if you did everything right and in good conscious, you’ll have nothing to worry about. I am not worried, why are you? As i said before, we are just another click in the clicker. :) I work for the OC/ALC here at Tinker. If my bosses, President Trump, Elon, and Sec Hegseth had to let me go because of the cuts, then I would just have to go. I know they are doing what is best for the country. Same as with any CEO in a major corporation, if they do not need me or they need to cut me to save money, i would have to accept it and move on to another Job. That is life my friend. But calling the President names, lets me know, this is not about you knowing or feeling what is right and wrong, you are a leftist and want to blame Trump for everything. MAYBE if you had that same worry about OLD JOE and his clown show HE and his CLOWN would have been re-elected. But we know how that turned out, and by the way, the VA was woke and run into the ground with OLD JOE at the helm, and you know it!!!!! Remember……click, click\nDraft dodging, “President Donald Trump claimed to receive a 2016 award from military veterans that didn’t exist and falsely denigrated the record of the late Republican Sen. John McCain on veterans affairs”.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/john-mccain-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-veterans-veterans-affairs-f322b3774b773cc29a527bc6f9b204ad\nBiden supported the PACT Act to help disabled veterans. Trump tried to reduce IU disable veterans compensation to hurt the disabled veterans and cursed Senator McCain, a Republican, for being a POW and supporting VA. Between the three, I pick Senator McCain first and Trump last.\nAlso, I am not a Democrat, but Biden is not currently running the show, but Trump and Collins are running the show. Why does hateful Democrats blame the new policies on Biden when he cannot affected the Trump adverse anti-veteran policies.\n“They are cleaning up the waste and fraud, plain and simple” LMFAO here is a typical Fox viewer willfully ill-informed\nMark,\nTell me more about the middle. CNN, MSNBC maybe? yea i thought so. So enlighten me as to what they are doing? YOU KNOW, since they are NOT cleaning up fraud, waste, and abuse. Please tell me the hidden agenda i just cant SEE for the trees. Ill wait, Mr. Insider. I am sure you will break it down from the MSNBC perspective since they are so non far left leaning. I am still waiting for allllllllllll these facts that you people from the lib-tard left keep saying has happened. My benefits nor my monthly pay has not changed. Let me know.\nI agree with David W. and Charles Harris probably never served and he is a spur heals, draft dodging dump supporter. VA IS NOT A BUSINESS, nor should it be run like one.\nTerry,\nI served 20 years 1 month and 2 days, 1990-2010, RETIRED AF. And i am still in the DOD working at the OC/ALC. What are you doing other than griping and looking for a hand out? I will save myself the time and copy / paste exactly what i told the other dumb dumb above that said the VA is not a business……….Absolutely it is, the money has to come from somewhere, congress maybe? Therefore, Congress is the MONEY and Trump is the CEO. VA still has to operate under the same principles. Spend the money wisely and doors stay open, spend it unwisely and Let the money dry up and what would happen to it? Just like a business, the doors would close for good. OHHHHHHHHHH, YOU are another one of those lefties that thinks money can be printed anytime the US wants to or runs short and we will never run out. Just go back to Congress for more. Now i see your logic. Yep! Same logic that is going to keep all the illegals getting free healthcare, food, housing, cars. Just print more money and keep pushing forward with that agenda as well. lol, you are kind of funny aaaaaaaaaaaaaand a little dumb Terry.\nIf you are a government employee. Ever hear of the hatch act? Posting fascist garbage on here and being hateful might get you terminated.\nCharles is a paid troll and judging by the way he writes, he’s probably one of those semiliterate teenaged lackies who work for that illegal Iranian Terrorist pedophile at his fake agency (DOGE).\nThanks. Finally.\nSo, they cut 82,000 positions out of 482,000. That is 17.22% of the positions, but they are not going to have any diminished benefits or service. Why does he sound like someone who is not to be believed? Has anyone tried to call the Crisis line recently to find out what is really going on? This guy is lying like no tomorrow. You know that the cancelled contracts he referred to will be redone with specific political donors who will benefit greatly with the new contracts. Gee? Who would that be?\nMartha,\nAre you trying to tell me that there is NEVER to many people hired for any company? I work for the government and can tell you that there are probably another 1 million that could be cut and we would still be putting sorties in the air on time. The government has grossly over hired to run most of its departments. ALL the ALC’s are sitting with a whole lot of FAT that can be cut loose. Did you ever stop to think, that of the 400,000 employees that are left, after the 82,000 personnel that were cut at the VA, that 200,000 may be in an area or position that is not needed as much as some other areas, such as, oh i don’t know, crisis line or doctors or nurses or dentist or dental assistants. Maybe, just Maybe, we don’t need people to water the fake trees in the VA hallways or 400 janitors for just 30 bathrooms in the building or 100 people for outside landscaping. You get the picture. But hey, I am sure you voted for President Trump, right? That is rhetorical, I already know the answer. :) I did and I am proud I did, even if he has to let me go from Tinker. As I told Dale above, “that is life”. Move on.\nYou’re obviously a moron. Every Trump voter I meet is a moron.\nSir, VA Healthcare has suffered the past four years. Instead of being greeted by American values, flags, and personnel, we are greeted by DEI, rainbow flags, and communists that don’t like us. I am broken for my Country, would do it all over again, but stopped going to my VA offices because of how SICK and disgusted I feel walking in to them. Being surrounded by people who DON’T share my values, don’t appreciate our Country, and don’t understand the price we pay VOLUNTEERING to fight for it. Before I was able to get a new psychiatrist, my last WOKE doctor told me that I didn’t deserve my benefits, and through different Veteran programs outside of the VA I found several other Veterans who she demeaned and insulted. That kind of service and treatment has forever tainted the VA for people like me. You have a lot to accomplish before I will trust you again.\nHello Keith,\nI was wondering how rainbow flags in the VA negatively affects your PCM/doctor from performing their job? And since you are going to the VA I’m guessing you have some type of medical issue, so being greeted by DEI would be a good thing. If you don’t know what DEI is, I can help you understand. DEI is size inclusive chairs and beds in medical facilities, work accommodations for a variety of disabilities, changing tables in men’s restrooms, breast feeding/pumping stations & accommodations, ramps and sidewalk curb cuts, pay equity & transparency, subtitles & captions (TV & phone), parental leave (time & pay), coming back to a job after birthing a child, belt extenders on planes, not having to just accept workplace harassment, various food options for vegetarians/vegans/kosher/gluten-free/etc at medical facilities, flexible work arrangements, non smoking areas/end of smoking indoors, wellness programs and incentives, more relaxed & inclusive dress code policies, rooms to pray/meditate at work & other public places, employee recognition programs, employee/network resource groups, large print materials, materials in different languages, multiple religious options at hospitals, accessible bikes and public transit accommodations, businesses not becoming fully cashless, and company-covered mental/behavioral health resources.\nA common misconception about DEI is that it’s just about hiring an under qualified person based on race or sex. It’s not. It’s actually a lot of things to include giving a qualified person of a certain race or sex the opportunity to be considered for a position that they would have never been considered for before. It’s opening up doors of opportunity that have been closed for years.\nWe fought for freedom in this country. But freedom isn’t forcing everyone to have the same values as you. And just because people support equality, wokeness and rainbow flags doesn’t mean they don’t love our country too. And lastly, just because I don’t agree with your post doesn’t mean I don’t care about you as my brother in the military. I served 20 years and one day in the Air Force. I hope you can find the service and treatment you are looking for and thank you for your service sir.\nHey Juan,\nYou are correct, I don’t need to be forced to see the same value as you either. So that means, I don’t have to sit and accept your rainbow flag in a VA that I have earned the right to use as well. You don’t see us forcing a made-up straight flag down your throat at the VA, now do you? I don’t need ANY OTHER FLAG accept the AMERICAN FLAG and or the DOD Flags in my VA. I don’t give a rats butthole about your dang rainbow flag. I DONT NEED TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE SLEEPING WITH OR YOUR PREFERENCE. Live and let live! I already know there are gay people out there. Why does their flag need to be up in any federal building to remind me? To push an agenda? I dang sure don’t see a place for it in my VA. So, I suggest we fly the ONLY FLAG we ALL fought for…….THE AMERICAN FLAG. That rainbow flag never entered my mind during ANY conflict.\nTo my fellow veterans against woke and DEI. Does the veteran preference points in federal jobs fall under DEI? Isn’t that diversity and equality in hiring? No, I guess not equality since it is a preference to veterans. Yes, WE are part of DEI.\nGreat message from Secretary of Veterans Administration.\nThank you for caring for all veterans\nBut hotline workers have been laid off.\nExcellent! I worked as an RVSR at Togus VA from 2002 to 2012, and it was a terrible center. Full of nepatism and kiss asses who did nothing except receive a nice pay check. I finally got fired because I bucked their system and fought for vets. I fought them in court and had the great pleasure of going face to face with the director and was able to speak my mind and tell the judge what really happened. I won my case after that! So please, Doug, get rid of the no loads that are holding positions just because they kiss ass and play golf with the higher ups.\nMy Healthevet has been taken away for thousands of Vets because of the new complex sign in!\nI served my Country 5 years in the far east and really need my Healthevet………They say if you can’t get logged in to use the phone……The phone system is broken and antique…..After waiting so long the phone just goes dead……If you do get person to talk to they are usually nice……..Right now I’m waiting for a call from from Anderson VA……..I am 80 and dyslexic living alone and can’t do this over the phone……My Humana is 9550 out of pocket and that is out so VA health is necessary……..If my community care gives out for my treatment for macular degeneration then I don’t know what to do……..This is not the way to treat a person that served in conditions you wouldn’t understand.\nWell, I visited my local VA clinic in Ventura, CA last Friday, and while they were very helpful as able, they told me up front that delays are worse and that many services are under review. I have had hearing aids through an outside source, Second Chance hearing, for a number of years. It was done through the CHOICE program and had been very easy to work with, once the approvals were in place. NOW, they are not approving the program for Second Chance, or at least not as they did in the past. And my devices are acting up and need service or replacement. So, now I have an auditory appointment weeks out as “the first step” it seems in taking Second Chance out of the loop, even though they have a local office that responds quickly and efficiently. That is, or WAS the reason for Choice to begin with. They did offer to take my devices and send them for service, but only after the now scheduled, weeks from now, appointment. And then they would be gone an indefinite time. Second Chance serviced the devices on site and if needed something had access quickly. So, is that how you are making it more efficient and HELPING? I will be 81 in a little over a week, and I depend on the hearing aids for assuring I understand people and such. Now, they are not dependable, though seem to work for short periods.\nI would like to see the veteran receiver a card like Medicare card and let them go to the doctor of their choice for care. This would do away with the state run VA which you have to go through just to get your benefits and you could go to your local drug store for prescription that the Dr prescribed rather than having the VA pharmacy tell you what you can get.\nMore hogwash coming from another lying Trumper!\nWhat did he lie about Steve? Just name one thing you can prove he lied about. I’LL wait!\n34 convicted counts of fraud proves he lies. The big lie that he won the previous 2020 election. He was going to lower inflation from day one. There are hundreds of lies by Trump. Do you blindly trust Trump?\nAs for Mr Collins, DVA is already showing appointment and surgery cancellations. DVA is firing disabled veteran from the DVA workforce. How is that helping the disabled veterans with their incomes? This is not helping the veterans.\nDale,\nYour ignorance is showing once again. Let me guess, you will bring every conversation back to TRUMPS fault. And let me ask you a question, you really think that by saying 34 counts of made-up felonies makes me shiver. Please tell me what law he broke and exactly what he was convicted for because some of the greatest minds in law are STILL saying they have not been told the exact charges he was convicted of. So, you may be the brightest law professor anyone has ever seen if you can come up with any actual law he broke and was actually convicted of. It was NEVER stated what law he broke. But go ahead and give it a shot. Ill wait. I’ll ask you the same question i asked STEVE, WHAT DID HE LIE ABOUT? Dont just make general statements. WHAT DID HE LIE ABOUT? Again, ill wait :) I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO LISTENING TO THE GREATEST MIND IN LAW. I didnt realize who i was talking to. This is an honor. :)\n34 counts of Fraud by a jury still prove he lies. This was viewed my most news networks, including Fox. But the question I asked was, “Do you blindly trust Trump?”\n“President Donald Trump claimed to receive a 2016 award from military veterans that didn’t exist and falsely denigrated the record of the late Republican Sen. John McCain on veterans affairs”.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/john-mccain-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-veterans-veterans-affairs-f322b3774b773cc29a527bc6f9b204ad\nFact or Fiction?\n“Trump found guilty on 34 felony counts in NY hush money trial”\n.\n“First criminal trial of a former U.S. president”\n.\n“Jurors in New York state court on Thursday found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star ultimately to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.”\n.\n“Trump now faces penalties ranging from probation to up to four years in prison for each charge of falsifying business records in the first degree.”\n.\nhttps://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/\n.\n.\nReference “I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO LISTENING TO THE GREATEST MIND IN LAW”, I am not a lawyer, but you can ask the jury and the Judge about the fraud convictions of Trump. They know the law better than both of us. By the way, did you listen to the evidence presented to the jury?\n.\nHe was impeached twice for breaking the law, for trying to affect an election by influencing Ukraine and for Sedition (Jan 6). 10 Republicans in the House voted to impeach him. The Republican Senators refused to acquitted him, but did not stated his innocence. The lead Republican Senator stated he should be tried in a court of law.\nSorry to break your faith in Trump, but if you still have faith that he does not lie to us, please present the court and jury was wrong, with the evidence presented to the jury, not by biased Fox News nor Mr. Trumps lies that he tells the truth.\nTrust anyone in this administration I don’t think so\nRobert,\nAND You trusted Biden and that circus to do what? I’ll wait, take your time.\nWorse to trust a convicted liar. 34 counts of fraud is 34 proven counts Trump lies. Biden was never convicted.\nWell now DALE, THAT just makes it all better since you and I both know they were not going to prosecute him for stealing top secret documents from the building ONLY because he was too old and senile. Yea you know you are talking out your butt now. You might want to do a little more reading on both his and Trumps issues. OH! and you do realize your issues with the VA have been under sleepy corpse Joe and his clown, the last 4years right? You make me fall off the couch laughing. :)\nOne more thing Mr. DALE. Who put 2 billion in ABRAMS made up account right before he left? You know, the one for all the free electric stoves. Don’t you think that 2 billion could have been used more wisely by the VA that you are having so many problems with today while under the watch of sleepy Joe the last 4 years? Yea, I thought so. :)\nTrump was charged with “crimes” that were created by democrats to charge him. He was tried by a biased judge in New York who contributed to Biden campaign and had a daughter who raised money for Biden. A jury selected from the most leftist district in New York … it was political, nothing more. Trump is doing all he can to save this country from the theft and corruption that has existed for years. You don’t hate the people who have been stealing from us… you hate the guys who caught them. Who’s side are you on?\nI am hopeful this new administration will make the changes many have said are coming but have failed, as a veteran awaiting decisions from the VA on disability benefits and healthcare, I am very pessimistic. I have been waiting over 9+ months (273 days) and counting for simple process to add my dependents to my disability compensation benefits. I completed a FOIA request to get a copy of my own C-File and after 8 1/2 months (259 days) this request was closed and no documentation provided. Timely access to VA healthcare is a joke, even after being hospitalized within the last few weeks for an ongoing issue I am unable to see a specialist because I am unable to get an appointment with my primary care VA doctor even for a referral. It’s situations like these that often make veterans feel like they are just a number and the sacrifices they made are meaningless. Many of us still fail to seek the treatments we desperately need because of the lack of access and care and often fall back onto what we were taught while on active duty, just “suck it up and deal with it”, until it becomes too unbearable and often times too late.\nSame here Shane! Tried to get my files through the FOIA and it was closed last week after 9 months with nothing provided. Also have been waiting 7+ months to get a dependent added to my benefits and it has never moved beyond step 1 (received).\nYou should be in the U.S. Senate Mr. Collins. But that’s another topic.\nNow for the VA. I’m a veteran enlisting in the Army at sixteen years of age on July 18, 1950. However, I didn’t get there until January 1954. I took Basic Training at Ft. Knox. I was then assigned as Cadre training inductees in tank gunnery. Nothing was done to protect me from hearing loss. By the time my term was up in 1953 my hearing loss was evident even to me. The ringing/booming noises in my ears were driving me crazy, but I thought nothing could be done about it.\nOn October 13, 1953 I reenlisted for three (3) years. My assignment? You guessed it. I was assigned to Ft. Jackson, again training troops in tank gunnery. The hearing loss only got worse. I asked to be reassined. The good old Army sent me to Korea. My job was first a tank commander, then a platoon Sgt. my hearing loss getting worse all the time. The engine noise was almost unbearable at times.\nI also experienced frost bite in the toes of my left foot, among other things.\nMr. Collings, I was then assigned to Fort Benning, again ito a tank company.\nI was discharged in October 1956.\nI went home (I was married by then) and I went to a business school on the GI Bill. I have always been grateful for that. That education launched me on a successful career in computers in the business world.\nNow the problems. This old yokel was a real DA. I was not aware that the VA would help with me with my hearing loss until I began talking to other veterans who had experienced similar problems. Oh, BY THE WAY, I had to have a titanium rod put in my right ear in the early seventies. I spent thousands on medical bills and hearing aids before I could get the VA to help me. I simply couldn’t affort the expense any longer\nThe VA kept refusing to help me. They kept saying that they (military) had no record of me having any hearing loss or frost bite and that I would have to provide proof of experiencing those problems while in the military. That incensed me as that was rhe most absurd thing that I had ever heard. Mr. Collins in my six (6) years in the Army, they had never tested my hearing or treated me for frost bite. Now they want proof. CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY.\nOne question before I go. Why is there such an employee turn-over in the VA? In Greenville, SC anyway?\nWhat’s a URL?\nRespectfully,\nLewis R. Vaughn, SC Sen. Ret.\n“IF YOU HAVE NO ENEMIES, YOU ARE APT TO BE IN THE PREDICAMENT IN REGARD TO FRIENDS.” —ELBERT HUBBARD—\nTrump is the biggest liar of all, if he lies about one thing, you can’t trust or depend on anything he says. He’s already broke campaign promises, prices are going up, he’s admitting a recession might happen now after saying prices would go down on day one. Smoke and mirrors, all of you.\nToo scared to post your name, but you will tell your democratic lies about our great president—– what a wimpy punk!\nNames should not be used with the factual complaints as 34x fraud convicted Trump (hence liar) use of Trump vengeance and DOGE having a copy of each of out individual records veterans files with a history of publishing the names of the completers so trolls like you can ruin their lives with threats and nasty e-mails and tweets.\nHow can you deny that Trump is a liar? It’s like denying the Earth is round. He lies even when he doesn’t have to lie. So here’s my name. I merely speak the truth. Unlike Collins who knows Musk has already started slashing VA jobs, of which over 40% were veterans working for the VA.\nTypical Anonymous. If you believe it, put your name on it.\nWhy? so you can troll him as many other Trump complainers get trolled and threatened? Why do you need his name anyways? What will you do with his name? As for Trump, 34 count of convicted fraud is proof he lies.\nYea, Mr. Anonymous, you tell us MAGA’s. That sleepy corpse Joe and his clown show Harris told nothing but truth, you know, BORDER WAS CLOSED, that is just one truth off the top of my head. There are so many more truths told by JOE AND HARRIS, I just don’t have the time to sit here and name them all. Again, falling off the couch laughing, you people are funny as hell. lol\nwhy are vets now being charged office visited charges\nI am a retired Decision Review Officer at Veterans Benefits and many of my friends are still working for VBA, making decisions on whether to grant benefits. In the decades I have known VA, benefits employees have been drastically overworked, with short staffing and mandatory overtime almost every single year. HOW ON EARTH will reduction in staffing make things better? It’s the same at the hospitals, where they are perpetually understaffed and now with the hiring freeze and the firings, they are in survival mode. HOW will this help veterans – who, by the way, make up 25% of the VA staffing. How is firing 25% of veterans at VA helping veterans? Yeah, answer me those whoppers.\nThat sounds like 1 of 230,378 lies already told. If The Orange one could he’d take all our money. Trust nothing these people say especially if they support layoffs which had already been done, so lie 230,379. They truly believe their bs\nI heard a rumor that VA Compensation beneficiaries may be required to complete a means test to determine if benefits would be cut or discontinued. Please address this to veterans in receipt of benefits.\nLoved this video . Glad Secretary Collins is in charge. . Just wish people would know how to get on these sites. Needs to be told the Veterans will be taken care of and Medicare & Medicaid isn’t going to be cut. Send letters to Dems. No matter what you say to them they don’t believe you. Spoke to a lady the other day. She was very nice most aren’t when I challenge them when they say president Trump is going to take our Medicare & Medicaid. Said definitely not\nShe said what channel do you watch? I said Fox News and I read. I asked her what she watched she CNN & NBC\nI live in Massachusetts. It’s hard to find anyone who will listen. I am 83 and I always remember whenever a Republican runs the cry is they are going to take away your benefits.\nGood Luck Secretary\nCollins. Shout it from the roof tops.

There is not one single records of me doing anything but being innocent for the Injustice and complete and total disrespect for me and my family. I have been screaming at the VA for over 3 years DUTY TO ASSIST find any unit records, still today you have not one piece of evidence or probably cause and have violated every right a man can have in the process. So instead of telling Whopper stories do your job get the facts about the crap the Army, DOD, and VA are flapping without so much as one shred of evidence. I demand relief and Justice for the lies and life that has been ruined. I’m INNOCENT GO GET THE FACTS before you Flame Broil my WHOPPER! Because if one more document comes from this Dept.

Now go process those 13 claims that have been sitting for 3 years while the adjudicators keep making matters worse and adding even more lies. Vets don’t want to hear you’re whopper stories we want to hear what we have already paid for in full what are you really gonna do to better this department for all Vets!\nI am seen at both the VA hospital in Seattle as well as the VA hospital in American Lake (Tacoma WA). They have bent over backwards to give me the best and most caring and considerate health care that I have ever had in my 75 years. All the people that have seen me have gone above and beyond to call me after different tests and procedures to follow up and make sure I was alright. Yeah, sometimes it is hard to get ahold of them but all in all I would rather go to the doctors and nurses in Seattle and Tacoma VA than any civilian care facility.\nI totally agree!\nWhat are they talking about in cutting? Are VA compensation benefits being targeted by the Trump administration?\nBecause if Trump cuts compensation or services to current veterans and then hands Israel $4billion and spends billions on Gaza, he is making a critical mistake\nI have sent two post but have yet to see one\nVeterans are the biggest fraternity of all.We may not agree with each other all the time,but one thing is for certain we all served faithfully to defend our country both foreign and domestic. We must not allow those who did not serve determine our benefits or are destiny. A t present our benefits are being talked about being cut by Congress. I suggest we march on Washington peacefully of course in full force to protect the benefits we so valiantly fought for and willing to die for while serving faithfully to protect our country.\nIs the President Trump will eliminate tax from military retirement pension?\nThank you very much for this message it Greatly needs to get out to all Vets as fast as Possible. Senator Patty Murray of my State of Washington has been trying to spread rumors, misinformation, misleading information and much, much more making herself out to be the hero also as much as possible. Senator Patty Murray is trying to panic Veterans to turn them all against President Trump and D.O.G.E.\nSenator Murray has not disclosed it was she and Senator Cantwell sent millions to the University of Washington/UW do sexual experimentation to sexually mutilate children and young adults transitioning them /sex change/gender affirming care to appear as the opposite sex. That it will cost taxpayers billions for decades that we do not have. Senator Murray spent the money on child experimentation not on our brave Veterans who deserver our blessing from God, gratitude, appreciation, Thanks and so much more. Senator Murray is trying to hide her misappropriation of money that should have gone to veterans. Please Expose them for what they are… My new name for Senator Murray Panicking Patty she is Panicking because the Veterans and others are going to find out how she has been spending our money she is trying to cover her tracks…. Keep Up The Great Work at the VA and find the best for our Veterans and their families…. Thank you All.. God Blessing… P.S. … Someone posted this on (I think it is an app not sure) NextDoor it is well worth posting it on there for Veterans Affairs …You have to have you invite you Like Pierce County Emergency Management is on there so is the Pierce Conservation District (most states call it the county Soil Conservation district)\nI call bullshit. Save your cornpone homespun bullshit for somebody else. Burger King HAHAHAHA. Let’s address the 2400 firings at the VA that have already occurred, and the projected 82.000 additional staff cuts that are coming. There is no way that that is going to affect the mission, according to you. How about you take Krasnov’s dick out of your mouth long enough to speak some truth here. I don’t believe a word that comes out of your mouth. You are a disgrace and an embarrassment, smiling in our faces and stabbing us in the back. The White House is populated with Russian assets and nazis, and you just go along with them tra la la, everything is hunky dory guys. Grow some balls and actually stand up and fight for your veterans, instead of just giving lip service to nazis.\nTotally agree, he’s full of all of it. Dog and pony show here.\nYou have no clue who Doug Collins is, do you! Pay attention and quit being a dumb shit democrat.\nWow. Such strong words for a Man that has been in office about two weeks. How have you gathered that much hate in that little time. You haven’t had time to judge his work or truth.\nTime to judge? We are watching this fiasco in real time!\nWatch hiring of past senior leaders in IT … they have failed miserably since 2011 and they are still in positions and there is a need to do a clean slate … I’m available to discuss\nLying pos veterans take notice.\nCutting VA and jobs in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Makes no sense when I am a Disabled Combat Veteran and I cannot even see a real VA Doctor, they send me to a Licensed Practical Nurse. Thank you PACT Act for taking care of our Veterans!!!???\nWen did Veterans VA become so democratic?\nThis website should be about and for the veterans, not the politics of Democrats and Republicans. Trust is important. Opinions is questionable. Mr. Collins, please present the facts rather than Congresspersons to BK Whoppers.\nYou just make yourself a complainer rather than defender of DVA to Congress. Listen to the complaint, concerns and issues here and give actual facts that no DVA office, DVA compensations, PACT act, making timely appointments, DVA clinics, and DVA Hospitals will be negatively affected. Firing Disabled veterans does not issue trust or belief.\nComplain to the law makers, not to the customers.\nThankfully clear message after Biden Administration failure to address veterans and leave DEI & woke to circus\nkeep up the good work\nCollins concluded by urging Veterans to seek information directly from VA\ni am still searching for a reason my local civilian approved pharmacy is continuously denied payment for an approved urgent care and approved 7 day rx supply… x3 years\nBeneficios para las viudas de los veteranos\n… o los viudos. (Hay veteranas, tambien.)\nDonald Trump or Russell Vought would tell you they’re rooting out the Deep State. A story they spun to sell their plot to the QAnon conspiracy theorists, to rob us blind and subject us to puritan rule.\nThis dismantling was promised in Project 2025, authored by Russel Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He’s in change of managing the executive branch.\nThe plan outlines the steps they will take to insure a kinglike rule for presidents.\nIt starts with them dismantling our social services and overcoming the supreme court while gaining more and more power. By the end of it they will be untouchable and the christian nationalists leading the plan will have their way with our country and our people.\nEven if some of his changes pay off and things are looking good, know that he is strengthening his office for devious means.\nGet you head out of you a– and smell the roses. Trump is rooting out waste, corruption, and unnecessary spending of tax payers dollars. It is about time someone goes after those programs that enrich politicians and their cronies at the expense of the public. Trillions of dollars in arrears is no way to run a country my friend because it leads to bankruptcy and depressions. Obviously, you have not lived through hard times when people had to struggle just to survive. Your complaints about “Christian nationalist” is based on Christian -Judea values, laws, and principles which you obviously find distasteful, because they actually define right and wrong, and that is obviously something you don’t want anyone telling you because you find boundaries of behavior and personal conduct as distasteful and archaic. Those principles have restrained evil people because they also create judgment and punishments for those who cannot or will not restrain themselves from doing evil. You are to be pitied for your ignorance of the necessity of enforcing law and order. Thank God for Trump. He is doing no difference than previous Presidents did after the end of WWII. The government bureaucrats were so entrenched in government offices that it became necessary to reduce these agencies, just like Trump and Musk are doing. It is high time that someone cleans house so we can reduce the size of government agencies and get rid of non-essential workers, programs, and unnecessary spending habits that no one monitors or even questions.\nFunny corrupted Trump, convicted of 34 counts of fraud (lying), rooting out corruption? He should be first to be weeded out.\nTrump called himself “the savior” while holding a Bible. The Ten Commandments states, “You shall have no other gods before me”, “You shall not take the Lord your God on vain”. These commandments reflect the actions of Satan attempts to replace God the Father. Trump is no God! He is more closer to Satan.\n‘ Trump is rooting out waste, corruption, and unnecessary spending of tax payers dollars.” lol yeah sure he is.\nThank you Mr. Doug Collin’s. Heavy on the Mister. YOU and President Trump have our backs. PLEASE keep up the good work and my hat is off to the rest of the VA folks that make this organization run as well as it does. Yes, there are some problems but it seems that you Mr Collins have, by far, are on top of them. In the past it just seemed that not many people really gave a rats —- about fixing anything. The higher ups could use some trimming as it seems this is where the system seems to bog down. You may want to look at nepotism in the system. God did bless the USA.???\nAs I stated earlier, you are just a Trump used car salesman spreading disinformation. I read today in the Stars & Stripes the article titled “VA pauses billions in cuts as lawmakers and veterans decry loss of critical care”, these VA cuts will affect cancer treatment, ability to assess toxic exposure, VA disability ratings, and much much more. You obviously had yourself a BIG GULP of orange kool-aid and bought into Trumps theory that if you say something enough, it becomes true. Before anyone labels me as democrat, I am retire military and have served democrat and republican presidents, but I know a liar when I see or hear one. I consider myself an independent voting for who I feel is the most truthful candidate, which is really difficult these days. You, Mr. Collins should resign your post immediately as I think that the majority of us veterans have a severe loss of trust in you.\nwill the V.A. go back to VETERANS CHOICE? I HAVE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH QUALITY CARE.\nI am a 78 year old veteran who needs everything that is available to me. I can’t work anymore nor can I walk very far as I came back from Nam with some sort of lung disease that has reduced my lungs to garbage. I have one third of my lungs so breathing is very difficult. I was really worried that all the cuts would be a disaster for my wife and I. After reading your response about what is really going to happen, I feel relied.\nYour typo is truer than you think. I think instead of “relied,” you meant “relieved.” But this guy is lying. I’m a vet and former VA employee with lots of contacts still in VA. All the cuts in VA are catastrophic and you and your wife absolutely need to worry. In fact, better be praying for two years to pass quickly so both of you can go and vote to take power away from the Musk-lovers and MAGA-maniacs who are taking away all your veterans benefits as quickly as they can. You are a citizen and you have the power to stop it. Get your friends and resist this robbery and constantly lying.\nFeb 20 was last month, a long time in the present situation where things seem to sometimes are changing on a daily basis, even for those in the middle of this horrendous mess. Appreciate your input.\nI am a wait and see kind of person, so let’s see how everything is this time next year. I will say this though, I am on VRE and if that program is cut, it will be tremendously devastating to me.\nLiar. You’re a corporate yes man and a Trump sycophant shelling out for your handouts from billionaires. It’s already harder to get appointments made. You don’t know what you’re doing. Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. And none of you care. I hope the Christian religion is right because we all know where you and the people you represent will end up.\nSir, I would very much like to know where you found/took that quoted $98K from.\nBULLSHIT!!!!\nWhen GWB was in charge the new administrator ended the contracts for the surgeons here in NH. End result was eliminating all patient beds and closing the ER. When asked what veterans were supposed to do after hours the administrator said “It’s not my job to provide insurance for veterans.” When Obama came in we got back Urgent care but not an ER. They did renovate the buildings and built a new mental health care facility plus a woman’s health care unit. Under Biden a new ER opened up in the new facility. I’ve used the ER facility several times and got treated quickly but don’t show up Monday morning and expect an in and out because it is always crowded. In comparison I was at a local civilian hospital ER with an apparent stroke and got there at 11 AM on a Wednesday and got into a bed and got treatments at 10:30 PM. My care is great at the Manchester NH VAMC but the same can not be said about many VAMC’s around the country.\nWell Doug, who do you contact outside of the state for an internal investigation?\nPresident Trump & ALL his staff are traitors!\nYou want Biden back? Crazy.\nDraft dodging, “President Donald Trump claimed to receive a 2016 award from military veterans that didn’t exist and falsely denigrated the record of the late Republican Sen. John McCain on veterans affairs”.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/john-mccain-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-veterans-veterans-affairs-f322b3774b773cc29a527bc6f9b204ad\nBiden supported the PACT Act to help disabled veterans. Trump tried to reduce IU disable veterans compensation to hurt the disabled veterans and cursed Senator McCain, a Republican, for being a POW and supporting VA. Between the three, I pick Senator McCain first and Trump last.\nAlso, I am not a Democrat, but Biden is not currently running the show, but Trump and Collins are running the show. Why does hateful Democrats blame the new policies on Biden when he cannot affected the Trump adverse anti-veteran policies.\nWould you prefer to hear propaganda? Because the “woke liberal news” will not provide you with propaganda.\nASK YOUR CONGRESS MEN AND WOMEN WHAT DOGE IS REALLY DOING, because they can’t answer. They will tell you that DOGE is cutting wasteful spending. How can that be? Congress allots monies to the Departments, not DOGE. DOGE HAS NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO CUT ANYTHING. DOGE IS AN ADVISORY section of the renamed U.S.D.S. nothing more. FACTS MATTER.\nSec. Collins, despite what you claim, services WILL be cut to Veterans when you cut 83,000 jobs at the VA. Those services ARE benefits as well. There WERE people who were sent home from the Veteran’s crisis line. Jobs WERE added to help with the PACT ACT, cutting jobs will not be beneficial for Veterans. DOGE doesn’t KNOW WTF it is doing, in ANY department that it has managed to gain access to. The absurd claims that Musk has proudly admitted to, are not based in FACT.\nWhen the economy crashes due to this administration’s ineptitude, and it will, don’t pass blame on to the poor, put the blame squarely where it belongs, on the heads of the millionaires and billionaires who were approved by the Senate, to head the Departments. This administration has sought to eliminate any oversight by illegally firing 18 OIG’s, which WERE independent agencies tasked with identifying and prosecuting fraud and waste.\nProject 2025 lays it out for everyone to learn about how the Heritage Foundation wishes to dismantle our democracy for private benefit. At 900+ pages, it might be too much for some of y’all to peruse, by hey, I’m not going to try to influence you when reality will present itself soon enough.\nDOGE is recklessly eliminating jobs from skilled Federal employees, many of which ARE Veterans.\nAny disabled Veteran can tell you FACTUAL stories about their treatment by the VA and the VHA, I for one do NOT want to risk my healthcare with a private entity with little to no oversight. I signed a CONTRACT with our government, I intend to hold the government accountable in upholding its part of the contract.\nLIES HAVE CONSEQUENCES!\nNEVER AGAIN\nNEVER AGAIN.\nEthics and integrity still matter.\nClaiming that harmful issues are due to “woke” and “DEI” are words that are used by ignorant individuals who wish to cast blame on people simply due to their gender or color of their skin. Racism, bigotry and misogyny are barriers to be overcome for a REASON. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, not who you are, or who you THINK you are. We have come so far as a nation, why would you want to go back to the past? We ARE better together.\nFor those of you who are bothered by “woke” or “DEI”, you have been fortunate not to have LIVED with the hatred that the anti-woke, anti-DEI folks have been emboldened to spew freely.\nAnother brain washed loony liberal. Read history, not MSNBC lies.\nDoug Collins says “Come to me” The old secretary had an email address that you could make contact with. I have not seen any way to contact the new Secretary directly. If the VA wants to save money, why don’t they stop the process of paying high ranking officials bonuses? What a disgrace, Veterans are being denied helpful medication (weight loss) while the VA is still paying out bonus money!!\nInstead of “cost effective prescribing” we should eliminate all bonuses paid to ANY VA employee.\nWe love our VA in Ashville & Satellite office in Franklin NC. My husband is 100% disabled due to agent Orange. He has the best specialists so we spend a lot of time in Ashville! They treat him the vets with utmost respect and kindness! We need MORE good doctors and nurses, staff so the wait isn’t so long in between appointments .\nDO NOT TRUST THIS MAN. He is a Trump-mouthpiece.\nwait for it! and hope you apologized…\nThere are lots of “Swamp creatures on this page!\nRupert Leray\nI appreciate hearing the truth from the leader of VA and not woke liberal news.\nBeing “woke” has nothing to do with firing 80,000 VA employees that are getting fired which will reduce our access to care and services.\nThose who use “woke” as their reasoning for everything bad, are just exposing their true hatred for others who don’t probably look like them! In actuality, they’ve been in a “deep” sleep their entire life and care not to be awakened by the true, sad realities of past and present sins. But they’re the same ones who will be in a church pew praising God on Sunday morning! O YE HYPOCRITES…\nAre you protecting our Educational Benefits that we earned? All the Chapters of Education for Veterans and their dependents are critical and necessary.\nSo, where did the 98 million get moved from and how will that move effect them. He did not say anything about that and who it will impact.\nCollins, You should be embarrassed in your behavior and actions against veterans. You support an administration notorious for disgraceful and disrespectful comments toward veterans and are forever going to be etched in history and the memory of veterans as a traitor to the veteran community. 83,000 jobs cut at the VA and most are veterans working to support veterans. Look out- Disability and Benefits will be next. STAND UP VETERANS>\nThank you for telling the real story behind efforts to cut the VA workforce.\nIs this article from military.com “fake news” (https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/19/va-crisis-line-employees-among-those-fired-amid-federal-workforce-purge.htmlc) or is Mr. Collins’ “Whopper” video a source of misinformation/disinformation? Also, why are comments to VA videos on YouTube turned off? Turning comments off is rather suspicious behavior.\nIf Mr Collins is lying than you can sue him. But if the rag military dot com is lying, its called free speech to the dipsticks that read their lies.\nSound like you could do with some TX for that head injury. Too bad it’s going away. See you under the bridge.\nsomeone needs to address the rogue disgraceful immoral unethical harassing va “police” they are the lowest scum at the va, look into them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe primary source of misinformation is the President of the United States and his team of preferred television and podcast personalities. I would not rely on any official statement from this administration.\nFirst, thank you for your service to our nation. The Vietnam vets got a raw deal both in country and in CONUS.\nSecond, the main stream media has been lying the the U.S. citizens since the Vietnam war. Walter Cronkite told a whopper when said we were loosing that war. We did not lose the Vietnam war in Vietnam. No Sir. The Vietnam war was lost in Ft. Living-room. With the use of a electronic box called a TV. And propaganda spewed out by people like Walter Cronkite, and Stars and Stripes.\nAnd things have not changed much in the years past. We are still being lied to by people working at CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, POLITICO, The NY Times, The Washington Post, and all of the rest that are being paid to spew propaganda of the deep state.\nJohn , Your comments are disgraceful. You are obviously a Democrat with TDS. You should be thankful this platform allows for free speech. Donald J. Trump is your President. This is not the forum to project your political views. No one cares. You must represent the 20% of the system riders. Best regards. Iraq Combat Veteran\nNext time commander bone spurs says the truth, it will be the first time. And boy howdy would I love for roundboy to slither back to whatever swamp he emerged from, but no, the idiot is everywhere and won’t shut the hell up. TDS, what an idiotic term. Lumpy is not sitting somewhere minding his own business, he’s a compromised russian agent ransacking this country. Ignoring him isn’t even possible, and paying attention isn’t derangement, it is survival. You feel entitled to dismiss anyone who disagrees with you as “obviously” a democrat. How you think that’s a valid argument, I’ll never know, but since you brought it up, in 8 presidential elections I have voted democratic exactly once, last November. And I’ll compare DD-214’s with you or anyone any day of the week, “combat veteran.” Kindly GFY, 2xCIB combat veteran.\nThank you Secretary Collins for your commitments to Veterans\nVA maine and NJ is a disgrace! Killing Vets in fact. No call backs, cant talk to your Dr, these new worthless hotlines that dont pick up or put you on hold 40min then kill the line! Rx issues, zero Directors that care NO patient advocates, NONE!!!! Rudeness, non helpful etc… the VA is worsening my health for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!\nsorry to read your complaint……. I am a 30 yr retired vet and never had an issue with the VA……I go to VA Asheville, NC and it is the best…… no issues to get an appointment neither do I have a problem with my Rx…. the Staff id always friendly and helpful,\nmaybe it depends who runs a VA\nHow are we supposed to believe Mr. Doug Collins?\nHe is part of and supportive of an administration that is famous for lying and deceit!\nDOGE and Elon Musk (a product of Apartheid) made cuts to several federal agencies involving thousands of employees without reason, or at least no stated reason, and VA was part of those cuts.\nDoug Collins, as far as I’m concerned, is totally lacking in credibility, as is everyone appointed by the Orange Pimp ?\nI know a veteran personally who has had his mental health services cut. When they cut probationary employees, they cut the 3 counselors who worked at the veterans’ center where he attended. So, talking about *just* the suicide hotlines is disingenuous, to put it kindly.\nthank you from a Vietnam\nI have sent two post but have yet to see one\nI work for VA and very happy all the WOKE-DEI crap is gone. Our focus should be on providing best care to our veteran and not worrying about utter nonsense. I would say 95% of the veteran I have seen were tired of all the WOKE-DEI-LGTB BLAH BLAH crap that was taking top priority across the VA. Our entire Govt is bloated and cuts need to be made in all departments, which in the end will be better for the govt and our country. Some good people will be caught in the lay-offs, but that happens in any business.\nnuts ——-\nSo glad you’re in charge. I was so tired of poor leadership at the top and all the woke garbage that we have had to deal with in the VA. Lets get back to taking care of our Vets and stop with all this Woke DEI crap that actually 95% of the vets hated too.\nAs a former Federal Employee at the VA, I can assure you all that there is TREMENDOUS bloat and waste at the VA. There are plenty of great employees, however, there are also plenty of employees who are only there to collect a paycheck and do the bare minimum to get by and would happily do nothing and collect a paycheck. As a Veteran, the advantage we have is in the hiring process, not keeping the job. If a Veteran isn’t performing and/or is being a SLUG while working for the VA (or anywhere for that matter) while they’re supposed to be supporting and serving other Veterans, fire them FIRST.\nI don’t believe in anything draft-dodger Trump says because he has sanctioned a self-serving maniac to cut all our hard fought for supports and checks and balances and that includes putting into place only people that support this slash and burn methods without remorse. I didn’t serve my country to have a self-declared king who has loyalties to dictators, murderers, and oligarchs in charge of my health benefits and social security. You and those in charge of OMB support the idea that if Veterans receive Veterans benefits, then we shouldn’t collect Social Security and have even written this down and spoken publicly about this. So, when you say you aren’t taking Veterans benefits away, you speak only with a forked tongue. Half-truths are still full-blown lies, and we are so sick and tired of this same old game, just different players. Your numbers do not add up in all your videos, showing me that if you can’t handle simple arithmetic, you obviously wont handle our benefits, care, and supports for Veterans. The whopper is you thinking that you can spin it to the real common-sense Veterans.\nThis really helps everyone.\nSpot on! So hard to place any trust in Collins as most of what he says is proven to be false. The Chainsaw approach to cutting the VA is affecting programs such as cancer care, toxic exposure assessments, VA disability ratings and more (Stars & Stripes article titled “VA pauses billions in cuts as lawmakers and veterans decry loss of critical care”). Collins must think that all veterans are stupid.\nWill, USAF Ret.\nI live in Mexico and I’m having a hard time talking to a vso officer. I can’t seem to find anyone to tell me what my status is on some of my claims that I put in for in October at the VA in Tucson Arizona\nYou can check the status of your claims online via\nhttps://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/\nYou may need to sign up if you haven’t already but it gives you full access to view all your benefits as well as ehealthyvet on the medical side. Hope this helps\nYou can setup an account online and check your status using website http://www.va.gov\nWhy all of the sudden is the VA closing claims as denied when there is a mountain of legal evidence in favor of the claim while the reason the VA denied the claim is because of data the VA entered on my behalf? I claimed sleep apnea as secondary to Rhinitis and sinusitis but was denied that claim because the VA stated there is no known nexus between my right knee condition and apnea? Who added that part about my knee? I never claimed that as the root of my sleep apnea, it appears that the VA claim investigators are adding information to a claim so that they can deny it. I will repeat my initial claim has nothing to do with my knee so the VA chose willingly to add that to my claim so that they could deny it.\nDoes not matter what Collins thinks. Trump and Musk have already put VA in their list of cuts.\nBenefits will be next under the auspice of re-evaluating veterans disabilities. Trump doesn’t like losers who get injured or captured.\nThere are barely enough staff to process veteran’s needs and the hospitals are already cut to the bone.\nIf you read what he says with an open mind, you can see he is using salesman’s speak. We aren’t cutting we are improving. He wants to change the words. We are redirecting, that means you had to cut something to move resources. We are safeguarding jobs, from who? From yourself? It goes on and on.\nSo let me get this straight. We will have better care and services with 70,000 less people working for the VA and VAH?\nTwo examples of less service under your leadership.\n1. 14 day turn around on a routine prescription refill that under the last VA director took 7 days.\n2. My VRC appointment for yesterday was cancelled. I wonder if that was because of DOGE cuts.\nWords are cheap and worthless, actions are what matters. Do better.\nSir, I have spoken to several veterans. They informed me that their medical appointments were cancelled and not to be rescheduled for 30-90 days.\nThis entire administration is lying to the country. Anyone who supports Trump, Elon, etc is a traitor to the country. Do not forget your oath to the CONSTITUTION! #vetsagainstmaga\nI tried taking the Secretary’s advice and called the VA to find out how firing thousands of VA health care workers would improve my healthcare. Maybe I’ll try again when they’re not so busy.\nPresident Trump is fixin the mess he inhereted. It’s gonna hurt some. However, there is gonna be some collateral damage.\nFortunately this time collateral damage does not necessarily mean deaths or injuries. I expect soon to see some correction and compensation for Veterans and other US Citizens innocently caught up in the America restoration.\nDo you fit into the “collateral damage” category? Are you feeling the stress and pain that many Veterans are experiencing? Have you had any critical medical appointment immediately CANCELED without notice? Are you scared because your medications are not going to be filled for another 30-90 days?\nThanks for setting the record straight.\nVeterans should be in Washington DC in force when the budget cuts concern cutting Veterans benefits. We served our country faithfully when we were called upon,and some like myself even enlisted during wartime.We need to send a clear message to Congress which is to keep their DOGE cuts away from the benefits we fought for .We need to March on Washington to show that we will not stand for any cuts to our benefits. FULL STOP ?. POST SCRIPT. They will decide our fate on March the 14th,2025.Be there if you don’t want your benefits that you were willing to die for cut while serving in the United States Armed Forces.\nDonald Trump is a 5 time draft dodger. He called Senator John McCain a sucker & a loser because his jet was shot down.\nI appreciate the clarification and efforts to make the VA more effective and efficient. What I don’t care for is the politicalization of the VA. I can understand the Secretary’s administration of President Trump but the VA is neither Republican or Democratic. It would be better to thank the veterans who have served rather than the president. Thank you.\nThank you for your work on making the VA more efficient. Please know that I have not been using the VA for a while because I have not been able to easily access VA care in the Georgetown TX area. I have been using my Medicare benefits. The biggest issue for me has been dental care. There is so much confusion on how to get dental care to which we are entitled as a 100% veteran. If you can fix access to care. Access to RX. Access to Dental and make it easy for us to understand how to go about getting the care we need I think the smartest of us will feel that there are no “whoppers” worth acknowledging! I really hope the President follows through. I hope that future veterans will know that jobs, housing and benefits are guaranteed. I love my country, and it was an honor to serve but the system is still not working as it should. No veteran should be jobless, homeless or toothless!\nWell, let me tell you a tale about service to veterans. This 100% Disabled who lives in Pensacola, Fl, has been receiving Pain Management care and procedures at Eglin AFB Hospital, 96th MG for over 10 years. It had be a wonderful case of continuity of care, having a decent quality of life. I was given less than a 30 day notice that they no longer will be treating anyone other than active duty due to a $5,000,000 over budget crisis. I’m now in a dire situation needing to look for this critical care. The PMS will be strong with this one! I’ll take another stand for my brothers, sisters & myself…..again, even to the point of being escorted out of the local VA, again for expressing my concerns over how many of us Vets are going to die from withdrawals or commit suicide from the sudden actions of careless others “in charge”. Trying to regain the previous care at another facility usually takes months going through the motions, getting approved for Community Care again and reestablishing the history and proper care. The VA usually can’t keep Pain Management personnel when they realize that their orders in treating a patient usually conflicts with their Hippocratic Oath. Yeah, treat the Vet how we want them treated not how they need to be treated. Guessing I need to go on another letter writing campaign like I did eight years ago to get fires lit under some asses and get CMO’s demoted and reassigned. I will not go away quietly.\nI think you and President Trump are doing an amazing job, and making great strides toward a better VA. DEI crap has for far too long protected useless, lazy, dangerous VA employees ! My grandfather was a WWI veteran, my father a WWII veteran, my sister a Vietnam vet, and I a vet of a not so quiet Cold War. All of us have utilized the VA hospital (s) as needed for our injuries. There is a union of nurses, aids, doctors, janitors, employees all belonging to unions. Whether it is a true declared union, or an underground it’s there – alive and well. It’s just as crooked and deadly as any “mafia” has ever been in this country. We all know you cannot disclose reasons for firing someone, because of “privacy” rules and laws largely enacted by democrats. We all know the ones fired are not going to be honest about things they have done which were unjust, unfair, illegal, immoral, or just plain wrong. They will proclaim innocence forever under the “privacy” protection. I have seen this “mafia” at work in the VA just as many other vets have. As far as I am concerned it would probably be simpler to fire the whole lot of them and start all over.\nI can’t believe your a Veteran!! If you are, your an IDIOT! 5 time draft-dodging Trump does not give a damn about Veterans or for that matter any American!! SEMPER FI from a Nam Vet 1965 1969 GOD help us!!\nI’m a vet and volunteer my time 2 to 3 days a week to drive vets to the hospital 81 miles from my town.\nIt has been said that they are going to take our fuil cards away. Our vehicles are donated. Is there any truth to this\nHow are you going to help Veterans when you are cutting 80,000 jobs, cancelling 200 contracts that include PTSD treatment, cancer treatment, surgical device sterilization? How can you help Veterans when you won’t even stand up for your own employees? What authority does OPM have to demand a weekly email of employee’s weekly accomplishments? Based on Vought’s own words during an interview, he said the goal is to traumatize federal employees so they will quit. There is a high probability that these emails will not be read, so the obvious conclusion is that the goal of these emails is to traumatize federal employees. Will you do nothing to protect your employees from the unelected bureaucrat who is not qualified to determine the PDs for all federal employees? You have long advocated for privatizing the VA, is this part of your plan? As a Chaplain, I would expect you to have more empathy for your fellow Veterans.\nI read today that SCOTUS has ruled that the VA is not required to use “Existing Conditions” for reevaluating Veterans Claims if those conditions worsen. Is this true? If an existing condition worsens over time, are we allowed to have our claims reevaluated?\nDoug Collins you are so full of crap and that is what anyone can expect kissing trumps ass. You should be ashamed to lie to us. Going to lay off 80,000 employees? That is sure going to help veterans to get care. I volunteered going on 5 years at a VA clinic. I knew everyone and I can tell you that I never met anyone lazy or wasn’t working hard to help veterans. Even if they had to stay late, they never not helped veterans to the highest level. How do I know, I was around the nurses, doctors and front desk full time staff. I have also had VA care myself at the Mpls hospital and the care was better and more helpful from my experiences there than at private clinics and facilities. You are a disgusting with your shitty lies that you care about veterans.\nDon’t know what to believe any longer. You sound like a used car salesman. How does the illegal department of Musk fire so many folks and you can stand there and say that it will have no effect on us veterans? Do you think that all of us veterans are stupid?!\nI see a lot of Vets are bitching about the VA and bitching about this new Secretary. He’s only been a month in office!\nYea, we listen to him and see what’s happening.\nAre they the president cuttin g piura benifitrs\nThank you this clears up a lot of questions I had. So thank you . Our VA is in good hands!\nDear Sir,\nMost of us put our life on the line to serve this country, I feel that it was in vain to the extent that it has fallen into the hands of the few favorites. I don’t know if this is a rebirth of America, but it seems more like afterbirth. The less fortunate, struggling, and hard-working Americans are losing jobs, health care, justice, and equality, and support for voting and trusting that their elected official and leaders in government would be there for the people. Most of us are not millionaires and billionaires and thats understandable, but what is not understandable is for the government and its elected officials to snatch away my footing causing me to fall or fail by haphazardly firing employed workers, shutting down agencies and programs, cutting services and systems, that create a trinkle down effect that guarantees poverty and hardship. while simultaneously making the rich richer and the poor poorer. It appears at times to be surreal. A 30-day notice is a difficult thing to deal with when you’re working two minimum wage jobs, or single parent or suffer with a disability or handicap.\nyou know why politicians and bureaucrats at the federal, state, and local levels are like assholes?\nThey open their mouths and shit spews forth.\nIs it true that VA is going to stop having virtual appointments via VA Video Connect? Virtual appointments have been wonderful because I have not had to drive 40 minutes one way to the VA Clinic for an appointment when no physical exam is required.\nQuestion for you. Veterans that are 100 percent disabled will they see their pay taken away\nI hope Elon Musk don’t end up controlling and running the VA. It appears that he wants to be above the President.\nI hope Elon Musk don’t end up controlling and running the VA. It appears that he wants to be above the President.\nHow about getting rid of the middle-man when ordering prescriptions? Please-Please-Please get rid of Express Scripts mail order drugs and let veterans get their prescriptions from their local mom&pop pharmacies if they wish to, like it used to be!! Or small neighborhood pharmacy is far better than any box box stores around here but Bide’s administration blocked the small neighborhood pharmacy out! We want our local small pharmacy back!!\nyou fired crisis line workers then REHIRED them, but they were FIRED. Biden hired 50k workers for the VA to cut into the turn around time of claims, now you want to UNDO it. IG said many depts in the va still understaffed, yet you want to make them more understaffed. you have not proposed a thing to help veterans, just make it hard and hard then say we need to privatize it. all that means is people will get rich while you cut programs and care to pay for their profits. IF privatize was so great why did the right kill the gvt option in ACA claiming the private sector could not compete. i have had private health care and va, would never choose private health care AGAIN.\nDoug,\nIf you’re not going to be honest, at least work on your tight five. The “aw shucks” routine is stale. VA privatization obviously isn’t about efficiency, it’s about getting your buddies more government contracts. Never count on an Air Force chaplain for an honest or realistic assessment. I would enjoy watching everything crash and burn around you if you weren’t hurting so many people in the process.\nGreat speech! We have 3 members of my household that utilize the Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center and the Bloomsburg Community Clinic. They do an outstanding job in all the many clinics we’ve used over the years. The Medical Center and Clinic staff, Medical as well as auxiliary personnel are professional and polite. Having worked in allied healthcare for over 50 years and the VA exceeds most community hospitals in care and attitude.\nWilkes-Barre VA deserves a Compassionet Caring Award.\nState, in detail, what areas are going to be cut. Stating a flat number before you’ve had any chance to conduct a thorough review makes it painfully clear this is sacrificing Beyeran support and productive Veteran jobs both in order to meet firing goals defined external to the VA by the administration. If you have enough information to state a number of employees to be fired, then provide the information you’d obviously need to already have if you arrived at that number responsibly.\nI’m sorry that you’re working with that cowardly President. He makes me want to hurl.\nYou guys don’t put Veterans first in anything but perhaps your paychecks. The VA medical system is a disgrace even for a third world country.\nJust heard the news (March 6th) 82,000 more employees are being fired at the VA. How many VETERANS are you firing?\nSeriously? This guy’s background is either as a preacher, or a used car salesman. He couldn’t pass a job interview in the real world. But in King Trump’s world ……\nHere at our VA Medical Center, we can’t get appointments, and when we do, the appointment is with a ‘nurse’ … I have not been seen by a VA medical doctor since 2019…… Short of staff….\nAs a registered Republican since 1969, I’m at a complete loss as to how any service member could support King Trump. If people would have listened to every pre-election Trump speech (instead of Fox News), they would know that the King promised revenge against any person and part of the US Government that – in his mind – did anything to him. Well, he is keeping his promises ….. He is destroying our Nation without even have to fire a shot….\nI am retired with disability (100%) from the US Army. I have over 50 inches of scars on my body and never-ending pain as a constant reminder of every time I raised my hand and took the oath to fight and defend …. Seems many of my fellow Veterans forgot their oaths only to be subservient to the King.\nThe King wants Panama, Greenland, Canada, the Gaza Strip… And the King wants to rape and pillage the ravaged country of Ukraine. The King will give the left over spoils of war to his friends in the Kremlin….. Your home is probably next on his list of take overs ……\nAnd some Veterans still defend King Trump ……\nSome of those veterans you’re laying off,you need to put answering phone calls here in Waco Texas. We can’t get anyone to answer phone calls. They have been saying that they’re working on fixing the phones for the last 7 years . Also let (fire) the advocates in Waco and temple go. They never answer their phone to listen to our problems.\nMaybe with this reduction and people back in the office the VA will be more efficient and take care of the veterans and widows. Took over a year to receive DIC benefits!!\nI can’t thank enough to the top dogs of Veterans Administration for taking care of our veterans like me for serving and protecting the country that I loved.\nIt’s quite sad to hear people are still complaining about our new administration. The whiners don’t realize that United Staes of American is bless compared to the rest of the world. Maybe it’s time for the government to offer them a one-way ticket to a third world country and maybe, this will educate them how good we got it here in America.\nOnce again, thank you Secretary Dough Collins.\nOk I’m rated at 100% and yet last 3 major claims submitted related to Agent Orange was mishandled and letter sent was so full of lies I”m sorry not impressed. Oh yes I’m former retired VA employee and with that said another issue.\nYes I want answers because San Diego, CA regional office is unwilling and that mess in Claims Intake center in Janesville, WI is not improvement since its their letters come back lacking forms they claim to have seen and that my Naval medical records are confusing, asking for medical evidence from a major my insurance company asking for same data twice is very stupid! My phone number in case someone would like to cal and tell me asking for Congressional and In Person meeting in DC is waste of my time because will fix the issues is again lies, delays and denial. In case if you really care I’m suffering from Agent Orange and they tell me time is short.\nThank you VA Secretary Doug Collins. I believe in you and our President Trump to steer this country in the right direction, but the VA has had many corrupt leaders. The BVA recently told me I was never hospitalized in Japan, but I was medivac’d to Yokota Airbase Hospital in Yokota Japan on June 8 1971 and hospitalized for four days, AFTER being hospitalized in South Vietnam for 22 days, then air lifted on a huge Medical Aircraft (C141?) to Great Lakes Naval Hospital after leaving Yokota JAPAN. The VA lied to me, purposely withholding ALL MY MTR and STR’s by the VA in order to avoid my claim for disability. I requested my medical records in January 1972 and finally got some of them in 2015, 43 years later. Dozens of SF 180s, F.O.I.A. REQUESTS, and hand written requests got me nothing. My oldest son died at 47 years old and I know it was Agent Orange related. I tried to get my medical records from the V.A. again in April 1983 when I filed claims, but the VA refused to hand them over and denied my claims. It’s still on going too and is documented by the US Army in May and June 1971 when the US Army issued me a P-3 Permanent Profile, and made me suffer since May 1971. They were deceitful and sent me two letters telling me they are withholding the remainder of my records due to certain F.O.I.A. EXEMPTIONS. My sons death was the result of something I passed on to him (Agent Orange) but the VA will not release the remainder of my records. That’s part of the bitterness towards the VA and the Suicide Rate being so high too. I’m still dealing with my claim 54 years later, and feel I’ve been waiting for death instead of resolution by the VA. Please fix the B.V.A. because my case is documented from May 1971 in VIETNAM, but basically ignored.\nDoug Collins is a liar. He is cutting VA benefits and I hope enough veterans wake up in time to stop him and this administration’s attack on veteran’s and his fleecing of America to enrich his fellow cronies.\nMr. Secretary,\nI watched your video and would like to share the Marine Corps Leadership Traits:\n– Justice – Judgment – Dependability – Initiative – Decisiveness – Tact – Integrity – Enthusiasm – Bearing – Unselfishness – Courage – Knowledge – Loyalty – Endurance\nYou neglected to address the approximate 70,000 to 85,000 VA employees that the Trump Administration is estimating to cut without any analysis of what processes could be optimized. This is the standard process businesses use to streamline operations. Having experience as a real estate developer does not qualify you to understand corporate operations.\nReflecting on the leadership traits I ask, where is the Integrity in reporting to those of us you are supposed to be representing? Do you believe you are displaying the Courage to stand up and adivise the President before he takes action. Do you have the Knowledge and understand all of the existing VA processes, have you outlined where operations can be streamlined or automated, and have you made practical recommendations outlining your vision to the President?\nWe are here to help you succeed if you ask and seek sound advice.\nRespectfully,\nSemper Fi\n2 Timothy 4:3-4\n3 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.\nEveryone relax. There is going to be some hiccups but Doug is an honorable man and veteran. President Trump has our best interests at heart. There are layers of bureaucracy at the VA that needs to be cut and they are doing it. This will make the VA much more efficient and customer friendly.\nSir, respectfully, you are coming at us like you are a used car salesman. We aren’t stupid. We see the DOGE cuts. We know that Trump despises the military because we swear an oath to the Constitution and will not to him. When I entered service my mind and body were intact and in good working order. Not any more. I’ve paid the price.\nI’m a former VA clinical psychologist and disabled Veteran who had to resign during 2021 due to the COVID vaccine nonsense. If losing my retirement wasn’t enough, it’s been impossible to access even an adequate level of care now that I’m also a VA patient. I’ve had 4 primary care providers in a short period of time. All of them female, and all of them absolutely incompetent/indifferent to my health concerns. They have no-showed my appointments and then documented a Veteran missed appointment to cover themselves. These providers have also consistently failed to properly document my concerns within CPRS. Is being assigned a stable, competent, PHYSICIAN too much to ask? PA’s have their place, but I would like to see a MALE physician. Despite the fact men make up the overwhelming majority of Veterans, we cannot even request to see a male provider. Meanwhile, female Veterans are ALWAYS accommodated when they request a female provider. Many locations even have a dedicated women’s clinic. CHAMPVA IS ALSO A COMPLETE JOKE! CHAMPVA has not reimbursed a single claim we’ve submitted in over 4 YEARS! I wish Trump would completely dismantle the VA and get rid of all the employees who are hiding being their permanent federal status. We all know they will never be removed from service any other way. Even in a clinic director’s position I was unable to remove providers who were committing fraud, intentionally harming Veterans, and point blank refusing to do their jobs. I was a whistle blower on three past occasions and of course, nothing was done. In fact, all that did happen were attacks on me for daring to rock the boat.\nI great to hear that they are doing their best to maintain the quality of veterans Healthcare. However, veterans benefits go beyond just Healthcare and I don’t see anything being said regarding other benefits.\nFor example, I was just denied for Chapter 31 VR&E. And myself and other veterans have been waiting months for a response to disability claims. The answers we have received is that the have been instructed to increase scrutiny on these other benefit claims and deny claims for cases that would have previously qualified.\nI would like to hear more being said regarding benefits otherthan Healthcare. Unfortunately, I fear that if tightening budget is the concern, there’s little that can be done.\nYou sound like a caricature of a dishonest salesman. If a late night comedian wanted to mock you they would simply recreate this video in its entirety. This sounds like a sales pitch because it IS a sales pitch; you are trying to sell a fantasy. People have legitimate questions about their healthcare and benefits and their jobs, and you are being very cavalier and dismissive. Your “reassurances” are dishonest at best, all the way up to outright lies.\nWe all know cuts are coming. We would appreciate it if you treated us with a little respect and addressed the realities head-on. It is disappointing to watch the Secretary of the VA act this way.\nWilliam you truly hit the nail on the head when you said “used car salesman”. I couldn’t agree more with your characterization of Doug and the bs he is throwing at us.\nInstead of posting these outdated videos, you should post his most recent video where he confirms that 80,000 jobs will be cut from the VA workforce, while continuing to promote the Trump agenda of “keeping critical mission” positions, whatever that means. Interesting that while around 30% of the federal government workforce are veterans, no preference has been given to them in any of the firings that have happened. Secretary Collins should be more concerned about that — the long-term price to serve and the recognition that should be given to this — instead of summing up his latest video with “cuts are going to happen, get used to it!”\nJust an excellent post. Trump has no respect for veterans and the sacrifices we have made. He is an incompetent fool and will cause the economy to tank.\nOh, and one more thing. In the same newsletter that this video was linked from, immediately below the link, there is an article from the VA noting that claims were processed more quickly than ever before in the VA last year despite being the most that has ever been processed in one year. It seems to me that is pretty efficient. Don’t fix what isn’t broke. So really, what are you actually fixing, where is the data, and how does your mass firing improve anything?\nhttps://news.va.gov/press-room/va-processes-one-million-disability-claims-faster-than-ever-before/\nAnd to all you veterans who are gettting great care commenting below, how do you think firing 80,000 people is going to maintain the care and service you are getting right now? I have been getting great care, but I do not believe it will continue if we cut staff.\nYesterday in a Youtube video you said you are going to reduce to 2019 levels (a 15% cut) to 398,000 down from 470,000. In this video today you said you protecting 300,000 jobs as mission critical! So what happened to that other 98,000 between yesterday and today??? At this rate the VA will have no people in a week which was what you always wanted according to previous rants by you!\nAlso I noticed that you spoke clearly and precisely when telling your (whopper) story but stammered and paused a bit when you said no cap on benefits and no diminishment of services. Some would say this is a tell. If you are going to try to sell something first you got to believe it!!!\nWell said. He knows he’s lying\nDo you think cute references to whoppers is useful? Cutting staff without a plan is stupid and wasteful. You need more people. You need more radiologists, you need more Otho folks, you need more primary care providers and PAs. I know this because I can’t get an appointment with my care provider even 3 months out. You seem to think the way to save money is to cut people doing work. You’re wrong. You need to cut wasteful placeholders and hire qualified people as fast as you can.\nYou represent a government that made us a solemn promise and I made and repeated an oath o the country. You owe us. Your sycophantic defense doesn’t get the job done; keep your promises and attend to your moral responsibility.\nI see a lot of Veterans here are talking out of their a*ses because they are hardcore Democrats, but don’t have a clue why!!! They repeat what they’ve been told all their lives, that the Democrats are the “Working Man’s Party”. That’s TOTAL BULL. Democrats surrendered their minds to the LGBTQ+Party and refuse to think for themselves. Democrats are the ruin of America with interest on the Deficit being $952 BILLION, almost a TRILLION in interest alone. We pay $2.6 BILLION every day at a minimum, and we will implode into total destruction if cuts are not made, but all Democrats and most Veterans can’t see that or understand that. Instead of food costing more, THERE WILL BE NONFOOD AT ALL!!! Can you not understand that? The LGBTQ COMMUNITY run and own the Democrats. If you are a Democrat you support this total takeover of the Democrats Party. This IS NOT the FDR or JFK PARTY. It’s the TRANS PARTY. This is the LGBTQ PARTY of today and the Democrats bow down to the Transgenders. You hateful Democrat Veterans surrendered your voice to the Trans + LGBTQ Policies and are reaping what you have supported. The most corrupt Administration in American History is being removed, and you should be happy and thrilled that Justice will be returned, unless you have vowed to fight Trump, like so many Liberal Veterans have done. I want a Patriot covering my back, not a Liberal Democrat!\nI wish you’d take all that hate and actually look up the facts unless you like being a liar. Trump has not cut any spending and has actually increased bloat spending on the rich cronies that run his agenda. Federal employee salaries only make up ~6% of spending while Trump cuts these jobs while shoveling money to the rich. His first time in office he pushed and passed permanent tax breaks for the rich and temporary tax breaks for everyone else to trick fools like you. Trumps policies have increased the debt, stop being a liar for them.\nWhat foxhole are you living in?\nYou seem to be a lone voice – are you lonely?\nVictor, you seem angry. Why are you so scared of who people love?\nYour dear leader does NOT care about you or any veterans.\nSo is it culture ware issues you’re worried about or the deficit? Nobody’s increased the deficit more than Trump did in his first term and firing government workers and cutting taxes for the rich isn’t going to help. I’m confused how you’ve made LGBTQ+ people the problem. Maybe you could provide evidence or context? Thanks.\n-Fellow Patriot\nYou’re right. The Democratic party left the military and the working class years ago.\nWow, are you a veteran? Your hateful rant against democrats helps absolutely nothing. I am retired Air Force and all of my career I was apolitical. I served democrat and republican presidents. Now I consider myself an independent because I (unlike you seem to) can think for myself and use good ole’ common sense. I don’t hate democrats nor republicans because this what our country is all about. If you want to do something positive then stop with the hateful divisive talk and have some common courtesy towards your fellow Americans. The division needs to stop!\nYou gonna have a Russian covering your back. You watched Red Dawn but now Trump made you forget?\nYou are on the wrong side of history. I didn’t get fed information all my life. I went to college and graduated with a Bachelor’s. Did you? You can’t have. Bc they teach you how to think.\nAll you are doing is being a passive aggressive.\nBeing scared of Trans?? Idiot.\nI bet you hate black people and Mexicans and women and gay people. You a Nazi lover, too? A Commie, Nazi lover?\nBecause you don’t know how to think. You have hate in your heart.\nHas anyone asked him about Project 2025? It clearly states their intent to cut VA disability benefits. Even Fix News host now SecDef said this. Google it. I don’t trust anything out of this incompetent administration who has a disdain for vets starting at the top. Google that as well or ask the generals who were in their first administration. Prepare to protest if the VA benefits are cut!\nDisparaging a particular group sounds hateful, coming from a person demeaning the Democratic party. Meanwhile you ignore the $4.5 trillion deficit added by trump’s $4 trillion tax cuts to the oligarchs. What will your interest be then? Not to mention that trump ADDED over one quarter of the national debt during trump 1.0. The problem with people like you is that you are devoid of facts and only repeat right-wing talking points. LGBTQ persons are not responsible for the thousands of veterans who have lost their jobs, or the price of eggs, or the multiple aircraft mishaps, or the price increase due to trump’s tarriffs.\nHow shameful it is that you hate such a small population who’s only request is to live and let live.\nPlease describe the ‘patriot’ that you want covering your back.\nFolks in infotainment silos would prefer to cast blame for all of their pain onto ‘the other’ because accepting their own part in their misery is too often difficult for them. Bless their hearts.\nThe millionaires and billionaires are pleased with discourse that their monies have paid for. In order to give them further tax cuts that they don’t need, Congress sees fit to cut services from the least likely to complain, the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the fed up. Remind CONGRESS that they work for US, WE THE PEOPLE.\nDemocrats and Republicans is your pain, you can vote, not vote and there will still be self interest and greed. There are people always trying to make positive changes and negative changes. The question is, who accepts either change.\nWhat you want and what someone else wants is always going to eat away at you.\nThink about it, DEI , LGTB, was needed because people like you set your own road block. If I am of a different race or sex , you will not hire me because this is a golden ticket to go back to the good old days when America was great paying women and people of color low wages or not being required to hire them. You don’t want to hear about struggles because it brings back your childhood memories of your family treating people bad.\nI served 20 years in the military and I can’t believe people wouldn’t have cared if I died on the battlefield protecting their lives.\nSo, stop blaming politics, it’s our own American society that is blind to true grit and service to our nation, and we are playing each other.\n911, oh, thank you military. Yeah these ungrateful civilians soon forgot and pushed us active duty and vets aside.\nI bet if China or Russia was parachuting in you neighborhood of dropping gerns in the air, you bet your ass the vets and people who felt disrespected by society will be the first ones to save your ass.\nWell said Robert\nStop lying to veterans. This whole administration is a disgrace and you’re screwing over our entire country.\nDoug,\nDon’t let the few off-the-wall, frankly disgusting comments bother you.\nYou’ve been there five weeks and are expected to instantly fix frustrations “left”\nby the previous occupants of your job.\nHand Salute,\nVietnam air combat vet @ 80% disability\nHow many veteran employees have been fired from the VA?\nHow many veterans have been fired from federal jobs in the last 6 weeks.\nNow please explain how this is looking out for veterans.\nThere may be some bumps, but DOGE is going to make things better – not worse. Keep up the good work.\nI believe everything Fox news tells me too because I can’t think for myself\nForgot to mention 20 % staff fired; certainly that will have a negative effect. Felon Trump, the draft dodger.\nWhy should we believe anything that comes from this administration?\nI have had the misfortune of trusting the v.a in Northport long Island. I was admitted and then released. I couldn’t walk.The D.e.i program at its best. People that do not qualify for the position that they hold. A complaint I filed was dismissed because of lack of response..I happened to be in the hospital. I reaffirmed my want to make the complaint known. Asked for a copy to be sent. No copy;no returned phone calls.what do you think I think of our(v.a)military veterans.\ndei means they HAVE TO BE QUALIFED for the job FIRST. 61% of the federal workforce is WHITE, white make up 59% of the population. ie you think only whites are qualified for ANY job? funny how we had plane crashes with just white pilots. why was that? so no one other tehn white men deserve a job? tha tis what anti dei means. notice how after it came out both the pilot and atc were white men, they said it was radio communications, dei vanished from the picture. MO ag is suing starbuck fornot having enoujgh white male employees. so now have white male quotas?\nSo very sorry you had this experience. I do know for a fact that DEI has nothing to do with your situation and it is a shame that your kind thinks like this. This seems to be a current ignorant theme of your kind- always blaming someone else for your demise. It is so sad that you cannot see the harm and danger that is about to be placed in your realm by this administration. This administration is/will rob you blind, but people of your kind cannot see that. You are so overwhelmed with hatred for people of color- and the fact that this administration struck a hateful cord within people like you. That is too bad. Unfortunately, people of your kind cannot see what is about to hit you – increase in prices all around- and it will not be because of a DEI. It will be because all you see is a white man saying DEI is bad- he knows how to get to people like you. All he has to do is keep repeating DEI…get rid of all the Black and Brown people- he knows he has your heart with this kind of talk. All the time he is robbing you and your kind blind. Well sir, keep on hating, hate until you lose what little dignity you possess.\nDefine DEI\nAs a veteran “frequent flyer” of the VA Health system, I can attest that there is no better source for obtaining timely, caring medical support than the current VA system !\nAs another veteran “frequent flyer” I can attest that VA healthcare quality varies dramatically by region. For example in Rochester NY, I had a torn labrum in my right shoulder. It took months to get physical therapy, they never did a single image, & I got one cortisone shot. This was in over a year. The Rochester VA refused to put Trumps picture up until at least a year after the 2016 election.\nI then moved to Nashville, went to the VA emergency room & got same day imaging & an appointment for an MRI which confirmed I needed surgery. The Nashville VA also recently replaced my right knee & did a great job.\nI wholeheartedly support the ongoing purge of the VA, believing that the more people you have, the better service is is insanity\nI’m grateful for the new administration. I’m a Vietnam veteran that is 100% P&T who is also from GA. Thank you for putting this video out so people can see you and become familiar with you. Over all, my VA health care has been a good experience.\nI see all the negative comments and wish my follow veterans would wait and see how you are going to run the VA before posting such negative statements.\nPoints of interest:\n1. It’s difficult to reach staff people you need to talk too by phone. There are some lazy people, mostly at mid level.\n2. Add staff to the ChampVA or find a way to stream the process. They are 6 -7 months behind on adjudicating applications.\nI have more we should talk about, but I will need a call from you.\nThank you, Tommy English\nNo one believes you, sir.\nMr. Sec. I watched your video like the idea of the whoppers. But being 100% disabled vet where anyone in VA management can rob from the veteran like myself I don’t have much faith still in the VA. I have treatment at the VA hospitals in Murfreesboro Tennessee and Nashville Tennessee. I have had to travel section take money from me by refusing to pay travel for procedures at the hospitals. I have called in the OIG in 2024 with nothing being done or heard from. I’ve had multiple complaints with patient rep at both hospitals and all of been done told is will will fix the problems it’s going on.. I have over several thousand dollars that I’ve had to pay out-of-pocket for travel that the travel section in the hospital has withheld from me if you could point me to someone to talk to over this I would greatly appreciate. Thank you and Semper Fi\nI served two years active duty in the USNR with 18 months in Vietnam. When I came home I did not realize at the time I had PTSD.\nI got a good education on the GI bill and worked in the social services sector, then 35 years in Data Processing. After I retired in 2007 i was diagnosed with Type II diabetes. I enlisted the help of the Colorado Veterans service. They helped me get the the process of getting my VA benefits. I found out that while in country in Vietnam I was heavily expose to Agent Orange. I was able to approve for disability. Later in\n2012 I was diagnosed with B-Cell Cll leukemia. With the help of my VA Doctors I ended up with full Disability. From 2007 until now I have seen great improvement with VA medical Care.\nI was not impressed with your Video. You sounded like the many incompetent managers and CEO’s I work under. Your connection with the MAGA fools causes me not to trust a word that come out of your mouth. Leave the VA alone. They are doing just fine. All you are going to do is make a big mess and someone with have to clean up after you leave. After all you job is just temporary ..\nThe jury is out on this until some time elapses and we see what fruit if any comes to bear, until then, the only fools I see are the folks rushing to judgement.\nLove your comments and agree\nI had to drive 2 hours to get help from my VA Cochlear specialist nurse because you froze her gas card.\nSad! I’m a 100% disabled veteran.\nThat’s not what President Musk says\nSure – Not in your Alternate Reality Universe!\nUnfortunately, things at the VA Medical Center level are not as great as you mention in your videos. We recently moved my parents, both Veterans, from Tennessee to Louisiana. Their level of care and services have definitely decreased (i.e., 44 hrs home care services down to 9 hrs). The “we care” worker ethic is also very different (TN was better and more obvious; biggest difference is the Social Worker – why you would be a social worker if you are not willing to help people especially Veterans). The exception is a person we met at the Overton Brooks VA Medical Center Mental Health Clinic who was obviously invested in working with and helping Veterans – he was fired last week as part of the probation employee reduction. A numbers game is not the right answer. The Social Worker should go and this gentleman should’ve been promoted.\nI watched the video and I hope you are speaking the truth. But Trump own administration is saying they’re looking at firing approx. 70,000 to 85,000 VA employees. If that’s true, how is this not going to affect the VA in their commitment to veterans? First, you are going to have 70,000 to 85,000 people loosing their job. I know some… many will be veterans. And for those who thanks Musk cares about us and wouldn’t do anything to cause problems… hardship, get you head out of your….. Musk is a mutli-billionaire from South Africa that shows he cares for nothing but himself. Like Trump. He’s cutting the Federal government with no responsibility and no care. He’s cutting everything except his billion dollar contracts he has with our government. Now that would save some money.\nEvery unnecessary employee who does little or nothing takes away from veteran’s care. If you’re not contributing, you need to go – vet or not! They can go find a real job.\nTrue. Vet ot no vet, but remember that there are slackers in every company in America.\nEven at schools some teachers put out the bare minimum. What the VA needs to do is have a true chain of command, written procedures for the jobs they do, and advancement like the military. We got to make employees earn each step in grade and promote more.\nThere is actually no fraud waste and abuse in the VA.what it is. Is there is no one challenging the contractor, salesman, and VA set prices for things.\nWe need to have VA auctions for material that is no longer needed, no matter the value. I see good stuff thrown out every day because it could injure or it’s no longer allowed to be in the hospital.\nTHE CONTRACTORS ARE THE PROBLEM. THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THEM A CONTRACT THAT IS ALWAYS OVER PRICED.\nTHEY ARE THE BLOOD SUCKERS, I KNOW BECAUSE I WORK FIOR THE VA.\nOH, CONTRACTORS ARE SWEATING BY HEARING OF THE CUTS! BUT THEN AGAIN, THEY ARE GEARING UP TO TAKE OVER THE VA FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS UNTIL ANOTHER PRESIDENT CHANGES IT.\nTHE CONTRACTOR LEACHES WILL ALWAYS WIN. LOOK AT ELON MUSK, ANY QUESTIOS? I THOUGHT SO!\nOf the fired people (33% veterans), what proof was presented when mass firing took place without any notice of why they were fired? Why are these ex-employees not permitted to contest their accusations of fraud? Were is the Due Process? Transparent DOGE is not in the least transparent.\nLove your comments, and agree wholeheartedly\nThis may have been leaked after this video was recorded, but the most recent “whopper” I read about (NYT, USA Today) is a leaked internal memo about a plan to lay off 80,000 (15%) VA employees. With what’s going on at other agencies (IRS, SSA, et al) with layoffs and budget cuts I don’t doubt the truth of this “whopper” either. A lie by any other name is still a lie.\nHis comments indicate he is a Trump Puppet and for that reason alone, I don’t trust or believe him.\nI’m with you\nTrump didn’t do a thing, and I sincerely hope that the vets who will get fired, and those who see their wait times increase, remember that it was a South African billionaire and a man with no respect, honor, personal courage, selfless service, or one day of service in his entire family’s existence that did it to them. We haven’t seen the iceberg yet. But hey, maybe the price of eggs will come down and those kids pretending to be cats in school will go away.\nYou are correct in describing Musk, but Trump did nothing to block this. Ultimately the buck has to stop somewhere and this buck stops at Trumps desk…remember that.\nI am an 80-year-old Disabled Vietnam Veteran. I watched this video because I am really concern about MUSK’s dirty fingers and his band of IT NON-military finger through my personal and private V.A. information. The Whopper #4 you told is YOU HAVE NO CONTROL!!!!!!!! MUSK and Trump are pulling the strings and as long as they are YOUR going to stand tall and say, “PLEASE MAY I HAVE ANOTHER” and the Veterans are going to suffer big time. MUSK is still making massive Illegal CUTs to the V.A. The V.A. needs more Doctors, nurses etc. to improve the healthcare of the Veterans who serve this Country. President MUSK and TRUMP Have never served in the military and has no idea what it means to sacrifice part of your life defending this Great Country only to see it Toren apart by a Wannebe Dictator………………..\nYou said you “didn’t fire any” crisis line workers. Is this true, or are these sources lying?\nSen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a service-disabled veteran, told reporters in a call Wednesday that her office has been in touch with fired VA employees who worked for the Veterans Crisis Line and helped process VA benefits claims for veterans.\n“After I raised these cases to the VA, and spoke out about them, it sounds like thankfully at least some of these employees will be rehired,” Duckworth said, adding that at least two former Veterans Crisis Line employees have told her office they are in the process of being rehired.\nSOURCE: https://federalnewsnetwork.com/veterans-affairs/2025/02/va-reinstates-some-fired-employees-but-36-senators-push-for-rehiring-all-1000-back/\nFirst strike against you is that you are a Trump appointee…..you talk the talk, let’s see you walk the walk.\nI don’t exactly know how to put this but here goes. ” I DON’T BELIEVE A WORD YOU SAY ” Your responses to these issues don’t seem to come from the heart.\nAgain, we need to see specifics\nNot anecdotes and aw shucks discourse.\nTell us WHAT positions your cutting in what departments\nWe aren’t stupid\nPlease stop treating us like we are\nHere is the joke of this matter. So far, management has not reeled in fiefdoms of medical staff that operate on their opinion/ego, not valid clinical studies. To address such issues, we are told to address such overbearing decisions is only allowed to be challenged by some written submission, no face-to-face conversation. Thus, it is once again some faceless entity that is difficult to hold accountable.\nI don’t believe you. You are the administration that you serve don’t care about veterans. It’s funny how people who’ve never picked up a weapon and put your life on the line for country can never emphasize with the people that have. Why don’t you have a town hall meeting and ACTIVELY listen to veterans and people that support use. I truly don’t believe you. Good luck to you and the draft dodger on making money off the veterans that you say you support.\nHmmm. Should I believe you or my own damn eyes?\nThis comment thread is full of whoppers…a lot of misinformation, media talking points, entitlement because “I’m a veteran,” etc.\nWe chose to serve, we’re not entitled to a life long job in government, period. Stop acting like petulant children. Educate yourselves. This isn’t even the first President to cut. Clinton and Obama made cuts. Our government is incredibly bloated, wasteful, and inefficient.\nYou’re in the minority here\nYour words ring hallow because I SEE a degrading of service at the local VA. Professional staff feel stressed and overburdened. Doctors and Nurses have been leaving for non-VA positions. Departments have been eliminated and the Drs. that have worked there/ This is NOT improving service – it is CUTTING important services.\nThe BK mention through me for a loop until I picked up on the “Whoppers.” That was funny. A nice touch with all the anxiety going around across the happenings with the Federal government.\nI would be nice to hear more details on how you have or will streamline the VA to better serve the Vets as well as what was cut to enable the funds to be diverted to our direct benefits.\nBelieve me, Doug, musk and t are screw those of us who served in any way they can. I am sure benefits will be cut to make tax cuts for musk and his rich cronies. Cutting 40,000 staff is just the beginning.\nYou have ZERO evidence of that, stop fear mongering. Musk has shown no desire to screw over veterans, and definitely not for “tax cuts” just stop. It’s embarrassing, it’s wrong, and it’s pathetic.\nMemo to cut jobs went out today. Sorry. Maybe talk to the 32,000 vets who will be laid off in the coming g weeks since the VA employs roughly 40% veterans. I’m sure they’d LOVE to hear your apologist musings. And dude, if you think cutting 80,000 jobs won’t impact services… I can promise to lower the price of groceries on day one.\nJust watch and see! I just heard on the news, the republicans do not have the money to fulfill Trump’s agenda, to include his tax cuts. As they put it, the numbers don’t add up. He’s going to have to still from somewhere. It’s not wrong… Just watch.\nPS, I put in an update for my benefits back in Nov. Web site says “In progress”. Today’s update, still in phase 1 , meaning it hasn’t been assigned to anyone it. Today’s date is 3/6/2025. Is there already a staffing shortage? What do you think is going to happen when they cut 70,000 from the VA? I’m still waiting!\nStop watching fox news you IMBECILE, (Steve P). I just got off the phone with Veterans I served with in Iraq and Afghanistan. They lost there jobs because of DOGE, a musk program, that saw they weren’t important enough to have a job they deserved. The only embarrassing crab I see is people like you who voted for Russian Commissar Trump. Check your facts before opening your mouth. The evidence is everywhere if your not watching one channel. Call a few people and ask around, you will see how bad it has truly become.\nFirst let me say that I served 26 years of my life for the liberty, freedom, and rights of common everyday Americans. Despite all the health issues, physical, mental, and emotional pain I suffer every day, I would do it all over again no questions asked. I want to be clear Doug, I did not serve, nor would I ever serve this country for people like you! You are not only unqualified to be in this position, but based on this video presentation you are a psychopathic liar. Furthermore, unsympathetic, heartless criminals like yourself, trump, musk, vance, and a host of other narcissistic sycophants should never be allowed to serve “we the people” of these United States of America.\nI hope you get to read this Doug, because you and the extreme conservative maga-cult, are solely responsible for the rumors, disinformation, misinformation, and deterioration of the Veterans Administration. Make no mistake, “we” see what’s going on here and we are will not sit back and wait for you guys to dishonor “us” without taking action. Hope you and the others can sleep at night!\nThe only whoppers I heard was all the bs you said. Calling the problems at the VA “whoppers” is pure bs. Veterans aren’t making up the delays, denials, and incompetence—we live them every day. The failures of this administration, including its blatant disregard for veterans and its double standards in care, are impossible to ignore. You expect trust, but you’ve done nothing to earn it. Instead of dismissing us, start fixing the damn system. Until this POS administration starts acting like they truly care about veterans, you can go pound sand at mar-a-Lardo, while the Cheeto -in- chief golfs.\nyou are negative, i don’t care how long you serve this great country.\nthis administration just getting started, give them a chance.I am sure if\nyou started on your first day of working for a company and they said\nyou are doing a lousy job and did give you the benefit of the doubt\nhow would you feel.we are all human we all deserve RESPECT…SIR..\nwith respect.\nExactly, thank you for speaking up. I can’t believe the lies that are coming out of this guys mouth!\nAmen – love what you said\nIt was pretty darned bad as it was for me and my family before the new administration. I can only imagine how “great” it’s going to be down the road. My child was removed from medical care at 21 because she wasn’t a full time student, left with zero options. Thanks so much for that. My wife or I have to wait, on average, 90 minutes once every couple weeks on a phone to get medications we need because of ridiculous procedures that are clearly intended to deter the use of the service. We’ve got a year or two worth of phone logs to prove it. Better? Sure hope so, but I wouldn’t hold my breath. I’d like to get on couple of these sites, like Genesis Patient Portal, with with me and YOU, in realtime, navigate me through these sites in the process of trying to find what you need. SMH. Purveyor of Whoppers… SMH.\nSecretary Collins, thank you for what you are doing to support all America’s Veterans. We finally have someone in the office that is honestly looking out for us. If I could ever be of service to you or the VA please let me know. US Army Desert Storm Veteran.\nI agree 1000%..we all deserve a chance..to prove you are worthy.\nYou need to lose those rose colored glasses\nWe don’t believe you.\nThis is unfortunate that we hear and feel comments like this. We are in an environment and atmosphere of less than truth and facts and over exaggerated story telling. this is all to fall in line or align with the current administration’s move to “Save Taxpayer Money and root out corruption”. How many arrests or court appearances have been made with this corruption story. Why is the DOJ silent. The we don’t believe you comment by Becky is well founded. Confusion and chaos, this is the mandate of the current Administration. Just a thought. Thank you.\nThank you for your comments.\nSo let me get this straight. We will have better care and services with 70,000 less people working for the VA and VAH?\nTwo examples of less service under your leadership.\n1. 14 day turn around on a routine prescription refill that under the last VA director took 7 days.\n2. My VRC appointment for yesterday was cancelled. I wonder if that was because of DOGE cuts.\nWords are cheap and worthless, actions are what matters. Do better.\nThank you for the update.\nSir, First your presentation on these rumors was an insult to we veterans. A cap at 300,000 is well below what is needed to provide first class service to those who have given more to this country than most anyone else. My PTSD therapist has received these emails. The Suicide prevention lines have lost 50% of the councilors. This exercise is to privatize the VA. That would throw us to the wolves of a health care system run by insurance companies. Suggestion read PROJECT 2025\nTrump and musk have never served and now they are talking away from veterans who have sacrificed so much and in most cases are still waiting on benefits. Anyone who kisses Trump and musk should resign. You are a disgrace\nYou’re a disgrace, so sick of the fear mongering. No one is taking anything from us.\nPeople like you are the disgrace.\nLots of seditionist traitors making comments back to other people. A false sense of security is a beautiful thing. So is OSINT.\nSee you soon Steve.\nThe Patriot Army of America\nSecretary Collins\nI am a combat veteran and have received excellent care the last several years from the VA.\nYou said VA health care is being protected and is a priority. To prove your point, you said you have called 300,000 jobs as protected, mission critical. Yet I believe there are roughly 486,000 people employed by the VA. Does that mean 186,000 were wasted dollars and will now be terminated? Frankly I don’t believe it.\nIn any Agency, how can a group of people unfamiliar with the mission and purpose of the Agency determine how many people show go in less than 60 days? That sir defies all logic and my experiences in process improvements.\nWe’ll see if what he says is ACTUALLY TRUE! I have my doubts that they WILL make cuts to VA health care and benefits. If they do, they’ll try to spin it into “balancing the budget” or something BS.\nHistory will remember those who didn’t care for their most vulnerable citizens at their time of need.\nThis is great news! Thank you for the personal video.\nThere is a one MILLION backlog of veteran claims. The VA plans to cut 83.000 VA civilian jobs.\nWords mean nothing. Follow the ACTIONS rather than announcements to learn the truth about what we “suckers and losers “ are in for.\nRepublic president Abraham Lincoln must be spinning in his grave.\nGO POUND SAND DOUGIE! We’ve the entire GOP bend a knee to this Administration. We watched them say that they weren’t going after SS or Medicaid. The bottom line is they’ve lied and not one damn one ya’s have called them out.\nThey haven’t gone after SS or Medicaid.\nYou’re wrong, they plan to cut medicaid by $800 Billion to pay for the 4.5 Trillion in tax cuts for the rich (Trump) and Must, etc. Only 20% of that goes to the rest of us.\nIt’s so maddening that this individual (or lackey) makes this claim, out and out pure lies coupled with abandonment of our veterans by a commander-in-chief that does not give a ____ about us. I envision several millions of dollars vanishing soon to boost ‘old what’s his name’s’ charge against the VA budget. God help us all…\nYeah….God help us all…from your fear mongering.\nAnother rumor he addressed was that Veterans’ benefits were being cut. You said: “They’re not,” explaining that the “VA had redirected nearly $98 million toward Veterans’ care and services rather than reducing them”. Let’s deal in reality. $98 million redirected from where? Where did you find or identify those funds? What is the evidence; how can we veterans (such as me) and the public see where you obtained those funds, how did those funds get shifted from whatever agency you pulled them from, and “redirected” to the VA. In short sir, there is no miss-information. Veterans are not stupid, rather they are well educated individuals who for the love of this country showed up for this country and did the right thing and some gave all; unlike the current CINC who by the way never showed up in uniform nor did any member of his adult male family members. Veterans deserve the truth. Fact: there are approx 16.2 million vets in the USA (give or take a few); decreasing the workforce of the VA by 80,000 is going to have an impact! (Trump’s VA secretary defends 80,000 layoffs in a wildly unpersuasive way–News Flash). Doesn’t take a brain surgeon to figure that out.\nIn the world of reality, if it is not documented, it did not happen…so unless you can PROVE to us ALL that what you claim: $98 million redirected to the VA did occur; it is as you said, just another whooper. As an AF (Chaplin) and lawyer, you should do better. BTW thank you for your service as a military person but get thee to confession.\nIn reading the comments there is a vast amount of very negative comments. Some are well founded other are not. One comment was so bad it was disgusting. I have 40% disability. Been with the VA for 15 years. I am now 78 years old. I agree that a vet who works for the VA should not be laid off but not in all cases. If you work for the VA it does not mean that you have a job for life. There is waste in every government agency. I have put several claims into the VA. Not all were process in a timely manner, and one did not have the out come I wanted but I understood the reasoning and stilll pissed off. Maybe I am lucky but the VA has come through for me not as fast as I would have liked, but the did come through. For the vets that are angrey keep fighting and good luck.\nI agree. There are many comments here that either are supposition, political crap, or just filling a need to whine. The VA has not always done what I have wanted but I can say they have always treated me well and respectfully.\nthis is the only country i know that gives the best benefits in the world.\nsure i agree the va is not perfect and sometimes not there when you\nneed something but they are available when needed.it took me 10 yrs\nto get my benefits better late than never.\nYou forgot to mention that the VA cuts are to pay for the Tax Cuts for the ultra rich (Trump, etc.) and corporations. You like that?\nIf I were Burger King I would sue you for lying about them and their woopers. You lied by trying to be clever. Don’t ever try to compare veterans with a burger. This is not the same scenarios Donald Trump is lying, and you know it ! You didn’t say ANYTHING in this video that gave me comfort. Now what about the new rounds of layoffs of VA workers?\nShame on you as a chaplain in the Air Force reserves. You’re supposed to put your women and men first not Donald Trump the draft dodger. This is why real Christians can’t trust fake Christians like you. Whopper gate lies.\nIf you’re a Chaplain in Air Force Reserves you might want to pause and rethink your post, especially targeting the Commander-In-Chief.\nLearn to read, Steve—Collins is the Air Force chaplain and he should be ashamed of his lies.\nReal men of God, men of the cloth, and honorable service members don’t sell their brothers and sisters out for Russian oligarchs.\nGo away troll.\nWhy have I been waiting almost two years to receive my back pay from the VA, can you explain that.\nThat’s been like that for years, it has nothing to do with anything going on now. It took me 2 years after my post Afghanistan filling in 2010 to get pay for disability.\nto Doug Collins – I have a ver\n++++\ny time believing that has to do with Trump. He constantly changes his positions and decisions . He always makes general statements without real and verifiable facts. Everything to him has to be political !!! DOes he really care about US Citizens? The onlly person he care about is himself !!!! He calls Veterans suckers and losers.\nI am a Totally Disabled Viet Nam Combat Veteran I was stationed at Da Nang Viet Nam. I have a 100% service-connectrd rating. Without thuffalo VA Medical Center I probably would not be here today. I recently had Heart Surgery and broken Femur Surgery. I have direct Agent orange exposure, Diabetes, Severe Osteoarthritis, Constant pain, Severe Mental Stress and anxiety loes of all my teeth and much more…..\nI have two degrees. I really love my country and take my oath to my country very seriously !!!!!! Will Project 2025 Screw up VA Affairs????\nore…..\nFirst, he didn’t call veterans suckers and losers, that’s straight rubbish. As someone that met President Trump in his 1st term I can 100% say he does care about veterans and out service members.\nProject 2025 has NOTHING to do with President Trump.\nWait, what, Trump didnt call service memebr s suckers… that coolaid is rich, you are in a CULT!\nSteve you are full of S-it. Trump did day that! You are drinking the cool aid. Are you even a Vet?\nSteve,\nTrump literally did, it is provable, and if you listened to anything other than Fox News and Trump’s easily fact-checked lies: you’d know he did.\nHe even got-mic’d and insulted a Gold Star widow.\nYou didn’t even wait to mix the koolaid with water, you snorted it as powder.\nI feel for you. You have it BAD. Take those blinders off. After witnessing the event where he said it, is the day that turned me away from supporting him. Can’t be trusted. FACT!!!\nYou don’t know what you’re talking about. President Trump never ever called veterans “Losers and Suckers”, that was a J. Biden Lie. Show us one time he said what you claim! YOU CANT DO IT because it never happened! You were brainwashed by Democrats, just like I was, all my life, until I saw the crimes of Obama, and woke up. I asked myself “exactly why am I a Democrat”. I was honest and found out I never was a Democrat, but was just persuaded that I was. I am conservative, love this Country, love Our Laws, Love our Freedoms & our Flag, love the Justice System when it works, love the opportunities we are given, and believe in two genders and Jesus(our LORD)! I do not believe in the LGBTQ or its special rights and privileges over straight heterosexuals, BUT DO YOU? ALL Democrats do, so I woke up because I do not! The V.A. has many corrupt employees, mainly at the top, but TRUMP is working to remove them. Give him and the Republicans a chance because it’s been less than 6 weeks in office. Wake up man. Get your head out of your a*s. Him and Musk don’t need or want your money. That’s all Democrats lies like Kotex/Tampon Tim Walz & Harris spread. Democrats do not think for themselves. You are a good example, so ask yourself why you’re a Liberal Democrat that despises America! Why???\nDraft dodging, “President Donald Trump claimed to receive a 2016 award from military veterans that didn’t exist and falsely denigrated the record of the late Republican Sen. John McCain on veterans affairs”.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/john-mccain-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-veterans-veterans-affairs-f322b3774b773cc29a527bc6f9b204ad\n34 counts of Fraud by a jury shows how much I can place Trump as truthful. His big Lie he won the 2020 election is a lie, Fact checkers counted over 3300 public lies by Trump.\nBiden supported the PACT Act to help disabled veterans. Trump tried to reduce IU disable veterans compensation to hurt the disabled veterans and cursed Senator McCain, a Republican, for being a POW and supporting VA. Between the three, I pick Senator McCain first and Trump last.\nBiden and twice impeached Trump swore an oath to follow the laws of the Constriction.\nAlso, I am not a Democrat, but Biden is not currently running the show, but Trump and Collins are running the show. Why does hateful Democrats blame the new policies on Biden when he cannot affected the Trump adverse anti-veteran policies.\nYou real think that because you kiss trumps ass we’ed beleive you?\nThank you!\nSGT. Olga ROEMER , US Army. Veteran\nGWOTEM &. GULFWAR\nMr. Secretary Collins, please allow V.A. Judges in Washington D.C. to process pending disability claims more expediently. I am a disabled Veteran who was deployed overseas during the Vietnam War, and I am 60% disabled. I have V.A remanded claims which need to be finalized, for I have already taken all my C&P Exams.\nWhy is the VA being forced to cut 70,000 employees. Services are already getting cut at the Boise VA, and it’s going to get worse. Supposedly, employee levels are getting cut to 2019 levels. Dozens of VA facilities have been added since then, making it easier to get to a facility. Are they going to be closed? You can’t offer the same service by eliminating people. What a fiasco. And the Trump appointees are trying to make a beauty queen out of a sows ass.\nWell, if you intend to improve veteran patient primary care, start with Clearlake VA Clinic, Clearlake CA. It is a cesspool of incompetence. One administrator and one doctor and a security guard routinely conspire to bait veteran patients into a violent episode from which these cesspool members “get rid” of one more veteran patient to go elsewhere for medical primary care. Otherwise Mr. Director, you are more of the same dismal performance of these VA employees at Clearlake CA.\nThat’s not how the VA works. They can’t deny eligible Veterans. They literally have to treat a Vet who held a nurse hostage in the ER and was shot by VA police.\nDuring your confirmation hearing- you promised that you would notify Congress of any cuts. You lied then. You’re lying now. You’re just another politician lying to veterans. How can you say 80,000 people being cut won’t have an affect on veterans….. In my opinion, you’ll go down as the worst VA secretary and someone who backstabbed their own.\nI get information strait from the VA employees and beneficiaries. This is just like the state of the union, lots of broad generalizations while leaving out some very important details. They think they are hiding their cards, but what they are really doing is throwing the whole damn deck in the air while declaring their hands are empty. This POG is just a puppet and a bootlicker.\nI am a retired Army Officer and I am a 100% Disabled Veteran. The vulgarity and ignorance I read in the comments on this page disgust me.\nThe vulgarity and ignorance from our administration disgusts me more. As an “officer” I’d hope you share the same integrity.\nI agree with you 100%.\nI agree with you completely.\nWell, if you voted for trump, I’d suggest that you do not read the comments. Many of the Veterans/commenters might say that you are vulgar, ignorant, and disgusting for your comments.\nI some how don’t believe anything he said. it’s not up to him, but President Elon to decide how he gets his tax cuts and the VA is the biggest prize on the board. Keep the promise and stop the bs. We expect you to resign if they chainsaw their way through the VA.\nBOOT LICKER LIKE ALL THE REST\nThank you.\nWhy are veterans affairs jobs being cut? It’s a Damm shame we need the VA workers and the job they do to get the health care we deserve. NEVER A trumper VET HERE.\nTalk is cheap,I been fighting the VA since 2018.all they know how to do is denied my claims over and over again.i got plural plaque on both lungs,denied ,severe hearing loss rated at 0% bilateral.pact act is a joke.ptsd va canceled my physiatrist treatments..shall I continue? I was in the sand for over one year and this is the way they treat me.why did I have to pay back 32000.00 dollars before I can start to get benes.i got out with severance pay.if I remember it was not a loan .correct me if I am wrong.thats why mu nephew took his own life because his medical records were lost.still\nLIAR\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut approximately 72,000 jobs, roughly 15 percent of its current workforce, VA Secretary Doug Collins confirmed Wednesday…The memo, sent by VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek, said the agency-wide reorganization would take place this August and instructed top-level officials to …cut enough employees to return to 2019 levels of staffing. Doing so would require cutting tens of thousands of jobs at the VA that were created under the Biden administration, including through the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded coverage to veterans affected by burn pits.\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5178063-trump-administration-va-veterans-affairs-job-cuts-doge-collins/\nIf walks like propaganda and it talks like propaganda, it’s probably propaganda!\n[Even though you deliver information with the energy of a trusty Golden Retriever, I don’t believe you are being truthful, Sec Collins. You are appeasing Veterans and the US Citizens who support us until the curtain has fallen and there is little we can do about it. The memo was leaked regarding what’s behind the curtain, reference Wizard of Oz]\nSec Collins,\nPlease explain how returning to 2019 staffing levels will improve my VA care? As you know, President Biden’s PACT act expanded the number of veterans eligible for care:\n“Thanks to the largest outreach campaign in VA history, Veterans and survivors are applying for their earned benefits at record rates. Over the past two fiscal years, VA has received 4,414,334 claims for disability compensation benefits (including 1,774,158 claims with PACT Act conditions) — 29.8% more than the two fiscal years prior. There was an all-time record number of applications in 2023, and Veterans and survivors are on pace to break that record in 2024.”\nI hope that instead of setting a number of staff to reduce, a concerted effort would be made to see how many people are needed to complete the VA mission effectively. I see comments in this forum that could lead to savings while delivering a better veteran experience.\n(Does anyone working at the VA ever read these comments or is typing this an exercise in futility? Reply to this comment.)\nAn actual evaluation may lead to reductions in some areas of service, increases in others or service delivery changes that deliver a better outcome. In some areas of the country, certain services are underutilized, and in other areas programs need more staff.\nRight sizing to meet the mission means you actually care about providing essential services. The memo sets a number goal with expectations to cut to that number regardless of mission requirements. This chainsaw approach is going to have a real impact on veteran health and well-being.\nWhile active duty, I worked on a skill-diverse team using population models to plan staffing for MTFs around the world. The team worked with stakeholders in each clinical area to create the models. We did this resource analysis with an eye toward medical readiness as well as the requirement to serve the military population. We recommended closing services in areas that had robust services on the economy while staffing up areas that needed increased on-base services. We thought about how many military members in each career field were needed for medical readiness and then recommended filling other needed healthcare positions with civilian staff. I know this level of scrutiny can be accomplished but it takes integrity, research, inclusion, discussion, TIME, and analysis.\nI am concerned that staffing and program reductions will increase stress experienced by veterans requiring access to benefits. The VA is making progress in reducing the incidence of veteran suicide. https://news.va.gov/137221/va-2024-suicide-prevention-annual-report/ The decreasing rate of veteran suicide needs to continue. The Biden administration policy change as of Jan 17, 2023, must continue to offer a life-line to ALL veterans:\n“Starting Jan. 17, Veterans in acute suicidal crisis will be able to go to any VA or non-VA health care facility for emergency health care at no cost – including inpatient or crisis residential care for up to 30 days and outpatient care for up to 90 days. Veterans do not need to be enrolled in the VA system to use this benefit. This expansion of care will help prevent Veteran suicide by guaranteeing no cost, world-class care to Veterans in times of crisis. It will also increase access to acute suicide care for up to 9 million Veterans who are not currently enrolled in VA.”\nI am NOT in support of a quick decision to cut a set number of employees (83,000+). This is not the way.\nhttps://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/va-plans-lay-many-83000-employees-year/403477/\nNo VA staff should be being laid off. It already takes too long to get an appointment as it is. I don’t wanna hear stupid jokes about Burger King or political support of a person who is making it so the people who offer us support are being fired. Please keep VA employees and their positions safe.\nEvery single word complaining is either from a democrat or a liberal….wonder why that is\nBingo. Whole lot of talking points and misinformation, it’s really pretty sad…\nAnd how would you know that?\nFAKE NEWS!\nyou’re a trump stooge. We don’t believe a word you say.\nWell that’s interesting Mr.Collins.\nMy journey with the VA here in Florida has been nothing but them toying with Veterans lives, like mine. So they approved my cancer (Tera) in October 2024 but a 0% compensation because they did not include that I still receive chemo shots on my record. That an examiner told me about. So the VSO filed it again with all of my secondaries from the cancer . So after the VA calling for about 20 plus reexamine C&P and IMOs without me at any of them per them. Now today the VA just put in a new claim theirselves to sever my service connected disability they approved the 1st time. The VA representatives today told me congress is pushing them to hurry up and get these claims taking care of. I guess this is how you all are telling them to do it by taking it away. No whopper her sir, just the facts and the truth. I am sharing what the VA is doing with eve I meet and with any news agency.that wants to know the truth that you all call liars. Have a great day and thank you for your service to GOD sir!\nWe are not cutting but putting in caps! That sounds like cutting to me. The systems are already overloaded, and now Trump and his dogs are saying they are going to lay off 80,000 staffers at the VA? How is that going to make VA benefits and services better? Americans support downsizing if it makes sense and does not affect services, but what is happening to our government now is not responsible leadership. It is crippling organizations. It is just a matter of time before the VA is also crippled and Mr. Collins loses his job because he is no longer needed. I truly hope what you say is true, but I must see it to believe it.\nThis is not true, I have been with the VA since 1993, it did get better but the past 6 months has been bad.\nTo me, VA care is a wonderful Blessing.\nThanks to everyone at the VA.\nNo Responders were laid off, however, staff that support responders were laid off and this was overturned. Those impacted were Veterans who coordinate emergency efforts to assist other Veterans facing crisis situations within VCL. Crisis Responders require support staff to operate effectively and ensure Veteran safety. All off the support services should also be included as mission essential.\nBut you’re cancelling contracts and declining to state what they are. How about that for transparency you stooge. Stop aiding in the theft against Americans and short changing the veterans who believed in the country you and this felon’s administration are trying to destroy.\nMr. Collins, why are you part of this mess with this administration? Look at waste slowly to make minimal mistakes. It takes time to identify waste, so take your time and make a more efficient VA. This administration so far is making up waste and then tries to fix it when they get caught. Stand up for Veteran.\nI’m disappointed in the response by many of the VA beneficiaries to this post. The efforts to improve efficiencies and save costs while preserving and improving VA services will only benefit us. It’s sad we’ve become so political that there’s little to no objectivity so we can find common ground on what used to be called common sense.\nWhy are you telling such obvious lies? You simply cannot maintain the same level of service when you’re firing tens of thousands of people, removing many aspects of tele-health, and when you have leases on buildings cut and sold so Trump can make more money. If I want the truth I’ll go to people who work in the VA and have leaked memos that were meant to be private, not the guy hand-picked by the Heritage Foundation and Trump to destroy the entire VA system because of how much it saves veterans money. They very definitively want the system destroyed so they can force us all into private healthcare that we’d have to pay way more for with even longer waiting times than the VA has.\nI noted that the cuts will bring the VA back to 2019 levels of employees. So ask yourself, “Was the VA able to do the job in 2019?” I think they were. So were those 80,000 jobs added during Biden’s regime just a way to make him look good by creating unneeded jobs? I think so. This country has over 35 trillion dollars of debt. We cannot continue down this path without seeing hyper inflation.\nI don’t believe a word you are saying. It’s literally administration dogma to do the opposite of what you tell everyone you are doing or not doing.\nIs laying off 83000 individuals going to get me an appointment with my doctor in days and not months?\nIs it going to lower my prescription bill, help me get a hearing aid, or get me dental care?\nThere already is a shortage of workers at the VA. Right now, there is a 6 to 8 month wait for appointments, and you want to cut 80,000 plus positions. Veterans will have to suffer yet again. Practice what you preach. Slam the Scam\nI have never waited 6-8 months for an appointment; for non-emergency care, it’s usually 3 or 4 weeks. Just last week, I needed a radiology referral from the VA. I called my PCM’s office without talking to her directly, and the referral was processed in a day. The following day, the VA notified me it had been sent to the radiologist.\nNice speech let’s see if there is any substance behind it.\nLies, lies, and lies. By firing veterans only hurts me and my fellow veterans! How can we trust you and this corrupt administration.\nFrankly, what you’re trying to gaslight us with is absolutely disgusting. The VA was already improving because they finally hired more staff and service was getting so much better. Now you’re making excuses to fire people so a few can get tax cuts on their already record profits? With all due respect sir, you do not represent the ideals that I would like to see at the head of the VA. You should be fighting tooth and nail for us, not selling us short. Shame on you.\ndon’t know what’s going on hope iam not involved.\nFascism with a drawl is still fascism.\nI implore your actions and Presidents Trumps. my issue is that you’re coming from the top down. I can tell you at ground level it gets scary some times.\nZero credibility…with you or this self serving administration. The only reason cuts and chaos are being sewn across the Federal Government is because of the opportunities that will be made available to the faithful and obscenely well off. Privatization is in the works. You think service and services are bad now? Wait until everything is turned over to the oligarchy, only as private entities that are designed to make a profit, not do good. As a retiree, I am ashamed that so many Veterans believed in what MAGA purported to represent. It was and never will be about serving anyone but the inner circle. The sacrifices so many of us made in service to country are meaningless under this hypocritical administration. Secretary Collins is only a voice-piece for chaos under the guise of support and service. Shame on you.\nYou get what you vote for!\nI like what they’re doing, cutting waste and removing people who are not needed. I’m not ashamed of our veterans, who believe in a smaller government and less tax. I would like to know your back story as to why you think the government is here to take care of you. It’s your job to take care of yourself and your family. I don’t want big brother looking after me. I’m a grown man who provides for himself and his family. Who give a damn if it goes private, it’s called America and not Russia for a reason.\nI’m more concerned with the government saying I shall take this pill or shot. If I don’t, there will be consequences for not following others. Keep the federal government out of my life as much as possible. Furthermore, they should be kept out of state responsibilities.\ndo you prefer KAMALA..to get the job done..if its a yes she will do away with the va and\nyour benefits..lets be thankful for what we get and quit with your crying and sobbing..\nbut fight for whats yours..you desrve it..\nThis is disgusting and shameful! You are belittling us and our concerns with this gross rhetoric. Whoppers… our questions and concerns are whoppers?\nTalk is cheap and your is worthless. Actions are showing us yours and the administrations true motives. Are you a Russian asset too?\nWTF, did you even serve?\nMark Patton, did you serve? You are saying Veterans shouldn’t expect the government to take care of them. When you you put your life on the line for our country and freedom there should be an expectation the government will support us if they broke us.\nSorry Doug. I thought you were sincere in your previous video, but you disproved that in this video. You’re about to layoff 80,000 employees and when you start mentioning Trump, you lost me. As a pastor, I’d think you would stand up to an administration that is affecting veterans negatively through arbitrary slashing of the Federal workforce and a plan in Project 2025 that takes away a significant amount of care to veterans.\nSo perhaps it it true that VA disability compensation will not be reduced. PERHAPS. But if Congress makes that compensation taxable to provide tax breaks to the billionaires, the net may be a reduction in take home. We just have to trust the politicians…\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI believe the message would be more effectively received if the tone and attitude were adjusted to be more respectful and professional. The casual joking and banter may come across as unprofessional and may not be appropriate in this context. As Veterans, we expect to be treated with the respect and seriousness that we deserve. I would appreciate a more direct, honest, and professional approach moving forward, with a focus on delivering on the commitments made.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nI had no issues with the delivery at all. Perhaps you’re over analyzing it. Or just being super sensitive…\nWhat is taking so long for contaminated water claims. I have read what some have said on the comment section. When I go to the VA clinic, I see a lot of slow motion and a tone coming from the people work there, that makes me feel like there doing me a favor! Not all but a lot of this is going on. Have been sent around in circles trying to get my teeth done. If they send you to community care get a Eval, then require a over view of what needs to be done. The dentist submits it to VA for approve, then it takes months to get anything back for approval. Then its one tooth at a time. Been working on getting my teeth fix for almost three years.\nWhen I go to the VA and see my PCM, it’s quick and easy to set up. I do it all online. I can refill my prescriptions online or call, and pickup is available 24/7/365. My claim that put me at 100% took a month, and the back pay was handled over the following two monthly payments. I think the VA is doing an outstanding job taking care of us. When I visit the VA, so many people are running around that even my wife says there are too many people not doing any work. From what I see, I think cutting some support staff would be appropriate. I haven’t been to any other VA facility, so I can not compare the care, but I’m satisfied with the service I’m receiving.\nQuestion: Were your teeth affected by your service? Or are you using the VA for personal support? Why not obtain dental insurance to cover your dental needs? Granted, it doesn’t cover all procedures 100%, but it works for essential services. I had my teeth cleaned four times yearly, two with insurance and two out of pocket. The out-of-pocket cost me $50 each time. Just a thought.\nI’m just wondering where all the alleged fraud, waste, and abuse is, because it hasn’t been there in the past. It sounds more like it’s programs you want to halt that are being described as fraud, waste, and abuse. We had IGs that watched for that. The reckless way cuts are being made gives no one confidence, and it’s causing a lot of hardship.\nThere’s been tons of waste, fraud, and abuse before Trump even came into office…\nI appreciate everything that VA is doing for us Veterans. Thank you.\nWe know that your just wanting to privatize the va just so your billionaire handlers can make money of it.. please retire you have lost all credibility sir..\nthis is coming from a trump DEI hire. Depraved, Evil and Incompetent. Do you really believe what you are saying. The fact that you don’t know you are being set up by trump and the DOGiE Xitter to be the fall guy when veterans get really pissed off shows how incredibly confused you are\nWe need the truth about how the Veterans are being taken care, reducing the staff from veteran hospitals and major medical people helping a vet is not helping as you say there will not have changes throughout the Veterans system for us Veterans. We needed the truth from President Trump the ( Felon ).\nHere is the truth right from the bosses mouth.\nThe homesy-speak doesn’t cut it, sorry nope, don’t believe a word out of this guy’s mouth.\nGo back to the liberal library and devise something intelligent to say. Another thing, are you afraid to use your real name? Give me a break.\nGo back to your close-minded, racist, and bigoted library.\nHey Mark, do you remember that blood makes the grass grow green? We do. See you soon\nPatriot Army of America\nPlease explain how firing so many veterans in the federal government is helpful to us? Also please explain how harassing them is helpful?\nMy care providers at the VA feel overwhelmed and many are thinking about leaving because of the awful current leadership.\nYou need to do better.\nFascinating, looks like the comments are being monitored and not allowed to be posted any more. I made two posts and nothing came through.\nThank you for this update and input on ‘Whoppers’. I like this direct approach and input to us veterans. Will see how it goes in the future and will try and provide quick and correct feedback. I am not going to be critical at this point. But if you want any opinions or suggestions well, I am sure we can give them. Let’s see how it goes.\nFirst – blader cancer is on the presumptive list but I cannot get it noted for me on my list of combat related – wonder why. I was told that the VA would review all records when this cancer was added so I did not have to do anything. So now a year or two later, I still have bladder cancer, but it is not on my combat type of list or whatever you call it.\nWe need a list of what is being taken away from us veterans.\nVA Website Announcement\n“ We are PROUD to have ABANDONED the divisive DEI policies of the past and pivot back to VA’s core mission.”\nDoes your Core Mission now include Abandoning these Hiring Preferences giving to:\n1)Disabled Veterans’ Preference (30%+)which recognizes the\neconomic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans.\n2)Military Spousal Preference which Federal agencies can use the military spouse non-competitive hiring process to fill positions on either a temporary or permanent basis.\nYou’re eligible if you are:\nA spouse of an active duty member of the armed forces.\nA spouse of a service member who is 100% disabled due to a service-connected injury at the time of separation from military service.\nA spouse of a service member killed while on active duty.\nhttps://www.vaforvets.va.gov/vaforvets/docs/OCHCO-Veteran-and-Military-Spouse-Hiring-Authority-Resource-Guide.pdf\nVA Secretary Doug Collins\nYour videos are really good, but take the politics out of the VA and your videos/messages\nI guess as a SUCKER AND LOSER, I’m supposed to believe the lying Chaplain and Divinity school graduate. Kick rocks, you pathetic Trump sycophant. Enjoy your time in hell.\nAll I know is the medical side of the house across all VA facilities in upstate New York are woefully understaffed. This includes the Syracuse Hospital and satellite clinics. It’s good seeing the DEI crap like pride flags gone from the lobby of the Syracuse hospital but they need a hiring blitz just to get up to full staffing and don’t say like Hochul did to the COs that 70% staffing is the new 100%.\nYou might note that this is from YouTube, and that comments are turned off. Reckon why that is?\nThe first lie in this little “speech”, echoed in what he said on his leader’s platform (“X”), is that veterans have been asking for more efficiency from the VA for decades. That’s nonsense; veterans may know that things can be more efficient, but that has never been a priority. The second lie is that the orange one is making things more efficient. I cannot tell you enough times that when you are looking to make things less wasteful, remove fraud and lessen abuse, you don’t fire the Inspectors General, and you don’t decommission the department of fraud, waste and abuse. You simply don’t start with dismantling the tools for doing what you say you want to do, and you don’t hire a bunch of snot-nosed computer guys to find Fraud, Waste and Abuse instead of analysts and accountants.\nYou’re not fooling anyone, you orange-nosed dimwit.\nFor what it’s worth, my father was a veteran, my brother was a veteran, I am a veteran, my son is a veteran, and my daughter-in-law is a veteran. I was born in the military and worked in and around it for more than 30 years.\nHow can we come to you for the TRUTH? Do you have a phone number we can call? Are you going to come out and do town hall meetings? Whats your email?\nHistory will remember how you didn’t follow your oath and are destroying the VA.\nThere are lies, damned lies, and Doug Collins. We don’t believe you, Dougie. Nothing but smoke and mirrors. But maybe we’d at least be able to understand what you’re saying if you’d drop that “I’m just a good ‘ol boy, hayseed, straw-between-your-teeth” act. You know those contracts you’re cutting? Of course you don’t. You don’t have a clue what it is they do. You hear the word “contract” and like a shiny coin, you start drooling about cutting them. Benefits? You’re going to come up with some brand new system that will crash in a day. I’ve heard GSA is having a hard time getting yours and Trump’s official photos into the VA. I look forward to them arriving. Then, everytime I pass by, I will happily and enthusiastically give you both the “one-fingered salute.”\nIf the Secretary says they are protecting veterans then why are some veterans being laid off from some federal jobs and news about laying off 70,000 more veterans workers in addition to the already laid off veterand workers. VA should not be politicized. Claims appeals are taking forever to be approved.\nVinny\nOEF Veteran\nCan I go to the fat Whopper in the Oval Office? It sounds like a different message is coming from there.\nDear Colonel Collins,\nI watched several of your videos and I’m not at all reassured. I’m hearing convincing reports that the VA will cut 80,000 jobs to shrink the workforce to pre-2019 staffing levels.\nI’m a retired disabled veteran with 27 years of decorated service. I am grateful for what I consider excellent support from dedicated and caring VA employees. I remember vividly when the VA was held in low esteem by the Veteran community due to staffing shortages, dismal facilities, and inefficiency. The VA’s improvements have been impressive. To hear there are plans to reduce VA staffing by 80,000 (including 6,000 vets) and then be told that there will be no cuts in healthcare or benefits is not credible.\nEven in the Chaplain Corps I’m sure you heard the saying “Don’t piss on my boots and then tell me it’s raining”. If there is fraud, waste, or abuse then go fix it — we’re standing by to help. Please don’t gut the VA under the guise of efficiency and end up harming those who served honorably.\nVery Respectfully,\nFormer member of the Navy Submarine Service\nIt is disappointing to see the head of this agency speak in a low level way by choosing a favorite president. Especially when we can all see whether your (R) or (D) this man is hurting Americans. Plus he is a full blown draft dodger coward that doesn’t respect the military service. Stand on your own and don’t give this coward the credit.\nJust stop with the draft dodger crap, it’s a stupid attack line. Biden and Clinton also dodge the draft. Also I met President Trump during the first administration and he definitely cares.\nFor the first time it seems that the VA system is finally working. Easy to make apppts, easy to get refills and easy to get in touch with your primary. Veterans are getting fired from different VA facilities. If anything, cut down on civilian hiring if they are not doing the job. You need to interview their supervisor to find out how and if thw worker should be fired. Instead, it’s a numbers thing and not a performance issue. If it’s not broken, leave it alone. It’s a real sad time for veterans.\nTYANK YOU! I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT\nTom KOENIG\nVIET NAM VET / US NAVY – BROWN WATER\nI read some of these unhinged comments from wacked out leftists. Holy crap, do we have some seriously mentally ill veterans. I’d encourage you to NEVER decrease services to the brain damaged vets we have posting comments here. They are complaining about not brushing their teeth or washing themselves. They are complaining that our massive government debt is being trimmed and oddly enough they are complaining about the quality and quantity of their FREE healthcare. Yeah they served, so scrap that sniveling argument. But, the cost of medical care is not free, we have to pay for the doctors, lab work, Xray’s and MRI machines.\nYeah, it took 10 stinking years to complete my claim. The average time for a VA response to my rebuttal was 567 days and then to years after my disability claim was completed the VA tried to take it away and I spent another three years winning every point at the Court of Appeals. Yeah, all of the misery was caused by Obama and Biden and democrats in general. But, I’m sure it was Trump’s fault.\nBecause no matter how many democrats spit on veteran’s, call us terrorists and laugh when we die, it is somehow always Trump’s fault…………………right?\nI saw a poll today that said 51% of the people support cutting the VA. So we should stop complaining. It don’t mean nothin.\nWell, guess that’s that! Time will always tell the truth though.\nI’ve heard the Secretary of Defense say that Veterans don’t need a pension and disability, as he sipped on his water in a shot glass.\nWell, Mark, that’s a snide comment. Did you hear SECDEF say that yourself or were you listening to a libtard? We need to make sure you’re telling the truth or passing rumors.\nYou are a disgrace to our veterans. You swore an oath to uphold the constitution not to carry orange Putin’s water.\nHe is a liar and makes statements that have no basis in fact. Show us the line items, how they define these as waste or fraud, so veterans can accurately evaluate the impacts of terminating over 80,000 positions at the VA. They never do and you will begin to see the negative impacts.\nIf you carefully watch what DOGE or whatever you want to call it is doing, you will see that they over exaggerate what they claim and saving due to waste, abuse, & fraud but have to change that amount regularly as they have not proof.\nA lot of fast talking with no substance…the proof is in the pudding, or should I say, the WHOOPER. We’ll see who’s telling the truth. Time will tell Sir! All these cuts are really not looking good for you. Efficiency comes in assessing programs, duplication of services, etc.; not reducing your workforce unless the programs call for it. We veterans are watching and we’ll be the judge of who’s telling the truth or not.\nthank you sir\nSuggestion, have the kiosks in all facilities so you can also complete your travel. It shouldn’t be different and or difficult or time consuming to complete a travel voucher.\nNH VAMC has kiosks that you can check in and complete your travel right there. Go down to any MA VAMC none of the Kiosks ever have that option other than checking in for your appt.\nMy 75-year-old father in-law can’t be expected to be logging into VA.gov and navigating to the BTSSS dashboard, logging in again and then doing a search for the appt. Then build a claim and submitting it has been a terrible experience unpleasant to do. Other option is to find the office at the VAMC and do a paper one that add additional time to the visit onsite. Keep BTSSS for the more complicated claims, but simple mileage reimbursement is just as easy to do at a kiosk. Please standardize that in all facilities.\nThis is such a lie!!! Ironically, I watched this video while waiting for an appointment with my provider at the VA. When I met with them, they told me they weren’t sure if they would be here next week for my treatment. They’ve already closed some of the programs and let staff go. I can’t wait to post this article with my recent experience all over social media.\n“We did not lay off any Veteran Crisis Line responders.”\nReally? I know someone who was laid off.\nHow can we believe anything this administration says? We can’t.\nTrump lies and the rest of you cover for him.\nUnimpressed with the gaslighting. Please let us know when we can expect our healthcare, disability, and pensions to be cut.\nDon’t be stupid and keep lying to us. You’re going to piss off millions of people who are war-hardened and many with poor impulse control. You’ll never sleep with both eyes open again. This isn’t a threat, it’s merely a prediction of what happens when you threaten veterans’ very survival.\nNo worse than Biden and his lies.\nHow about getting a doctor on staff at the Newnan, GA clinic? The VA expects me to drive across downtown Atlanta to see a Dr.\nMost of these comments are odd considering democrats had been in power for 12 of last 16 years. If everything was hunky dory with your VA care, I could see the reservations with the secretary’s comments. I think the question us vets should be asking is: Do we continue down the same path or should we look at something else.\nAnd out of those 12 of the last 16 years, how many times did they propose cutting VA staff by 80,000?\nYes Mr whoever, whatever you actually think vets are stupid and worthless now that we are disabled. Why don’t all you worthless pieces of shit in Washington go out and actually serve your country and its people. Send your children to fight (you don’t ever). Just remember if this administration takes away Veterans benefits\nyou (maga/nazi) will never serve office again. Trump looks so sick no amount of meds you put in him or makeup and tanning will make me believe he is doing anything Musk is in control. Someone that wasn’t even born in th USA.\nIt’s sad that after reading a majority of these comments that most of you are insane.\nThank you for cutting the fat that silly Joe Biden and Komrade Barry Obama put in place by creating jobs for people that don’t work.\nHelp me understand how safeguarding 300,000 of the current 400,000+ employees is not going to end up with laying off employees?\nAnd explain to both your staff members and all our veterans how just 300,000 employees are going to be able to maintain current levels of services and access to healthcare and benefits for our veterans when over 400,000 current do it.\nThese “whoppers” you talk about are coming out of your mouth.\nI’m all for eliminating fraud, waste and abuse, but you come across as uneducated and delusional by taking a chainsaw to the whole VA system and then telling us nothing is going to suffer. And that you care about veterans.\nYou are insulting all veterans when you speak/lie to us like this.\nToo bad trump doesn’t care about veterans. He doesn’t care about you either, but you at least could stand up to him and protect us veterans.\nIronic that you profess support for vets but then follow Trumps’s lead in laying off thousands of unsuspecting vets to improve the VA. Hypocrisy, and you are now on the record as supporting a man who views vets as suckers and losers. Vets deal in truths. With that bootlicking video of lies you have show us where you stand. Shame!!\nThis man is a tRump puppet, every time his mouth moves, tRump is pulling the strings and a lie comes out. I’ll bet you couldn’t find a half dozen ethical people in this so called administration. America is in a sad state of affairs.\nDOGE is seeking a 20% reduction in staffing, how is it possible to maintain level of care with this reduction. Also how does the VA plan to implement some if not all of the 5 bills working their way through the House that would shift funding and services to private providers.\nAs a Veteran, I’m supposed to believe a TRUMP APPOINTEE?\nGive me a break – this is nothing more than rhetoric over substance.\nI copied this from the Washington (AP): The Department of Veterans Affairs is planning a reorganization that includes cutting over 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency that provides health care and other services for millions of veterans, according to an internal memo obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.\nSince you are a trump supporter, I DON’T BELIEVE YOU!\nThanks for all you are doing, I am thankful for what you bring to the VA\nThe last shoe hasn’t dropped, burger boy, and it’s not your call, so when the administration tells u what to do as a good private you’ll jump instead of resigning\nI love it!!! Thank you President Trump for finally doing something positive for us veterans. Thank you Secretary Collins for talking to us in plain English about what’s happening. The Democrats want to hate any and everything our president does, but will still enjoy all the benefits. I have always received great service from the VA, and look forward to even better days.\nGod Bless America!!!!!\nTrump and an all GOP Congress cut retired military benefits in 2018, lessening coverage and instituting premiums on those who served 20 or more years on active duty. In early 2020, Trump barred retired military from seeking care on most military bases. Considering how long one already had to wait on hold to speak to a VA disability representative, I have no question but that Trump is going to gut military benefits further, while also tossing thousands of veterans out of jobs. Less for our heroes, but gobs more for the already obscenely wealthy and support for our enemies in Russia.\nYour words do match what is actually happening. I am no fool. I watch the sentae hearings, I read documetns directly from official government websites,, I have worked at the VA and I am a Veteran. The 98Million USD you are referring to came at the cost of firing federal employess, many whom were Veterans. So now those Veterans don’t have jobs. Absolute Disgrace. Departments in the VA have already reported struggles as they have been downsized including work on critical studies on medical conditions directly affecting our Veterans – including burn pit, cancer, and infectious disease. Regarding the 300,00 roles you have “protected”, that is a misrepresentation of the numbers. You said you are planning to lay off 15% of the VA providers and staff that support those providers on March 5. To focus on reducing employess, rather than first looking at the specific issues, you have clearly made it obvious that you are just misleading all of us Veterans with your insincere promises. However, one quarter of those you are laying off are Veterans – so once again, you are over simplifying a very complex system and issues. You cannot make this make sense – we finally had more employees addressing the needs and services of Veterans as evidenced by reduced wait times, increased access to the VA, and quicker claims time. Just saying you are restructructuring the VA by firing people is NOT being done well if you just fire people on probation. It takes investigation, reporting, understanding the systems, talking to the Veterans, talking to the empoyees, and not just acting over night. MAKE THIS MAKE SENSE. Our benefits our meaningless if we don’s have enough providers or staff to actually supply those services.\nAny veteran who thinks you are on our side are fooled. You are acting brashly and sadly this is going to costs lives, lower the quality of life, and harm Veterans. You are not offering solutions. You are demonstrating that you and this administration are willing to make Veterans disposable. Shame on you!\nSo why is Alina Haba, Trump‘s personal attorney saying that they are making 80,000 cuts and that some veterans do not deserve jobs?\nOMG. I depend on the VA. What’s going to happen to my healthcare?\nI think that it it a shame that the Democrats and their lackeys are spreading misinformation. They made it plain that what they were going to do and they are doing it. It’s about time that all sections of the government is cleaned-up and run like a well oil machine. Anyone who is not brain dead can see that the government has been broken for yearsssss. The national debt has to be brought under control or else the United States will not be no more. OUR debt is fast approaching that point of no return.\nYou talk a good game, but actions always speak louder than words. You were put in that position by Trump and he only puts his loyalists in charge, people he knows will obey him to their core. What you say and what’s actually happening and reported are not the same. You can’t be trusted to take care of our countries vets.\nYou’re a liar. You’re a fraud. You are waste and abuse. The government owes veterans are benefits. It’s a contractual obligation. There is no other way to look at this and there’s no other way for this to be executed. It is insulting and it is shameful to even utter the phrase considering cutting veterans benefits. We are entitled to these benefits. We are entitled to these benefits. WE ARE ENTITLED TO THESE BENEFITS. To take them away would be a crime. There’s no other way to phrase or to comprehend this. Doug, you are not fit or qualified for the role you are underperforming in currently. Which is made glaringly apparent from your lack of a spine. Get it together. Stop being a puppet.\nTrump mouthpiece speaking Trump lies… how does cutting 80k jobs help veterans?\nI guarantee that statement doesn’t include transgender veterans or our care. I am never stepping foot in VA again because I’m gonna be made to use the wrong restroom and be addressed by the wrong pronouns, even though i’m fully transitioned with a vagina, thanks to this present and his disdain for transgender service members, veterans and anyone outside the gender binary.\nI am so sorry Rene. It is so disgraceful that you are being treated this way. Your gender has no bearing on your honorable service, and you still deserve exceptional care that is gender affirming! I support you as a fellow veteran, and I am actively working as hard as I can to reach out to my representatives to encourage and enlighten them on this very issue. I hope that Judge Reyes stands firm in her upcoming decision to protect all Americans and treat them fairly regardless of gender identity.\nHe’s talking about this stuff as if it’s in the past, so that he can muddy the truth.\nHe’s right that none of these things have happened, but that’s not the problem that he’s pretending to address.\nThe cut to 80,000 VA personnel is set to happen in the future. So he’s obfuscating the truth I’m order to trick us into thinking everything will be fine.\nI have been told that the homemaker services are being discontinued. The homemaker helps with medications, picking up groceries and medications, cooks meals, does cleaning, and takes vet to appointments. We have been told this from several of our providers that this service has been stopped for several of their clients. We are in the Texas coastal bend area.\nSuch a liar. I guarantee that statement doesn’t include transgender veterans or our care\nLIAR. https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60918 https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60947\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60916\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60917\nSomeone needs to tell the (Las Vegas) Henderson, NV clinic. They’ve been less than satisfactory for me.\n80,000 workers. Youre a freaking lying weasal. VA healthcare co cared away. More lies. Your turning our country into a garbage disposal. Political speak weasel.\nListen we know how smooth sweet-talking politicians are. There speeches are like the proverbial frog under the heating water, before we know it we’re being scalded in boiling water. Look let’s not get political here, politics aside, we know what is driving all these cuts, and it’s to make up for the 4 Trillion tax cut bill president Trump wants to pass for his billionaires friends and himself. Listen, there isn’t enough jobs or the shutting down of any Federal departments that’s going to offset a balance budget and the tax cuts proposed. NOT POSSIBLE!!! What we need is a responsible government that does the right thing, and own up to the obligations to veterans, social security and Medicare recipients, and the most needy in our society. Man! Can we look out and take care of each other and not use the positions we’ve been given to sock it to the downtrodden. I’m afraid this isn’t going to end well for our democracy when elected leaders don’t listen to their constituents, and the proletariats has to bow to oligarchs in dejected abandonment.\nYesterday we received a warn act due for 5/5 letting us know VA employees would be reduced back to 2019 status, so it will let go 80k plus employees. It will affect in some form and shape veteran care, what’s next get rid of veteran disability pay.\nWhat VA positions by position title, grade and series are being eliminated? How many of those positions are encumbered by vets and of those how many are DVs? Have the projected RIF/cuts been provided to the bargaining unit? Will you just summarily fire these people or will you follow the law? Can we see the before and after organization chart that justifies the positions being eliminated and the info that establishes that the reorg will maintain the same level of services, projected savings and efficiencies accomplished? How will this improve services to the vet? Provide this information that justifies your position, and I may see it your way. If it doesn’t exist or you don’t provide it, then I see no reason than to agree with the vets below who question your motives. If it doesn’t exist or you are in the process of creating it to justify the announced cuts then you are backing into the position. Thank you.\nSomeone needs to tell the medical folks in Las Vegas/Henderson, NV. I’ve dealt with lower back issues for years. The VA sent me to the main VA hospital for an MRI. Then sent me to a “pain management clinic run by civilians (at an astronomical cost to the VA) for follow up. Then VA ONLY uses CD’s for their MRI’s. This pain management clinic had no method of reading the CD. And, it was like pulling teeth for me to get this CD from the VA. It was about a year long process.\nDuring this process I walked out of one meeting with my provider at the Henderson clinic as she said she couldn’t help. (A PA last name Trinidad. She has since moved on) On my way out another employee asked “how was your visit today.” He subsequently had me sit as he went to the manager of the facility. He said, “he’ll see you in a minute” That wait was about 10 minutes with him not coming out to see me. I asked what he was doing. I was told “he was paying bills.” I walked out, obviously I wasn’t important to him.\nALL I INITIALLY WANTED WAS THE PAIN & MUSCLE RELAXERS I HAD BEEN TAKING, AS NEEDED, FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. I have since found a civilian Dr for my needs. I am 76 years old and just want the time I may have left here on earth to be able to manage my back pain as I know I can.\nI wish this was true but, when you have an administration (President) that lies to us everyday how do we believe you’re telling the truth? I am sure all our concerns will fall on deaf ears. I am sure the VA will go back to the way it was in the 60’s and not care at all about us Suckers and Losers. Thanks for nothing.\nTwo appointment cancelations by the VA, and they keep pushing out two months. I do not believe you!\nA Burger King analogy doesn’t work with this Veteran : Quit bending the knee to the want to be King.\nYou are laying off VA employees. You should be embarrassed.\nFrom AP News:\nhttps://apnews.com/article/veterans-affairs-cuts-doge-musk-trump-f587a6bc3db6a460e9c357592e165712\nFrom USA Today:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/05/va-layoff-federal-employees/81624579007/\nFrom Wahington Post:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/05/veterans-affairs-cut-employees-trump-doge/\nFrom Government Executive:\nhttps://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/va-plans-lay-many-83000-employees-year/403477/\nWish I had confidence in what you said but I don’t. I know that the wait for veterans to see a psychiatrist for PTSD is extremely long and veterans are told to go elsewhere. I really don’t believe what you said just like I don’t believe what Trump says. Sorry but I don’t believe you will stand up for veterans but I do believe you will do whatever Trump tells you to do even if it means cutting veterans benefits!\nhttps://military.com does a good job of factual reporting since the VA news site is now a propaganda channel.\nWe, the veterans, didn’t ask for the lifelong struggles we have because we chose to make a sacrifice to support our country. You are a piece of shit for just making stuff up. The sad part is, the Trumpper veterans are going to be so shocked when they’re homeless. I wish them luck.\nHow is cutting 800k jobs helping us veterans get the care we need. I have been without my own doctor for a few years now. They are now saying that I may not get another VA doc bc of your policies. All I see is a liar and a fraud appointed by a megalomaniac. Very frustrated with the fact that this administration has moved to change everything so fast. All you are doing is stress testing this US government and the fallout will be horrendous.\nRegardless if you pro or anti trump, you have to love this guy.\nThis all sounds like more lies from bureaucrats while veterans suffer. Has anyone tried calling VA benefits to check on the status of there claims to be told that they have no information and the recieved a letter from the VA stating the same. Does anyone personally know veteran’s who were fired and are now at risk on ending up on the street? How about contacting your primary care provider only to be dua issued for weeks? The only redirection going on here is with the truth.\nDon’t go to Capitol Hill for lies! You can get them right from Doug Collins!\nWhen the layoffs occur, because this administration is doing what it said it would, and services suffer, we know who is complicit.\nDear Sir,\nIt has been proposed to terminate the employment of 80,000 VA employees. If this occurs many Veterans who work for the VA will loose their jobs. Also, this will affect the health care services of Veterans and will cause delays in claims processing of Veterans claims. However, you did not discuss the proposed employment issue. This is not funny. This is serious!\nI am a 77 year old Veteran with 90% disability rating. I am unable to work and depend on my disability check for survival. I was discharged from the Army in 1985 with disabled status honorably. If I loose my disability check I will not be able to survive. Trump/Musk leave things alone that you know nothing about.\nThanx for listening to this “Crazy Old Woman.”\nThe VA telephone system is absolutely unsatisfactory.\n1.) The centralized phone, call in, system is so inefficient that I am of the opinion that the last thing the VA cares about is the Veteran’s time.\nClinics do call the veteran, but are using phone numbers that do not identify as being from the VA. The calls show up as an “unidentified” number. When the Veteran tries to call back it goes to the centralized phone system where they usually wind up having to leave a message that may or may not make it to the appropriate care giver. It’s a “catch 22” type situation and needs to end.\n2.) The centralized phone system wastes immense amount of time. Call into the system and listen to all the crap they want to go through. It’s not helping Veterans, it’s frustrating Veterans.\n3.) Bring back, direct access to the provider.\n4.) Community Care: What a ridiculous program. They only authorize 6 visits at a time. Will not allow the Veteran to call in before the sessions run out and then can’t issue the next 6 visits without a break of two to three weeks in treatments, thereby setting the patient back and limiting any progress in the treatments.\nDear Secretary Collin,\nThank you for addressing the recent rumors surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is essential that we maintain transparency and open communication as we navigate these challenging discussions.\nWhile I appreciate your efforts to clarify misconceptions, I believe it is crucial to emphasize that the negative reactions stemming from these rumors are unwarranted. The focus should remain on our common goal: ensuring the well-being and support of our veterans and employees alike.\nThe issues of fraud, waste, and abuse not only impact the services provided to our veterans but also highlight inefficiencies within our workforce that require ongoing review and prompt action. It is vital that we uphold our commitment to accountability by continuously scrutinizing our internal processes and taking necessary measures to enhance efficiency.\nI urge the VA and DOGE to prioritize this review to foster an environment that is both trustworthy and effective. By doing so, we can combat unwarranted negativity and reinforce our dedication to serving those who have served us.\nThank you for your leadership and for addressing these critical matters. I look forward to collaborating further to facilitate positive change within the VA.\nWarmest Regards,\nSteve L Butts, CWO, USA (Retired)\n“Come here for news” bwhaha ha ha hahahaha. You DID, in fact fire crisis line responders. Saying otherwise just shows your lack of integrity and honesty.\nThe cuts have already terrorized workers and impacted my care. You lie. I don’t call a whopper line (how stupid are you?), I use news sources that provide the evidence.\nWhen you cut benefits and service-connected conditions, you’ll claim there was fraud. There isn’t.\nHONOR THE CONTRACT!!! (Thanks VFW for having the integrity to speak truth to power, unlike this lackey!)\nThank you for taking the time to address this issue. So many untruths coming from DC it is shameful.\nThe only “whoopers” are coming out of Collins mouth, parroting Musk, Trump. The medical schools use the VA for training. No way can the medical schools, schools of nursing, psychology, social work, physical therapy, etc continue to operate w/o a compliant, accessible group of guinea pigs to train on. So, where are the reps of those fields? Why aren’t they involved.\nSo no one that was a new employee and axed was on the crises line? No new doctors or nurses were fired? We are no longer ina long term war in Afghanistan and numbers do need to be cut understandingly. You are cutting and not saying what did on purpose. When a Republican or any other politician talks to you with no jacket on they are showing they are more than guilty all ready. LTC Coleman\nI’m watching this video after finding out about active duty military families not receiving food assistance. I think we all need to be paying more attention to happening at the front!\nMy claim for PTSD compensation has been on a docket for a judge review since 20 April 2020. That’s FIVE years Mr Collin’s. Give me a break!!\nLove what our new Secretary of VA says. Hope he can clear up the pipe line of delayed claims that take months to adjudicate. Upper level reviews are also painfully slow. Call me and I can give you some ideas on how to expedite claims.\nthank for the information and help\nThe word “benefits’, at best, is somewhat ambiguous. What the Secretary (and others) need to do is actually define “benefits” Project 2025 for example (and the Secretary was associated with) clearly outlined that “benefits’ changes, cancellations and disability payments, in part are in their game plan, so to speak and, may actually affect many Veterans.\nDisability qualifications may also change as with ratings, percentages etc.\nTDIU (now IU) benefits is likely to be altered dramatically as well.\nAll I know for sure is that my current critical medical procedures at my VA medical facility regarding my bladder cancer have been postponed.\nWhat all Veterans need from the Secretary is FULL DISCLOSURE. Further ‘chit-chat’ from the Secretary lacking FULL DISCLOSURE is, well, what it is; pure hyperbole etc.\nThis is not true ! They are falsifying tests to take AWAY disability ratings for the Vets. All false ! This needs DOGE to get involved. Cute little video, but many like ourselves, are suffering.\nThank you, sir.\nThis is the catch: benefits are going to be paid. What he isn’t saying is that disability ratings are going to be up for revision and it will be harder to receive one. That’s a card repubs have wanted to play for a long time. Remember, vets had to march on Washington to get the PACT act signed. In fact, the new wave of firings will directly target the workers hired to implement the PACT act.\nI’m worried about the “stipend ” program being canceled. Even as a legacy, it’s all still up in the air. Please help out us Veterans who have already grown accustomed to being a caregiver for disabled Veterans.\nSo untrue!!! We you stress you staff the way Trump has done is bound to have a lasting effect on how Veterans are treated. How about the mandate the VA healthcare will no longer write reasonable accommodations for any veteran that uses them as a primary provider that doesn’t seem like you’re helping veterans to me.\nThanks Secretary Doug Collins i’m glad you are being honest with us. We will keep you and President Trump in our thoughts while all of this is going on.\nCollins is a liar just like the fuhrer, fuck Trump and fuck you for voting for him.\nEvery morning the local Kansas City news reports 80,000 VA employees will be laid off. The VA staff treat Veteran’s very good, better than 60’s or 70’s. What is the truth?\nI am a 76 year old Vietnam veteran\nU.S.M.C. Sergeant I live in New Jersey.\nThe VA has been very good to me for my HEALTHCARE and medicine. It’s the only insurance I have for HEALTHCARE I’m 100% disabled veteran I’m on home Primary care from the VA I go through community care through the VA. My wife is my caregiver been married 53 years. I hope it’s true what I just heard you say if it is, you took a lot of pressure off of me, God bless America.\nAnd thank you very much for the service you are giving to the VA thank you, sir you’re truly\nJoel Nevins\nHave the COURAGE to post your “Kick the can” video HERE on the official VA website!!! Why are you only posting that on Twitter? To further enrich Elon Musk? Be a MAN, show ACCOUNTABILITY, quit COWERING behind “obstacles” to clear and OPEN communication with the veteran community.\nI am absolutely serious in saying that I would like a response to know why the “Kick the can” video message wasn’t also posted here on the VA website, but only on Twitter.\nWhy is it that when I try to call the advice nurse, all I get is some sales rep telling me that they have a special deal for me. And there is noway to avoid them and get to the nurse! I have to not go to an appointment because I can’t get through to cancel it!!!\nJust another puppet for the Musk administration. The current administration is gutting this country under the guise of helping. This pair of clownshoes is complicit in aiding and abetting. Snake oil salesman.\n“We’re putting Veterans number one back at the VA,”\nBy firing veterans and reducing the staff who we depend on.\nThank you, Doug. Great info.\nR/Barry N. Moore\nI for one can not thank VA health care enough. Since 2017 I have had one health issue after another and the VA has been there every step of the way rather it be in house or community care from southeast Pa to North Central Pa and everything in between I salute you. If anybody makes the VA any better it will be President Trump. To get this country back in shape it is going to po many but so be it. No pain no gain. Thank you Secretary Collins for the actual update.\nCut the bull shit BurgerKing comparisons. Yes find fraud abuse and waste. Do it smart. Don’t be a Trump dingleberry.\nThe condescension in this video is incredible. We are not privates gearing up for the final battle at NTC. Also, you are the whooper line. This administration has clearly laid out its intent to reduce and/or end Veteran’s Benefits in the manifesto, “Mandate for Leadership,” that it is following to a T. It is also intending to remove tax payers money from a federally ran program and place it in the hands of private interests. There is no world in which private capitalist interests will operate with the care of Veterans as priority one. Finally, you cannot announce that you will fire 83000 workers, including nurses and psychologists, and expect us to believe you when you say we will not be impacted.\nNo problems with any of the services, some times it could be faster, less conversome.\nThings are so incredibly serious right now and this idiot is reaching out to us like a comedian? Like a bad comedian? We need serious leadership and this man has made himself a joke. Speak to us with respect for what we have sacrificed. With dignity. With serious care. Your partisan BS has no place here. Veterans are veterans under many administrations. You have no credibility and it’s your own fault because you treat this as a complete farce. Also, you didn’t say one word about how we will be constitutionally protected. And, if you think firing federal employees in Veteran settings doesn’t impact healthcare, you are wrong. I am a nurse. There is a terrible shortage, especially in rural areas. I am also a disabled veteran. Can we have you address things as an adult, please?\nMr Collins’ condescension and fast food references are offensive. As a veteran I expect transparency and not good ole boy “I told you so” rhetoric. It’s disheartening to say the least.\nI, like my fellow vets, put our lives on the line for this country. We need better access to life saving treatments. What we don’t need is another politician telling us how stupid we are and talking down to us using references to hamburgers so that we can understand in poor people terms. It’s insulting and offensive.\nFor 20 years I have been appealing my VA disability rating. Went on 100% SS disability in 1999 but has not recognized the fact.\nMAGA hates Veterans.\nI am glad the new Secretary is affirming the priority of veterans and their benefits. I am disappointed he completely ignored the fact that 80,000 jobs will be lost in a very short time frame and how such a haphazard approach is likely to affect the capabilities of the VA. At our facility, we lost many long-term knowledgeable resources.\nI can not stand your partisan propaganda messages. You’re supposed to be in your position solely for the administration of the VA and the care of this nations’ veterans. Instead you get on your platform and spew partisan talking points. Pleases remember the uniform you wore and the people you served with and put them first instead of placating the president.\nGood news!! Thank you Sec Collins. I could use some help from you concerning my disability resolution, its taking me almost 9 years, and not resoloved yet. Please help!\nWe all know you’re a Trump lackey and will pretty much say anything the Dear Leader commands. I’d believe what you’re saying way more if you put away the pom-poms, quit kissing his backside, and didn’t try to banter your way out of the hard questions.\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60918 https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60947 https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915 https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60916 https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60917\nExactly, we all need to let the administration know how we feel and how they are taking away our benefits. Fury is a great way to express how I fee.\nSo the people you’re letting go are not Veterans, right? I’m sure you would NEVER want to put a Vet out of work now, would you?\nThank you for setting the record straight for Veterans. I work for the National Call Center and we speak with Veterans and their families every day. So many of them are worried about their benefits and also about us as employees. Many have expressed their concerns about whether or not Call Center agents like myself will be let go. It would be nice if you could specifically address our service area so we may continue taking care of these callers and answering their questions and concerns. Thank you!\nHe’s lying to us.\nI’m not sure what universe the secretary inhabits. In all cases where an organization cuts its workforce as drastically as he is proposing – 15% by his own admission – the ability of that organization to meet its obligations falls dramatically. He is lying to us veterans and to the American public. Fortunately most of us are intelligent enough to see through it. What a disgrace this administration is, to go after us Veterans after all we’ve given to this Nation.\nAll I hear is democrats and liberals crying…\nNot true at all. Organizations make drastic cuts all the time in the private sector due to bloat and become more effective afterwards. All the time. Twitter is probably the most dramatic example but every corporation has experienced this on a regular basis in its own lifecycle. It’s necessary for the survival of any organization and our government entities are way overdue. So calm down Jen and quit insulting people. Spinoza once said “I have made an effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them” in other words, your mockery stems from ignorance because you refuse to understand. Ask why and be sincere in your journey. Lash out less, seek to understand more. Be better.\nVeterans should receive medical care and attention to their health and families. They wrote a blank check to our government and some paid with their life and some with their health and sanity. They deserve all the support they need from the USA government end of story.\nWhat percentage of layoffs have been veterans? Answer the simple questions. Stop gaslighting the patriots who have defended this country. The fake patriot magas don’t like service.\nI don’t believe a single fucking word that comes out of a Trump appointed bootlicker.\nIf we want to know the truth go to your local VA health center/hospital and talk to the actual people working there.\nYou can talk all you want but the boots on the ground are going to know the truth\nI have been to the Buffalo, NY VA, and you are wrong! I have ALWAYS been treated with dignity and fairness. I have not seen a cut in my benefits, and no one down at the VA is talking cuts.\nI visit the VA hospital in Madison and my pcp quite frequently. I talk to a lot of vets.\nI can’t agree with your statement. I hear more about how well they are being treated. Yes, unfortunately some may feel differently depending on their situation.\nBut overall , for myself, for many years have received the best possible care.\nSorry that you feel you will not be cared for as you deserve.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins,\nThank you for the update and congratulations on your appointment. You are very reassuring. I have one question from the video update. Where was the 98 million taken from that you redirected to veterans care?\nEd\nReno, Nevada\nWhere do you get your information? You need to do better research!\nWe don’t believe you. Smoke and mirrors. When you started talking about what others haven’t done, you sound just like Trump. He’s going to gut the VA and I believe you’re going to help him.\nYou said it…\nWhere are you receiving your information—MSNBC or CNN? Cite your source, or move on and spread your propaganda elsewhere.\nThis is great news. I saw just this morning that 73,000 people were being laid off. Bad news. If my 70% service-connected disability was cut off, I’d be sleeping on streets. Keep up the good work and God bless you.\nI work at the VA, we are operating in constant fear and anxiety. Do not believe what he is saying.\nHe’s lying to us. Expect all benefits to go away: healthcare, disability, and pensions. Trump and his lackies are gutting the government. Better organize.\nyour disability will never be cut off unless you are collecting on it due to fraud.\nThey’re absolutely firing tens of thousands of people, he’s just lying to try to prevent people from realizing how badly he’s trying to screw us all over.\nThanks for clarified that rumor.\nI have a bridge to sell you.\nAs a Veteran who currently works at the VA, I am disgusted by you and the entire administration. None of you give a damn about Veterans, if you did you wouldn’t be firing over 83,000 employees!!!!!!\nI still remember trump saying the civilian award means more than the military awards. After he received his donation from said award recipient (of course it was a billionaire).\nRicky- Collins was a lying sack when he was in congress, he was maga and is more maga now that he is directly working for trumpet! The Liar in chief loves toadies like\nand because they are controllable\nHere is Pinocchio with a bunch of lies. This man doesn’t care about Veterans, he just care about being in the good side of his daddy.\nLove your comment and I agree with you totally.\nSo another Trump appointee toes the line and lies to their constituents. Veterans deserve better. You can’t fire 80,000 employees unexpected to conduct business as usual. The veterans will suffer as a result of your cowardice. Stop kissing the ring of a draft dodger and stand up for everyone who put their life on the line in defensive this country.\nWe live in an age where all we need do is see the other person as a liar, and they are, don’t you know, because we are God and we have spoken. Truth is, not what we say it is or judge it to be.\nYou should lay off some of them that are not doing their jobs. I’ve had a bad experience a time or two.\nYou’re not the only one. My experience has been so bad, I literally purchased my own private Healthcare insurance post op (neck surgery) so I don’t have to deal with the VA for anything. Jsmh, I am hopeful that Trump/Collins can fix this mess they call The Veterans Administration. I had a solid VA Doctor for 13 yrs, then it was 1 new doctor every year afterwards when Biden took over (I’m sure it was just happenstance). Then I get a new young doctor that just decides he’s no longer offering pain management. Imagine having a job where you can just decide not to do part of it and still keep your job and get paid the same. I won’t air everything out here, but I hung in there as long as I could. But when even the patient advocate is a joke, takes a week to call you back post op, you know it’s a losing battle. I’m out of the system for good unless I see proof that things are fixed. Firing 3 key people at my clinic would be an excellent start.\nLiar.\nHave you been drinking?\nThank you.\nThis is such a poorly done piece of disinformation and I did not find it humorous nor sincere. The felon called all of us veterans “suckers and losers”. We don’t believe you Doug but nice try. We know you are just aniother talking head for the felon.\nAgree with you Totally.\nThat’s been proven false many times\nNever happened so get over it.\nDuring my 20 years service, I personally cut $10s of millions of dollars of inefficiencies. Unlike your team, I had to clearly express the negative impacts. Without telling everyone the cons, you are doing nothing but gaslighting all of us that have served. I appreciate you saving our deficit, but at what cost?\nGIVE The Changes a CHANCE\nYou aren’t understanding what is going on. You can’t dismantled the government and build it back up in ANY TIMELY MANNER.\nOur enemies will catch us with our pants down.\nReally? If an organization cannot survive cutting some fat, we are doomed. They are not cutting DoD, we continue to be the most lethal Armed Forces on the planet.\nhow is cutting the VA workforce by 15% going to be a good change when the VA already has trouble serving vets with the staff they have . please take your political hat off and put your thinking one on.\nare you serious? We don’t have to give them a chance, the chance is being shoved down our throats.\nThe “changes” are gutting the government. It’s an excuse for Trump to raid the treasury. Don’t believe them; they’re bold faced lying to you.\nWould you like to sign up with not having your benefits or job for this “change”? Many vets had t fight to get the few benefits they have so you got to understand them not trusting anything to of change\nI suppose the firing of mental health workers, those doing research on chemical toxins, Burn pits, and various forms of cancer were also not mission critical. But please continue with the fast food analogies, your not fooling anybody.\nThe way to increase efficiency isn’t to arbitrarily cut positions and tell the remaining folks to figure it out. You first analyze and improve the process, then you look at what positions are no longer needed. This is such basic management I can’t believe musk is getting away with this. This administration clearly does not care about veterans. And that seems like a very dangerous group to piss off.\nDO YOUR JOB FOR THE VETERAN NOT FOR TRUMP MUSK OR DODG\nThis is the catch: benefits are going to be paid. What he isn’t saying is that disability ratings are going to be up for revision and it will be harder to receive one. That’s a card repubs have wanted to play for a long time. Remember, vets had to march on Washington to get the PACT act signed. In fact, the new wave of firings will directly target the workers hired to implement the PACT act.\nI’m watching this video after finding out about active duty military families not receiving food assistance. I think we all need to be paying more attention to happening at the front!\nI don’t believe a word you say, Mister Secretary! You are nothing but a puppet of two men who didn’t serve one day in the military, Trump and Musk.\nScrew this sycophant. He is lying through teeth his like his cult leader. Do not believe a word coming out of his mouth.\nwhy do you have facts ???? I hate liberal veterans must have a desk job hahaha\nCrisis lines? Yes, no cuts. Customer service lines? no, massive cuts. Without customer service, how do we make appointments? Your nonsense doesn’t cut it.\nWhen it comes to scheduling appointments, you have the option to do it online at VA.gov. If you’re not computer savvy (like many), have a family member or friend help you. You must create an account at VA.gov and go from there.\nIf true, then why is my claim still under review since Oct 2024. This guy really needs to se the big picture. Why do Officers get approved in a couple of days not MONTHS?\nBe prepared to be denied and have to fight to re-apply. Normal operating procedure.\nKeep documenting your ailments. Keep going to appointments to show you need care.\nYa had me right up until the end. Then you brought Asshat into the story. Nope. That’s a hard “Bullshit!” for me.\nbecause it takes time dumb ass and you know this because your VSO told you that!! , im service connected 100% and it wasnt a walk in the park, my advice to you is dont push the button be patient.\nDon’t try to separate us by officer and enlisted. I’m an officer and it took me over 6 years to go from 10% to 60%. I’ve been at 60% for 4 years.\nI’m an officer. My claim was completed in 14 months.\nAlso, took me over 15 years to go from 50% to 60% and 10 more years to go from 60% to 80% (and that was for cancer.)\nDOUG THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VA SYSTEM EVERYTHING HAS WORKED FINE FOR YEARS TRUMP AND MUSK DODGE NEEDS TO STAY OUT OF IT GIVE HE WORKERS THEIR JOBS BACK WE NEED THEM I SUGGEST THAT YOU START BEING FOR THE VETERAN AND BIPARTISAN WE ALL SERVED TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY WE DESERVE ALL OUR BEFNEFITS AND I SUGGEST YOU USE THE VA SYSTEM TO TELL US ANYTHING NOT X OR SOCIAL MEDIA\nThe VA system is broke. I spend many hours a day helpng veterans wade through the system as well as finding them therapies anbd treatments that will work for them and not hinder them.\nAs a 100% diabled veteran myself who went through hell to get that I do not want any veteran have to go through what I did.\nWonderfully stated. As a grateful family member of a spouse with VA healthcare and DAV benefits, I can share that the VA has stood behind our needs every step of the way. I never doubted that the VA would reduce care and benefits but thrilled to see this article dispelling that rumor.\nI will spread the word.\nDo not spread this video. Secretary is literally lying. Use GOOGLE.\nVA cutting 80,000\nVA cutting suicide helpline\nEtc\nBravo and well said! Some unsophisticated people (here) are spreading lies because of their hatred for the current administration. The smart veterans will see right through the lies that have been told here and realize—the VA is here to help.\nOnly if he is not lying like his boss does repeatedly… The auto makers are all on board for tariffs BUT 24 hrs later he gave them an exemption since they obviously were not. So many lies, hard to find one to believe and this isn’t one of them.\nHe’s lying, Linda\nDon’t spread it. This is disinformation.\nDoug is lying to you. Benefits will be cut: healthcare, disability, and pensions. Time to organize.\nHe’s cutting tens of thousands of jobs, he’s a liar appointed by a convicted liar. He has confirmed that there’s going to be over 76k jobs cut and he wants to tell you that it won’t impact service because he doesn’t care, he just wants to get rich off of our suffering.\nYour own administration has leaked that you plan to cut 70,000-80,000 employees from the VA due to “restructuring”. The timelines for disability claims, education claims, and medical services are WOEFULLY slow even after the additional staff authorized by the PACT ACT and now you want to go back to 2019 levels when it was WORSE? Shame!\nThis is crazy what Donald Trump is doing to the VA. I have doctors and nurses that have been great with me. I have an amputated left leg and maybe the right leg in the near future. I don’t know if he’s planning to cut different programs, nurses or doctors. Either way he is messing with my life. He is one crazy and worthless president I have ever seen on my 73 years of life!\nDuring your confirmation hearing- you promised that you would notify Congress of any cuts. You lied then. You’re lying now. You’re just another politician lying to veterans. How can you say 80,000 people being cut won’t have an affect on veterans….. in my opinion, you’ll go down as the worst VA secretary and someone who backstabbed their own.\nThat was a nice speech. But I don’t believe anything republicans say. They are liars. This guy will do everything the White House tells him to do.\nIt wasn’t that great if a speech. It was full of falicies and he had marbles in his mouth. Couldn’t talk straight or be bothered to do a second take. Was he drinking?\nA lazy liar.\nVeterans are watching.\nThe liars are the idiot democrats! Biden and clan f*cked everything up!\nCan’t believe a word you are saying. Trump despises veterans and he is showing his true self. Maybe he can give a Freedom Medal to all of his flunkys\nread what u wrote, comprehend it! then look up VP JD Vance service. Then go to store and purchase your clown makeup. the end!\nI mean he’s claiming that the layoffs of up to 76,000 employees will not affect veteran healthcare + that is mind-bogglingly false or at the very least insanely naive of him to say.\nI mean it was definitely shown that at least a few people who worked on the veterans crisis line were laid off and then were later extended offers to be rehired because they realized. Oh no, we’re firing these people that we shouldn’t be.\nI’m sorry but when you lay off 76,000 personnel some services are going to be affected. So don’t try to lie to us and tell us that veterans healthcare services are going to be absolutely fine.\nYour so full of shit I wish they would fire your ass to Mr Collins\nI’m not getting the assistance I need with my dental.it’s been over 5 years and nothing is happening. I am all tired out\nMy claim has been in stage 5 for about a month what’s going on\nIt sits on the bottom of the pile on some ones desk who isn’t there\nLying criminal and terrorist\ni tried for years also. I had to personally go and have surgery to have implants put in. I hope I can get help with the surgery costs but I was out of teeth and options. Not the answer you wanted im sure but you gotta do whats best for you\nIf you’re 100 percent disabled, you do qualify for dental at no additional cost.\nTrump administration plans to cut 80,000 employees from Veterans Affairs, But keep telling us Veterans won’t be impacted. We don’t believe you.\nRight? They specifically said the VA would not be touched yet here we are. And this clown is trying to gaslight us into thinking cutting 80k people will somehow make things more efficient. But to be fair; the Trump fans fall for so many lies.\nTrump is just cleaning house,waste and abuse of our system for us veterans. The VA hospitals in cleaning out.\nEnough with people like you spewing that nonsense. There has been zero fraud found. You need to stop watching Faux News and listening to Joe Rogan.\nEducate yourself before posting lies.\nNo. Trump is a traitor that is dismantling our Country and OUR government. Trump cant build businesses, he destroys them.\nDo you not remember the movie Red Dawn? Do you not understand that Putin is one of our WORST ENEMIES? Are you too young to remember the World Wars?\nExactly! There is a lot of waste and fraud happening. Cut the fat from the pork, and you’ll have a healthier meal.\nDon’t believe the lies!\nTo Jose,\nI hope what you are writing is sarcasm, if it isn’t????????\nWrong, there has been no time or effort put into identifying waste and abuse. This is arbitrary demolition. This is a quack doctor amputating your leg to help you lose weight.\nTrump has prevented the on boarding of nurses that were needed in the VA I work at. We were already sort staffed and now we can’t even bring on the new hires. They are forcing people that have worked nights for over ten years to take turns working days. This will not end well. Thanks for the hiring freeze don the con. (sarcasm inserted)\nHow do you know this?\nI dont know about you but VA has been absolutely terrible always! Lets not act like becasue we have “said” number of people working somewhere it makes the place function better. This is where all who are complaining about layoffs are completely lost. You can layoff those who arent the best at what they do and still have way better service. You can cut out of office jobs if someone who agrees to come into the office can do and better. Stop focusing on the “Veteran” aspect and focus on efficiency for the Veterans because thats what we all want. We are tired of waiting 3-4 months to see someone, and so on. The VA has been broke for decades and to act like its just happening is a complete lie.\nYou’re going to cut 83,000 VA employees. Shame on you.\nWe All Know VA Not hurting Loosing Employees doing NOTHING\nUnfortunately, the firings are indiscriminate. They’re just cutting folks without evaluating what they do or the level of their performance. If they were performance-based firings, I’d be in agreement, let ’em go but DOGE is just cutting based on the number of employees they want to see gone.\n70,000 more VA employees to be terminated? That is what the News outlets said this morning. How can that not affect our care. I was concerned about losing 2,500. Can you explain what’s happening? I have a claim pending for about 10 months now. I have surgery scheduled. Is it true that 70,000 more will be fired?\n80,000 . As soon as he praised Trump I knew it was a lie, there would be more and it’s the usual smoke & mirrors.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/veterans-affairs-cuts-doge-musk-trump-f587a6bc3db6a460e9c357592e165712?fbclid=IwY2xjawI1qfBleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHYF7s9VfPMykLt3LyeYC4Rs0ykJPd1ZUhsuomvDVe_QI6EFuDU34SojhOg_aem_B7DgTyOt92dW2bjcCXFrpg\nI read the article, and yes, 80,000 jobs; however, of the 80,000, how many are ready to retire? How many perform a duplicate job?\nWhen are you going to learn that news outlets are unreliable.\nAll Veterans deserve good quality health care in return for their commitment to protecting the United States. All health care workers and the services and supplies needed for their care should be encouraged and protected. Intimidation, harassment and removal of Federal health care workers is not productive. Many VA health care workers are suffering and as a result Veteran care will suffer. Is this your intention?\nYes we shgould but all it takes to be denied is an opinion of one VA doctor. AS of now I am fighting a VAMC tooth and nail to get veterans a prcedure the VA approved back in 2023, but since it is not Medicare approved even though 40000 people have received it with 82% positive results my VAMC denies everyone because of one doctor.\nI received it a few months ago on my own dime and it works. After 25 years of suffering chronic back pain, I no longer suffer that anymore. I no longer have siatica or any nerve pain down my legs and feet and no longer have a constant pain number of 8.\nMost of our central supply staff have been let go. Our fee-basis physicians have been let go. None of our open position for “mission critical” employees are not being filled. Care IS being impacted. And anyone with Google knows that you DID lay off Crisis Line staff.\nYou laid off most of our supply room staff, laid off our fee basis physicians, and aren’t backfilling any of the “mission critical” positions when people leave due to destroyed morale. Care IS suffering. Oh, and you absolutely laid off Veteran’s Crisis Line personnel as anyone with Google can verify…\nAnd if you rely on Google, you’re an idiot!\nSo are the people that rely on Fox News.\nJim. This person is talking from working there…… not just Google.\nI went to my VA hospital today and asked around and yes their workloads and jobs are being negatively affected in a very big way.\nIf you rely on the word of a guy put in by a liar, you’re a rube. This guy doesn’t give a shit about us, Trump has openly mocked veterans repeatedly.\nI know people who have been fired, Jim. Feel free to share a source contradicting that if you have one. Instead of just attacking another member ad hominem.\nMy husband is 100% and just had a Mini stroke. Taken to hospital by ambulance keep two days and told immediately to go to vascular surgery. The hospital scheduled him 3/3/25, now 3/10/25 because we have been shuffled around for community care. Please send help Marine need someone to help immediately.\nLolololol. You actually think anyone that likes Trump cares about us? Yikes!\nThey classified Surgical Nurses as non essential, and fired them. Stand up to this Administration, or get out of the way for someone who will.\nSource, please?\nWhose they?\nhttps://nurse.org/news/va-fires-nurses-doctors-trump-federal-cuts/\nTo whom it may concern:\nI wrote several emails to the Secretary of VA since he stepped into office.\nThe first one I got a email later stating it would be passed on the office\nof client relations February 6th 2025. February 13th 2025 I got this really\nlame letter mailed to me in a near comical cardboard envelope from a\nDr Patricia Hastings of Health Outcome Military Exposures.\nThis was a short insulting 2 pages of material chopped together from\nGoogle snippets. As if I was too stupid to understand what Im writing\nabout. It was meant to drive me off. Sec of VA Doug Collins must have\nsigned off on this. Which means he endorsed this letter.\nIf this is true, we have a true coward here who does not plan to back\nanyone. He is here to cut budget, cut benefits, cut employees, cut bait,\nand think dismantle is enough. That he has no ideas of his own and\ndoes not respect that of others beneath his position and rank. In essence,\ni need to be wealthy and prove I dont need him to get his interest.\nThis post went out on LinkedIn which got a real big reaction. As people\nread the letter they saw for themselves what VA has in store for all of us\nnot hiding at the top floors in 810 Vermont street. Except there are high\nprofile folks including upper VA executive staff that got my letter at LinkedIn.\nThey kind of get the writing on the walls. No one is safe, not even them.\nLinkedIn shows me when they come to my profile and what they look up.\nPeople, you keep ignoring my remarks here about organizing. VA does not\nfear you as individuals venting here. 10 of you saying the same thing in\nunison is very different. 100 of you asking the very same thing would be\nvery spooky to VA. The biggest thing that would help all of you is a open\ndoor policy at VA where they cant turn you away. You show up at the front\ndoors they have to talk to you, they dont now.\nBetween the 4 Sec of VA video post the moderators have censored about\nhalf of what I sent in. Especially if it was the same thing between all 4. Im\nnot using profanity, vulgar topics, religious or political remarks, or anything\nnear as offensive as what I have been seeing posted in here. So Im being\nblack balled on any unification post or links to anything Im doing.\nWriting here is one thing, but standing alone isnt helping any of you. With\nover 2,000 comments on the first video post – that was the time to rally on\ncertain points. By the 4th they have been censoring much more heavily.\nIn fact, they were deleting remarks over the weekend.\nDeployment Health is the enemy here. They are trying to manipulate the\nSec of VA to reinstate old prejudices and outright lies to keep us in check.\n2 months from now he will shut us out and probably kill public comments\nas unproductive. Then you really wont have any access to executive staff.\nI was one of the first folks through in February 6th, and VA said “Insult and\ndrive Mr Love off – too bad so sad”. That means this is universal. Only certain\npeople are allowed to speak within VA, and its only the in crowd. That some\nof us are more equal than others.\nDemand equality, and demand open door policy. These are public servants,\nnot a private mens club or golf course of the wealthy. Stop turning us away\nat the door as if we were illegal immigrants or carpet baggers.\nThank you for your detailed response to this ridiculous propaganda. You make a very good point about doing more than venting on a forum and organizing. Do you have any recommendations for veterans who are looking to use their voice for more ? I am part of the local events in Virginia but sadly many of the veterans around here still think Trump and his team of sycophants are doing a good job all well our rights and benefits are slowly being eroded from under us.\nYou say that 300,000 employees were kept and were These surgeons and their critical support personnel along with the custodial staff needed to maintain cleanliness? Why have the wait times for surgical procedures been delayed then?\nTo Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while stationed in Udorn Thailand in 1974, due to my exposure I developed Chronic lymphoma leukemia, which was listed as a presumptive condition. The VA just dropped my Leukemia disability rating from 100% to 0%, at 74 my Anxiety went through the roof….Im still in shock\nI am a Vietnam vet, 73 with diabetes and a presumptive of AO. I was rated at 20% for this and currently overall 90%.\nI know with any ailment that you are rated for, you will get VA health care and be treated for that ailment.\nSome people get better and others are stable or get worse.\nIf you are indeed rated 100% for just that one ailment, it must be very severe.\nSo please, if you can share the rest of your claim as to why you were reduced to 0%. You must have gone into remission and have a clean bill of health. You still have your ailment, however it has gone silent. They will keep you at 0% and can be increased if the ailment becomes worse.\nThe VA doesn’t just reduce your benefits for no reason.\nWas your anxiety because you all of a sudden lost almost $5k a month or that you feel you will no longer be treated?\nI’m so sorry you are having to deal with this change. I hope it is some clerical mistake that is easily rectified. If not, the bureaucracy will be difficult as you maneuver through the steps as I’m sure you know. Keep going forward, your claim is valid and your compensation should return. That said, my belief that our government is functioning in good faith is non-existent.\nPlease reach out to someone to talk to keep your mental health balanced through this journey. You are a worthy, valuable person. I hope you are able to go from 0 to 100 quickly!\nyour lying\nsounds like a clear unmistakeble error on the VA’s part. DId they send a letter telling you why? Go see your VSO immediatrely to remedy this problem. Your 100% rating should have been protected.\nIf the VA cuts benefits then no one will sign up for the military. Elon’s children can go to dangerous foreign lands to fight for the US.\nYeah right- when have the rich ever done anything in service to their country.\nTrumps klan has been voting against their best interest since 2016. This will change nothing in their eyes.\nOn Trumps first term he started community care. It saved me from traveling 60 miles to get treatment.\nOrdinarily I would relay on the VA for accurate information, but since their current director was appointed by a pathological liar who demands total loyalty from his subordinates, I can not trust anything he says. I place my trust in professional journalist who still have integrity.\nIf what you say is true why was my appointment for Feb. 27 cancelled due to the VA not doing the paperwork? W hen I called the 28th I got a recording saying I have no appointments, even though the appointment was moved the 11 of March on the 26th? I get a real person at the hotline number but only recordings at all other numbers.\nFrom a family of veterans I am astonished by the possibility that veterans’ care is on the table for federal government cuts. Please keep us posted about any changes so we can make appropriate adjustments based on our needs, Mr. Collins.\nAlso be generous enough in understanding that in many cases, veterans become vulnerable the more they age, in many cases, as a result of stress on the heart.\nWe wish you success with steering our massive Veterans Affairs ship.\nDon’t believe what he says. The guy’s a sycophant and a liar. He’s gaslighting everyone. Expect to see our benefits go away: healthcare, disability, and pensions. Trump and their criminal gang are raiding our Treasury to give $4.5T to their rich friends and the VA is on the chopping block.\nYou where doing fine until you sucked Trumps dick at the end.\nHow is this comment approved?\nI am very concerned to read about the proposed cuts to veteran’s programs and how the recent probationary employee terminations and suggested mass layoffs are going to negatively impact the care my husband receives. Is there an actual business need to support these broad cuts or is this just being done because of a DOGE whim?\nI hope the VA has not allowed the same amount of personnel to stay at home VA care has suffered After COVID allowed many to remain at home and veterans suffered.\nI worked for the VA and proud to do it, now am on the other side looking in and was an inpatient shocked at the care\nMany of us looked forward to surveys but the inspectors were lead and supervised by upper admin and certain pts were excluded for any measure to conceal the truth.\nSo Sir,\nIf you are saving money elsewhere to redirect back to actual veterans’ services, why does VA/VHA/VBA contract with an entity that has committed HIPPA violations and Fraud by billing the veteran for services/equipment that was provided to a 100% schedular Veteran who is P&T? Note the entity has been cited 3 times for violations of HIPPA Privacy and security Rule, 2 times VA was party to the settlement…. This is the same enmity that used Overseas contractors to evaluate Patient data that was used to create patient reports and billing information.\nWhy does your Privacy Office, OIG and Contracting Office continue to ignore the information and not engage with the reporter?\nNote I do have delivery and read receipts to substantiate that I provided this information to the Department (all the way from the local facility up to the National Level. (Lebanon VAMC up to Central Office). Additionally I am in possession of an email from your Central Office Privacy Officer stating they were not going to investigate?\nI get it you have only been in Office a short time, however this has been before the proper VA/VHA/VBA Officials since at least December 2024, with no action.\nDoug,\nIf you want to make a huge difference in the quality and efficiency of care provided by the VA here are 2 suggestions:\n1. Looking at the posted patient per day stats for Primary care they see 12-14 patients per day (my pcp sees between 10-12 and complains he is over worked) This is glacier like compared to the “dreaded Private Sector” where PCP’s see 31 patients per day. If expectation was raised to 21 patients per day (or 2/3 of the expectation of their peers in private practice” the back log and quality of care as well as job satisfaction will increase dramatically. These folks are not challenged with high expectations, and the result in many cases is apathy, and it shows in the overall care provided. Efficiencies can be driven by using pre appointment questionnaires to cut down the interaction time and get to the meat of the problem rather than using the exam room time to cover the same info.\n2. Increase the operating hours from 0800-1600 to 0700-1900. This way more patients can be seen at hours that are convenient to the patients, rather than the patients having to bend to the convenience of the providers and staff. I find more often than not that if I need a quick appointment I’m referred to the community. That is just passing the buck, letting a low expectation to continue to fester, only to let someone else clean up for their lack of enthusiasm for their work.\nI just called in to my local CBOC to be seen for a severe respiratory infection, was told I will need to go to a local urgent care because my PCP is booked solid. I asked how many patients he sees a day, and it’s 10-12. I could imagine that the stress of seeing just one more patient would send him over the edge. It would ruin his exceptionally low productivity history, and force him to work at a razor thin higher level of output to meet the new record smashing unsustainable quota he has created for himself.\nThese folks want and need to be excited and challenged with higher levels of care and productivity than they ever dreamed possible. They have no call, no rounds, yet their output is half that of their peers who the VA benchmarks themselves against in their outcomes reporting.\nI have full confidence in your willingness and ability to create a patient centered healthcare system that serves at the pleasere and convenience of the veterans and not the other way around.\nScott, I want to share my experience as a member of Veterans For Peace (VFP), where a group of us actively opposed the outsourcing of veteran healthcare under what was known as the Mission Act back in the summer of 2022. We were joined in this important effort by the Nurses Union of California and the Veterans Health Policy Institute (https://veteranspolicy.org/). I sincerely encourage you to take some time to visit VHPI’s website and learn about their impactful work. Although I’m not affiliated with them, I deeply respect their dedication and commendable efforts in this field.\nThe only services that should be outsourced is where the facility does not have staff to be able to accommodate veterans…oh wait I see what they’re doing. /s\nOut sourcing is a way to give veterans care that the VA can’t provide. I have used CC for a few of my operations due to no VA doctor could perform what I needed so I was sent to the best surgeons in my area.\nPrivate sector have to see 25-30 patient per day to break even on their overhead and expenses. Another point is that in the private sector the appointment slots are 10 min block. At the VA the appointment slots are 30 minutes for primary care and a hour for a new patient. In all my considerable experience as a nurse I can tell you NO PRIVATE PROVIDER will willingly spend 30 minutes let alone 60 minutes with a patient they can not make money doing that. Each slot on their schedule is a paycheck to them not a patient.\nI read these comments, and many appear to be written by trash-talking Trump haters.\nABOUT TIME! What about these drive thru civilian medical disability checkers that the VA sends us to. I have had some that were good (1 or 2) but most don’t have a clue what they are looking for. Example here3 in the Dallas area for my hearing loss. Two female attendants, one asked the other, “what are we to do? the other gal I think we are to check his ears. Here, take this light and look into his ears.” After that she told me OK you are good to go. I have also at different times aske me what am I here for.\nThat is absolutely not true! Sen. Duckworth had to force you to reinstate workers who had been fired from the Veterans Crisis Line. When you do not speak the truth, Mr. Secretary, you undercut the confidence that people have in the VA.\nWell, he is a Trump supporter, so we should all not be surprised he’s a professional liar.\nUnfortunately, we will see more videos of this nature from this clown.\nRead this story at the link included, and think about the video Mr. Collins posted. https://www.military.com/daily-news/opinions/2025/02/21/speak-va-health-care-gutted.html Does it seem like we are being told the truth Mr. Collins?\nsure am glad a politician told me. so trustworthy. not disgusting humans at all.\nall politicians and filthy rich people gross me out. they go to bed at night knowing what they are. we make them richer in these wars they are too weak to fight themselves and then they are gross enough to lie and roadblock our benefits.\nPlease look into how long it is taking to get disabilities approved. I feel the phone service is very helpful. Those that take our calls. Very caring. Thank you\nWhy does it take an average of 6 months to 3 years to answer a claim for compensation.\nMr Secretary of Veterans affairs,,urgent.\nMy husband died on December 28,2024,\nI’m filing for my benefits, when I called I spoke to a woman a while ago that the veterans money is his and the spouse I really nothing,\nI told my husband what she said, just to explain is my husband died after 53 years of marriage, his income was\nPension 844.12, compensation was 4,638,12 the finance department to all money back for December and January 2025 well that closed my account the military said I had to pay back 7,147.84 so they put a hold on my account, I have been trying to get things settled,they too too much money my account hold till I pay this money, then I was told I will recieved 2004.00 monthly that puts a hole I will now loose my house. My husband has been sick a long time since 2014, he was granted his compensation.

Your not being truthful.\nI am a 100% disabled Vietnam Veteran and have lost my kidney function due to agent orange. I am going to dialysis weekly and the VA provides me with transportation, however the transport company is almost always late (over a hour). I have complained to the company and the VA however it has not helped.\nThe VA said they only had “one” transport company. They charge hundreds of dollars per trip!\nI had my wife take me and asked for travel pay and they gave me $ 1.44 cents.\nI think someone should investigate this as to me the whole situation stinks to high heaven!!\nJust follow the money?\nI don’t believe him. The actions of this administration demonstrate their willingness to screw veterans along with everyone except their rich friends.\nYou clowns will end up cutting benefits and these dips*** veteran wet blanket maga idiots will end up thanking him and asking for more. You all get what you voted for. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nYou’re spot on. But us Vets that actually have a brain and saw that clown for what he is, is in a world of hurt.\nDip…sh…its really thought Trump and co had our best interest at heart which is mind boggling,\nStaff reduction will take us back to the old VA where it takes months to get critical care and people die waiting to be seen (not hyperbole…this happened). I hope it’s not time to camp on the Whitehouse lawn again (The Bonus Army – 1932).\nQuestion for you Mr. Collins.\nDO you support the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025’s framework for restructuring, reducing and taking benefits and disability ratings from the veteran community ? Please answer this question.\nHe’s lying, of course. My sister in law just retired as a VA nurse and Collins didn’t replace her. That means the remaining four nurses will have to do the work of five. Only the veterans will suffer with longer wait times for care\nPlease post a detailed listing of all 2400 hundred positions that are now vacant. List location and job description and where that job is now being done.\nI have searched all day for Doug Collin’s email address and have been unsuccessful. I called the Caregiver Support Line and that lady didn’t even know who Doug Collins was to her! She tried to help and ended up giving me the 1-800 number but the person on that end could not find it either? My dad applied for Aid and Attendance a year ago and still has not gotten approved. He sitting at Stage 3. He and my 96 year old mom have NO MONEY left to cover their assisted living. They need this money ASAP. She has cognitive disabilities and doesn’t need to leave. Use them as an example that benefits are not being cut and show America we care for the elderly before it’s too late.\nProject 2025 is very specific when it comes to their intentions when it comes to veterans healthcare and benefits. They want to change it to where you can only access VA healthcare if you have a service connected disability. If you’ve ever been to a VA hospital youve seen the elderly vets that would have no place affordable to go with these intended cuts. They want to end paying veterans unemployability at age 67 because they’re at full retirement age, and just pay the estimated rating. Most vets have been on SSDI while fighting their cases and will never receive more than half of what their checks would have been if they made it to full retirement age. This is ridiculous as these people have mortgages reliant on their disability payments, many who like in my case were granted these benefits by a military judge. They want to go through the files of veterans one by one and see how many people they feel justified for whatever reason, in cutting their benefits. Finally they want to revise the guidelines for military disability and make it where a veteran can only collect if they meet certain definitions of what constitutes a service connected disability.\nThank you Sir for that cut to the chase message.\nThe Pensacola VA Clinic is 146-150% over capacity. The main VA hospital is in Biloxi Ms. Which coordinates the CCN process which is slow and ineffective in the experiences I’ve had as a priority 1 vet with service connected injuries. I realize building new facilities is expensive. With that said Baptist Hospital has moved to a new location and local officials are trying to determine what to do with Baptist hospitals older buildings. The past administration seemed to let things be with VA facilities and/ to make cuts and funnel those funds elsewhere.\nCan you please say what iCARE stand los for ?\nFirst and foremost, if we are going to reduce waste let’s start with how claims are inadequately processed.\nMultiple unnecessary C&P exams, mishandling of VA claims that create a great deal of redundancy.\nWhy are we paying people with no medical background whatsoever to evaluate or rate VA claims?\nEven making decisions that conflict with Civilian Physicians, truly madness.\nI’m all for Community Providers, but integrating communication so lab results, referrals, and appointments has a long way to go.\nDon’t then turn around and making a VA claim decision that is in contradiction to the community providers contracted with VA.\nSecretary Collins in making the online computer system\n( the Health Medical Record System ) a top priority. This is the how the communication between Providers (VA and Community Providers) actually works. I have a lot of confidence in him. He’s a “ good, honest public servant. Please, give him a chance….\nAhahahahahahahahahah oh my! Dense!\nThank you…great points.\nYou sir, are doing a disservice to your employees to have the backs of the wrong people.\nRemote work has been effective for the VA since it has been able to provide essential care to veterans by stoping the lease of unnecessary buildings and all the expenses that come with it. If you really care about the veterans you will save the money used in office spaces and put it into the clinics.\nSome of the people working remote are staff that work for the employees HR comes to mind, some others are mental health providers, nurses, crisis line , etc. but you are making Musk happy and that is all that matters. Also, the Veterans can chose where they want to go, they are not forced to go to the VA. If you or somebody you know ever need a pacemaker, thank the VA but I’m sure you already know this.\nThat office space has been there the whole time. They didn’t give up leases. DOGE is getting rid of waste. There have been employees working from home and not being productive. My dad has been waiting a year for Aid and Attendance to be approved. It has been sitting at a 3 for months. The VA has had what they have needed for months. I need an employee to approve his Aid and Attendance before he gets kicked out of assisted living for no money.\nThe VA hospitals all need to close they don’t help us Vetrans what so ever .It would be best for us to get proper medical care on the outside do away with the VA hospitals and the wasteful spending that goes on there its a big money grab .There is no dental for us there its there but only to those who fought in Vietnam ,lol good luck getting help even if Ur suffering ..I think a Veteran should be able to go anywhere to get help we fought for our Country and deserve to make our own choices . thank u\nTotally agree..\nSpent 21 years in the Army. My daughter works for the VA because she honored what i did for a living. If she gets fired because of DOGE cuts, I’ll never vote again! The donkeys failed me, and although its a different path, it looks like the elephants are headed in the same direction…\nDid you ever think that maybe her job wasn’t necessary? Maybe she will be okay, but this is all about saving money. Just because people work for the government doesn’t mean they don’t have to be accountable, productive, and necessary. Always vote! You served to protect that right.\nImagine thinking that a political party centered around cutting taxes for billionaires would help you . When it was dems and independents getting the cares act, it was a dem congress that gave back to back the two biggest increase in financial benefits. But keep licking the boots of billionaires maybe you will get a scrap\nIt’s almost like the elephants drove you to hate the donkey’s, so they could set this all up to take everything and leave us with nothing but crumbs to fight over.\nA week ago this site had 162 comments\n[Editor: There are almost 2,000 comments on the other, similar video.]\nWhere is the 98 million being redirected to?\nVA serves approximately 9 million enrolled veterans annually. What about those of us that are not enrolled? I was categorized a priority 8 and was told I would never be accepted into the VA system even though I am a retired veteran.\nI also do not understand how you can retire from the service and a disability. If you serve 20 to 30 years and retire and now you have a disability – sleep apnea?\nMr Secretary , I pray that the Veterans will come first again and believe that President Trump knew what he was doing by putting you in this position!!! My main concern is our Spinal Cord Veterans in north Florida has had their SCI Clinic Closed at the Lake City VA so the over 100 veterans has to commute an extra 1 and a half hours to Gainesville VA . These our more vulnerable veterans that have very specific needs that is why it was so surprising that this decision was made. This clinic had been operating there for the last 10 years because of the identified critical need.\nWow! I can easily tell that many of the comments on this site are not from the Disabled Veterans they claim to be. These are political hacks, trying to stir up a bunch of false information and rumors. Be smart and research and verify for yourself. Things take time to happen, this administration has not been in office even a full month yet. So all these horror stories about what’s being taken away must come from the past administration. I’ve read, verified and triple checked, The President or anyone in his administration has no intention of cutting or taking away any benefits whatsoever. Just think of the past 4 years, doesn’t this game seem familiar? This is what politics does, unfortunately it’s a filthy, dog eat dog backstabbing and exaggerated, overly dramatic stunt to discredit the current President. We’ve been watching it over and over the last 4 years.\nThank-you, Thank-you, Thank-you! For all you do at the VA…and for us Veterans. I never believe rumors and I have the utmost confidence in this new Administration to par-down and get it right…especially redirect any misdirected funds AWAY from any illegals and bring them back to Veterans. I am so glad you are not wasting any more money on DEI. It IS divisive! Thank-you for focusing on what is important.\nI am from W Central MN and use the Fargo VAMC and Fergus Falls Clinic. We desperately need a new Doctor and Mental Health practitioner in Fergus Falls hired, and I know it will happen someday soon. This is God’s Country. You will find good people for those positions who WANT to work for the VA and live here. I love the Fargo VA, it’s top-notch. Excellent. When they can’t provide what I need, I am so appreciative of my Community Care providers. Thanks again, Diane, US Army, Vietnam era\nAgree. I have nothing but good to say about the VAMC in Fargo, ND. I have been so blessed with excellent care and follow-up.\nMa’am with all due respect if you’re going to make comments like this please leave your full name like many of the disabled veterans worried about their healthcare. Many knowing full well what understaffed VA hospitals are like to deal with. So please either identify yourself if you’re going to put accusations like this out or simply shrink away like the political troll that you are.\nThe VA services are shit in lots of places, Debbie & Diane, including where I get service in the Inland Empire (California). The only good exception is Loma Linda, and I think that is mostly because they’re a religious organization that mandates all service providers to live out those values of compassion and love at work. All the other VA hospitals in the area have extremely long wait times and too many high-risk veterans here have died waiting for medical, mental health, and housing services to become available.\nSo maybe pull your head out of the sand there Debbie, and see what’s really happening, instead of accusing other veterans and military families who deserve services just as much as you of being “political agitators?”\nUsually, the simplest explanation is the correct one, and the most simple explanation of what is happening right now is that it is a purposeful campaign by a power-hungry President to break and then privatize all public services, so he can enrich himself and his billionaire friends.\nSir, how can you tell us that VA benefits wont be cut, but in Senate they don’t seem to be supporting Veterans. Please review this: https://youtu.be/31VjDt-4CxE?si=fR7TW0g8cBLVeTU2 VA Benefits are truly on the table for reductions and is real. Congress is a mess; they can hardly make a compromise on anything and are kind of a political embarrassment. I saw your video stating that there’s no cuts happening, but the Senate voted against protecting Veterans benefits says differently. The budget seems to be taking presentence over people. I believe you believe in what you said in your recent video but seems the reality maybe different. Its already an almost insurmountable task to get any meaningful ratings now with the VA but with the recent Govt cuts and how the new world will look seems that “yes” benefits are on the table for cuts. I already can’t retire at my age because I just can’t afford it, this will make me work right up to the day I take my last breath. Just wanted to drop a line and say thanks but not sure your assessment is correct about reductions. Doesn’t seem like anyone is standing up for us.\nPlease don’t mess with Sanford Maine VET center.\nAs an 83 y/o vietnam VET, it’s a well needed service…\nSec Collins\nI have followed you thru congress all the way to being Sec. I have a question. Is there a way for veterans to no pay any copays for their meds. When we are drawing SS and COL is so high we cannot afford the copays. They add up quick.\nThank you sir\nDanny Cole\nUSN\nThe Honorable Doug Collins\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\nWashington, D.C. 20420\nSubject: Request for Support on OPM and DOGE Directives Impacting VA Employees\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI hope you’re doing well.\nI’m writing to ask for your help with a growing issue affecting VA employees, including my wife, who serves as a Community Care Nurse in the Salt Lake VA system. She’s currently on maternity leave but recently received an email from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under Elon Musk’s leadership, asking her to justify her weekly work—despite being on leave. This has added a lot of stress during what should be a peaceful time focused on our newborn.\nThese emails are going out across agencies, pressuring dedicated workers and creating confusion. It’s especially disheartening to see VA employees, who serve our veterans with care and compassion, being caught in the middle of this.\nI fully support making the government more efficient, but there needs to be balance. People like my wife—who’ve given so much to our veterans—shouldn’t be facing this kind of pressure, especially while on maternity leave.\nI’m asking for your support to:\nAdvocate for VA employees and ensure that those on leave, like my wife, are protected from unnecessary stress and directives.\nPush back on overreach. Work to ensure that DOGE and OPM policies respect labor laws and consider the real-life impact on VA staff.\nStand up for our veterans’ caregivers. The people who care for our veterans deserve respect and fair treatment.\nI know you care deeply about our veterans and those serving them. Your voice on this issue could make a huge difference.\nThank you for your time and everything you do for our veterans and those who care for them.\nSincerely,\nDavid Jones MPAS, PA-C\nEverything\nWhat is being done with remote Community Care – Case Workers .\nThey need to be located at the VA facility so they are able to work with all the departments in the VA. Currently the C C case workers are not available for the veterans. If need to talk to your case worker assigned to your case – phone numbers nor emails are provided to the Veteran . I needed foot surgery and been waiting for over a YEAR. It seem that the supervisor over the community Care section at the Dallas Texas VA also manages the section remotely.\nI would welcome a call or some to assist with the leadership of the VA.\nMy phone number is, [REDACTED]\nI am calling on you Secretary Collins to stop doing mental gymnastics and be straight up with veterans. Less talk, more action. Words are meaningless unless acted upon. We don’t need word salad or gaslighting. Republicans (besides Rand Paul) all voted against open-ended funding for burn pit claims. As a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq and was exposed to burn pits, I find this appalling. Veterans need more funding and this “efficiency” you’re talking about are layoffs and reduced resources at the VA. Please don’t assume we are stupid. We are well read and political active.\nWhat is the VA doing about the lack of Medical Doctors in the country? Why does the VA make veterans utilize community hospitals instead of closing the ones that were in existence in communities? Why does a veteran who has been in the VA for many years have to struggle to get a covid test or treatment for a respiratory illness. Why keep clinics open if all they do is give out drugs, test for problems, and then not treat them? Does the VA only hire medical professionals who are veterans? WHo is speaking up in this coun try for Veterans Health care? Why are all of the resources at the VA going to those who are younger. Why doesn’t a 86 year old veteran matter anymore to the VA? Why isn’t there managed care for the older veterans in this country. Why does the VA only means test the poor vet and not the ones that are double dipping. Why is an older vet limited to only two visits a year when they have end stage kidney disease and are facing dialysis? why does. the federal government think it is all right to discriminate against veterans who can’t afford devices or know how to use them?\nThanks Mr. Doug Collins,\nSemper Fi\nDEI is not the problem, it is not affirmative action. All it means is to treat all with respect. Trump/musk/vance turned that into a bad word, but destroying the framework of our government to get ride of DEI is plane STUPID. So much so that it is a lie, a license to steal.\nThese people need to clearly state where we are going? I wonder?\nThere is plenty of FACTUAL INFORMATION out there. Be very careful which sites you choose to get information from. It sounds like you are a victim of those false info sites. Good luck.\nAnother no last name chastising a veteran that was willing to identify himself. Stand proud if you are going to regurgitate lies.\nYou do not understand what DEI or Affirmative Action is from your description.\nTrump does not care about veterans, us. Musk is in place because of trump, not in spite. See the truth, the billionaire class took over the federal government and they will try to change it to their advantage (even more) at our expense (the people). 20 year Navy retired veteran.\nThere is a lot of false info being spread about VA benefits. They are not true. President Trump and Elon Musk DO CARE VERY MUCH. No one is losing any benefits. Nothing is being cut. One must be very selective where they get their info from. As time will always tell, President Trump will always protect the Veterans, he has not so far turned out to be that destructive monster they said he would be on day one in office. I myself am a disabled veteran, I do tons of research and ask a lot of questions, I believe in verification of information. Please just relax and no worries, we are in good hands with This current administration.\nLol funny guy. I just saw a unicorn, they do not care about anybody. The people that care for the Veterans are being fired\nHey Steve. Get the boot out of your mouth. “i dO ToNs oF mY oWn rEsEaRcH” yea okay buddy. Reading Breitbart and waxing it to Fox and Friends while the brain worms in RFK Jr tell you not to trust 1000s of doctors isn’t doing your own research.\nYou’re a partisan hack. A frothing useful idiot of a clown who’s too stupid to realize how uninformed he is as he spreads his idiocy around.\nIf you hate veteran benefits so much, do us all a favor, find a bridge and don’t call the crisis line.\nLet’s see if “no one is losing any benefits” rings true in a couple of months. I suspect it won’t be but I’ll be happy to be proved wrong.\nWhat site are you getting your information from?\nI want to know if the rumor is true that I may lose my VA Disability payments. This would be extremely devastating for me as well as all other disabled veterans that rely on this payment as the only source of income.\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n810 Vermont Ave., NW\nWashington, DC 20420\n1-800-698-2411\n20250222\nMr. Secretary,\nI am writing to bring to your attention a pressing matter regarding a court case in Portage County, Ohio (Case Number: 2020CV00303). As a retired Staff Sergeant (SSG) with 10 years of active duty service, including multiple combat deployments, I am deeply concerned about the integrity of our justice system and potential violations of federal law.\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\n1. *Biased Court Rulings*: The court’s rulings have been completely biased, considering only Prerogative writ.\n2. *Attorney Withdrawal*: My attorney suddenly withdrew from the case without my request, violating Ohio Rule 1.16.\n3. *Lack of Evidence*: The plaintiff failed to provide evidence, relying on hearsay, changed/forged documents, and lies under oath.\n4. *Conflict of Interest*: The plaintiff has sold real estate to multiple individuals of high stature in Ravenna’s court district, and the clerk of court was the plaintiff’s attorney.\n5. *Fraudulent Removal*: The plaintiff has used her stature to persuade the court’s rulings, fraudulently removing me from my home’s deed and loan.\nI respectfully request that the Department of Justice investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that justice is served. I believe that a thorough investigation will reveal a pattern of corruption and fraud that has denied my son and I our civil rights.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\nSSG (Ret.) Christopher J. Wilcox\nThis video is BS and not to be believed in. He has shown no proof and wants you to take him at his word. He is a trump supporter and will say anything to keep his job. Sen. Cruz and Cornyn have voted down on an amendment ensuring full and uninterrupted funding for DVA Healthcare and benefits provided by SFC Heath Robinson Pact act. Look it up every one! Fact check please and you will see that American vets have been duped by yet another lie. We were promised to be taken care of by our nation for taking care of the constitution and all that it stands for. Please brothers and sister, make your voice heard and send message to your congressman in your district. Let us be listened and acknowledged as vets of this nation.\nPresident Trump and his administration haven’t even been in office a full month yet. You have to be selective on where you get your information from. Then double check it. That’s what I learned I had to do to get the truth. Take the wait and see approach, I guess that’s all you can do.\nHahaha another planted comment. You have NO HONOR\nWhy don’t you hold a vote and see how many veterans agree with you and Trump?.\nI did, it came out to 97% trust the current President, based on past and current promises fulfilled. 1% undecided, out of 1350 responders I believe his past and present record speaks for itself. Can’t deny that.\nFake news.\nSee how easy it is to deny it. Look at me, I’m the republican now. “Fake new fake news blahblah fakity fake, durrdurr, anythin I make up is true and anything I don’t believe is made up, alternative facts!”\n@Deb\n“97% trust…” Certainly. I trust that he will again assert fiction is fact, make decisions specifically intended to benefit the ultra rich, and display the behaviours of a petty bully.\n“…past and present record…” A petty, self-serving buffoon – past, present, and nearly guaranteed future.\nI’m happy you agree with me!\nI would like to know just where the 83,000 lost jobs are coming from, if it doesn’t impact veterans’ care. Sounds impossible, old “garsh darn” Collins. That old atta boy talk isn’t cutting it.\nSecretary Collins, perhaps you should tell Elon about the protections because he doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo. He posted this today (2/22/25) on Twitter:\n“Consistent with President Trump’s instructions all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.\nFailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\nThis doesn’t sound much like protection now, does it? Although it does sound an awful lot like a threat. And busywork. Not efficient. In fact, you might say it’s wasteful.\nYou invited us to ask you directly about these things rather than believing the “whoppers”. So, I’m asking you directly, doesn’t this conflict with your assurances that hundreds of thousands of VA employees are protected?\nTruth??? Or just more whoppers. The proof will be in coming days. I have doubts.\nThank You Mr. Collin’s for setting the record straight\nDear Doug Collin’s. Question. Are you going to let the Trump, fire more Employees. I’m Retired From the VA Long Bch, Ca. 33 yrs. Plus I’m a 100 percent P and T Army Vet. What’s happening with our GOVT, is a travesty. Plus for sure protecting our Benefits, is vital. What is being about this. Spec. Larry Boggs\nHow will you mitigate the resignations of remote employees who are now required, but unable to, report to an office? What is your plan to ensure that loss of employees does not negatively impact timely healthcare and timely award of benefits? Cutting veterans benefits doesn’t just mean reducing payments or healthcare benefits, it also includes rendering Veterans unable to access their entitled benefits. Explain to Veterans how this will directly improve services, and provide examples that Veterans can readily understand as they apply to their lives and benefits.\nWe can’t survive without that thanks for your time. I’m Elvira Thompson DOB 10-23-1938\nMr Secretary,\nYou seem sincere. But I would like to hear specifics from you about your support or refusal to support proposed changes to Veterans health and disability benefits as written in the proposed CBO budget report and supported by Russell Vought at OMB. It seems it will be a battle and hopefully you as Veterans Secretary will be able to override these cuts. I encourage you to support the ” Independent Budget of the Department of Veterans Affairs for Fiscal year 2026/2027″ recommendations by the VFW, DVA and PVA. Most veterans wholeheartedly support and trust these groups to protect them legislativly from the whims of congress who send us to war. But then in peacetime, try to bury us with double talk while trying to take away or deminish our veterans health and disability benefits during every budget cycle. The cost of war is high and veterans should not suffer. EVER.\nYou can be replaced in a heartbeat. Pucker up to President Musk.\nHow do I get a meeting I have evidence of billions in abuse currently going to veterans and nobody is talking about it while their stealing veterans funds while I’m a disabled veteran with a spinal cord entry TBI basic eggs for brains 52 out here living homeless with my family while they’re stealing the money money I’ve got tons of names documents I’ve been from state the state the city the city I need to get a meeting Secretary, Doug Collins\nVa can track my contact powers 0633 i’m not worried anybody’s gonna steal my homelessness, but there’s my last name and last four that’s how I feel. I’m trying but being blocked and I’m sure those 22 tried like me. Because one thing veterans know suck and for 22 a day to say their life is worse than military suck, we got a problem in America and we need the real number of homeless veterans and their families it will be the biggest number you ever seen. All who signed up for help got funding given to the NGOs under our last 4 but did not provide services in that veterans name and it’s in every state city church and school Va programs it is the most corrupted system and I’ve tried 5 congress members who backed me but still nothing. So I want a meeting for 60 seconds and I will expose it all. I steady what they did to us while In these programs and then ditched us for illegals. I’ve never asked for a handout for my 11 years of service or a home for my service connection or demanded the USA to care for my 18 years of suffering with tbi and spinal injuries or said take care of my family for my life sentence of never being a functioning human being, enjoying American life without pain. I always stood quietly in a corner not to ruin anyone’s photo of a busted up disabled veteran no will save that for our 1 day a year and free plate between hours of. See I’m not even up set to give my business anymore to retailers who give veterans a discount for being loyal nope 1 day a year. We need 3 d concrete house printers in every state and end ngo renting scam and end taxpayers footing the bill buy a buy back program for service connected and retired veterans through our Va checks no middle man needed and no taxpayer done homelessness over veterans ai it. It will blow your mind. We need a x town hall platform once a week by Doug Collin\nQuestion for you Burger Ming, wheres the efficiency in firing veteran employees, and reducing staff to provide care for patients? Where’s the efficiency in reducing patient care areas with displaced remote workers? Wheres the efficiency in reducing patient parking? Where’s the $98 million going if its not towards the mission? If this is a problem that can be solved with money whats your price to go away and let the veterans receive the care they deserve?\nI don’t believe this the VA is already taking my disability money and when someone tries to work with them it’s the runaround.\nThis could be cleared up very easily, if you would offer proof of your words. I am sorry that I do not just take you at your word, there is precedence for doubt.\nNoticed he didn’t say anything about protecting those ratings that are already in place. He just used a general term “benefits”. I wouldn’t put it past them to take away our compensation or lower it without reason\nYou are saying that the newsletter Military.com lies? https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/11/veterans-groups-keep-watch-va-disability-benefits-under-trump-administration.html\nListening to this guy makes me almost embarrassed to work here. It’s like a slimy used car salesman kicking the tires and saying “ain’t she a beaut?!” Thankfully I come to work to help Veterans and not because of this dirtbag bootlicker.\nThanks for the updated actual information.\nWith the present Adlof Dictator Bully Veteran insulting Trump in office anyone he hires is suspect. I will wait and see if Mr. Collins is the right man for the job. Anything that comes out of Trump’s sickening mouth is a lie so it is no wonder what we here from Washington is held with mistrust.\nThe previous admin did not do anything fore us, it stole from us, Trump has done more for us the Veteran than Biden period!!! Those people needed removed as there are many that refuse to work at the VA, and they are in the Administration side. Many of you just want to stir the pot, and cause problem, Let him address thing as he finds them out. Just because you hate Trump stop!!! The past Sec of VA was a royal jerk and didn’t care about us at all, he allowed money to get sent to help the Illegals taking funding away from us. Complain about issues within the VA. Mush has zero to do here except to find the fraud and misuse of funds. I have been dealing with the VA fore over 45 years and have seen way more at different facilities all across this country, some good, some bad, some horrible. Anyone ever hear how a Veteran got “LOST” in the stairwell at a VA facility only to be found dead 30 days later?? Anybody ask why some Veterans have taken their lives on the steps of VA facilities?? I am sure very few if any have, and that the problem!!!\nThere is no answer here about the long running remanded appeal backlog sitting at the BVA. 15 years, 4 BVA hearing and 4 BVA remands and now a remand from the CAVC, this is out of control, Neither Committees will address this issue, will you?? Your lawyers asked for the remand from the CAVC with the granting of EXPIDITED TREATMENT< will it get it?? Why the long delays?? Why the failures by the BVA, DROC and ROs?? This all needs investigated by you, the new Sec of VA!!! This backlog needs to stop!!!\nIt will be even longer now they are firing more people and those positions will not be filled. Sorry about this, he does not care about veterans, he cares about making his boss happy and himself.\nHere’s another proof Doug Collins just lied to veterans.\nThe Trump administration is about to cut Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Public and Indian Housing from 1,529 employees to 765 people (see https://apnews.com/article/doge-hud-trump-turner-affordable-housing-musk-0176c8539fa9b5959198c351c97b8652).\nThe Office of Public and Indian Housing administers the Housing and Urban Development Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, a rental assistance program for homeless veterans (see https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/vash).\nHow are homeless veterans getting better service when the people who can get them off the streets and into a rental are cut 50%?\nThey can’t.\nIf you aren’t contacting your senators and representative telling this to stop, you are going to see more homeless veterans not getting the help they deserve.\nWe expect our draft dodger to abandon us\nYour comments sound comforting, however, the closing of the acute center at Castle Point VA Hospital in Wappingers Falls NY is a mistake and contrary to your message. This is a very important facility and a critical service in our community. It is sorely needed by veterans in our area struggling with PTSD and anxiety. Please open it back up ASAP.\nThank You,d\nKevin,\nThis is terrible news. I’d encourage you to share your story with Common Defense, a veterans organization who is actively trying to combat these layoffs for the benefit of Veterans. The link to do so is below. Best of luck to you and yours.\nLorenzo\nhttps://commondefense.us/expose-doge?source=email-fundraising&emci=bb3bed75-d1f5-ef11-90cb-0022482a93b5&emdi=59c8cf5b-edf5-ef11-90cb-0022482a93b5&ceid=142730\nI just received a rejection letter my case has been going on for 21 years. I will file a new 10182 to the board. Someone needs to look into the Oakland Regional Office the worst office in the US.\nYes, it s, and has always been. However, the D.C. Regional Office runs a close second\n1,000 VA employees have been fired. The VA has not been transparent about where those firings took place. There are multiple reports online that the VCL had a hiring spree to fill critical positions in the last year—and those probationary employees have all been now fired. Senator Duckworth has spoken to two of them. Critical VHA contracts are being cancelled, further affecting services to Veterans.\nSecretary Collins can easily prove his claims by providing the positions of the 1,000 people that were terminated.\nAs a retired and disabled Navy Chaplain who served both Navy and Marine units, I deeply appreciate Secretary Collins’ forward-facing, come-ask-me attitude and videos. I believe him and appreciate the work he and the entire VA Administration is doing on behalf of veterans. I believe Secretary Collins is a man we can trust and that by going on video to disclaim these horrible, fear-inducing rumors, he has assumed the role of “Rumor Control.” I’m grateful he is doing this.\nOf course the chaplain believes a bunch of lies. No surprise there.\n“The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command…”\nOf course Collins wants you to get your information directly from him. Only consume the propaganda, don’t trust the news, only trust the party. And here you all, gobbling it up like good little brown shirts.\n98 million saved? The VA’s yearly budget is 396 billion. So you saved 0.02% of our yearly budget. Yes it definitely is “like a whooper with no tomato” because it’s a ‘whopper’ without and substance.\nAs for veterans not being impacted… People in these protected positions are choosing to leave rather than have such a tumultuous job experience and a lot of those protected positions are now in the return to office order. This order will obviously cause people to quit. Then the cherry on top… or maybe the tomato on the whopper? Our hiring is effectively frozen. We are running short on staff. Lastly, why do you keep saying so confidently that veterans benefits aren’t going to be impacted? Let’s put aside that this 0.02% savings will obviously impact care. We don’t what funding will be like. Congress decides that. They are looking at cutting millions. We have no idea from what at this point\nCan you please return the post 911 GI Bill that was cancelled orcexpired since it was not used after 15 years.\nThere were others whose post 911 GI Bill that did not expire\nThank you\nWe need the VA Sectary Collins to have an open door policy and to correct the complaint system nationwide.\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\nThis is what I posted here 17 hours ago that didnt go out:\nYour not responding to veterans. Your dictating to them. Telling us\nnot to worry while we can’t see anything from the outside of VA.\nYour last video had 1,490 public comments last I checked. That is\nmassive for News.va.gov. But, it also all over the map. I posted 3\ncomments myself. Long term concerns as a advocate for Gulf War\nvets that has watched continual degeneration since 2012. Only,\npublic comments also represents how one sided this is. This is the\nbest we can hope for?\nYour the 14th Sec of VA for me, and in the last few weeks it’s been\nall one sided. I have to guess where your really going. So far your\nbragging and looks like a island of one rather showing staffers or\nsupport. Because your only as good as your team. They don’t seem\nto be a part of the picture.\nI didn’t go away. You didn’t answer any of my questions or even\nrespond to me. Looking more and more like top down management\nwhere you hide behind your staff to keep people at bay. Well, some\nSec of VA had open door policies with staffers that talked to vets –\nanyone that asked.\nYou and I are off to a really bad start. As I have alot on my plate over\nGWI and how badly we have been treated. That it took VA 6 years to\nfind a 4 inch tumor in my lungs, after missing it in a 2018 CT scan.\nVISN 17 is in trouble, it can’t keep up and is under manned. Now your\ncutting more? Attrition here is already to high. Soon it will only be\ntemporary workers and foreign interns with no experience. COVID\nwiped us out with people giving up. Travel pay takes 45 days because\nnot enough man power.\nYou can’t just keep saying things are fine, ignore veterans, and claim\nit can be fixed by firing people. You’ve almost eliminated the hiring\npool to pick from.\nThis is all bluff. VA is in trouble, and it needs help from the veterans\nto save it. Instead your pissing us off and playing favorites.\nSome folks like myself have more experience than you may think. Dip\ninto it, and try to be more flexible about it. Instead of listening to some\nburned out under secretary lifer who runs everyone off. There are\nsome folks that need to go. Top end tree stumps we all keep tripping over.\nMy old remarks still stand. I’m just building on that and let others get\na idea from what I’m posting. How singular its been. Told there is\nprogress, seeing none of it and saying so. I’ve been posting public\ncomments all over News.va.gov since 2022 with one common theme –\nSec of VA dodges me even when confronted outside 810 Vermont\nstreet. Your not solving our problems, or yours.\nTreacherous times. Can’t believe anything is safe.\nVeterans nationwide would disagree with him. Mayhap he shouldn’t be in a position of power.\nWhen the “rumors” come from the TOP and from Musk, it is time to worry. Trump can replace the VA Director with a snap on his fingers.\nMusk is the problem because Trump listens and believes the man! I put in over 22 years with the VA and when I retired, it was top notch. Hope it stays that way!\nThe VA would rather bury a veteran than help one\nYou say no reductions in veterans benefits, does that include veterans compensation?\nFunny how you don’t acknowledge the more than 1,000 layoffs of probationary workers at VA. You can say you care, but when you leave off the whole truth it’s still lying.\nI’d appreciate it if you stick to topics and not boot lick trump. The previous administration also looked out for us. We are watching you. If we catch you in a lie… well…\nThat’s a joke veterans rights are being violated are the country in state courts to the point of joining the 22. No one gives a crap even when you have court transcripts of proof of the judge admitting on the bench that he is violating your rights. All after three viles of cyanide were found in the courthouse annex enough to wipe out the great lakes according to DHHS. But the government thinks it’s right to try to drive me and others into joining the 22. I know the cyanide is a fact I found it, I was thanked by DHS for possibly saving millions of lives and the great lakes. But the VA rewards the doctor tom hanf for turning it in and tried to kill me by over prescribed meds . You honestly believe that the VA helps you are wrong , it picks and chooses . Two marine brothers got out same time one got help (doing well good life ) the other got told 6 months wait ended up blowing half his face off ya great\nYou deleted the 1,558 comments because you didn’t like m ?\nHi George,\nThank you for your comment. I want to assure you that we have not deleted those comments. The 1,558 comments you’re referring to are actually on a different post than the one you’re currently viewing. You can find them on the correct post here:\nVA Secretary Doug Collins addresses Veterans’ benefits in new video\nWe appreciate your engagement and apologize for the confusion.\nI posted here yesterday evening, and I dont see it today. Ive posted\nrepeatedly in the previous page which is at 1,572 at of this morning.\nIm sure there are much more than 4 post. If anything, its a repeat of\nthe last location with those hoping to plea there cases. Soap Boxes\nIve been begging for, years ago. To vote on mutual ideas.\nIve written 4 emails to Sec of VA Doug Collins at doug.collins@va.gov\nand the first email got a partial response. Passed me onto client relations\nwho have said nothing. So this feels lot like Sec of VA Denis McDonough\nall over again. Till i just confronted him at the front door 7am September\n7th, 2023 and he put on a show of how he would get back to me. Put my\nname in his cell phone, and there was no follow up.\nSo Im just going to hand off anything from here to Senate committees and\nsee if they probably want to follow up like they used to in the old days.\nLiked it alot better when Secretary executive staff had open door policies\nso we could talk. Like with Sec of VA Anthony Principi. In fact, I can tell you\nback stories of 14 sec of VA going back to 1999 and the gradual changes\nin management when they set out to drive off grass roots organizations in\n2002. After that, they began driving off the service groups. By 2020 they\npretty much closed off the lobby at 810 Vermont street and even executive\nstaff stopped taking calls, emails.\nIn the old days, you could at least be escorted upstairs to talk to secretary\nof VA staff. That floor wasnt so exclusive back then. Could even go to the\ncommissary in the basement and talk to anyone. It wasnt always friendly,\nbut everyone stood in line to pay for lunch.\nI think the exclusion has gone on to long. Breeded contempt. Put VA staff\nout of reach. I think its time to go back to open door policy.\nSo this post will go out on other channels in the event VA does not like what\nhappened with veterans benefit posting. As I suspect VA will pull back into\nthe shadows after veterans did behave the way you predicted. Just roll over\nand take it like the last 4 years.\nI didnt cuss, or be vulgar. I didnt wave left or right wing politics. Havent\nexpressed anything violent. Just asking to represent myself and my fellow\nGulf war vets who have mostly been excluded since 2012. Not through the\nVA RAC which is a tool of VA ORD. I mean benefits and healthcare issues\nmy former committee wanted addressed in 2009.\nSo conclude by saying, I think Ive been more than fair. Cant say I have been\ntreated that way back for a long time now. Just like asking Cheryl Mason to\nbe open minded. Senior Advisor to the Sec of VA, and so far quiet as well.\nThis shouldnt be this difficult, or offensive. Got to be a better way.\nThank you for your comment.

I posted once politely yesterday. This reply\nto you posted – before my statement from yesterday. You put\nit off on me that I was some how violating protocol. Ive been\nposting on news.va,gov for many years now and only once in\n2021 did I have to say similar things about my post not getting\nout or complete. Im not new to this. The complete versions are\non Facebook where I show what I sent.\nWe dont have any means of interacting with VA other than here\nand its one sided. So folks will get defensive if they cant even\nget out here. No where else to go. Its not fair.\nKirt,\nI don’t believe that anyone has accused you of violating any protocols. Perhaps I didn’t explain myself well enough. We have content review policies in place to make sure content that does violate comments policies does not end up on this website. Stuff like personal information and clear scams (“Click here for free Bitcoin!”). Stuff like that. Nothing that you posted was anything like that. What I was trying to convey to you is that our team has to manually review all these comments before they show up on the website. It takes a little while to get through all of the comments. We are certainly not trying to stop you from commenting. It also has been complicated somewhat by the fact that another article on our site recently got more than 1,800 comments.

We will continue doing our best to review and approve them as fast as we possibly can.\nSeriously stop lying it’s embarrassing and dishonorable. Not one of my comments have been posted and I’ve posted over 3 times since last week. We’re not stupid and not to be toyed with\nKirt,\nyou imply Mr. Collins reads this forum. If so, why does he not answer the veterans questions with factual proof instead of Whoppers?\nDoug Collins is a liar and a coward along with his draft dodging piece of trash boss. Nevermind the half truths being spun by this charlatan. Look at your care and benefits. If they change, believe that. But of course it will be too late then. Just like the 1000s of good people in the Federal government that have already lost their jobs while inflation rises. I weep for you all who gave into petty and exaggerated hate and saw value in electing these half men. Men who never served and have no honor. You are going to reap it. No matter what you believe. And FOX news won’t fill your bellies.\nHold on for a bump ride. One way or another.\nWelll, I wished that veterans are num one on the list. For seven years not, what the va has done toe , is inhuman, cruel, and their actions have almost cost me my life now, I can’t get nobody to understand or help me, my wife struggles to keep me alive, I’m a 200 percent service connected, and have no payments nor have access to health care by va or local free clinics because of the va.. I have blisters on my feet and legs the size of gtate fruit and intense infection I’m my body fr the blisters, the va has stopped sending me my insulin needed to stay alive, I weigh 130 pounds now from 200,; the va is getting away with murder,c, can prove everything\n34 years ago the US Army DESERTED me left me behind in Desert Storm and have covered it up and destroyed records and denied me benefits I earned and deserve. What the Government didn’t count on was the fact of me getting through the cracks and now being Service Connected where I have a tiny bit of leverage. Calling out the VA in Duty to Assist and CUEs all over, leaving 13 claims on compensation issues for over 2 years now. While they struggle to rebut what they destroyed in records. Oh what tangled webs we weave when we first choose to deceive! Good words to live by the Injustice that I have endured for over 34 years will soon be exposed. The International War and Humanitarian Laws that have been violated someone will stand Justice and answer for their actions.\nIt is self-evident that it would not be enough for a government to give orders or directions and leave the military authorities to arrange as they please for their detailed execution. It is for the government to supervise the execution of the orders it gives!\nThank you Mr. COLLINS, I appreciate the confirmation and clarification.\nHey Dan, still around Woodstock?\nCollins is a lier! If the VA wants to cut expenses, i’ve a few suggestions. Here in Phoenix they have realized the connection between medical treatment and answering the phone. They’ve quit answering the phones! Why not make this a nationwide policy!\nThe VA knows that the ability to justify a disability claim lies in your ability to explain why. They have ingenously demanded that all claims must be filed on a VA form. This form only allows for a two sentence explanation! Right now about 90% of all claims are denied. O feel certain this could be brought closer to 100% by halving that space!\nI’ve been waiting for an oncology appointment since November! I do not understand this at all.\nHonorable Secretary Collins,\nYou have been placed in a leadership position that is critical to America’s veterans, not just for compensation and health care, but as a veteran yourself who continues to serve. You are viewed as the tip of the spear to all veterans. Your allegiance after God is to veterans before any elected official. You know as a man of God, what you do in this position will be judged, as it is a great responsibility and honor. I pray for you to be strong and stand up with conviction for all veterans. With that being said, untold number of veterans and their families have been crushed by the federal job freeze and firings for no reason. I for one was hired and was boarding when I received the email, that rescinded my job offer. I am a 26 year retired combat veteran, 100% P&T. I applied for the VA job because I believed I could still contribute to my fellow veterans and country. The question you should ask yourself is “How many veterans have we hurt, plus their families in this freeze and purge. Veterans have served and sacrificed for our country, we did not take deferments, but volunteer to serve with Honor, Integrity, and Devotion to the Constitution and this great Republic. However no Republicans are standing up for the veterans during this time. As a life-long republican, I am ashamed. Lip service to veterans is a sign of a nations decline. So Mr. Secretary, please look into how man veteran’s lives have been crushed and families decimated by these decisions and as the tip of the spear, stand up to all and anyone for the veteran. You beliefs in God and his son are my same beliefs and we know we will be judged one day on what we did with the responsibilities God gave us.\nAnother 1400 VA workers fired. Mr. Collins, do you think the 2400 VA workers who were working in their probation period are deep state or are all slackers? Where is your moral compass on this issue? You sir are doing nothing about the real problem of entrenched lazy employees. As a prior VA GS-12 Rater, I saw firsthand employees who used race, gender, or sexual favors to advance their careers or to threaten others who tried to have them fired due to their worthless work ethics. You are directly responsible for propagating this continuing problem by firing people without cause except that they were in their probation period. Weak management skills by this administration for headlines only. You sir, are disappointing in your lack of integrity and Christian compassion as you are not even blinking an eye to the numerous lives destroyed by your actions. I hope you can sleep well at night knowing your actions in worshipping at the “Golden Age of America” administration or should I put it into terms you understand “The Golden Calf Age of America’s downfall”. As a retired 26 year USAF veteran it does not surprise me as I met very few USAF Protestant chaplains who truly were sold out to Jesus, most were grip and grin politicians. Fix the VA claims process by focusing on accuracy only and stop trying to mix oil and water by demanding speed and accuracy when rating claims! Do it accurate the first time and you will see less appeals and increased productivity over time! Get to work Mr. Collins or move out of the way for someone who is willing to stand up for the veterans who have been fired in this purge.\nLies. Trump and his South African Queen will make “adjustments” lower your rating, lower your payments. You know, for the deficit or something. You voted for this, now suffer.\nWhy did I wait, 1 year to get my dependent taken care of and still waiting on my retroactive pay.\nDidn’t know you could fire veterans guess too many buds yo ha ha\nWhy does it take so long for everything to approved when you have prove\nHe didn’t “lay them off”, he FIRED THEM.\nHe is NOT telling truth, he is spewing falsehoods…..\n1,000 workers( DEI) have been laid off. The VA was already short- handed. This reduction in workers will mean that it will take longer times to get appointments, and longer times to get health care!\nIt will take longer for pharmacists to fill a prescription and longer time to mail it out to the Veteran.\nIt makes sense, if you have 1,000 less workers, it will take longer to get the jobs done!\nUnfortunately, we are talking about government especially the VA. We all know government employees are not very efficient and the VA has one of the worst worker effeciency reputations there is. And this reputation is from the second largest agency employing more than 450K not including nurses and doctors. Do you really think hiring 1,000 people just because of their race, sex, sexual preferences, or perceived identity, makes that much of a difference?\nDid trump tell you that? Because government workers are just like any others. Just they can’t cut corners due to the regulations\nVeteran’s or employee’s?\nHard to believe Collins story … it is the opposite of what has been broadcast by many outlets. Frankly the federal government has totally lost trust. President Trump’s feelings toward veterans is well known and documented “losers”. Frankly federal government has lost all trust. By their actions, they want our country to become the bad guys, like Russia, China and Iran.\nThank you for setting the fears aside. We as veterans worried that all the things we did for our country was not in vain. The things that we’re seeing coming from Trump and everybody else is very scary it’s like we don’t know from one day to the next if we’re even going to have a country, for the rest of the world is looking at us and laughing and holding us as a joke…. it’s so sad to see what is happening. Thank you for your time and belief in us Betsy.\nI have tried for 7 years to be treated for pain management. You wonder why vet give up. No one listens or care about everything but the vet. I say hire vet as you can and let vet’s help each other. There is no nursing supervisor in the the facilities who can help with dealing with daily issues.\nyou guys are awesome thankyou caring about vererans we have great leaders now and only going to get better it needed a big change and trumph picture needs put on wall were it should be Va facilaties because you and him has always said that you will take care of veterans!???\nIn TRUMPS FIRST TERM ! TRUMP WAS THE PERSON TELLING: THE WHOPPER’S AND VETERAN SERVICES STOPPERS. THE TRUTH\nWAS EASY TO OBSERVE WHICH TRUMP THOUGHT “his CHOSEN” COULD HIDE! WELL;\n“THEY COULDN’T!” TROUBLE IS; THERE’S TWO BURGER KINGS WHOPPER’S NOW!; TRUMP/MUSK. AND YES “THEY” ARE SERVING\n“WHOPPERS” WITH “A.I.” ARTIFICIAL\nINGREDIENTS. BUTT! WE CAN SEE BETTER!:\nALOT BETTER NOW! AND IF IT IS NOT THE\n“TRUTH”; WE’RE NOT BUYING IT!\nLies. My last appointment was pushed back 3 hours because my P.A.C. team was covering 3 clinics at once. Our care is worse than I have even seen it and reminds me of my Grandfather’s VA in the 70’s. I have been trying for 8 years to be re-evaluate by the VA for PTSD and I am just told it won’t change anything. BS! If I had a PTSD diagnosis, many service dog training places would give me a service dog, instead, I am left training my own with no help with vet costs or service dog equipment. Him making it all a joke just shows how little it means to him.\nWillard NY the old hospital still stands, empty. Great spot to put a new VA with room to breathe. It has great potential.\nHow do I contact Doug Collins directly?\nThank you,\nLeo Jones\nOne person said Doug.collins@va.gov\nYour not responding to veterans. Your dictating to them.

Your not solving our problems, or yours.\nThe VA process for claim approvals, especially appeals takes far too long.\nyes way to long,i guess they are waiting for all of us to DIE,its cheaper..\nHow are we putting the veterans 1st when the VA facilities are converting patient care areas into offices to get the remote workers at the stations? The VA moved employees to remote workers environments to allow for more direct patient care, now that we have to “bring them back to the office” we are losing patient care areas to accommodate this!\nHow is this putting the patient first. Please fight to keep the remote workers remote so our veterans have the space to get their care!\nHello,\nMy name is William, I’m a veteran that is currently service connected with a 40% rating and I’m currently participating in the VA VR&E Program for the last 8 months as a Medical Supply Technician.\nThe program helps veterans like myself with opportunities for direct hire opportunities as Medical Supply Technicians or some other specific jobs within the VA hospital if positions are available.\nThe VR&E program is also intended to pursue accredited higher education/vocational training if the direct hire option isn’t available or if we would prefer to pursue some type of accredited higher education/vocational training.\nI was in the process of onboarding for a Medical Supply Technician, but did not meet the February 8th deadline for a start date and my offer letter was dated tentatively February 20, 2025.\nThe position I was onboarding for is in the job family series 2005 Supply Clerical and Technician as a Medical Supply Technician and for unexplained reasons was and still is not included on the hiring freeze exemption list.\nWe supply the entire hospital with the medical supplies needed for the high quality care for the veterans receiving health care within the VA healthcare system. This includes departments like the Emergency Room, ICU, patient wards and all the supporting functions for example.\nThis role is a 3 shift position that requires Medical Supply Technicians to be available at all times including holidays.\nThe VA I’m assigned to is short staffed in Logistics. The hospital is having to pull employees from other departments to help staff the logistics department.

INFLUENCE PEDDLING: EXAMINING JOE BIDEN'S ABUSE OF PUBLIC OFFICE ---------- Wednesday, March 20, 2024 U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Accountability Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:09 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. James Comer [Chairman of the Committee] presiding. Present: Representatives Comer, Jordan, Turner, Foxx, Grothman, Cloud, Palmer, Higgins, Sessions, Biggs, Mace, LaTurner, Fallon, Donalds, Perry, Timmons, Burchett, Greene, McClain, Boebert, Fry, Luna, Langworthy, Burlison, Waltz, Raskin, Norton, Lynch, Connolly, Krishnamoorthi, Khanna, Mfume, Ocasio-Cortez, Porter, Bush, Brown, Stansbury, Garcia, Frost, Lee, Casar, Crockett, Goldman, Moskowitz, Tlaib, and Pressley. Also present: Representatives Smith of Missouri, Gaetz, and Swalwell. Chairman Comer. The Committee on Oversight and Accountability will come to order. I want to welcome everyone here this morning. Without objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time. Without objection, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Jason Smith of Missouri, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, and Representative Eric Swalwell from California are waived on to the Committee for the purpose of questioning the witnesses at today's Committee hearing. For today's hearing, opening statements will be limited to 10 minutes for the Chair and 10 minutes for the Ranking Member. The Chair also notes that points of order pertaining to the engaging of personalities against the President will not be in order for the duration of today's hearing. Given that this is a hearing regarding this Committee's impeachment inquiry, members must be allowed to speak frankly. The Chair now recognizes himself for an opening statement. Today, the House Committee on Oversight will hear from witnesses who have previously provided information during our deposition and interview phase regarding the Biden family's business practices in China, Ukraine, Russia, and other places around the world. At the start of this Congress, the Oversight Committee has investigated what product or service the Biden family and their associates were selling that would justify over $24 million in payments. We have reviewed emails, bank records, text messages, suspicious activity reports at Treasury, and other evidence normally compiled during an expansive investigation such as this. The Oversight Committee has found no credible evidence of the Bidens providing any work product. The Committee has identified no legitimate value or document or even one single hour of work the Bidens have provided their business partners. Nothing. What is apparent after over a year of investigation is that the Bidens do not work in any traditional sense of the word. They do not work as consultants or lawyers or advisors. The Bidens do not sell a product or service or a set of skills. The Bidens sell Joe Biden. That is their business. For months, we have heard Democrats desperately proclaiming that witnesses have told this Committee that Joe Biden had no involvement in his family's business dealings, but where are those witnesses today? It is telling Democrats have not invited one of these witnesses to today's hearing. That is because they know their testimoneys would not withstand public scrutiny. Democrats have relied on these witnesses' opening statements and have willfully turned a blind eye to the facts that have come out in these interviews once the witnesses were questioned about our record of evidence. Democrats now must rely on bringing in a distraction witness to talk about nonsense and who cannot talk about any of the facts brought by today's witnesses who worked with the Bidens. Now, President Biden cannot control his adult son. He cannot control his brother, his sister-in-law, or his nine family members who have received money from these transactions. All President Biden can do is control his own actions, and that is what we are here today to discuss with the witnesses, because in the course of this investigation, we have learned that Joe Biden has taken action after action to further his family's plans to get rich. He shows up to meetings, gets on phone calls, shakes hands, and tells people to ``look after my family.'' He goes to dinners with foreign oligarchs and a Ukrainian executive paying his son millions of dollars. He gets paid with money from Chinese businessmen who he has meetings with and tells other business associates he will see what he can do to help their situations. He writes letters of recommendation for foreign business associates' children. The scam is simple: the Biden family promises they can make a foreign partner's problems go away by engaging the U.S. Government. The problems can be anything: a Ukrainian corruption investigation, moving Russian money to the United States, a Romanian criminal prosecution, access for China to American energy sources. Joe shows up, shakes a few hands in front of his son, and says, ``Take care of my boy,'' or something similar, and the money flows to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. It is done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe's power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens' pockets. Joe Biden is the family's closer. How could he not be? The Bidens are not doing any other work for these foreign companies that would warrant tens of millions of dollars. There are only two explanations for this. The first is that Joe Biden knows exactly what he is doing and knows a handshake, a wink, and a smile is enough for him to maintain, as Jim Biden famously calls it, plausible deniability, or Joe Biden is being led around by his family and has no idea who he is meeting with or what message he is sending, and is truly an elderly man with a poor memory. There is no other explanation. Either Joe Biden is complicit or Joe Biden is incompetent. Since becoming Chairman of this Committee in January 2023, I promised the investigation into the Biden family's influence peddling would be based on bank records, witness testimony, and verifiable facts. After years of Democrats using this Committee as a mouthpiece for every conspiracy theory they could find, like the Russian collusion hoax, under my leadership, the Committee has returned to real investigations. If Democrats want to spin another Russian hoax, I will ask them to answer one question: what services did the Bidens provide to earn them and their business associates over $24 million? What did they do for the money? Democrats have the same bank records as we do, and bank records do not lie. The witnesses today are here to talk about Joe Biden. Republicans are here to talk about Joe Biden. If Democrats wish to spend their time beclowning themselves with another Russian collusion hoax for the sake of protecting President Biden, they can do so. As I said, I would have invited Hunter Biden here today to sit alongside his business associates and provide his side of the story. Hunter Biden demanded a public hearing. I have given him one. Maybe he will show up. He has said he is not, but he loves saying one thing and doing another. At some point Hunter Biden saying one thing and doing another begins to reflect poorly on his ability to tell the truth at all, but this hearing is not about Hunter Biden. This investigation is not about Hunter Biden. It is about Joe Biden and the lies he continues to tell the American people. With that, I yield to Chairman Smith. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Comer and Ranking Member Raskin. From the beginning of this investigation, we have made clear that we will follow the facts wherever they lead. The facts have led us to two conclusions: one, the Biden family has for years traded on Joe Biden's name in order to rake in millions of dollars, often doing so with his direct knowledge and clear involvement; two, President Biden has been continually dishonest with the American people about his knowledge of his family's business dealings. We have testimony from multiple witnesses that Joe Biden was the brand. He knew what his son and brother were doing and did nothing to stop it. That alone makes him complicit in a scheme to make money off of his public service. But he was not just complicit. He was, as one of today's witnesses has testified, an enabler of this activity. The evidence of the two IRS whistleblowers who came to the Ways and Means Committee has been affirmed by volumes of material provided to Congress by the testimony of others and even by the Department of Justice, who finally brought charges against Hunter Biden that mirror those called for by the IRS investigators. The evidence obtained shows that, one, Joe Biden met with his son's business partners on multiple occasions. He used an alias to exchange dozens of emails with his son's bookkeeper. He took official government action that suspiciously coincided with those meetings and correspondence. The connections between Joe Biden and his son's business practices extended even to the Biden 2020 campaign. At the height of the Democrat primary, Kevin Morris, a Hollywood lawyer who met Hunter Biden at a Joe Biden campaign fundraiser, paid off Hunter Biden's tax liabilities because there was, in his words, ``risk personally and politically if that matter was not swept under the rug.'' Investigators that were interested in pursuing a potential criminal campaign violation were told to stand down. The Biden family relied on the Biden brand so much that evidence has revealed that Hunter Biden believed that ``all this stuff,'' meaning his legal troubles, would all go away when his dad became President. Why did he believe that? Because for years, the Biden family has personally benefited from Joe Biden's position of power. Joe Biden knew this. He did nothing to stop it, and he lied about it. I yield to Jim Jordan, Chairman Jordan. Mr. Jordan. I thank the gentleman. Who planted the pipe bombs on January 6? Nobody seems to know. Who leaked the Dobbs draft opinion, you know, the leak that led to an assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh? How about this one? Who left cocaine at the White House? The Biden Administration does not seem to have time to answer these questions. They are too busy investigating parents at school board meetings, labeling Catholics extremists, retaliating against whistleblowers. They are too busy putting together a sweetheart deal for Hunter Biden, the deal that got laughed out of court. And, oh, the guy who put together the deal that got laughed out of court, that is the guy they named special counsel. You know what Democrats do have time for? Going after President Trump. They have been doing it for 8 years. They spied on his campaign. Then it was the Mueller investigation, 19 lawyers, 40 agents, $30 million, and found nothing. Then it was impeachment. Then it was raid his home. Then it was a special counsel. Then it was the Fourteenth Amendment. The party of democracy said, ``We are going to keep the guy off the ballot,'' who is leading in every single poll. The Ranking Member said that President Trump should be disqualified from even running for office. Thank goodness we have a Supreme Court who disagreed with the Ranking Member and the Democrats 9 to zero. Not 5-4, not 6-3, not 7-2, not 8-1. Nine to zero they disagreed. Now, Democrats say how dare Republicans investigate Joe Biden? How dare they look into the money, the business, and the brand? As the Chairman said, millions of dollars from foreign entities run through 20 different companies for what? I mean, 20 different companies for what? Devon Archer told us what it was for: access to the brand, and the brand was Joe Biden, the brand that played rounds of golf, took calls and meetings, attended lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business partners; the brand that conditioned $1 billion of American tax money on the firing of the prosecutor pressuring the company Hunter Biden sat on the board of and, oh, by the way, was getting paid a million bucks a year. Today, we are going to learn more about that brand. We are going to learn more about what Mr. Galanis called the Biden lift. We will learn about the plausible deniability that Jim Biden talked to Mr. Bobulinski about. And we will hear about the statement, the rule that governed how the business operated around Joe Biden, the rule that said, ``Say it, forget it. Write it, regret it.'' So, I want to thank our witnesses for coming here today. They, like the whistleblowers who came to the Ways and Means Committee, are doing it simply because they want the American people to have the truth. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member for 12 minutes for his opening statement. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, thank you very kindly. With any luck, today marks the end of perhaps the most spectacular failure in the history of congressional investigations: the effort to find a high crime or misdemeanor committed by Joe Biden and then to impeach him for it. In prior hilarious episodes of this long-running madcap series, America got to see the following: one, nearly 20 fact witnesses who could not identify a single act of wrongdoing by President Biden, much less a high crime and misdemeanor, and who overwhelmingly testified that Biden was not involved in any of his family's business adventures; two, three expert witnesses called by the Majority itself, who said nothing that they had seen in the tens of thousands of pages of documents introduced by the Majority even remotely approached the level of a high crime and misdemeanor; bank records which show exactly what all the witnesses told us, that Joe Biden was not involved in his family members' businesses; repeated voyeuristic displays of pornographic images by the Majority, completely irrelevant to any conceivable legislative or investigative purpose; a star witness, Gal Luft, who turned out to be a Chinese agent and an illegal arms trafficker on the run from American justice; and the key piece of evidence which launched the entire zany goose chase: an FD-1023 form in which the FBI duly recorded a completely fictional tip about a $5 million bribe to Vice President Biden, peddled by Alex Smirnov, who has been criminally indicted by a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, Special Counsel David Weiss, for felony counts of systematically lying to the FBI and constructing a false record about Joe Biden, and now sits in jail in California as a flight risk while the world studies his longstanding and extensive ties to Russian intelligence. Today, the good Chairman and his ace MAGA detectives have finally jumped the shark. The comedy of errors comes crashing to an end as House Republicans in more than a dozen Biden districts beg for mercy, and the Committee throws a flabby Hail Mary pass 3 weeks after the Super Bowl is over. So today, we revisit the fruitless testimony of two more fading star witnesses who have failed to testify to any Presidential wrongdoing, much less evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors. Both of the Majority witnesses are frustrated would-be business partners of Hunter Biden, who tried to leverage the Biden name or the Biden brand, as they keep calling it, but they never got any business off the ground for reasons that will become painfully obvious to anyone watching the proceedings today. Even Hunter Biden, laboring at the time under a serious substance abuse addiction, could tell these were not the type of people he should be doing business with. So, rather than representing the Biden brand, which was their ardent wish, they now show up today as loyal servants of Trump world, each of them proudly represented by their very own former Trump White House attorney. The first is Mr. Bobulinski, the bitterly disappointed wanna-be Hunter business partner, whose famously litigious history includes unsuccessfully suing his own dying father's charity for nearly a million dollars, and just last month, suing Cassidy Hutchinson for $10 million after she reported that Mr. Bobulinski, wearing a ski mask, met with Mark Meadows, which Ms. Hutchison has now backed up with actual documentary photographic evidence, something in very short supply in this investigation. Mr. Bobulinski made his hazy allegations against the Bidens public for the first time at a press conference choreographed by the Trump for President Campaign, which provided him a venue, a gaggle of journalists, and even a dress shirt that they went out and bought for him to wear to the event. Hours later, Mr. Bobulinski joined the second 2020 Presidential debate as Donald Trump's personal guest, where he was seated with Kid Rock and Mark Meadows. The other star witness, Mr. Galanis, who, I believe, is appearing by Zoom today, is a serial fraudster and convicted con man, a term I would charitably not use on a witness, except it was explicitly bestowed upon him by not one, but two different U.S. Federal district court judges, including the one who sentenced him to over 15 years in prison for defrauding union pension funds, a Native-American tribe, and scores of innocent investors. Mr. Galanis was sentenced to pay restitution of over $80 million to his victims. That is a lot of money. That is what Donald Trump was sentenced to pay E. Jean Carroll for in that civil litigation. The very first record of Mr. Galanis' claims against the Biden family appeared--check this out--in the clemency petition that he sent from prison to President Trump. But the key point is this. Even if we were to believe every single word offered by these utterly compromised and biased witnesses, Mr. Bobulinski and Mr. Galanis, their allegations do not identify any wrongdoing, much less an impeachable offense by President Biden. With the impeachment bus running on empty, our GOP colleagues now are apparently preparing to save face by ending the impeachment farce with criminal referrals. But criminal referrals require evidence of crimes, and the only crimes we have seen are those of the GOP's own star witnesses, like Russian asset, Alex Smirnov; Chinese agent, Gal Luft; Devon Archer; and Jason Galanis. The Minority witness today, our witness, Lev Parnas, casts a piercing light on what is really taking place here, and Mr. Parnas has reason to know. He, too, used to be a MAGA sycophant peddling lies and disinformation to smear Joe Biden. Today, he joins a long line of self-exiles from Trump world who could no longer stomach all the corruption and deceit, people like Cassidy Hutchinson; people like Michael Cohen; Sarah Matthews; Alyssa Griffin; General James Mattis; the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley; General John Kelly; and now, Vice President Mike Pence, who refuses to endorse for President, the man he has served with. But we do have loyal sycophants still in the room, and 1 day I look forward to hearing their testimony about how they got sunk into this religious cult. Mr. Parnas wrote Chairman Comer and me a remarkable letter on July 23, 2023. This is the first time I am meeting him today. He was Rudy Giuliani's right-hand man, his globetrotting business partner, and language interpreter in the mission to manufacture Ukraine-and Burisma-related dirt and smears against Joe Biden in 2018 and 2019. He spent all of his time traveling around the world trying to stage evidence against Joe Biden. In his letter, Parnas explains that the desperate search to find evidence of any kind of Biden corruption was a complete and total bust because there was no evidence to find. He wrote to tell us that not only is there no evidence in Ukraine that Joe Biden did anything improper, but, more darkly, the manic search for a smoking gun against Biden became a mission to invent and concoct evidence out of thin air with the active help of Russian intelligence assets and agents. Chairman Comer. Right. Mr. Raskin. I am getting to Russia. You have not heard anything yet, Mr. Chairman. A man who has reckoned with his own more descent into Trump world, Lev Parnas is ashamed of what he did to serve the interests of Russian propaganda and Putin's lies, and he wants America to know the truth. He can explain how the Russian-stimulated conspiracy theories and lies that he promoted with Rudy Giuliani live on in the tiresome fabrication spread by Alex Smirnov and now repeated by this Committee like Pavlov's dog. At every turn, my colleagues cry, ``Russia hoax,'' even in the face of repeated warnings from Donald Trump's own Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State, from the intelligence community, from Robert Mueller, and, most recently, from Special Counsel Weiss, who was named to office by Donald Trump. As Secretary Mnuchin stated, ``Russian disinformation campaigns targeting American citizens are a threat to our democracy.'' That is Secretary Mnuchin, someone that you guys usually defend, but my GOP colleagues continue to cry ``Russia hoax'' like cult members selling flowers at the airport. Our colleagues are the ones loyally amplifying the actual Russian hoax, not the Russia hoax, the Russian hoax. The one that Giuliani and Trump and Smirnov have eagerly adopted from Putin and his agents. They participate in this hoax while they shamefully block $60 billion in military assistance to President Zelensky and the besieged Ukrainian people 5 years after Trump and Giuliani tried to shake President Zelensky down for counterfeit dirt on Joe Biden. And while they continue to parrot these transparent Russian lies, Vladimir Putin wages his bloody aggressive war on Ukraine, filled with atrocities like the mass kidnapping of children and the rape and slaughter of civilians. The MAGA right's wholesale adoption of this Russian hoax and their sellout of the Ukrainian people by the MAGA right is an historic betrayal of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. But the defense of democracy begins with fidelity to the truth, and the Oversight Democrats, America's truth squad against this disinformation, is here today to set the record straight. I yield back to you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. I would now like to introduce our witnesses. Mr. Tony Bobulinski. Mr. Bobulinski was a business partner of Hunter Biden in a joint venture between a Chinese energy entity, CEFC. Mr. Bobulinski sat for a transcribed interview with the Committee on February 13, 2024. Mr. Lev Parnas. Mr. Parnas was not a business associated of the Biden family. Mr. Parnas is an entrepreneur, a political activist, and an author. And Mr. Jason Galanis. Mr. Galanis was a business partner of Hunter Biden. Mr. Galanis sat for a transcribed interview with this Committee on February 23, 2024. We asked the Bureau of Prisons to make him available in person today. They would only provide Mr. Galanis for virtual testimony. Notably, Mr. Galanis applied for CARES Act home confinement, and after a lengthy approval process, was approved for home confinement on June 9, 2023. On June 12, 2023, I issued a subpoena to Devon Archer for testimony. On the following day, June 13, 2023, Mr. Galanis' approval was reversed as a result of Department of Justice's intervention, so Mr. Galanis has remained in a Federal prison facility. He is currently in Montgomery, Alabama. Mr. Galanis, can you please state for the record who else is in the room with you? Mr. Galanis. Yes, Mr. Chairman. My counsel and advisor, Mark Paoletta and Nicholas Wise. Chairman Comer. Thank you. Pursuant to Committee Rule 9(g), the witnesses will please stand and raise their right hand. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? [A chorus of ayes.] Chairman Comer. Let the record show that the witnesses all answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You all may be seated. We appreciate you all being here today and look forward to your testimony. Let me remind the witnesses that we have read your written statements and they will appear in full in the hearing record. Please limit your oral statements to 5 minutes. As a reminder, please press the button on the microphone in front of you so that it is on, and Members can hear you. When you begin to speak, the light in front of you will turn green, after 4 minutes, the light will turn yellow, and when the red light comes on, your 5 minutes has expired, and we would ask that you would please wrap it up as quickly as possible. I now recognize Mr. Bobulinski for his opening statement. Mr. Bobulinski. Should I allow Hunter to give his opening statement first? Chairman Comer. Well, it does not appear Mr. Biden showed up for his public hearing, so we will recognize you, Mr. Bobulinski. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. STATEMENT OF TONY BOBULINSKI Mr. Bobulinski. Chairman, Ranking Members, and Members of Congress, good morning. Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you and present my truthful testimony to the American people. I sit here today under oath for one reason and one reason only: the American people deserve to hear the truth. Though the truth involving the deep corruption of the Biden family, including the malfeasance of the sitting President of the United States, might be wrong and unpleasant, the American people must hear it. You are presented here today with two narratives in this investigation: a false one being pushed by Joe Biden, a serial liar and fabulist, now under this impeachment investigation for public corruption; his brother Jim Biden, a 75-year-old man who cannot keep his lies straight, including under oath; and his son, Hunter Biden, a chronic drug addict facing two indictments with 12 counts. You also have before you the truth confirmed by multiple Biden family business partners over many years and backed up by mountains of irrefutable evidence, including text messages, emails, documents, recordings. I am the only Biden family business partner with an impeccable military record. I am grateful that this country has given me the freedom to be successful. I worked hard to become independently wealthy. I have taken several businesses public, sold multiple businesses to some of the world's best private equity firms. In fact, my business success is why they sought me out. However, what they have done is repugnant to me. I am here today because I am a patriot, and I am a truth-teller. We keep hearing from certain corners that our democracy is at risk and democracy is on the ballot in 2024. Yet, the same people preaching this mantra know better. They continue to lie directly to the American people without hesitation and remorse. Rep. Dan Goldman and Jamie Raskin, both lawyers, and Mr. Goldman a former prosecutor with the SDNY from New York, will continue to lie today in this hearing and then go straight to the media to tell more lies. Hunter Biden's defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, weaponizes letters to Congress to try to smear my name---- Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. And misstate the cold hard facts---- Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. In an attempt to save his powerfully connected client and his father. I challenge Mr. Lowell to make those claims on national television so he can be held accountable for his lies. Prior to my successful business career, I was an officer in the United States Navy, at the Navy's elite Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. I later served as the Command's chief technology officer. Chairman Comer. I apologize for the disruption from the from the Minority. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Am I supposed to say it is my time, Mr. Raskin? Chairman Comer. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski, please---- Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Chairman Comer. Come to order. Mr. Bobulinski, please proceed. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. OK. Chairman Comer. Please proceed. I apologize for the disruption from the Minority. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Mr. Raskin. Well, Mr. Chairman, save his time, but he called Members of this Committee liars. And I just want to know whether the order and decorum requirements of House Rule XI apply to witnesses appearing before the Committee? Does it apply or does it not? Mr. Bobulinski. Should I just---- Chairman Comer. There is decorum for the Members. We have asked for that. There is no language that I am aware of pertaining to a witness. Mr. Raskin. Thank you. Chairman Comer. So, I will make sure we did not waste any of his time on the opening statement. Mr. Bobulinski, I am sorry for the disruption. Please continue with your opening statement. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. I think Mr. Raskin used my time. Chairman Comer. We will make sure it is right. We will make sure it is---- Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Great. I just want to make sure the American people hear all these facts. Abbe Lowell weaponizes letters to Congress to try to smear my name and misstate the cold hard facts in an attempt to save his powerfully connected client and his father. I challenge Mr. Lowell to make those claims on national television so he can be held accountable for his lies. Prior to my successful business career, I was an officer for over 6 years in the United States Navy's elite Naval Nuclear Power Training Command as a decorated Master Training Specialist. I later served as the Commander's Chief Technology Officer, where I held a Q security clearance from the Department of Energy and the NSA. When I left Nuclear Power Training Command, I was the number-one-ranked direct input officer in the entire Command and then jumped into the business world and public markets. While I have made a few contributions over the years to Democrats, such as Representative Ro Khanna--I do not see him, but I hope he shows up today; he sits on the Democratic side of the Oversight Committee--I am not a political person. I come from a family with a long history of distinguished service in our Nation's military, including my father, both of my grandfathers, and my brother, all of whom were willing to sacrifice their lives for this great country. My sister serves our military vets for 2 decades at the Veterans Administration. We have lived our life as a family in service to this great country. I hope the American people will pay close attention to this hearing. I also hope they will understand that some Members of this Committee will engage in absurd attacks and efforts to try to deflect attention from the facts I will present today by questioning my integrity and my patriotic duty. You may see me speak passionately at this hearing, but for good reason. Not only was I willing to die for this country, every single male member of my immediate family was willing to die for this country. I want to be crystal clear. From my direct personal experience and what I have subsequently come to learn, it is clear to me that Joe Biden was the brand being sold by the Biden family. His family's foreign influence peddling operation from China to Ukraine and elsewhere sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the U.S. Government. Joe Biden was more than a participant in and a beneficiary of his family's business. He was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability. I ask this big question. If there is no evidence of corruption here today, if Joe's conduct and the conduct of his family were fully legal and proper, then why are they so dishonest about it? Not just slight misrepresentations of fact, but deep untruths about the entire corrupt enterprise. Hunter Biden gave his transcribed interview on February 28th and lied throughout his testimony. Here is just one egregious example of Hunter's perjury. He lied to the Committee on important details concerning his money demands and threats to CEFC in text messages on July 30th and 31st, 2017. He leveraged his father's presence next to him in that infamous text to strong-arm CEFC to paying Hunter immediately. Jim Biden also lied extensively throughout his transcribed interview on February 21st and perjured himself. An example of that: on page 100 of his transcript, Jim is asked specifically: ``Do you recall having a meeting with Hunter Biden, Tony Bobulinski, and Joe Biden?'' Jim's response: ``Absolutely not''. The Committee was so shocked by his perjury that they asked him the same question multiple times. Each time he denied meeting with me and Joe Biden. After the Committee showed him text messages confirming that I met with Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Jim Biden at the Beverley Hilton in May 2017, Jim Biden, with a former U.S. attorney lawyer sitting next to him, still denied that meeting took place. Hunter Biden in his own transcribed interview confirmed that that meeting took place. Hunter confirmed his uncle perjured himself in front of this Committee. I am simply here to tell the truth to the American people, and I hope each and every one of you Congressmen and women give me the opportunity to do that instead of focusing on Russia or smearing my family's name or focusing on facts that are irrelevant today. I yield back. Chairman Comer. Thank you. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, a parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Comer. Yes. Mr. Raskin. Just two points. One is, I believe that Mr. Bobulinski went over 2 minutes, 14 seconds. I hope the same courtesy will be given to Mr.---- Chairman Comer. We will give Mr. Parnas equal time. Mr. Raskin. Thank you. And second, I see that we now have a witness appearing remotely, and I thought that witnesses were required to appear in person under the rules adopted by the Majority at the beginning of the Congress. And do we have a new practice with respect to that rule because I know that Members on our side were denied the ability to participate in hearings that were conducted in Florida and Mississippi and Alabama. We wanted to participate by Zoom. So, I hope---- Chairman Comer. And I will answer that. To be able to testify remotely requires a letter from me and approval from the Majority Leader, which we have. And I will enter that---- Mr. Raskin. Good. Chairman Comer [continuing]. Letter into the record, without objection. Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope we will extend the same courtesy to Members of this Committee when they cannot get to a hearing as in Mississippi or Florida. Thank you much. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Chairman, a parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Comer. State your point. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Bobulinski just referred to text messages. I believe he is referring to photos of a BlackBerry. Chairman Comer. What is your parliamentary inquiry? State your parliamentary inquiry because we have got a very important hearing here, and we do not have time for stunts. What is your parliamentary inquiry? Mr. Goldman. It is not a stunt. I am simply asking that Mr. Bobulinski---- Chairman Comer. You do not have a parliamentary inquiry. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Parnas for equal time that Mr. Bobulinski---- Mr. Goldman. Mr. Chairman, does the Committee have in its possession the text messages that---- Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Mr. Parnas---- Mr. Goldman. Does the Committee have the text messages that Mr. Bobulinski---- Ms. Mace. Mr. Chairman, we do not have time for games by Democrats today. Chairman Comer. All right. Listen, we have important witnesses here. This is a credible investigation. Mr. Goldman. I am asking a question from one of your important witnesses. Chairman Comer. You asked for a parliamentary inquiry. You will have 5 minutes whenever Jamie Raskin tells me it is your time to speak. Mr. Parnas, the Chair recognizes you for equal time that Mr. Bobulinski had, which was 7 minutes. STATEMENT OF LEV PARNAS Mr. Parnas. Thank you. Hello. Honorable Members of Congress, Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and Members of the Oversight Committee, I am humbled and thankful to show up before you today. I came to the United States from Odesa, Ukraine in 1976 when it was still the former Soviet Union. My mother, father, sister, and I had left the Soviet Union, escaping antisemitism and persecution. While in Rome en route to Israel, my sister and I won the most important opportunity that we have ever been given. We won the U.S. Green Card Lottery. My family came here with literally no more than shirts on our back and the hopes of rebuilding our lives in the land of freedom. I say this to you because I love this country. From shortly after my arrest on October 9, 2019 to now, I have been trying to share the irrefutable truth with you. The American people have been lied to by Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and various cohorts of individuals in government and media positions. They created falsehoods to serve their own interests, knowing it would undermine the strength of our Nation. From November 2018 to October 2018, I was a key participant and a witness to numerous efforts to prove that Joe and Hunter Biden were linked to corruption in Ukraine. Rudy Giuliani, on behalf of then-President Donald Trump, tasked me with a mission to travel the globe, finding dirt on the Bidens so then an array of networks could spread misinformation about them, thus securing the 2020 election for Donald J. Trump. Ironically, when I was arrested, my original indictment linked me to an individual referred to as Unindicted Co-Conspirator One. We now know this individual to be Congressman Pete Sessions, who sits on this very Committee today. Today, I ask you to consider the following. In nearly a year traveling the world and interviewing officials in different countries, I found precisely zero evidence of the Bidens' corruption in Ukraine. No credible sources ever provided proof of criminal activity, not the FBI, CIA, nor the NSA. No respectable Ukrainian official has ever said that the Bidens did anything illegal, including former President Poroshenko and former prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko. Even when the CEO of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, was offered a deal by Rudy Giuliani in exchange for information on the Bidens, he provided none because there is none. The only information ever pushed on the Bidens in Ukraine has come from one source and one source only: Russia and Russian agents. The impeachment proceedings that bring us here now are predicated on false information spread by the Kremlin. Everyone involved knew they were sharing lies. From Trump and Giuliani's shadow diplomacy; through my missions to Ukraine and elsewhere; through members of BLT team, a group convened for the sole purpose of investigating and damaging the Bidens, everything was for the ultimate benefit of Donald Trump and, thereby, Vladimir Putin. Because the team's investigations were centered around Biden and Ukraine, I was designated the point person in every matter they pursued. That is how I know with certainty that these Biden stories are untrue then and are untrue now. Congressman Pete Sessions, then-Congressman Devin Nunes, Senator Ron Johnson, and many others understood they were pushing a false narrative. The same goes for John Solomon, Sean Hannity, and media personnel, particularly with Fox News, who used this narrative to manipulate the public ahead of the 2020 elections. Sadly, they are still doing this today as we approach the 2024 elections. We cannot separate this conspiracy from the Russian-Ukraine War because Trump has no intention to keep aiding Ukraine. Without the support of the United States and NATO, millions in Ukraine will suffer and die. If we allow Russia to defeat Ukraine, eventually that suffering will reach American shores. Today, I admit my own wrongdoings. I have been convicted on Federal election campaign and fraud crimes and served my sentence. I do not hide that from reality. It is part of my truth. Despite rigorous attempts by those in power to silence me, I will be silenced no longer. Thank you to the Committee for allowing me to speak. I look forward to answering any and all of your questions. Chairman Comer. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Galanis for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF JASON GALANIS Mr. Galanis. Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and Members of the Committee, my name is Jason Galanis. I was a business partner of Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, among others, during the years 2014 to 2015. Our business included the acquisition of an 85-year-old Wall Street firm, Burnham & Company, the $1.5 billion surviving division of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Our objective was to build a diversified private equity platform which would be anchored by a globally known Wall Street brand together with a globally known political name: Biden. Our goal--that is, Hunter Biden, Devon Archer and me--was to make billions, not millions. The entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden. In 2014, we believed that the Burnham enterprise would be significantly enhanced by forming a partnership with Harvest Fund Management, a $300 billion Chinese financial service company closely connected to the Chinese Communist Party. This effort was led by Hunter Biden's contact with Henry Zhao, the Harvest chairman. Mr. Zhao was interested in this partnership because of the game-changing value-add of the Biden family, including Joe Biden, who was to be a member of the Burnham- Harvest team post the vice presidency. My lawyer provided to the Committee a draft email, dated August 23, 2014, drafted for Hunter Biden that reflects this understanding. It states, ``Michael, please also remind Henry Zhao of our conversation about a board seat for a certain relation of mine. Devon and I golfed with that relation earlier last week, and we discussed this very idea, and as always, he remains very, very keen on the opportunity.'' I am certain that this phrase ``a certain relation of mine'' refers to Vice President Biden. Devon told me about this golf course conversation shortly after it happened. Ultimately, this paragraph was deleted from the final version, with Hunter following our general rule of thumb on business deals: ``Say it, forget it. Write it, regret it.'' Further to that, I recall being with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer at the Peninsula Bar in New York, where Hunter took a call from his father and told him things were going well with Henry Zhao and Harvest and that he might need a little help getting it across the finish line. It was not the only time I heard Hunter speaking with his father for business reasons. I was present when Hunter called his father on May 4, 2014 on his cellphone, put it on speaker mode to have him say hello to Yelena Baturina, a Russian oligarch and an investor in Rosemont projects, and her husband, Yuri Luzhkov, the former mayor of Moscow. Devon Archer was also there. Hunter said, ``I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello.'' The Vice President said hello and some pleasantries and then, ``Hope you had safe travels,'' and then said, ``OK. You be good to my boy.'' Hunter responded by saying, ``Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.'' The Vice President said something about ``being helpful,'' and Hunter ended the call by saying he was going to call his father later. Before this call, Hunter sat next to Yelena Baturina at the table, and I heard them speaking on business matters generally. A few days after this May 4th party, an email my lawyer provided to this Committee shows that Devon had confirmed Ms. Baturina was committed to a ``hard order'' of $10 million to $20 million in a Burnham investment banking client. In an effort to build this financial platform, I engaged in unlawful conduct. Our companies were entrusted with $11 billion of union pension fund money, whose trust I betrayed. I pleaded guilty. I have had 8 years in Federal custody to reflect on my actions. I am profoundly sorry for committing these crimes. I deserve the lengthy sentence I received. Nevertheless, as I set out more fully in my full statement, I believe the SDNY prosecutors did not indict Hunter Biden on the same deal for political reasons despite then-available documentation that we were partners, we were involved in decisionmaking that involved illegal self-dealing, and all of us had financially benefited from these schemes. In fact, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer's company, Rosemont Seneca Bohai, received $15 million from the tribal bonds fraudulent scheme to be invested in the Burnham group. I have offered all this information to the government about Hunter Biden's crimes, but the prosecutors have been uninterested. In my request for commutation I filed with the DOJ on December 2020, I did provide information about Hunter's culpability. The DOJ has retaliated against me and vigorously objected to my being placed in home confinement pursuant to the CARES Act. I applied for home confinement on February 4, 2023, and I was approved on June 9. On June 12, this committee issued a subpoena for Devon Archer, and the BOP reversed my approval on June 13, with the SDNY prosecutors strongly objecting to my release. I have been appealing this reversal, and, with each stage, the BOP reason for my denial has changed. During this period, the period beginning in January 2023, I was sexually assaulted by a member of prison staff at FPC Pensacola. He persisted in sexually harassing me for many months thereafter. I had hoped to receive home confinement to remove me from the danger. My judgment was clouded by the shame I felt for not being able to prevent the attacks. I was well aware, as all inmates are, that the Bureau of Prisons had a horrible record on these matters. I believed my disclosure would have made things worse for me. Unfortunately, the sexual harassment continued until early August when the prison correctional officer's comments became more threatening. I feared for my safety. I decided to seek counseling from Chaplain Dixon the next day, on August 10, 2023. The chaplain was visibly upset by the events and asked to bring in Warden Saulsberry, who quickly opened a PREA investigation, which is a reference to the Prison Rape Elimination Act passed by Congress. And after further debriefings, I was immediately escorted to a vehicle and driven by senior staff hours to FPC Montgomery, a separate facility. I am grateful the Committee has opened up an investigation into these matters, and I appreciate Chairmen Jordan and Comer and Subcommittee Chairman Biggs signing the letter. I believe I have been a victim of a pattern of retribution by the Department of Justice. I believe I am putting myself at grave risk within the BOP for providing information on these matters concerning the President and his son. I have been treated professionally at Montgomery. I want to thank Case Manager Coordinator Anthony Barnes and Warden Randy Keyes for their help in facilitating access to my attorney prior to this interview. Chairman Comer. Thank you, Mr. Galanis, and I want to thank all the witnesses again for being here today. We will now begin the questions, and I want to remind Members on both sides of the aisle each Member has 5 minutes. I am going to adhere to that and hit the gavel. If the question has been asked, then we will allow the witnesses time to respond, but we are going to try to get in a lot of questions from a lot of Members. And I will begin the questioning followed by Ranking Member Raskin. Again, Mr. Bobulinski, thank you for your service to our country, your military service. I appreciate you being here. During the 118th Congress, this Committee has investigated Joe Biden's involvement in his family's influence peddling schemes around the world. So, let us start with that. Mr. Bobulinski, was Joe Biden involved with any of your business dealings with Hunter Biden and James Biden? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, he was. Chairman Comer. Was Joe Biden involved in his family's attempts to sell their access to him? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, he was. Chairman Comer. You set out to form a legitimate business with the Bidens. Did you come to find out that the Biden family had no interest in doing real business? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. Chairman Comer. Mr. Galanis, are you aware of any times Hunter Biden used Joe Biden with Joe Biden's knowledge to benefit their business associates? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Chairman Comer. Which business associates? Mr. Galanis. Yelena Baturina, the Russian oligarch---- Chairman Comer. Russian. Mr. Galanis. Russian; Chinese; the Chinese fund manager, Henry Zhao; and Mykola Zlochevsky, the Ukrainian oil and gas oligarch. Chairman Comer. OK. Now that we have established that Joe Biden was involved in his family's business dealings, I would like to turn to the financial records we have subpoenaed. One major point my Democrat colleagues downplay is how much money the Biden's accumulated from foreign business ventures in such a short period of time. We have over $24 million to the Biden family and their business associates from 2014, while Joe Biden was Vice President, to 2019. Mr. Bobulinski, there came a time when you were attempting to raise $10 million from the Chinese to pursue an actual business deal, a real business deal, but it would not be correct to say this was a $10 million deal, would it? What did the Bidens conceive of the business with the Chinese becoming? Mr. Bobulinski. The Chinese were committing to deploying billions of dollars in infrastructure projects here in the United States as well as around the world. Chairman Comer. Mr. Galanis, what was the financial goal you, Mr. Archer, and Hunter Biden set out to achieve? Was it millions of dollars or billions of dollars? Mr. Galanis. Billions of dollars, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Billions with a ``B?'' Mr. Galanis. Yes, billions. Chairman Comer. Now, I would like to turn to some of the statements Joe Biden has made during his presidency about the findings of this investigation. Mr. Bobulinski, Joe Biden has said he never interacted with his family's business associates. Did he meet with you? Mr. Bobulinski. He did. Chairman Comer. In fact, are you aware---- Mr. Bobulinski. He did on multiple---- Chairman Comer [continuing]. Joe Biden also met with---- Mr. Bobulinski. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Yes, go ahead. Mr. Bobulinski. He did on multiple times. Chairman Comer. OK. Are you aware that Joe Biden also met with Rob Walker, Eric Schwerin, and Devon Archer too? Mr. Bobulinski. I am generally aware of it. Chairman Comer. Mr. Galanis, as you discussed earlier regarding Yelena Baturina, the Russian oligarch, you were present for Hunter Biden calling his then-Vice President father with the Russian oligarch, Yelena Baturina, present, correct? Mr. Galanis. That is correct. Chairman Comer. You also were present for Hunter Biden's conversation with his father about a board seat on a Chinese company board. Is that correct? Mr. Galanis. I was present for a call where some Chinese transaction was discussed, yes. Chairman Comer. So, Mr. Galanis, isn't it true that when Joe Biden said he did not interact with his family's business associates, that is not true, is it? Mr. Galanis. I believe it would be misleading to the point of being a non-truth. Chairman Comer. I want to touch on the fact about the absent seat in the middle. Hunter Biden has chosen not to attend today's proceedings, and I have given Mr. Biden exactly what he asked for before his deposition. It is clear that Hunter Biden knows his testimony would not withstand public scrutiny. Joe Biden has not been truthful about his participation in schemes to sell access and influence, and today's witnesses will show the American people a side of the story that the President and his allies on this side of the aisle are eager to hide. Mr. Bobulinski, can you tell us about your meeting at the Beverly Hilton with Joe Biden? Mr. Bobulinski. The short version or long version? Chairman Comer. Long version, but within a minute. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. So, Hunter Biden, Jim Biden, and Joe Biden were in Los Angeles for a variety of business discussions. Joe was there to speak at the Milken Conference in May 2017. I had lunch with Hunter Biden at the Chateau Marmont, and he had asked me to meet with his father that night. He set up a meeting at the Beverly Hilton, where they hold the Milken Conference. And I got there a bit early and sat with Jim Biden, Hunter Biden, and we were just talking about what we were doing with the Chinese and the legal documents I was working through. And they had sort of coached me before Joe showed up. They said, listen, we are going to just keep things at a very high level. We are not going to go into a lot of details in this meeting. And I just remember that discussion generally because it just struck me as odd, honestly. Joe was not in the White House then, and that they were sort of framing it that way. And then Joe showed up, walked through the lobby of the Beverly Hilton Hotel. I stood up to shake his hand, and we sat down and spent 45 minutes to an hour going through my background. Chairman Comer. You met with him that long? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, yes, yes. This was not a handshake---- Chairman Comer. All right. Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. A 2-second discussion about the weather. This was a 45-minute---- Mr. Goldman. How long is this going to go on? Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Long meeting to an hour, where we talked about a lot of stuff. Chairman Comer. Very good. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Ranking Member Raskin for his questions. Mr. Raskin. But we are actually going to go to Mr. Garcia to begin. Mr. Garcia. Great. Thank you very much and thank you again. I just want to, just for the record, be very clear that in Mr. Bobulinski's testimony, he has provided zero evidence--zero evidence--of any sort of link between Hunter Biden and the President, as far as it relates to the business dealings. And so once again, we are back to a hearing where no evidence is being provided of any sort of wrongdoing by the President, but I want to go back---- Mr. Bobulinski. That is a blatant lie. Mr. Garcia. [continuing]. Actually, it is my time, sir. Mr. Bobulinski, I want to go back to the private deposition that we had. I was one of a handful of Democrats in that private, on-the-record, under-oath conversation we had. And during that deposition, I asked you a question of which you gave a false answer to, and I want to go back to that. I asked you specifically who got you into the Presidential debate that was attended by you and others, and that, of course, was a huge moment in that campaign, and you could not recall. In fact, you said, ``I do not recall who got me into the debate.'' Do you remember telling me that, sir? Mr. Bobulinski. You were playing semantics, trying to ask me as if somebody called me directly and gave me a ticket like going to a movie---- Mr. Garcia. Sir, I am going to reclaim my time, sir. Mr. Bobulinski. I told you that my lawyer---- Mr. Garcia. I am going to reclaim my time. What I said was---- Mr. Bobulinski. [continuing]. Well, you asked me a question, Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia. I am reclaiming my time. Thank you, sir. Actually, what I asked you was, ``Do you recall who actually got you into the Presidential debate?'' You actually said, ``I do not recall who got me into the debate.'' You did not remember who got you into the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Mr. Bobulinski. That is not a true statement. Mr. Garcia. Sir, you quoted, ``I don't recall who got me into the debate.'' It is on page 102 of the transcript. Mr. Bobulinski. You did not ask me whether I was a guest of Mr. Biden---- Mr. Garcia. Sir, I asked you that question. Thank you. I will reclaim my time. I am not asking you a question right now. Thank you very much, sir. In fact, here, as was shown by Ranking Member Raskin, we know that you were in the debate actually sitting adjacent and next to Trump officials. When you were confronted again on the same question, Mr. Bobulinski, if you were a guest of Mr. Trump at the debate, you responded and you quoted, once the Wall Street Journal called you out, ``Is the Wall Street Journal God or something? Like, you act like this is some encyclopedia of fact.'' And you refused to still confirm that you are a guest of Donald Trump, so I want to ask you one more time, sir. Were you a guest of Donald Trump at the Presidential debate? Mr. Bobulinski. Mr. Garcia, those were not the questions you asked me in my transcribed interview. You were trying to ask semantical question. Mr. Garcia. Answer the question, sir. Were you a guest of Donald Trump? Mr. Bobulinski. I was clearly a guest of Donald Trump at the debate. It was obvious to everyone in the world at that point. You are asking me semantical questions. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, sir. So, you were a guest? You answered the question because at the time you said in the transcript, under oath, ``I do not recall who got me into to the debate,'' so just to be clear. So, I want to keep going. So, you also call yourself you are not a political person, yet you went to a Presidential debate on behalf of Donald Trump. I want to also make it clear that you made numerous claims and allegations, you have made them today, you have made them before. And yet, even though you are not a political person-- this is also another photo of you--you actually chose to show up at a press conference for Donald Trump prior to the debate because you are not a political person. Did you show up to a press conference for Donald Trump before the debate? Mr. Bobulinski. I cannot qualify whether it was for Donald Trump. Mr. Garcia. Do you know who invited you? Sir, who invited you to the debate? Donald Trump, you said. Who invited you to the press conference? Mr. Bobulinski. My lawyers coordinated things, and I showed up. Mr. Garcia. Well, sir, I will tell you, it was Jason Miller--it has been very clear, it has been reported--who actually worked under the part of the Donald Trump Campaign. Here you are at a Donald Trump press conference, and you cannot remember how you got to the press conference. You refuse to answer how you actually gotten to the Donald Trump debate with Joe Biden. Do you remember speaking at the press conference? Mr. Bobulinski. I do very clearly. Mr. Garcia. You do. Do you know who Jason Miller is, sir? Mr. Bobulinski. I do know of him. Yes. Mr. Garcia. Do you know that he was a Trump Campaign staffer? Mr. Bobulinski. Mr. Garcia, you keep asking me semantical questions. You underestimate that I had three lawyers around me that were coordinating my travel, where I was going, and so forth. Mr. Garcia. Well, sir, interesting---- Mr. Bobulinski. So, please stop. Mr. Garcia. Well, I reclaim my time. Thank you very much. It is interesting, sir, because you show up to a pre-debate press conference, you show up to a Presidential debate, both invited to by a person running for the presidency of the United States. You know the stakes are high, yet you have no idea how you got to the press conference. You do not remember how you got to the debate. And here you are speaking at a press conference of which the national media---- Mr. Bobulinski. I do remember. Mr. Garcia. So, how did you get to this press conference? Mr. Bobulinski. I flew on a plane. Mr. Garcia. Who invited you? Mr. Bobulinski. Are we going in circles on who invited? Mr. Garcia. Sir, who invited you to the press conference? Mr. Bobulinski. My lawyers told me I was invited to come to Tennessee. At that point I was trying to get the truth and the facts out to the American people. At that moment in time, if I recall, I believe 80 million people watched that debate, and that was probably the No. 1---- Mr. Garcia. Thank you, sir. I reclaim my time. Well, with that, I think it is very clear for someone that cannot remember how he got to a Donald Trump press conference or a Donald Trump debate, you are completely an uncredible witness, sir. Thank you, and I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Jason Smith, for 5 minutes. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have previously heard from two IRS whistleblowers that Joe Biden was the brand being sold by his family members. One such example of this could be seen in a June 6, 2017, WhatsApp message where Hunter Biden told a business associate that he was not willing to ``sign over my family's brand'' or give them ``the keys to my family's only asset.'' Mr. Bobulinski, can you confirm that President Biden is the brand being sold by his family members? Mr. Bobulinski. I can. It is a hundred percent right. Mr. Smith. Thank you. During his deposition, Hunter Biden repeatedly testified under oath that his father was not involved in his business in any capacity and that there was not even a connection between his father and his businesses. Here is just one example, ``I just state for the record one more time, under oath and under penalty of perjury, my father has never been involved in my business. I have never asked my father to be involved in my business. My father has never benefited from my business, and I have never asked anyone or my father to do anything for the benefit of anyone I have ever done business for.'' Yet the Ways and Means Committee released a WhatsApp message that were provided by the IRS whistleblowers showing that Hunter Biden wrote on July 30, 2007, ``I am sitting here with my father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father.'' Moreover, you testified that Hunter was not shy about his ability to get his father on the phone, and Devon Archer testified that there were multiple instances in which Hunter placed his dad on speakerphone. Mr. Bobulinski, was Hunter Biden telling the truth when he testified under oath that his father was never involved in any of his business dealings? Mr. Bobulinski. No, he was not. Those are all blatant lies. Mr. Smith. We continue to hear claims that President Biden was not involved in his family's business dealings and that he did not benefit from illicit business deals. However, IRS Special Agent Joe Ziegler provided documents to the Ways and Means Committee, 327 emails, many of which involve Hunter Biden and Hunter Biden's business associates. Mr. Bobulinski, do you have any personal experience that leads you to believe that Joe Biden was involved with Hunter Biden's business associates and business dealings? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, I do. Mr. Smith. You want to say a few? Mr. Bobulinski. To outline how Joe was involved? Mr. Smith. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Different Congressmen and women keep trying to say that there is no evidence and use the word ``involved,'' which is a very opaque claim. If Joe Biden was not involved in his son's business dealings, why after flying all the way across the country to the Milken Conference, where there is, next to Davos, is probably the biggest conference in the world, why would he take 45 minutes out of his night? It was not a 10 a.m. meeting. It was 10:40 in the evening. He is an elderly man, flew all the way across country to sit with me for 45 minutes to an hour to discuss my background, the business we are doing with the Chinese, his family's background. Mr. Smith. Speaking of the business with the Chinese, in October 2020, Joe Biden asserted that his family had not earned money through business dealings in China. However, IRS whistleblowers shared evidence that the Biden family made at least $1.1 million from their business with China, including $100,000 in payment from CEFC China Energy and a $1 million payment in exchange for legal services that were never provided to a CEFC official, Patrick Ho. Mr. Bobulinski, do you know whether the Biden family made any money from China. Mr. Bobulinski. They did. Millions of dollars. I think approximately $8 million to $9 million. Mr. Smith. The Biden family has made millions of dollars from China, correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Smith. And you said at least $9 million. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. I think it is actually over $10 million, but I will leave those details up to you guys. Mr. Smith. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member. Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Parnas, for being here today. Your involvement with the real Russian hoax about Joe Biden began in 2018 when, as a big donor and a big supporter of Donald Trump's, you were introduced to Rudy Giuliani, and you began working with him to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine. If you can just tell us quickly how you got involved in that. Mr. Parnas. Yes. I was a donor at the time. I began doing business with Rudy Giuliani. He got involved in a business I was doing called Fraud Guarantee and in the midst we started spending a lot of time together and until, eventually, in November 2018, he approached me and asked me about my connections in Ukraine. After telling him about people that I knew and things that I heard, at that point then he wanted me to go to Ukraine to find Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general. Mr. Raskin. And basically, he wanted to go from his Fraud Guarantee to guaranteeing a fraud on the American people. But after turning over every stone and going down every rabbit hole, including interviewing Viktor Shokin and Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma, did you ever find this smoking gun or any evidence that Donald Trump was looking for to paste on Joe Biden? Mr. Parnas. On the contrary, Representative Raskin, not only did we keep hitting dead walls and not finding the smoking gun, but we kept running into sources of the information that was coming out of Russia. Mr. Raskin. In fact, Joe Biden was part of a global campaign, including by the United States, to oppose corruption and to go after the corrupt forces in Ukraine. Isn't that right? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Raskin. At what point did the campaign to dig up dirt on Biden become a campaign to spread disinformation and lies about Biden? Mr. Parnas. At some point, when we hit a few brick walls, all of a sudden then I saw the shift between the BLT group, which included John Solomon, the media personality, and Rudy Giuliani, and other Trump lawyers, to start trying to push narratives that were not validated. We had no way to validate them. Basically, a letter would come over from somebody in Ukraine. I would hand it over to John Solomon. Next thing you know, he was on Fox TV 2 hours later with Sean Hannity. Mr. Raskin. At what point did Mr. Giuliani begin working directly with Russian agents and Russian assets, individuals who would later become sanctioned by Donald Trump's own Treasury Department, for spreading propaganda and disinformation against Joe Biden? Mr. Parnas. It was sometime in probably around May-June 2019. Mr. Raskin. Were you aware, was Mr. Giuliani aware that these people were basically just doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely. Mr. Raskin. So, he had no hesitation about spreading lies that were concocted by Russian agents? Mr. Parnas. As long as it fit the narrative, absolutely not. Mr. Raskin. How were you and Giuliani able to take these false allegations, peddled by corrupt officials and Russian agents, and promote and amplify them here in the United States, in our political system? Weren't media groups skeptical of your claims? Mr. Parnas. Most media groups, I would probably say, all except for Fox and a few other right-wing media groups, did not want to take any of the information, and that aggravated Rudy Giuliani and John Solomon and other players, and the main group that was being pushed through was Fox, Sean Hannity and some other media personalities over there. But then there was also other people that were doing the bidding for the Russian people in Congress, like Senator Ron Johnson, like Congressman Pete Sessions that sits here right now, that was with me from the very beginning in this journey into finding or digging dirt on Joe Biden. Mr. Raskin. Is Putin's war on Ukraine today, which has cost hundreds of thousands of people's lives, is that part of the vaunted Russia hoax? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely not. Mr. Raskin. Is it real? Mr. Parnas. Yes, absolutely. Mr. Raskin. I want to ask you one more personal question, if I might, Mr. Parnas, because in my several years living through this extraordinary period of American history, I have tried to ask people like Michael Cohen and Cassidy Hutchinson, I have wondered about people like General Milley, General Kelly, why did you break with all of the deceit and corruption and lies of Donald Trump? How did you get out of that culture? Mr. Parnas. I mean, it was very difficult. I actually had to hit a brick wall myself and get arrested and to be able to get out of that cult because when you are in that cult, when you are around them, you have blinders on, and you are only able to see a certain amount of information. You are only able to hear the certain amount of information. You are not allowed to go out on the outside, out of the circle, and if you go outside of the circle, then you are not in the circle, so eventually, you brainwash yourself to believing certain things that are not true. When I was arrested and had some time to reflect and really understand what was going on, I started realizing, looking back and thinking back to moments in time where I started thinking to myself that this cannot be true, and we are doing something wrong. Mr. Raskin. Well, thank you for telling the truth and helping America to end this nightmare. I yield back to you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Ranking Member just said that, ``Joe Biden was opposed to corruption.'' Really? So opposed, he leveraged a billion dollars of American tax money to fire the prosecutor in Ukraine who was investigating Zlochevsky at Burisma, the company Hunter Biden sat on the board. Wow. And the prosecutor who replaced Shokin that Mr. Parnas referenced in his opening statement, Mr. Lutsenko, guess what he did? He took Zlochevsky off the wanted list and dropped the charges. Wow. He is really, really opposed to corruption there. Mr. Bobulinski, who is the ``Big Guy''? Mr. Bobulinski. Joe Biden. Mr. Jordan. Are you sure about that? Mr. Bobulinski. Joe Biden. Mr. Jordan. You sure? Mr. Bobulinski. I am a thousand percent sure. Mr. Jordan. Because when Hunter Biden did his deposition under oath, he said, ``I do not know who it is,'' even though he was copied on an email that said, ``H will hold 10 percent for the ``Big Guy''.'' You sure the ``Big Guy'' is Joe Biden? Mr. Bobulinski. A thousand percent, and there are other text messages that back that up that the brave whistleblowers, Shapley and Ziegler, had produced, not from my phones, not from my Blackberry that I took screenshots from. They took them from subpoenas directly from Apple's iCloud that back up the fact that Hunter knew the ``Big Guy'' was Joe Biden. Mr. Jordan. The ``Big Guy'' is the brand. The ``Big Guy'' is the lift. The ``Big Guy'' is the one who showed up at golf outings, who took phone calls in meetings and lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business associates. Is that right? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Jordan. Mr. Galanis, you referenced in your opening statement, May 4, 2014, you were at a party at a restaurant in Brooklyn, New York. Can you tell me who else was there? Mr. Galanis. Yes. It was a birthday party. So, there were more than a 100 people there, but amongst them was Devon Archer; myself; the host, Alex Makarski; Yelena Baturina; her husband; and then Hunter Biden joined after I arrived. Mr. Jordan. And tell us, I think you referenced a phone call that took place. Tell the Committee what happened with that phone call. Who was involved in that phone call? Mr. Galanis. As I testified in my opening statement, it was already said it was Yelena Baturina, her husband, myself, Hunter initiating it, Joe Biden on the speaker phone, and Devon Archer. Mr. Jordan. So, there is a little pull aside where that group of people you just described, pulled aside and Hunter Biden called his father or called the Vice President. Is that accurate? Mr. Galanis. That is accurate. Mr. Jordan. And then tell me what was discussed on the call. Mr. Galanis. As I testified, it was a relatively short discussion, but it was a discussion about Yelena and Yuriy coming to town. As I testified specifically, they talked about being good to his boy. And then it ended---- Mr. Jordan. Well, let me ask you this. Mr. Galanis, let me ask you this. Did you get the impression Joe Biden was expecting the call? Mr. Galanis. Yes. To me it was clearly set up ahead of time. It was an arranged call. Mr. Jordan. So, this was arranged. This was coordinated. Hunter Biden calls his father, then Vice President, and I think in your deposition, you said he said this, ``I am here with our friends that I told you were coming to town.'' So, it is ``our friends'' and ``I told you this was going to happen,'' which suggests that it was most definitely coordinated. Is that accurate? Mr. Galanis. That is accurate, yes. Mr. Jordan. And again, can you tell the Committee who Ms. Baturina is again? Mr. Galanis. A Russian billionaire, wife of the former mayor of Moscow, served for nearly 20 years as the mayor. Mr. Jordan. She is the wealthiest woman in Russia. She had already given money to Hunter Biden in his business before this meeting in May, and then subsequent to that meeting, she committed to give more money. Is that accurate? Mr. Galanis. That is accurate. Mr. Jordan. So, subsequent to the coordinated call, the arranged call that Hunter Biden had with the Vice President of United States, the wealthiest woman in Russia commits to give millions of dollars more to Hunter Biden's business. Is that all accurate, Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. That is accurate, yes. Mr. Jordan. And again, this was a pull aside done at this meeting, and you think and you know that it was coordinated. Is this what they call access to the brand, access to the Biden lift? Is that what you would describe it as, Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. I do not think there is any doubt that that was the intent of the call and the objective, yes. Mr. Jordan. And it followed the motto, it followed the statement that you all agreed to ``say it, forget it; write it, regret it.'' This was not put in writing. This was a phone call on a speaker. That was all. There is no writing about this. It was all done that way. That was how the business operated. Is that correct, Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Mr. Jordan. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Lynch from Massachusetts for 5 minutes. Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to make an observation here. I have been on this Committee, this investigating Committee for over 20 years. And as an attorney before that, I have had sufficient training and experience to say that, with high confidence, that when you review the entire record of evidence of these hearings going back over a year, you have actually provided more evidence to impeach Donald Trump for a third time than you have in so much as laying a glove on President Biden. We keep on hearing about the Biden family. When you hear someone say, ``the Biden family,'' that translates into we have no evidence on the President, so we are going to use the Biden family to try to implicate President Biden. But by the constant bumbling and continually shifting arguments here, you have done nothing more than exonerate President Biden. For months, we heard about the Hunter Biden laptop, and there were absolutely some embarrassing photos on that and some awful information about Hunter Biden's personal life, I will admit that. Then you bring in your own witnesses, your legal experts before this Committee, and had them testify, and what they said was amazing. They said there was no evidence to even suggest that there was support for articles of impeachment against the President. That was your legal experts, the Republican legal experts that said that. Then we have statements by Mr. Jordan saying that Mr. Smirnov was the most corroborating witness that the Republicans had, the strongest witness that they had. And course, after that we find out, through the Trump-appointed prosecutor, that all of the information that Mr. Smirnov had provided was fabricated, false, and submitted by the inducement of Russian agents going after President Biden and trying to undermine our democratic system. And now we come to a point where, since that witness blew up, now we are going to prison where we are reaching out to witnesses who have been convicted and sentenced to prison for stealing $80 million from the pensions of innocent workers. We cannot get any lower at this point. That is your star witness. I want to remind people, he is sitting in prison. That is why he cannot be here today. He is sitting in prison for scamming workers' pensions. I mean, how low can you get, that it is the Republicans' idea that this is the best guy they can get to testify against the President. This is the best guy they can get, a guy sitting in prison who cannot even be here. Mr. Parnas, you have talked about your own direct involvement with Mr. Giuliani, and you said that your mission was to dig up dirt on President Biden. Can you talk to us about the coordination between yourself and Mr. Giuliani? Thank you for being here. Mr. Parnas. Thank you, Congressman. So, basically, it was a shadow diplomacy run by Trump and Giuliani where Giuliani was the shadow policy Secretary of State. I was his right hand and basically the point person in Ukraine to not only dig up, validate, search, whatever needed to be done to try to find some corruption against Joe or Hunter Biden to be able to present. Once I would receive whatever information I received, I would then meet with him, John Solomon, and other members of the team, like Pete Sessions and Derek Harvey or other people there, to discuss what we found. At that point, from there, Giuliani would then go to the White House and share with the President, and that was the line of communication. Mr. Lynch. You said also in your testimony that Members of this Committee, Republican leadership, should have known before Smirnov was indicted that this information was fabricated about President Biden. Could you talk about that? Mr. Parnas. Congressman Lynch, not that they should have known, they did know. They knew exactly what was going on. They knew that the evidence was not vetted. This information was just coming in from anywhere from left to right field, and it was being pushed straight to the halls of Congress without zero verification of it. Mr. Lynch. OK. Thank you. Gentlemen, my time has expired, and I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. Before I recognize Mr. Palmer, I would like to enter into the record the testimony of Tony Bobulinski with the committee on February 13, 2024. It corrects the record of Representative Garcia's, who did not provide your entire testimony. On page 147, you told the Committee about your understanding of who invited you to the events referenced by Mr. Garcia. So, without objection, I would like to enter into the record the entire transcribed interview of Tony Bobulinski. Mr. Raskin. And Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter for the record an article from today's Daily Beast entitled, ``Texts Reveal More Russia Ties for Key Anti-Biden Witness, Bobulinski.'' Chairman Comer. OK. Daily Beast, without objection. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Palmer from Alabama for 5 minutes. Mr. Palmer. Mr. Bobulinski, I have very limited time, and I want to get through a lot of information, so please answer these questions with a ``yes'' or ``no,'' if you do not mind. You have met Joe Biden. Isn't that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Palmer. In fact, you had a meeting with Joe Biden. Isn't that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Two of them. Mr. Palmer. One of those times was before the Milken Conference in Los Angeles, May 2017. Is that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. It was during the Milken Conference. [Chart] Mr. Palmer. You provided a great deal of documentation to this Committee. I want to show you some messages between you and Hunter Biden, they will be on the screen here, in May 2017, before you first had a meeting with Joe Biden. These are messages between you and Hunter Biden dated May 2, 2017. Do you recognize these? Mr. Bobulinski. I do. Mr. Palmer. At the bottom, Hunter wrote, ``Dad not in now until 11. Let me and Jim meet at 10 at Beverly Hilton where he is staying.'' Jim is James Biden, President Biden's brother. Is that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. [Chart] Mr. Palmer. The next set of messages is, if you would put those on screen, is between another business associate of Hunter Biden's and you. His name is James. Do you recognize it? Mr. Bobulinski. I do. Mr. Palmer. At the top you write, ``About to meet Hunter, Jim and, I guess, Joe at Beverly Hilton Hotel.'' Joe is now President Joe Biden. Is that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Palmer. This chat between you and Jim Biden, Joe Biden's brother, you write to Jim, ``Great to meet you and spend some time together. Please thank Joe for this time. Was great to talk. Thanks, Tony B.'' You met with Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Jim Biden the night before the Milken Conference in 2017. Is that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. I did, and Jim Biden perjured himself by trying to deny that meeting. Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Bobulinski. That was at the Beverly Hilton, correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Palmer. You can provide more details around that meeting. What was the purpose of that meeting? Mr. Bobulinski. I did not ask for the meeting, so I wish Hunter Biden was sitting next to me and he could, under oath, describe it. But the only reason why I was meeting with Joe Biden, and the only reason why I was there is because I was the CEO of the enterprise that they were putting together with the Chinese company, CEFC. Mr. Palmer. So, can you give me a little more detail about what was discussed in the meeting? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, as I said earlier, before Joe Biden showed up, Hunter and Jim Biden coached me, asked to sort of outline that we would not go into a lot of details. So, through the 45-to 60-minute meeting I had with Joe Biden--I think it was about 10:40 p.m., after he flew cross country--we talked about my background, my family's military background, the different business ventures I had done around the world, the family I have worked with. Joe spent time talking about his family, some of the tragedies that they had lived through, and then at a high level, Hunter actually introduced me to Joe because before Joe came and sat down with us, Hunter said, ``Hey, give me 5 to 10 minutes. I need to read my father in on it.'' Mr. Palmer. So, when you are referencing Joe, and Hunter's father, you are referencing President Joe Biden. Mr. Bobulinski. I am. Mr. Palmer. Correct. [Chart] Mr. Palmer. These four images--well, in this message you sent to James--and you said you spent more time with Joe and Jim this morning, and to be factually correct, that is President Joe Biden and James Biden, his brother. ``Also saw them last night, including Hunter.'' These four images show a pretty clear record of your meeting with Joe Biden in May 2017, Mr. Bobulinski. Hunter Biden, during his transcribed interview, testified that the meeting did, in fact, take place. And after being asked, ``Did Mr. Bobulinski meet with your father during the trip,'' Hunter stated, ``He met with him in the lobby of the hotel.'' When asked, ``Who attended the meeting?'' Hunter replied, ``Michael and myself,'' but when asked whether the meeting at the Beverly Hilton between Joe Biden, Jim Biden, Hunter Biden, and Tony Bobulinski took place, Jim Biden testified, ``Absolutely not.'' These stories do not match up. Mr. Chairman, Jim Biden also told the Committee that Joe Biden did not meet the Chinese businessman, Ye Jianming. Rob Walker, by no means a friendly witness of the Committee, said the opposite. So, Mr. Chairman, it appears to me that there are material inconsistencies between the witnesses' testimony. These witnesses' statements appear to me to be irreconcilable. In short, Mr. Chairman, someone appears to be lying to the Committee. The inconsistent testimony seems to come from Jim Biden, the President's brother. Lying to Congress is a serious offense, Mr. Chairman, a criminal one, in fact, and if the Bidens or anyone else has come before this Committee and lied to this Committee, I strongly encourage the Committee to pursue criminal referrals to the Department of Justice. One last thing that I want to ask, Mr. Bobulinski or Mr. Galanis, have either of you heard of any offer of a pardon for anyone involved or associated with or partner to the Biden family enterprise corruption investigation? Mr. Bobulinski. I am sorry. Was the question have I heard of any---- Mr. Palmer. Have you heard of anyone being suggested that a pardon might be an order for anyone associated with this enterprise? Mr. Bobulinski. I have not. Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Bobulinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, I just have a parliamentary inquiry. Chairman Comer. State your point. Mr. Raskin. We have heard for months now and seen the photo of that BlackBerry with the cracked screen, does the Committee have in its possession the data from Mr. Bobulinski's phone from which he has allegedly taken these pictures, because I think we need the data that they keep referring to, and maybe Mr. Bobulinski could just turn it over to us, or we could subpoena it today. Chairman Comer. We have the images that we have shared with you. Mr. Raskin. Right. I saw the picture of the cracked Blackberry, but do we have the underlying texts that are being referred to by my friend, Mr. Palmer? Mr. Goldman. Mr. Bobulinski previously said he would be happy to turn over his phone, so if we could just---- Chairman Comer. We have pictures of all the text messages and screenshots that we provided with everyone on the Committee. Mr. Raskin. OK. All right. Well, of course, he has just given us, obviously, the ones he has selected. I am wondering whether we could get all of those texts, and I would move that the Committee to subpoena Mr. Bobulinski's Blackberry phone on which messages with Hunter Biden and the Oneida Holdings partners were saved. He stated that he is willing to provide it to the Committee, so it should be rather simple. Mr. Palmer. Mr. Chairman? Chairman Comer. OK. There is a motion to subpoena Bobulinski's Blackberry---- Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Seconded. Mr. Raskin. Yes, with the texts that were just referenced by Mr. Palmer. Mr. Jordan. Mr. Chairman? Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan. I move to table the motion. Chairman Comer. There is a motion to table. Mr. Raskin. I would request a recorded vote. Chairman Comer. The motion to table is not debatable. As many are in favor---- Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman? Chairman Comer [continuing]. Of tabling may signify by saying aye. [Chorus of ayes.] All those opposed, signify by saying no. [Chorus of noes.] Chairman Comer. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the motion to table agreed to. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, what we are doing is we are tabling evidence here which you keep relying on, so I am going to ask for a recorded vote for that. That just makes no sense. Chairman Comer. A recorded vote is ordered. We will suspend for a moment. This is a Committee hearing. We do not have the clerk. Will somebody go find the clerk? [Pause.] Mr. Mfume. Mr. Speaker? Mr. Chairman? Mr. Minority Leader, do you think it is possible that the witness would voluntarily just give it? Mr. Raskin. I had understood actually that Mr. Bobulinski had volunteered when he was asked about this. It would simplify things if he would just turn over the Blackberry. Mr. Goldman. Well, he did very clearly say he is happy to turn over his BlackBerry to the Committee. He did not. We then asked for it at the deposition. We have asked the Majority to-- -- Chairman Comer. Mr. Goldman, you are out of order. We are in suspension here waiting for the clerk to come so we can take the vote that your side of the aisle requested. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Ranking Member? [No response.] Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Ranking Member? Mr. Raskin. Yes? Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. I solely want to underscore the importance of this---- Chairman Comer. I am sorry. The gentlelady is out of order. You can come back here and talk to him if you want. Ms. Greene. Mr. Chairman? [No response.] Ms. Greene. Mr. Chairman? Chairman Comer. Yes? Ms. Greene. We do not even have a---- Chairman Comer. As I said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez would have to come up, you will as well. Sorry. [Pause.] Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, just an invitation to regular order. We have Democratic clerks who are faithful to the rule of law and could do this if you are waiting for clerks, and we will all be here to watch to document their work. In other words, if you want to conduct the vote with the Democratic clerks, we can do it. Chairman Comer. All right. A recorded vote is ordered. The Clerk will call the roll. The Clerk. Mr. Jordan? Mr. Jordan. Yes. The Clerk. Mr. Jordan votes yes. Mr. Turner? [No response.] The Clerk. Mr. Gosar? [No response.] The Clerk. Ms. Foxx? [No response.] The Clerk. Mr. Grothman? Mr. Grothman. Yes.

The Chair now recognizes Mr. Connolly for 5 minutes. Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bobulinski, in your deposition, you were asked about taking a picture of your phone, and you said, ``I still have that phone. I could put that phone on this table right here, and every person in this room could look at that individual text and validate that it is a legitimate text and the date and time stamp on it.'' Are you willing to provide the Committee voluntarily with the Blackberry referenced and that phone? Mr. Bobulinski. I am willing to sit in a room with both the Chairman and the Ranking Member with my phone and their staff and we can go through each and every text message. As I said in my interview, I had a forensics expert plug into my Blackberry, somebody who has done extensive work for the FBI for over 10 years with an interest of pulling all the data off that phone, so I can provide it to the Committee. Unfortunately, they were using Cellebrite software, which is a software that the FBI uses, and they were unable to pull the data off the phone. So, I am more than willing to sit in the room with Mr. Chairman and the Ranking Member and their staffs with that Blackberry, fully charged, and we can go through each and every message if---- Mr. Connolly. Well, that is in progress, and I appreciate that. But you can understand, I am sure, why the Committee wants to look at prima facie evidence on its own, not rely---- Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I cannot understand why you are trying to imply that I have not cooperated. Mr. Connolly. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bobulinski, this is my time. You can understand why we would want to look at evidence, raw and unvarnished, so that we can make our own determination, but thank you for your willingness to cooperate at least at that level. Mr. Parnas, you observed back in 2023, in a letter you sent to Chairman Comer that ``there were flagrant examples of Giuliani interfering in Ukrainian politics.'' Why would Giuliani be interfering in another country's politics? Mr. Parnas. I mean, Giuliani would do and say whatever he needed for the purpose of getting the information he wanted to secure Donald Trump's 2020 election, so just a prime example of one of the things he did. He had a close relationship with then a boxer, Vladimir Klitschko, who was then the mayor in Ukraine. When the new President came over, there was rumors about maybe him not being staying in office as mayor of Ukraine. Klitschko flew to New York, met with Rudy Giuliani, and then a meeting that we had with Andriy Yermak in Spain that was relevant, had to do with President Zelensky announcing the investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. At that meeting, he also brought up the Klitschko situation and basically told Yermak that if Zelensky got rid of Klitschko, President Trump and the American people would be very upset about that because we love him, and he needs to be in there. Mr. Connolly. So, was Giuliani just doing this as a rogue on his own because he was a patriotic American who loved Donald Trump, or had somebody encouraged him to engage in this kind of political interference in another country? Mr. Parnas. I mean, I think he was encouraged by Donald Trump. Mr. Connolly. Personally? Mr. Parnas. Personally, yes. Mr. Connolly. That is your testimony? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Connolly. Thank you. In your letter, you also said that Mr. Giuliani was to ``deliver a precise message in very strict words.'' With respect to the administration of the then newly installed President of Ukraine, President Zelensky, what did you understand a very strict message or a message with very strict words construed, and what was that message that you delivered that was in very strict words? Mr. Parnas. Yes, Congressman. He basically told me not to be nice, to be very stern, and relay the message that unless Zelensky announced an investigation into the Bidens by Monday-- this was Sunday--that there will be no cooperation, no aid to Ukraine from the United States, and the Vice President Pence at the time that was scheduled to appear for the inauguration would not appear to the inauguration. Mr. Connolly. That would seem to corroborate that very famous and beautiful telephone conversation between President Trump then and President Zelensky basically saying, ``but I need a favor,'' and hinting that there would be withholding of military aid until that favor was delivered. Is that fair? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely. I was a part of setting up that phone call, that famous phone call that Trump had with Zelensky. Mr. Connolly. I think your testimony is very important, Mr. Parnas, and it is under oath. Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Connolly. I thank you. I yield back. Chaiman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Taylor Greene from Georgia for 5 minutes. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Joe Biden continues to lie to the American people about his role in his family's businesses. In 2020, he stood up on stage of a Presidential debate and told the American people that his family did not take any money from China. That was a lie. Not only was it a lie, he knew it was a lie. He knew it because he met with his son Hunter Biden's Chinese business associates. I want to talk about CEFC, which is the China Energy Fund Committee. Mr. Bobulinski, who is Chairman Ye? Mr. Bobulinski. Chairman Ye was the Chairman of CEFC. Ms. Greene. Thank you. Jim Biden told the FBI and IRS that Chairman Ye was the protege of Xi Jinping, the leader of China and the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Bobulinski, Rob Walker told this Committee that Joe Biden met Chairman Ye. Are you aware of that? Yes or no. Mr. Bobulinski. I am now. I was not at the time. Ms. Greene. And Joe Biden also met with you. Is that right? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, he did, twice. Ms. Greene. Who is Director Zhang? Mr. Bobulinski. Director Zhang was the No. 2 at CEFC. Ms. Greene. The executive director of CEFC, the No. 2? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, he was the No. 2 executive, but really the point person that I worked with, and the Biden family worked with. And he is the individual that Hunter Biden was shaking down at the end of July 2017, demanding that they fund the $10 million, they ultimately send $5 million but $10 million directly to Hunter Biden's account, Owasco. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Bobulinski. [Chart] I want to show you a text message that Hunter Biden sent to you and his other business associates. I am holding it right here. I will read it to you. ``Hey, Tony, I have an idea. In light of the fact, we are at an impasse of sorts, and both James' lawyers and my chairman gave an emphatic no, I think we should all meet in Romania.'' He is speaking about ``my chairman.'' When Hunter Biden came in for his deposition, he said that he was referring to Chairman Ye and that the rest of your group referred to Zhang as a different chairman. Does this make any sense to you? Mr. Bobulinski. That is a lie. I never heard Director Zhang referenced as ``chairman,'' and I had direct communications with Director Zhang over WeChat, met him in Romania, met him in Moscow. I met him around the world, in New York, trying to develop this business, and he was never referred to as ``the chairman,'' first of all. Second of all, that makes absolutely no sense in the context of this message because we are discussing Oneida Holdings, LLC and the Chinese---- Ms. Greene. Thank you. So, he was not the Chairman? Just to clarify. Yes or no. Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Ms. Greene. OK. So, I want to show you another text. [Chart] Ms. Greene. When he said, ``his chairman,'' he was talking about his dad. This is from Rob Walker. It did not seem to make much sense to Rob Walker either. So, he said when Hunter--he said this to you--when Hunter was talking about his chairman, he was talking about his dad. When Rob Walker came in to give his transcribed interview to the Committee, he basically said, well, Hunter was high or confused or mad, and Rob Walker said that he was just trying to calm things down between you and Hunter, but that does not really answer the question about who Hunter Biden is talking about. Hunter Biden lied to this Committee. So here clearly Rob Walker is saying he is talking about his dad, so I want to be very clear we have established that Zhang is not the Chairman, obviously. Is that correct? Yes or no. Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Ms. Greene. Let me show you another message. [Chart] Ms. Greene. This message does not call Zhang ``Chairman Zhang,'' does it? It just says the Chinese want to do business with the Bidens. As a matter of fact, it says, ``Both coming to be my partner, to be partners with the Bidens'', with an ``s.'' ``He,'' Zheng ``implied that the No. 1 has made it clear and available to him.'' Who is the No. 1? Mr. Bobulinski. The No. 1 is Xi Jinping. Ms. Greene. Xi Jinping, the President of China? Yes or no. Mr. Bobulinski. That is correct. Ms. Greene. The leader of the Communist Party, the CCP? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Ms. Greene. Is the No. 1. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, that is the No. 1 that Hunter was referencing in that message. Ms. Greene. Now, let us be very clear. This was in 2017, but I would like to make it known for this Committee that Joe Biden told the press in 2016, as a matter of fact, ``Yes, I am. I am going to run in 2020.'' He told the press in 2016 that he was running for President of the United States in 2020. So, here are the Bidens doing business in China in 2017 when everybody knew he was planning to be President of the United States. Do you see that to be a serious problem, Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. I do, and I wish this Committee would thoroughly investigate it and focus on all the evidence that the SDNY has on CEFC. They had FISA warrants, so they were recording conversations, and I wish they disclosed all of that data and fact to this Committee. Ms. Greene. Thank you, Mr. Bobulinski. I yield, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Krishnamoorthi for 5 minutes. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Parnas, Rudy Giuliani tasked to with, ``a mission to travel the globe to find dirt to damage the Bidens' reputation in the 2018-2019 timeframe,'' right? Mr. Parnas. Correct. Yes. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And this was an effort to secure Trump's---- Mr. Parnas. Reelection in 2020. Mr. Krishnamoorthi [continuing]. Reelection as President in 2020, right? Mr. Parnas. Correct. Yes. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And by ``dirt,'' you mean evidence of wrongdoing or criminality, right? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And in your travels, you found ``precisely zero proof of the Bidens' criminality,'' right? Mr. Parnas. Correct. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And there was no evidence of the Bidens' corruption in Ukraine because, as you said, there truly was none, right? Mr. Parnas. Correct. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Now, interestingly, you have looked for dirt around the world about the Bidens and specifically Joe Biden, in particular, and you say the FBI, CIA, NSA have all failed to produce any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, right? Mr. Parnas. Correct. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Not only that, but former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko stated there is not a single word of truth to these allegations about Joe Biden, right? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Now there is a guy named Yuri Lutsenko who is the former prosecutor general of Ukraine, and he also ``confirmed that nothing ties the Bidens to criminal activity in Ukraine,'' right? Mr. Parnas. Correct. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And then there is another prosecutor general named Viktor Shokin, who conceded that he had no evidence that either Joe or Hunter Biden had ever interfered with Ukrainian law, right? Mr. Parna. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And the reason you know this is because you talk to each of these people, right? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And your job was to try to dig up dirt or manufacture dirt, right? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. And yet we have conducted months of hearings, and because there has been no evidence of wrongdoing, you have called this whole impeachment inquiry a ``wild goose chase,'' right? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Now, interestingly, we have heard from the other side that the real quid pro quo was not Donald Trump. It was Joe Biden when he tried to hold up foreign aid when he was Vice President in exchange for firing the Federal prosecutor in Ukraine that was investigating the corruption from his son. Now, you, again, looked for evidence to support this claim. There is no evidence, correct? Mr. Parnas. Correct. That was false. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. In fact, firing the prosecutor would make it more likely that they would go after the company in question, Burisma, not less, right? Mr. Parnas. Well, the ironic part is the reason why majority of the world and Ukraine and the Obama Administration wanted to fire, get rid of Viktor Shokin because he was corrupt, not because he was investigating Burisma. Because he was stalling investigations for the U.K. that was looking into $23 million they wanted to get from Zlochevsky, and Shokin stalled that investigation. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. So, the logic is just the opposite---- Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Krishnamoorthi [continuing]. Of what the Majority claims to be the case, namely that they say that somehow Joe Biden was out to fire the prosecutor to reduce the chances of a prosecution of Burisma, but actually, in firing that prosecutor, he increased the chances of prosecuting Burisma, right? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely, correct. Yes. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. So let me just talk to you about what some of the other witnesses in this impeachment inquiry have said. Jonathan Turley, the constitutional expert that Republicans brought forward, said there is no evidence of which he was aware to support impeaching the President. You agree with that, correct? Mr. Parnas. One hundred percent. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Garret Graves, a colleague of ours said just last week, ``Have I seen anything that is impeachable? No, I haven't.'' You agree with that statement as well? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Last year, our Republican colleague Ken Buck, who is about to retire, said that evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden ``doesn't exist right now.'' It does not exist now, it did not exist then, right? Mr. Parnas. That is exactly true, sir. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Sir, how many times have you met Donald Trump? Mr. Parnas. Well over 10 times, I would say. I would have to count, but lots of times. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Is there anything that you would like to relate to us about your conversations with Donald Trump that would bear on the conduct of these proceedings? Mr. Parnas. I mean, Donald Trump was aware of everything that was going on. On that that day in the Red Room when we were in the White House, after Rudy bringing Donald Trump up to speed on that I could go out to Ukraine and get Viktor Shokin, now Trump approached me, shook my hand, and said thank you for all that you are doing, keep up the good work, patted me on the back, took pictures, and I was off to Ukraine. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. To meet with Viktor Shokin? Mr. Parnas. To find Viktor Shokin, to bring him back here to meet with Lindsey Graham. Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Got it. Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. Parnas. Thank you. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Cloud from Texas for 5 minutes. Mr. Cloud. Thank you, Chairman. Now, we have heard time after time Joe Biden say that he had no knowledge whatsoever about the business dealings, and that changed. He had never allegedly had any conversation with Hunter. Then they moved the ball to say that, well, he did not have any business dealings, he was not involved, did not have any financial contribution. Since then, we have uncovered about 20 shell companies, and we have bank records that bring light to that. And while we cannot cover all 20 shell companies in 5 minutes, I wanted to focus on one, and that is Rosemont Seneca Bohai. Rosemont Seneca Bohai is interesting, and Devon Archer had testified, and he said this in his testimony, he said that this entity ``was used as a common entity, owned 50-50 on a handshake deal between Devon and Hunter, splitting these shares.'' Actually, that was your words, Mr. Galanis. Do you stand by those words? Mr. Galanis. Yes, I do. Mr. Cloud. And Devon Archer agreed with that. He said Hunter was a corporate secretary of RSB and had a handshake 50- 50 ownership deal. Is that correct? Mr. Galanis. That is correct, yes. Mr. Cloud. And primarily, this company was set up to, initially, as a place to hold equity from the equity stake of Bohai Harvest. Is that correct? Mr. Galanis. What I was told by the partners at the time, it was set up to do that and invest in other businesses, and I think Devon Archer subsequently testified to that effect. It included moneys that were paid from the bond fraud, $15 million that was wired to that RSB account as well. Mr. Cloud. Yes. Mr. Galanis. So, it conducted multiple transactions as you depicted in that diagram. Mr. Cloud. And even if this were legal and there was no impropriety here, it is very concerning because this company is set up to basically compete against America's energy interests at the behest of CCP. Then we have other flows into Rosemont Seneca Bohai from Burisma. We all know about Hunter's $1 million salary that he received for sitting on the board and providing no actual function there, and so we have $1 million salary going through Rosemont Seneca to Hunter Biden. And then this is interesting. We have a meeting with Kazakhstani Kenes Rakishev, and what gets me here is the $300 at the end of the $142,300 that goes into this and then the next day went to a Porsche dealership for a car for Hunter Biden. Now, what is interesting about all this, of course, is that each of these not only flowed money through the shell companies to Hunter Biden, but each of them also involved important meetings with, of course, President Biden. And so, on December 4, we have coffee with Jonathan Li, who was one of the members who started Bohai Harvest, and he was connected with the CCP. They were having trouble getting a license to work because, of course, the CCP has to get permission for that, until Hunter flew over on Air Force Two with Vice President Joe Biden at the time. They met with Jonathan Li. Hunter introduced him. Joe ended up writing a letter of recommendation to Jonathan Li's daughter to get into college, and then we see that this relationship continues to be formed. Of course, in the Ukraine, we know that April 16th, 2015, Joe Biden had dinner with a Burisma official at Cafe Milano. It seems to be a popular spot because Joe Biden also had dinner with Kenes Rakishev there, all in flow to going here. And of course, as Tony Bobulinski has pointed out several times, this all comes down to eventually the one ``Big Guy'' who gets 10 percent for the ``Big Guy.'' And so, we know that all this money flowed through this to get to Hunter, and then we know, of course, that 10 percent went to the ``Big Guy.'' So, Mr. Bobulinski, does this general pattern of Hunter offering foreign access to Joe Biden, Hunter gets paid and then Joe gets a share of that, is that basically what the general practice across many of these shell companies were? Mr. Bobulinski. Congressman, as I outlined, the ``Big Guy'' is clearly Joe Biden. The details of some of those transactions I was not involved in, but that is clearly how they operate. Mr. Cloud. But that is the pattern that we have seen over and over. And, Mr. Galanis, you said at the beginning that Hunter did not really provide any sort of intellectual propriety, asset value, or anything of the sort, that his entire value was the brand. Is that correct? How did you state that? Mr. Galanis. Yes. We did not rely on him for any work product other than delivering the Biden lift. Mr. Cloud. The Biden lift, and one more question for you, Mr. Galanis. Did you offer to provide information on Hunter Biden and Devon Archer back in 2016 to prosecutors and the SEC, and what happened there? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Through counsel, I had offered to provide information specifically on that to the SDNY. And, at some point, I also did the same thing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was interested and suddenly was told to quash that interest. I understood that to be an order from the Southern District of New York to quash the SEC information. Mr. Cloud. Thank you. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Goldman for 5 minutes. Mr. Goldman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I only have 5 minutes, Mr. Bobulinski, so I am going to try to move quickly, and I would appreciate if you just answer the questions. You testified that Joe Biden was involved in your business venture related to Oneida Holdings and Hunter Biden, so I want to drill down on the crux of what your testimony is. Oneida Holdings is the business venture that you are referring to, correct? Mr. Bobulinski. I am referring to what? Can you ask the---- Mr. Goldman. Any business you did with the Bidens. Mr. Bobulinski. My reference is to SinoHawk Holdings, LLC, and Oneida Holdings, LLC owned 50 percent of that. Mr. Goldman. Right. And Oneida Holdings was the 50 percent that was on the American side of that SinoHawk deal, right? Mr. Bobulinski. It was the 50 percent that was the Biden side of it. You know, James Gillar is not an American, so. [Chart] Mr. Goldman. Sorry. Fair enough. And it was a joint partnership memorialized in an incorporating document, correct? And it had equal shares divided among five partners. Is that right? Mr. Bobulinski. Are asking me about what you are holding up because you are---- Mr. Goldman. Sir, were there equal 20 percent shares among five partners? Mr. Bobulinski. In what? Mr. Goldman. Oneida Holdings. Mr. Bobulinski. In the final signed documents? Mr. Goldman. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. Is that what you are asking me? Mr. Goldman. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. It is? Mr. Goldman. It is not complicated. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, it is because---- Mr. Goldman. All right. You are just filibustering now. The answer is--you are filibustering, I get it--that there were five partners: Hunter Biden, Jim Biden, Rob Walker, James Gilliar, and you. Each owned 20 percent. Do you---- Mr. Bobulinski. Well, they did not each own. Their LLCs owned it, which is a material difference. Mr. Goldman. Do you see Joe Biden or an LLC related to Joe Biden on this? Mr. Bobulinski. I do not know if Joe Biden owned any of Jim Biden's LLC or Hunter Biden's LLC. I will leave that up to the Committee. Mr. Goldman. OK. And do you know when this agreement was entered into? Mr. Bobulinski. The poster board that you are holding up or the actual legal document that was signed? Mr. Goldman. The agreement, sir. Mr. Bobulinski. The agreement. Mr. Goldman. The agreement was signed May 22, 2017. Who was the Vice President then? Mr. Bobulinski. May 22 you said? I think it was Mike Pence. Mr. Goldman. And who was the President? Mr. Bobulinski. Donald Trump. Mr. Goldman. OK. And when did you first meet Hunter Biden? Mr. Bobulinski. I first met Hunter Biden in early 2017. Mr. Goldman. When? When in 2017? Mr. Bobulinski. A day or an hour or a month? Mr. Goldman. The month. A month is good. Mr. Bobulinski. I believe I briefly met him in New York. The first meeting I had extensive time with him was in early May 2017. Mr. Goldman. OK. And that was around the same time that you had those two meetings with Joe Biden, right? Mr. Bobulinski. It was, but prior to that, I had numerous discussions with Hunter. Mr. Gold. So, look, you have said that---- Mr. Bobulinski. I had lawyers working---- Mr. Goldman. Sir? Sir? Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Through the documents that you are asking---- Mr. Goldman. Can I please reclaim my time, sir? As I said, we have to move quickly here. In your testimony earlier today, one of my colleagues asked you about that meeting at the bar, 45 minutes to 60 minutes, and you were also asked about that in your transcribed interview. And in neither of your answers did you mention any discussion that you had at that meeting with Joe Biden about the Chinese business venture. Yet, in grandiose terms here today you have declared that Joe Biden was involved and that you have mountains of irrefutable evidence to support it. So, let us look at the mountains of irrefutable evidence. You provided the Committee with a screenshot of a text message that is between James Gilliar and you dated May 11, 2017. Do you see this? I do not know if you can see it. If you cannot see, it is just you and James Gilliar, though, right? You remember this text message, I am sure. Mr. Bobulinski. Generally, yes. Mr. Goldman. All right. And in it, Gilliar writes, ``Man, you are right. Let's get the company set up, then tell H and family the high stakes and get Joe involved.'' And 2 days later, Mr. Gilliar sent an email to you, cc'ing Rob Walker and Hunter Biden, in which he suggested a division of the company and included a proposal of, ``10 percent held by H for the `Big Guy'?'' You remember that, right? Mr. Bobulinski. The infamous email with the ``Big Guy''? Mr. Goldman. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, I do. Mr. Goldman. Did anyone ever respond to that email? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, they did numerous times. Mr. Goldman. Sorry. Did anyone ever---- Mr. Bobulinski. Hunter Biden himself did. Mr. Goldman. Excuse me. Excuse me. You are right. Did anyone---- Mr. Bobulinski. Well, no, I think that is important---- Mr. Goldman. Sir, did anyone ever--can you answer the question? Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Because Hunter Biden has claimed that he did not respond to it, and he responded to it, I believe, three times. Mr. Goldman. OK. You are just going to filibuster. I reclaim my time that is running out, but I will say no one responded to the ``Big Guy'' reference for 10. Mr. Bobulinski. Thank you for making my point. They did not have to respond because they all knew the ``Big Guy'' was Joe Biden. Mr. Goldman. Sir, I reclaim my time. Mr. Chairman, please control the witness. I would like to get a little extra time, Mr. Chairman, because I want to read what Mr. Gilliar said to the Wall Street Journal. ``I would like to clear up any speculation that former Vice President was involved with the 2017 discussions about our potential business structure. I am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former Vice President. The activity in question never delivered any project revenue.'' Nine days later, the agreement without Joe Biden was signed. You and James Gilliar wanted Joe Biden involved, and that is why Hunter Biden dumped you and did the business on his own, and I yield back. Mr. Bobulinski. That is a blatant lie, Mr. Goldman. You know better. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Higgins from Louisiana for 5 minutes. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bobulinski, thank you for being here today, and we appreciate the candor of your responses, sir, which is reflective of the way you handled yourself in private testimony and deposition, so I thank you for communicating truthfully to the American people today. I am going to ask you about the China Energy Fund Committee, the CEFC. You are familiar with that, sir? Mr. Bobulinski. I am. Mr. Higgins. Was this a multibillion-dollar company like a Fortune 500 company at one time before they went bankrupt? Mr. Bobulinski. It is even bigger than that. If you go back and look at its financials in 2016 and 2017, it was probably one of the five largest private companies in China. Mr. Higgins. Exactly. So, this was a major operation that had a lot of money. I am going to hold up a memo here. [Chart] This is a chart from the Second Bank memo, and it shows disbursement of a total of almost $24 million for diamonds. So, you have a major Chinese company spending a lot of money on diamonds, and apparently, diamonds were used as a means of payment for the Biden family. We know that the Bidens have testified, have admitted to having two diamonds. We suspect that there are many, many more, $23 million worth of diamonds. Are you familiar with the exchange of valuable assets to pay the Bidens other than electronic transfers of moneys? Are you aware of payments in diamonds, payment in cash, payment in board memberships, et cetera? Mr. Bobulinski. Am I generally aware of it, or was I involved? Mr. Higgins. Yes, sir. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, I read Jim Biden's and Hunter Biden's transcript multiple times. Jim Biden in that transcript references two diamonds that were given to Hunter Biden. One, he implies, was in 2015 by an individual, who he couldn't recall his name, but the individual's name is Scott Oh, who is a surrogate for CEFC. And then apparently a second diamond was given at a meeting in Miami, and I really want to set the record clear. I was not at that physical meeting. I was in Miami, but I was not at that physical meeting. That is what I told the FBI in my transcribed interview. Mr. Higgins. Are you aware, Mr. Bobulinski, of a pattern of bribery, of bribe payments coming from the China Energy Fund Committee? Mr. Bobulinski. I appreciate that question. I wish everyone on this Committee would read the 1,200 pages of testimony in an 8-day trial in the SDNY, where Mr. Goldman used to work while the actual trial was going on, that accused numerous executives, ultimately Patrick Ho, of corruption, bribing, leaving shoeboxes of cash to a variety of political figures in Africa. Mr. Higgins. Exactly. So, Mr. Bobulinski, from your perch within the Biden family operations and their interactions with major businesses in China and the exchange of millions of dollars that are known--we have tracked them through bank records, through suspicious activity reports, through emails, through communications that this Committee has documented-- there is no debate that millions and millions of dollars flowed into the Biden family's bank accounts, but the existence of other forms of payment is fascinating because diamonds are untraceable. We really do not know how many diamonds the Bidens received, do we? Mr. Bobulinski. We do not, and for somebody who has been to mainland China probably 10-plus times, Hong Kong probably 15- plus times, had hundreds of people---- Mr. Higgins. Yes. Let me share---- Mr. Bobulinski. Congressman, I had hundreds of people working for me in mainland China at one point. I never got a diamond from any businessman or woman. Mr. Higgins. I hear you. So, Mr. Bobulinski, I shift quickly to a text message. Are you familiar with this? It is from a gentleman named James. Mr. Bobulinski. Generally, yes. Mr. Higgins. Yes. It says, ``Don't mention Joe being involved. It is only when you are face to face. I know you know that, but they are paranoid,'' and there is a response saying, ``OK, they should be paranoid about things,'' and then there is a response saying, ``For real.'' So, what is meant by, ``Don't mention Joe being involved. It is only when you are face to face. I know you know that, but they are paranoid?'' Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I think it outlines how the Bidens operated, not specifically just with CEFC. You have Galanis here testifying and numerous other witnesses that have given you a tremendous amount of evidence. They work to obfuscate it, create layers of obstruction. That is the reason why Rob Walker was getting sent millions of dollars instead of Hunter Biden directly. That is the reason why Devon Archer was receiving millions of dollars instead of going to Hunter directly. You guys have a mountain of evidence that stacks high and answers that question on how they obfuscated. They lived in a world of plausible deniability. Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Bobulinski. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I yield. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Norton from D.C. for 5 minutes. Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Galanis, thank you for appearing voluntarily for this hearing from Alabama. I understand you are currently serving a 189-month sentence in Federal prison, almost 16 years, after being convicted of not one, not two, but three different schemes. The victims of your schemes, as the judge who presided over your criminal prosecution noted, included ``one of the poorest Native American tribes in the country'', as well as pension funds held for the benefit of transit workers, longshoremen, housing authority workers, and city employees, hardworking people, everyday people, among others. The court also noted that you personally benefited from these schemes, ``using over $8 million, almost $9 million for lavish personal expenditures, including home expenses, automobiles, travel, clothing, jewelry expenses,'' and meanwhile, investors were left with nothing. But this is not your only encounter with prosecutors. In another case, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged you in 2005 with accounting fraud in connection with your investment--your involvement, rather--with Penthouse Magazine, and in 2010, you were convicted of attempted tax evasion and were sentenced to 5 years' probation and ordered to pay nearly $2 million in restitution. In imposing your prison sentence, the judge noted that you are ``an extremely talented man, extremely gifted in his interpersonal skills, uncommonly so. He is very persuasive as an individual. And those were the tools in his tool bag of the fraud he committed and the people he ensnared, his intelligence, his interpersonal skills, his charm, if you will, and this is something that is not unseen in people who are commonly referred to as con artists.'' Another judge who presided over your case referred to you as ``a skillful con artist.'' A skillful con artist. That is who my Republican colleagues are relying on to carry their water in this sham impeachment inquiry after their last star witness, the author of the infamous FBI Form 1023, was indicted for lying and outed as a likely Republican agent. It is time we put an end to this pathetic and desperate inquiry. I yield my remaining time to Ranking Member Raskin. Mr. Raskin. Ms. Norton, thank you very much. So, for more than a year now, we have heard innuendo, rumors, propaganda, big lies, but no facts, no evidence that could reasonably support the finding of impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors against President Biden. In our first real impeachment hearing, the Majority invited several expert witnesses who came together. And their witnesses agreed with that, that there was nothing that remotely approached the level of proof needed to support a finding of high crimes and misdemeanors that one would impeach a President for. And now we come back again today, and the Majority has two witnesses: one, the designated con man, as determined by two different Federal courts, not without talent, but someone who deploys his talent toward the purposes of exploiting Native- American Indian tribes, pensioners, and other innocent investors. And then Mr. Bobulinski, who offers a lot of rhetoric and a lot of hot air, but absolutely no facts that could indict the President of the United States for high crimes and misdemeanors, impeachable offenses against the republic, the kinds of offenses which James Madison said are great attacks on the republic itself, great affronts to our republican form of government. And nobody on their side can even tell us what is the impeachable high crime and misdemeanor, which suggests that they are moving in the direction of criminal referrals and they should start by looking at their own witnesses. I yield back to you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. And I would like to remind the Ranking Member and Ms. Norton, the witness, Mr. Galanis, was partners with Hunter Biden. That is why he is here. We have their partners. You could have invited partners, but you invited this guy. Mr. Raskin. Yes, Donald Trump's partner, Mr. Parnas, who was really with Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani. Chairman Comer. Oh, he was Donald Trump's partner, OK. All right. The Chair recognizes Mr. Grothman. Mr. Grothman. Yes. We got a variety of things I would like to go through. But first, Mr. Lynch complained about Mr. Galanis testifying from prison. So, I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the Department of Justice's own press release announcing the sentencing of the Democrats' witness, Lev Parnas, to 20 months in prison for, among other things, making false statements. Chairman Comer. Without objection, on Donald Trump's partner. Mr. Grothman. Thank you. Now, Mr. Chairman, you know, we had originally hoped that we would see a few more witnesses here today. They are not here, but I would like to run a brief tape because I showed up today hoping I would be asking these witnesses a little bit more about this tape. I know that, you know, there is some mystery or some people feel it is still ambiguous as to how this prosecutor was fired in Ukraine, and I wonder if this tape could do a little bit more to shed light on why that prosecutor was fired and why we want Hunter Biden and Mr. Archer here today. [Video shown.] I just wanted to put that up there because I do eventually want further efforts made to get Hunter Biden or Mr. Archer here because we have Joe Biden himself bragging that they got rid of a prosecutor who would have provided his son's business dealings with a little bit more observation, I will put it that way. Now, Mr. Bobulinski, in previous interviews with this Committee, you said that Joe Biden not only knew about the family's business dealings, but enabled them and participated in them. You went so far as to say, ``It is clear to me that Joe Biden was the brand sold by the Biden family.'' Could you elaborate a little bit why you felt that way again? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. That is one of the challenging things I have had to deal with over the last 4 years with a focus of just simply telling the truth. The obfuscation around these facts are just beyond insane. So, I will use a meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, DC that I was not at, but apparently 8 to 10 Chinese executives of CEFC were at with Chairman Ye and Director Zhang. Director Zhang I interacted with extensively, and James Gilliar was in that room, Rob Walker. Hunter Biden was in that room. And my understanding, based on Rob Walker's testimony, is that Joe Biden walked into that room, sat down, shook hands with people, and spent 5 or 10 minutes talking about his family, I guess. I was not in the room. People have tried to obfuscate that meeting, like Joe Biden was walking in there to ask about the weather, and Rob Walker said that the Chinese did not even know that Joe Biden was the former Vice President of the United States, which is beyond absurd. The power that those 10 Chinese individuals had to go back to mainland China and say that they were in a room with Joe Biden is the value of what they were giving. Mr. Grothman. OK. You stated that the Biden family concocted a scheme to give Joe plausible deniability. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I would just point to all the different text messages and communications. They call him the ``Big Guy.'' I was not involved with Mr. Galanis or Mr. Archer, but they are giving you numerous data points. There was obfuscation. They did not use his name. They used the ``Big Guy.'' You were not supposed to talk about it. It was just, you know---- Mr. Grothman. And you personally met with the Vice President. Mr. Bobulinski. I did twice. Mr. Grothman. OK. Did he say anything that indicates that you wanted him to help his son, that sort of thing? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, he thanked me for helping his son and his brother and asked me to keep an eye on them as I walked him out to his car after he gave his speech on the second meeting of the Milken Conference. Mr. Grothman. OK. Just one other followup, and this kind of may be a vague question, but I would like to know it. One of the things that disturbs me about that is the interaction with the Chinese--that is what we are dealing with today, but obviously other countries as well--that, apparently, in their own mind, the way you deal with the United States is the way you deal with, say, a corrupt city councilor or something like that. In other words, you know, you give them money and you get what you want. Do you want to comment on that, or did you hear any stories about that, or did you hear stories that they were surprised how easy it was to buy the U.S. Government? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I think it---- Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired, but answer the question. Please feel free to answer the question. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. I think CEFC, and there is tremendous evidence, believed that they were bribing the Biden family, and they were doing it via Hunter Biden. Mr. Grothman. It is kind of shameful. Thank you. Chairman Comer. Very good. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Khanna for 5 minutes. Mr. Khanna. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Parnas, can you tell me about your meetings with Dmytro Firtash and why you believe the Trump Campaign used his services? Mr. Parnas. Yes. I was sent to meet with Dmytro Firtash because Dmytro Firtash had resources. He is an oligarch that was in Vienna waiting to be extradited to the United States, but he was very close with Vladimir Putin, Ukraine, and lots of characters in that part of the world. And my objective at the time was to have him help us lean on Mykola Zlochevsky and get dirt on the Bidens. Mr. Khanna. And what type of dirt were you trying to get? Mr. Parnas. We were searching for Hunter's hard drive that we were told was out there. We were searching for bank records to validate certain bank records that was given to me, Hunter's personal bank records that was given to me by John Solomon that he said he got from the FBI to validate certain payments that were going for car purchases. But the objective was to try to find a link from any of the payments that would go into Joe Biden's account. Mr. Khanna. And who told you to get this dirt? Mr. Parnas. Well, who told me? Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Khanna. Anyone else that you remember? Mr. Parnas. John Solomon. I mean everybody that was part of the team. I mean---- Mr. Khanna. Did Bill Barr know that you were involved in getting this dirt? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely. Bill Barr was notified of our investigation from the day he took office. Mr. Khanna. Did you ever have a conversation with Bill Barr of being lenient toward Dmytro in Bill Barr's role as attorney general? Mr. Parnas. I personally did not, but I was witness to Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova having a conversation with Bill Barr about Dmytro Firtash. Mr. Khanna. What did they say to Bill Barr? Mr. Parnas. Basically, they were telling him that the charges were false and that he needs to drop the charges and basically end the case. Mr. Khanna. And why did they tell him to drop the charges on this Russian oligarch? Mr. Parnas. Because Dmytro Firtash was going to help us getting dirt on the Bidens or whatever else the Trump Campaign needed. Mr. Khanna. So, my understanding is you have the Trump Campaign telling you to talk to a Russian oligarch to get dirt on the President of the United States for political reasons, and then someone from the Trump Campaign is talking to the Attorney General to drop the charges because this foreign national is helping get dirt on a political candidate? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely. Mr. Khanna. Did Bill Barr indicate any willingness to drop the charges? Mr. Parnas. After a meeting that Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova had with DOJ, they came back and informed me that we are going to Vienna to tell Dmytro Firtash everything is going to be OK. Mr. Khanna. Do you know if Bill Barr in any way told you to say that? Mr. Parnas. I was not privy in that meeting, no. Mr. Khanna. And do you have any evidence that Bill Barr would have indicated to signal to Dmytro that the charges would be dropped? Mr. Parnas. Only from conversations from Rudy Giuliani or Victoria Toensing. Mr. Khanna. And what did they say about what Bill Barr said? Mr. Parnas. They basically told me that this will be taken care of as long as Firtash played ball, and that is the message they relayed to me to tell Firtash. Mr. Khanna. And they said that Bill Barr was conveying that to them directly? Mr. Parnas. Yes, after meetings. There were several meetings. There was a private meeting where Rudy Giuliani went and bumped into, actually, Bill Barr at the Trump International Hotel, and he used that as a moment to take him aside and speak to him, and then there was certain official meetings through official channels where Victoria Toensing met with him. So, yes. Mr. Khanna. Do you know if anything was done with the charges? Mr. Parnas. Until this day, Dmytro Firtash is not here. Mr. Khanna. Do you believe that Bill Barr should be investigated for his conduct in potentially dropping these charges? Mr. Parnas. I absolutely believe that, but not only that, I believe Bill Barr should be investigated into the cover up and trying to silence me to get the truth out of what really happened in Ukraine. Mr. Khanna. And explain the cover up and what you believe he should be investigated, with your last minute. Mr. Parnas. My arrest was set up strictly to shut me up, to steal my documents, take away all my information, and turn me into a crazy man that had no way to prove what was going on, but the real story was Bill Barr was trying to save Donald Trump from an impeachment and use me as a scapegoat. What he did not realize was Donald Trump was not going to stop but would continue doing what he wanted to do, and that is why it blew up in Bill Barr's face. He also hired a special counsel, at the time, Brady, to look into Ukraine. When we tried to reach out with my attorney to Special Counsel Brady, he never returned our phone call. Nobody wanted to hear anything I had to say that had to do with Ukraine, Donald Trump, or Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Khanna. Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Raskin. Would the gentleman yield? Mr. Khanna. Yes. Mr. Raskin. Thank you. Mr. Parnas, I just want to say you have stuck to the facts today. We do not hear bombast and rhetoric from you, but you are telling the true story and you have conducted yourself with great purpose and great dignity. And I know your son is here with you today, and I hope he and the rest of your family are proud of what you are doing for America. I yield back. Mr. Parnas. Thank you. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Donalds from Florida for 5 minutes. Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Chairman. It has been an interesting hearing so far. Let us actually get to the actual paper trail of money flow from the CEFC into the bank account for President Joe Biden, and I want to start with a text message, July 31, a WhatsApp text message between Hunter Biden and one Mr. Zhao. Real quick. Mr. Bobulinski, who is Mr. Zhao? Mr. Bobulinski. Congressman Donalds, I would just actually like to spend 20 seconds. If you noticed, Congressman Khanna scurried out of here very quickly, and I am actually disgusted as I sit here that he did not address me based on the fact that I am sitting here in front of the world trying to testify to the truth. In October 2020, I have messages that I am going to produce to both the Democrats and the Republicans that Ro Khanna sent to me saying, ``You have always demonstrated to me that you are nothing but an honest with the highest integrity individual,'' and I was begging for him to go on CNN and tell the world in October 2020. I have extensive emails with Congressman Ro Khanna in 2021 and 2022, where I begged him and his staff to sit down with me and look at my BlackBerry phones that the Democrats are so focused on, to hire forensics experts and go through all of the factual information I had. So, the fact that he did not even address me and then scurried out of here is disgusting to me. Sorry, Mr. Donalds. I will answer your question now. Mr. Donalds. All right. So, we are going to come off of that because now we are at 3 minutes, 30 seconds. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. I apologize---- Mr. Donalds. Mr. Chairman, for the record, I want to submit into the record two different WhatsApp text messages: one, July 31 between Hunter Biden and Mr. Zhao of CEFC, which stipulates that Hunter Biden wants to be able to move on and get the contract resolved, get the deal resolved, and that Mr. Zhao responds and says, ``Yes, the CEFC is willing to cooperate with the family.'' On August 31, there is another exchange, August 3, 2017, excuse me, between Hunter Biden and Mr. Gongwen Dong, and in this message, they are talking about the stipulations of the arrangement between the Biden family and CEFC. I want to submit both WhatsApp text messages for the record, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. OK. Now, to the money flow because this is where the rubber meets the road. On August 3, they actually stipulate through WhatsApp text messages the exact stipulations of the deal. On August 4, $100,000 is wired into Owasco P.C. from CEFC Infrastructure. Mr. Chairman, I want to submit for the record a portion of the bank statement for the time period of August 3 of 2017 to August 31, 2017, stipulating $100,000 going from CEFC into the bank account of Hunter Biden through Owasco, P.C. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. On August 8, 4 days later, $5 million is then transferred from the Northern International Capital account of $5 million to Hudson West III. Hudson West III is a bank account controlled by Hunter Biden and Mr. Gongwen, a/k/a Kevin Dong, who was a CEFC associate. That money comes from a Northern International Capital Bank account, a bank account that is tied to the CCP. Mr. Chairman, I want to submit for the record the bank statement demonstrating that transfer. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. OK. Moving on. On August 8, the same time period, there is a wire transfer of $400,000 to Owasco P.C. from the Hudson West III bank account. That $400,000, Mr. Chairman, I have the transfer records in the bank accounts from the August time period. I want to submit that for the record. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. Now, here is where the fun stuff comes in, everybody, and I got a minute to do it, so we are going to get this done. On August 14, there is $150,000 that is transferred from Owasco, P.C., which is controlled by Hunter Biden, to Lion Hall Group, which is controlled by James Biden. I have the records here, Mr. Chairman, of the $150,000 that has gone to Lion Hall Group from Owasco, P.C. I want to submit that for the record. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. On August 28, and I believe we have a screenshot for everybody in the room. [Chart] On August 28, Mr. Chairman, we have the withdrawal ticket from Lion Hall Group that is signed by Sara Biden, who is the wife of Jim Biden, for $50,000 to withdraw from Lion Hall Group. I want to submit that withdrawal receipt for the record, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. On August 28, actually, Mr. Chairman, we have the deposit reference into Sara Jones Biden's account on the same day she withdrew it from Lion Hall. I want to submit that for the record. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. Last document. On September 3, 2007, from Sara Biden's own personal account, there is a check that is written to Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., the President of the United States today, for $40,000, signed loan repayment, a loan repayment, by the way, that Joe Biden's own personal accountant, Mr. Eric Schwerin, has no record for. I want to submit that for the record, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Donalds. To the Members of the Committee, it is clear that the source of this money came from CEFC and that CEFC is a company that is directly linked to the CCP and actually, the chairman of the CCP, and the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Xi Jinping. With that, I yield. Chairman Comer. Very good. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, I have got a UC request, if it is OK. Chairman Comer. Go ahead. Mr. Raskin. First, ``A White House For Sale,'' the staff report of the Minority side, which details the CEFC's business interactions with Donald Trump. They own a $5.5 million unit in Trump World Tower and others. And then the Department of Justice press release announcing the sentencing of Jason Galanis in Federal court to term of 189 months in prison, ordering him to pay restitution of more than $80 million for three criminal fraud conspiracies against a Native-American tribe, pension funds, and other investors. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Mfume for 5 minutes. Mr. Mfume. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I am sitting here and I am imagining what I would be thinking if I were not here but rather somewhere around the country watching the Congress of the United States and, in this case, this Committee for 15 months hold these hearings on Hunter Biden and come up with not one impeachable offense in all that time, 15 months, over 10,000 documents and more, as you can see today, as a result of that. This is a do-nothing Congress, and we should be doing the jobs that we were sent here to do, which is not to have investigation hearing after investigation hearing over and over and over again and then run to our favorite TV outlet to give interviews afterwards. We were sent here to get a job done. Taxpayers are looking at all of us. Meanwhile, Americans, Black, White, Asian, Latino, Native American, and their families are wondering what the hell is going on. Is this another investigation hearing, in this 15 months, that has yielded nothing at all? It is the do-nothing Congress. You thought Harry Truman said it in 1948. Anybody can say it today. Look at what we have done in 15 months. Virtually nothing. Nothing at all. Senior citizens sit in their homes and watch C-SPAN or some other outlet carry this. Some of them sitting in nursing homes. All of them worried about losing their Social Security. They are on fixed incomes, and they expect the Congress to use its time and its energy to deal with things that affect them directly. Students are defaulting on loans to colleges all over the country, and no one wants to talk about that. Healthcare is not adequate in most places in this country, and diseases are ravaging our communities, and people assume that at some point the Congress will deal with that. And so, whether it is cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, HIV, stroke, the disparities in the health system, say please, please give us a little bit of your time also when you are not dealing with Hunter Biden and when you cannot prove that he has done anything wrong. Crime is out of control, white collar as well as black collar, and assault weapons are still being used every day to shoot and kill innocent children and Americans, and we are sitting up here talking about something that we have talked about for 15 months with no substantial evidence. Cannot get humanitarian aid to Palestine. Cannot get military aid to the Ukraine. Children are looking and wondering what the hell is going on? Is that what politics are about? So, we are doing a disservice. I know I am supposed to be asking questions, and, Mr. Parnas, I may have one or two for you. But I am so outraged at a do-nothing Congress just pointing the finger, pointing the finger over and over again, and people are hurting, looking for real help. Cannot deal with immigration because Donald Trump calls up and kills the immigration bill, and yet people say that is the major issue. Is it? I have not seen the sort of attention that we thought we were putting to that or anything else. And so, this particular hearing will probably be followed by another hearing and another hearing and another hearing until this Congress expires in January of next year, and we have not done a damn thing to move the ball forward except make accusations. Life is too short. Now, maybe some of you have a guarantee you are going to be around forever, but I do not. I came to this body first in 1987. I worked under Ronald Reagan and the first Bush, and Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, and now Joe Biden. This Congress is not doing anything. It is not like the previous Congresses, trust me. That is why people have such a low esteem of those of us who say well, ``I am Congressman so-and-so.'' People on the street do not buy that. They do not see the action. So, I am done. I know I have exhausted my time. Mr. Parnas, a couple of quick questions, and I will let you go. Is it your understanding that Rudy Giuliani worked for an individual identified by the Trump Administration as a Russian agent? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Mfume. Do you know what these Russian lying actors were trying to do? Quickly. Mr. Parnas. Push a conspiracy theory about the Bidens. Mr. Mfume. Did you warn Rudy Giuliani? Mr. Parnas. Yes, I did. Mr. Mfume. And what was his response? Succinctly. Mr. Parnas. I mean he agreed with me, but then proceeded to work with these people behind my back. Mr. Mfume. And these people have been identified as Russian agents? Mr. Parnas. Yes, sir. Mr. Mfume. And we have got a meeting here of Mr. Giuliani with one of those. I am disgusted, as most people are, about this process. And the only way we get to a point where we get things done is that we learn to talk to one another across the aisle without having another conspiracy theory after another one after another one. You do not buy trust that way. You buy contempt. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Lisa McClain for 5 minutes. Mrs. McClain. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start off by saying I think most Americans are taught at a very young age that you are who you surround yourself with. I keep that in a premise as I sat here and listened to everyone talk about how Hunter Biden is just this golden boy. I mean, are we really supposed to believe that Hunter Biden is the golden boy? His associates, such as Jason Galanis and Devon Archer, are felons convicted of fraud, yet he is the golden child. I want to talk about examples of Biden's influence peddling scheme. This time it was Romania. It follows the same general pattern as we have seen with other countries like China, Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Here is the pattern. It is really simple. A corrupt foreign oligarch needs access to the U.S. Government. Hunter Biden sells influence to the U.S. Government. The oligarchs pay up. So, let us just take a deeper dive into this Romanian scheme. Mr. Bobulinski, who is Gabriel Popoviciu? Mr. Bobulinski. Gabriel Popoviciu is a businessman from Romania, probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars, I would envision. Mrs. McClain. OK. Is it true that Gabriel Popoviciu faced corruption charges in Romania in 2015? Mr. Bobulinski. It is. Mrs. McClain. Thank you. And when you were in Europe with the Bidens to close on that CEFC deal with the Chinese, you separately negotiated with Popoviciu to get a 17th payment. Is that also correct? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. Mrs. McClain. OK. But Popoviciu did not want to pay him. Is that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. You are talking about a 17th payment that would go to Rob Walker, and then Rob Walker would distribute to Hunter Biden. Mrs. McClain. That is correct. And is it because Hunter Biden had failed in the work he was engaged by Popoviciu to do, which was to get the corruption charges dismissed by the Romanian authorities? Isn't that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, it was two things. That they had failed to do that, but also that Joe Biden had left the White House at that point. Mrs. McClain. OK. So, there is a dot. So, I get 16 payments while Joe Biden is in the White House. Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mrs. McClain. But after Joe Biden leaves the White House, coincidentally the payments stop? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mrs. McClain. OK. I just want to make sure that we can connect the dots very simply. Mr. Bobulinski. But obviously, it was not a coincidence. Mrs. McClain. Right. I am not much for coincidences, which neither are the American people, but, Mr. Bobulinski, what do you think Popoviciu wanted Hunter Biden to do? Mr. Bobulinski. I do not have to think because Gabriel told me personally and did not want the details. He expected Hunter Biden, Rob Walker, and James Gilliar to do whatever was necessary to impact his case in Romania. Mrs. McClain. Well, how do you know that? Mr. Bobulinski. Because Gabriel Popoviciu told me that. Mrs. McClain. From his mouth? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Mrs. McClain. OK. So, there is another dot that we can connect. Would that be a conspiracy theory? Mr. Bobulinski. That is not a conspiracy theory. Mrs. McClain. OK. Thank you. Mr. Bobulinski. I would encourage you to interview Gabriel Popoviciu. Mrs. McClain. Thank you. Lastly, after claiming he wanted a public hearing, Hunter Biden decided to skip today. Why do you think he skipped the hearing today? Mr. Bobulinski. Is that a rhetorical, or a serious? Well, I do not think he wanted to sit next to me because, obviously, I have emphatically stated he perjured himself in his transcribed interview with the committee, as did his uncle, Jim Biden. And for every fact he claims or wants to say I was high on drugs or obfuscate, I can show a document, a text message, a recording that confirms that he is lying. Mrs. McClain. Well, let us not let the facts get in the way of a good story, right? Here are the facts. Mr. Bobulinski. Highly disappointing that he is not here, though. Mrs. McClain. I would agree. I would agree. Here are the facts. Hunter Biden was engaged by a foreign principal, Gabriel Popoviciu. It is well known that Hunter Biden met with the Ambassador to Romania, Hans Klemm, in November 2015. Hunter Biden was not registered under FARA. He stopped getting paid as soon as his father leaves office until you got Popoviciu to send Hunter Biden one more payment. Seriously, what services was Hunter Biden providing to the Romanian oligarchs for millions of dollars? We have yet to hear it. As far as the Committee knows, Hunter Biden was never registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. If the Department of Justice applied the same standards it did in the Paul Manafort case, Hunter would be in more trouble than he is already in. Mr. Chairman, there are real FARA issues here that we need to continue to look at. And with that, I thank you for being here, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Absolutely. Thank you. Good job. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez from New York. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Bobulinski, I heard your opening statement. It is submitted to the record, part of our proceedings. I have a quick question, simple. Is it your testimony today that you personally witnessed President Joe Biden commit a crime? Mr. Bobulinski. I believe the fact that he was sitting with me while I was putting together a business deal---- Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Did you witness the President commit a crime? Is it your testimony today? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. And what crime have you witnessed? Mr. Bobulinski. How much time do I have to go through it? Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. It is simple. You name the crime. Did you watch him steal something? Mr. Bobulinski. Corruption statutes, RICO, and conspiracy, FARA. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. What is the crime, sir, specifically? Mr. Bobulinski. You asked me to answer the question. I answered the question. RICO. You are obviously not familiar with the corruption statute. FARA. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. RICO is not a crime. It is a category. What is the crime? Mr. Bobulinski. It is the category of crimes that you are then charged under---- Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. You have charges. Sir, please name---- Mr. Bobulinski. You want me to name the exact statute under RICO? Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, it is funny. In this committee room-- everyone is not here--there are over 18 lawyers that went to law school. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. All right, sir. I reclaim my time. I reclaim my time. Mr. Bobulinski. I will leave it up to you guys to define the statute under RICO. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. OK. Thank you, sir. I reclaim my time. Clearly, what we are seeing here today is a continuation of the 15-month saga of the Republican Majority lost in the desert. Impeachment 101: the Majority party or whomever is raising impeachment must accuse the President of a specific high crime or misdemeanor. I would like to submit to the record H. Res. 918, the House resolution to open this impeachment inquiry. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. This resolution does not outline a high crime or misdemeanor. It is not here. Now, when we compare the Chairman's opening from his previous opening, he is talking about Ukraine and Burisma and all of this. This entire inquiry is based on a blockbuster piece of information that was in a classified SCIF room, and inside that room was a document alleging President Biden, directly, of a $10 million bribery scheme. A $10 million bribery scheme is extremely serious. What happened? What happened a month ago, Mr. Chairman? The FBI arrested the person who offered those allegations for falsifying his testimony to the FBI. This entire impeachment inquiry is based on an actual, provable individual who has lied. Now, responsible leadership would withdraw an inquiry based on that. Withdraw it. Instead, what we are seeing is that this Committee was warned about the falsehoods of these allegations long before that, warned by Trump Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and yet they proceeded anyway. The Chairman proceeded anyway. This Committee was warned by Rudy Giuliani associate right here, Lev Parnas, after that document about the falsehoods of this, then held hearings, where your own expert witnesses said that there was no ground for impeachment, and you proceeded anyway. And finally, as if none of this was enough, the FBI arrested the individual who was the source of the entire ``heart of the matter'' to launch this impeachment inquiry, and proceeded anyway. At this point, the story is not the fact that the basis of this impeachment inquiry is wrong. The story is why it is proceeding anyway. Why is this Committee proceeding based on false charges, and, by the way, no charges? I have yet to hear in the Chairman's opening the allegation that they are specifically charging the President of the United States with. I am hearing about the Biden family. I am hearing about this and that. I am not hearing the specific allegation by this Committee. What is it? It is not here, and that is the problem. The story is when this Committee knew that they were working with falsified evidence. That is the story. And with that, I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Mace from South Carolina for 5 minutes. Ms. Mace. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On March 1, 2024, Joe Biden stated he did not interact with Hunter or Jim Biden business associates. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a New York Post article, ``Biden Insists He Did Not Interact With'' family business partners. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Ms. Mace. We are going to go fast here. I have strictly ``yes'' or ``no'' questions. On that note, the New York Post article, Joe Biden also said read the record of every single witness, so I did. I first read Devon Archer's deposition, and he interacted with Joe Biden. Then I read the transcripts of Rob Walker, Eric Schwerin, George Berges, Kevin Morris, Tony Bobulinski, and Jason Galanis, and every single one of them interacted with Joe Biden, and that is just the people we interviewed. Mr. Galanis, my first questions are for you. Did Hunter Biden call Joe Biden with Yelena Baturina on the line on May 4, 2014. Yes or no? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. In that call, did Hunter Biden state on this call with Joe Biden that ``everything is good and we are moving forward''? Mr. Galanis. Yes, he did. Ms. Mace. OK. On the same call, did Joe Biden in the call was saying, ``OK then. You be good to my boy?'' Mr. Galanis. Yes, he said that as well. Ms. Mace. OK. Did Baturina agree to put $20 million into one of Hunter Biden's business projects days later after this phone call? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. Did Hunter Biden ever take a call from Joe Biden while at the Peninsula Bar in New York? Mr. Galanis. I am sorry. I did not hear that. Ms. Mace. Did Hunter Biden ever take a call from Joe Biden while at the Peninsula Bar in New York? Mr. Galanis. Yes, he did. Ms. Mace. During this call did Hunter Biden update Joe Biden on progress on landing a business partnership with Harvest Fund Management? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. Was Harvest a $300 billion Chinese financial services company closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party? Mr. Galanis. Yes, it was. Ms. Mace. OK. Mr. Galanis. And, it is. Ms. Mace. Is Hunter Biden involved with Harvest? Mr. Galanis. Hunter Biden is involved with Harvest in two ways, through BHR, which is a fund that Harvest is---- Ms. Mace. Is Hunter Biden involved with Harvest? Yes or no. Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. As part of the deal---- Mr. Galanis. And sent an email to that effect. Ms. Mace. As part of the deal, did Hunter Biden want the company to reserve a board seat for Joe Biden? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. Did Henry Zhao, a Chinese businessman, want assurances that Joe Biden would join the board? Yes or no. Mr. Galanis. Yes, he did. Ms. Mace. OK. Did Hunter Biden---- Mr. Galanis. He discussed that in emails as well, and in conversations. Ms. Mace. OK. Thank you. Did Hunter Biden draft an email stating, ``Please also remind Henry Zhao of our conversation about a board seat for a certain relation of mine. Devon and I golfed with that relation earlier this week and we discussed this very idea again, and as always, he remains very, very keen on the opportunity.'' [Chart] Here is a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer and Hunter Biden golfing days before the alleged email draft. Do you believe a certain relation of mine refers to Joe Biden? Mr. Galanis. I do not think there is any question. It was based on firsthand conversations with Devon Archer, who was in that picture and in that golf meeting, yes. Ms. Mace. Did you ever meet with Devon Archer where Hunter took calls from his father? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. During one of these phone calls, did Hunter Biden tell Joe Biden that he and Henry Zhao needed help ``getting across the finish line?'' Mr. Galanis. Yes, that is correct. Ms. Mace. OK. Mr. Bobulinski, do you recall receiving an email that floated the possibility of giving 10-percent ownership of SinoHawk to Joe Biden through Hunter Biden? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. My last questions are for both of you very quickly. Mr. Bobulinski and Mr. Galanis, you both stated you were told not to use Joe Biden's name in communications, correct? Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Ms. Mace. Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. Did Joe Biden participate in phone conversations and meetings with Hunter Biden and his business associates and foreign interest? Yes or no, Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. He clearly did. He met them twice---- Ms. Mace. OK. Mr. Galanis, yes or no? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. OK. In Hunter Biden's deposition, he said he did not involve his father in his business. Did Hunter Biden lie under oath? Yes or no, Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Ms. Mace. Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. If that is what he said, yes, that would be untrue. Ms. Mace. OK. Is Joe Biden lying when he says he did not interact with Hunter Biden, Jim Biden, their business partners, or foreign interest? Yes or no. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Ms. Mace. Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Mace. All right. In a debate on October 22d, 2020, Joe Biden denied Hunter Biden made money from China. Did Hunter Biden, his business associates, and foreign interests include money from Chinese businesses, business partners, and/or interests? Yes or no. Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. I am sorry. Did the Biden family make money---- Ms. Mace. Did Hunter Biden receive money from Chinese business interests? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Yes. Ms. Mace. Mr. Galanis, did Hunter Biden receive money from Chinese business interests? Yes or no. Mr. Galanis. Yes, he was. Ms. Mace. OK. Thank you. Mr. Galanis. Yes, he had economic interest, and, yes---- Ms. Mace. All right. Mr. Galanis [continuing]. He was---- Ms. Mace. Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed that he was not involved in Hunter Biden, Jim Biden, or any other Biden family business deals. Today, our witnesses have proved otherwise. Today, we have established Joe Biden lied about interacting with Hunter Biden's business associates. It is my belief Joe Biden is the closer for Hunter Biden, Jim Biden, and their business associates and foreign interests. Good luck to the left proving otherwise. Thank you, and I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Porter from California. Ms. Porter. The title of this hearing is, ``Influence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden's Abuse of Public Office.'' Look, the impeachment inquiry is dead. If it was on life support, my colleague Ocasio-Cortez just killed it. There is no allegation of a specific crime. President Biden did not do anything wrong. There is zero evidence of that, and sill, both Democrats and Republicans and the media treat these hearings like the Super Bowl, but no one ever wins, and Americans always lose. So, I have got a fresh direction for this hearing. [Chart] All we have to do is cross off the part after the colon, there, just ``Influence Peddling.'' We should have a policy discussion about how to stop government officials from using their positions to get money or favors. Now that is a real hearing, one that nearly every American, regardless of party, wants us to hold. We could start by talking about how senior executive branch officials can leave public service, wait just 1 year, and then legally become lobbyists for big corporations, scoring their new employer's profitable government contracts and favorable regulations. They can even be paid by the big corporations during that short 1 year while they are waiting to become lobbyists as a downpayment for their future ability to peddle influence. That is wrong. For the panel of witnesses, by show of hands, as Americans, would our witnesses support extending this 1 year waiting period to at least 2 years? Mr. Bobulinski. I would. Ms. Porter. OK. So, there we go. Republicans, Democrats, even convicted criminals, everybody supports that we should do more to stop influence peddling. This is the kind of good government reform that Americans of all political stripes support, and I should know. In 2022, I passed that exact reform as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act with a bipartisan majority vote. What happened to that amendment? Why didn't it become law? The answer is simple: nearly 500 former Members of Congress work for lobbying firms, and too many people around here want to follow in their footsteps and so do not want to make it harder for government officials to become lobbyists. Ultimately, Democratic leadership under then- Speaker Nancy Pelosi let the amendment get stripped out of the final bill. When I offered up the amendment again during this Congress, Republican leadership under then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy never even put the amendment up for a vote. Both parties have let us down on fighting influence peddling and tackling corruption, but I am hopeful we can begin a new approach in this very Committee. The American people, regardless of party, should know that an investigation was conducted into whether Joe Biden did anything wrong. We followed the evidence to where it led: a dead end. So, this impeachment inquiry should end today. And where should we go from here? We should stop partisan attacks on each other and address the real problem, that the American people believe that the rules that prevent corruption are way too weak. To stop politicians on both sides of the aisle from influence peddling, this Committee should be working together in a bipartisan way to change the culture of Congress, to crack down on influence peddling and corruption, and, just as importantly, to stop the perception of it. Let me give you some facts. I do not even need a whiteboard for this one: 495 former Members of Congress work for lobbying firms. Four-hundred-and-sixty-seven Members of Congress take corporate PAC money. Seventy-eight Members of Congress violated the STOCK Act last Congress. Clearly, we have our work cut out for us. So, let us start the conversation today on what a bipartisan ethics reform package could look like. [Chart] Here are the organizations that could have come today as witnesses so we could have had a productive conversation. Oversight staff, do you have your notebooks ready? Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Common Cause, Project on Government Oversight, Public Citizen. With the right witnesses and the commitment to doing what the American people want, this Committee can have a real conversation about the problem of influence peddling. And we can pass legislation to create badly needed ethics guardrails. That would be real work, not a real circus. I yield back. Chairman Comer. Before I recognize Mr. Timmons, Ms. Porter, I think you are sincere, and I look forward to working with you on that legislation. Ms. Porter. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Parnas. Chairman, can we take a 5-minute break? I need to go to the bathroom. Chairman Comer. Let us get one more, and then we will do that. The Chair recognizes Mr. Timmons for 5 minutes, then we will take a break because we have votes coming up anyway. Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At our hearing last July, I laid out the scheme that the Bidens concocted to sell the Biden brand, netting almost $30 million for various members of the Biden family. This scheme was repeated with various clients in Kazakhstan, China, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. I am going to spend my time on just one instance, Ukraine, specifically involving Burisma, which netted Hunter over $3 million during a 3-year period. And to clarify the criminal offenses being alleged, for Hunter Biden, it is conspiracy to commit bribery, 18 U.S.C., Section 201(b)(2)(A) and (C), and for Joe Biden, it is conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right, 18 U.S.C., Section 1951 (b)(2). And if you want a refresher on those, just look up Senator Menendez and his wife's indictment. [Chart] So, let us start with this. Foreign client has a problem. I have got an email here from Vadym Pozharsky, the secretary of Burisma, and he is advocating that Hunter Biden intervened with high-level U.S. officials to facilitate meetings and communications expressing their positive opinion of Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma, to the Ukrainian President, chief of staff, prosecutor general, with the ultimate purpose to close down any cases against Zlochevsky in Ukraine. This is dated November 2. Now, keep in mind, and again, foreign client has a problem. Zlochevsky is being investigated by Viktor Shokin, the Inspector General of Ukraine, and he needs help, the Biden brand. So, here we got bank records galore of Hunter Biden receiving, prior to this email, over a million dollars. After this email, $2 million. You will find out in a second, he really earned his fee. So, again, client pays Biden $3 million. [Chart] Next. What is it? What happens? What happens? This is great. Eleven days later, we have the U.S. embassy in Ukraine announcing that Vice President Biden is traveling to Ukraine on December 7. Oh, interesting. Vice President Biden travels to the country. Here we got a great photo of him touching down. They are very proud of themselves. So, Vice President Biden leverages U.S. policy to achieve a favorable outcome for the client. We have all seen the video. He brags about leveraging U.S. foreign loan guarantees to get the Ukrainian Government to fire Viktor Shokin to end the investigation. Again, we have got the email from Pozharsky saying that we need to leverage you, who have not provided value yet for your million dollars in service, Hunter. He brings in the ``Big Guy.'' Biden leverages U.S. influence, withholds a billion dollars in loan guarantee to fire Shokin. So, if that is not enough, we got the victory lap here. We got an email just a few months later saying, whoa, we won in less than a year. You brought us in, so take a victory lap. So, look, I mean, this is straightforward. This is straightforward: pay to play. It is bribery. Hunter Biden was paid $3 million at the lowest point in his life. He testified in the deposition that he was drug addicted, that he has never been to Ukraine, yet he is paid $3 million to get his father to go to solve his client's problem. That is the scheme. Mr. Bobulinski, does this sound like the scheme that you have seen the Biden family do? Mr. Bobulinski. I was not involved in Ukraine, but the facts surrounding this are very similar to CEFC and Romania. Mr. Timmons. Thank you for that. So, this is the thing. If Hunter Biden were here, we would be able to ask him some questions, maybe clear this up, but he is not. He is not here. And what is interesting is that just yesterday, Peter Navarro reported to Federal prison in Miami for 4 months for not showing up in front of the January 6th Committee. And I want to point out to everybody that the January 6 Committee was procedurally defective under House rules. It was procedurally defective because the Minority leader did not get to appoint Members to that Committee. The U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Accountability Committee is a procedurally perfect Committee, and we have authority to subpoena Hunter Biden, and he has to show up. He has to answer these questions, and he has to tell the world that his father did not leverage U.S. foreign policy so he would get $3 million. This is no different than what Senator Menendez did. And look, the American people are not buying this nonsense you all are selling. We must restore their faith in our institutions, and we have to stop this ridiculous two-tiered system of justice where the Department of Justice persecutes President Trump and hides Hunter Biden behind every corner. I mean, this is not the United States of America that the American people deserve, and we have to get our country back on track. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Moskowitz. Mr. Chairman, pardon my inquiry. Did the Committee subpoena Hunter Biden today? Chairman Comer. Pursuant to the previous order and at the request of the Minority witness, the Chair declares the Committee in recess for 10 minutes. Then we are going to come back in here, and then we may have to recess again for votes. [Recess.] Chairman Comer. The Committee will resume. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Brown from Ohio for 5 minutes. Ms. Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today's hearing is another unfortunate attempt by my Republican colleagues to muddy the water in an election year with no proof, no evidence, no wrongdoing at all by President Biden. The American people are tired of this charade. As I said before, my Republican colleagues simply grasp at straws that do not exist. While House Democrats in the Biden-Harris Administration work to cut costs of prescription drugs, expand student loan forgiveness, and mitigate the threat of gun violence, Republican Members of Congress continue to chase after Russian disinformation campaigns from the 2020 election, which have been thoroughly debunked again and again, and as usual, in this Committee, we know who is in charge. It is the bondless, broke, bluffer, twice impeached, four times indicted, insurrection initiator, election denying, self-declared dictator on day one, and puppet for Putin. The one who wants to terminate the Constitution and defund the FBI. The one who romanticizes exchanging of love letters with North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un. The one who just last week embraced autocrat Orban of Hungary to discuss their diabolical plans to destroy our democracy. The one who proposed the policy to ban Muslims from this country. The one who just this week said any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat hates their religion and Israel. The one who called Neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches, chanting ``Jews will not replace us,'' good people. The one who referred to African nations as ``shithole'' countries. The one who called NFL players, the majority whom are black, sons of bitches for taking a knee in protest of the ever-present racial inequality and police brutality that continues to pervade our justice system. The one who called Mexicans rapists and promised to build a wall and have them pay for it, and, in case you missed it, it did not happen. The one who told women of color born in the United States, elected to Congress, and serving on this very Committee to go back to their own countries. The one who bragged about grabbing women by their private parts. The one who confused his rape victim whom he claimed was not his type for his very own ex- wife. The one who is an admitted and committed adultery, who attempted to pay off a porn star for her silence. The one who has publicly mocked people with disabilities. The one who dodged the draft and referred to prisoners of war as losers, the very people who pay a high price so we can enjoy the freedoms that far too many of us take for granted. The one who boasted about being able to stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and not lose votes. The one who promoted political and physical violence multiple times, including most recently at my rally in my home state of Ohio, where he declared there would be a bloodbath if he did not win. The one who intentionally denied COVID was deadly and eventually suggested injecting bleach into our bodies to kill the respiratory virus that took the lives of 1 million people in the United States. The one who ordered his son-in-law get top secret security clearance, overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials, who, according to this Committee's Chairman, admitted the former President's son- in-law crossed the line of ethics by accepting a $2 billion investment into that very same son-in-law's fledgling firm, only 6 months after leaving the White House. If any of this sounds crazy, it is because it is. This might sound unbelievable, but it is all true. These are facts, indisputable facts, a thing that is known and proven to be true. This may be a foreign concept to some of my colleagues, but for those of us who still have a relationship with the truth, please know this is not an exhaustive list of inappropriate, unethical, and questionable behavior by the maniacal manipulator of Mar-a-Lago because I could go on, but I only have 5 minutes. Yet here we are, again, trying to make sense out of nonsense. I would humbly, respectfully ask my Republican colleagues on this Committee to stop falling over yourself to win the approval of one because millions of people are depending on you to defend our delicate democracy. And with that, I yield the remainder of my time to the Ranking Member. Chairman Comer. You have seconds. Mr. Raskin. Oh, I do not know there is much time left, but thank you for that eloquent and compressed recitation of some of what we have lived with over the last few years. Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes Mr. LaTurner from Kansas for 5 minutes. Mr. LaTurner. Mr. Bobulinski, I want to talk about May 2017. To be clear, Hunter Biden was doing business with CEFC while his dad was VP. Are you aware of that now? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Mr. LaTurner. Rob Walker told us that during his transcribed interview before the Committee, but I want to talk to you about your meeting with Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Jim Biden in May 2017. Other Members are going to bring up the meeting you have had with Joe Biden at the Beverly Hilton the night before the Milken Conference, but I want to talk about the next day when you went as Joe Biden's guest to the Milken Conference. So, you watched Joe Biden deliver a speech that day, then you had a followup conversation with Joe Biden. Isn't that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. LaTurner. What did Joe Biden tell you during that conversation? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, as I have already publicly shared, I was brought backstage by his team because he had just given his keynote and we just exchanged pleasantries. And then I walked him out to his car, and he specifically thanked me for the work I was doing with his son and his brother and asked me to keep an eye on them. Mr. LaTurner. And my understanding is, Mr. Bobulinski, that after Joe Biden had left, you went across the street to the Peninsula Hotel and had a long conversation with his brother, Jim Biden. Isn't that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. Mr. LaTurner. It is my understanding that you asked him how the Biden family does the business that they do while Joe Biden is such a prominent political figure. What was Jim Biden's response to you? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. I was actually concerned and asking from a position of concern, and Jim Biden's response to me was plausible deniability. Mr. LaTurner. Plausible deniability. And by that, you mean Joe Biden would be kept in the loop, but you were not supposed to talk about it, especially in writing. Mr. Galanis, during your transcribed interview with the Committees, you said a very interesting phrase, ``Say it, forget it, write it, regret it.'' Does this sound familiar? Is this consistent with your understanding of how the Bidens do business, Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. Yes, very much. So, that was an operating principle, yes. Mr. LaTurner. But it looks like someone made a mistake. Mr. Bobulinski, you created two companies with the Bidens. I want to show you an infamous email discussing the ownership structure of one of those companies. [Chart] CEFC, you can see on the screen, 20 percent for H, 20 percent for Rob Walker, 20 percent for James Gilliar, 20 percent for Tony Bobulinski, 10 percent for Jim Biden, and 10 percent held by H for the ``Big Guy.'' Mr. Bobulinski, who is the ``Big Guy''? Mr. Bobulinski. The ``Big Guy'' is 100 percent Joe Biden. Mr. LaTurner. Mr. Bobulinski, Hunter Biden did not respond saying knock it off, we cannot include Joe Biden, did he? Mr. Bobulinski. No, and that is actually a critical point because remember---- Mr. LaTurner. Mr. Bobulinski, did you ever get a text message or a group text message or anything like that saying, guys, knock it off, Joe Biden is not involved in this deal? Mr. Bobulinski. No, the whistleblowers actually have a text exchange where they are talking about everything else but that, and the reason why they were not talking about it is because everyone knew Joe Biden was the ``Big Guy.'' Mr. LaTurner. Hunter Biden begged for a public hearing, but it turns out he is too afraid of accountability to show up and tell the truth to the American people, but Americans do not need Hunter's testimony to know they are being gaslit by this President. It is blatantly obvious to anyone paying attention that Joe Biden is the ``Big Guy.'' The CEFC deal broke the ``say it, forget it, write it, regret it'' rule of the Biden family businesses, and now they are trying to cover it up. Joe Biden said repeatedly that his family never made a dime from China, but Mr. Bobulinski just confirmed that Hunter, Jim, and the ``Big Guy'' himself all got a cut from the CEFC China Energy deal. Let me be clear. The only service the Biden family ever provided was their ability to leverage the office of the Vice President of the United States to cash in overseas. My Democrat colleagues are going to try and tell you that Joe Biden was not on the final ownership structure agreement, but isn't it true, if someone was holding Joe Biden's stake in the company, it would not appear in the document? Isn't that the whole point of this email, to hold Joe Biden's stake so his name would not be in the document? Isn't this just plausible deniability in action, Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. It appears that way. Mr. LaTurner. But plausible deniability only gets you so far. Now, I want to fast forward from May to the end of July 2017, when the Bidens cut you out of the deal. I want to show you a message that Hunter sent to his Chinese business partners. Please put it up on the screen. [Chart] Hunter writes, ``I am sitting here with my father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled.'' So, when Hunter Biden is desperate for money, Jim Biden's old trick of plausible deniability does not cut it. And when desperate times call for desperate measures, Hunter Biden let the cat out of the bag, said the quiet part out loud, and gave the game away by calling on his father to help him shake down his Chinese business partners for the money, and it worked. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, just a point of inquiry, what was the last image we saw that you put up? Where did that come from? I just want to authenticate that. Mr. LaTurner. This is the Ways and Means Committee Exhibit 300. Chairman Comer. Must be the IRS whistleblower note. Not an inquiry, though. Anyway, the Chair recognizes Ms. Stansbury for the last question. Ms. Stansbury. All right. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to the GOP's day-long campaign for Donald Trump. I want to start with Mr. Galanis to help connect some dots that have not yet been connected in this hearing. Mr. Galanis, you are serving just under 16 years for, among other things, as has been said today, defrauding a tribal nation and specifically a tribal corporation held by the Oglala Sioux, which is why you are testifying from a prison today. But I would like to ask you, Mr. Galanis, have you had an attorney representing you before this Committee that you retained last December, and that attorney's name is Mr. Mark Paoletta, correct? Mr. Galanis. That is correct. Ms. Stansbury. And when you first testified before this Committee in a taped interview, you were actually stopped by Mr. Paoletta from answering just a simple question about how you met him and who exactly was paying your legal fees. Now, I want to make sure that the American people understand exactly who Mr. Paoletta is because he is, in fact, a former lawyer to Donald Trump, who served in the Administration in the Office of Management and Budget and was at the center of the Ukrainian pressure campaign for which Donald Trump was impeached. And, in fact, Mr. Paoletta was Trump's chief OMB lawyer when he withheld aid to Ukraine to try to extort the Ukrainian Government into investigating Joe Biden to support Donald Trump's campaign, and Mr. Paoletta literally wrote the memo to help withhold those funds. Now, I want to dig in a little bit on this pressure campaign, and Mr. Lev Parnas is here to discuss as an eyewitness who was there. Mr. Parnas, we appreciate you being here, and I want to move through this quickly, so just ask for simple ``yes'' or ``no'' answers. You have testified here today that Donald Trump repeatedly asked you and through Rudy Giuliani to put pressure on the Ukrainian Government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden to support Trump's campaign, correct? Mr. Parnas. One hundred percent, yes. [Chart] Ms. Stansbury. And as we can see here in this picture, you were very much a business associate of Rudy Giuliani during this time. And as established in your testimony, you traveled to and met with Ukrainian officials and told them that the White House would withhold its support and aid to Ukraine if it did not cooperate with this bribery, essentially. Mr. Parnas. That is correct. Ms. Stansbury. And as we all know, Donald Trump's Administration, and specifically, the Office of Management and Budget, did withhold that foreign aid in 2019. And here is the guy who did it, and he is representing the witness who is literally on Zoom with us for this Committee today. And it is the reason why Donald Trump was impeached the first time and the man at the center of that scheme is involved in the House GOP's inquiry. But I also want to point out that Mr. Paoletta is also involved in and very much in bed with the Thomases. In fact, he represented Ms. Ginni Thomas, Clarence Thomas' wife, in her involvement in the Stop the Steal before the January 6 Committee, and actually also goes on vacation with Mr. Harlan Crow and the Thomases, so this man has quite an interesting roster and participation in this hearing. But the bigger picture here is that Mr. Paoletta's presence is yet another indication of the way in which this hearing and this impeachment inquiry is part of Donald Trump's larger misinformation campaign, just like it was in 2020, where in addition to pressuring and withholding aid to Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani, and the Trump organization, as Mr. Parnas has established, planted the story in the media. And now here we are 4 years later as they have dredged it back up and are planting it back in the media using Congress, using this Committee, and using a baseless impeachment, supported by Donald Trump's own allies on this Committee, to push that information out, as Members on this Committee have trafficked in false evidence that was planted by a Russian operative to the FBI and is now in jail for that. All of this is in the service of propping up the criminal enterprise for which Donald Trump is at the top and has already been twice impeached. Rudy Giuliani and others have been exposed as they continue to traffic in Russian disinformation that not only props up Donald Trump, but it props up Vladimir Putin himself and his goals back in Russia and in Ukraine. So, I just want to point out here that once again, as I said, when we had a false impeachment hearing a few months ago, that once again we see the long arm---- Chairman Comer. Time has expired. The gentlelady's time has expired. Ms. Stansbury. [continuing]. And little hands of Donald Trump all over this hearing. Chairman Comer. And I just want to state you made a mistake and said that Mr. Parnas was a Republican witness. He is very much your witness, not a Republican witness. Mr. Parnas. But I was a Republican for Donald Trump. Ms. Stansbury. Mr. Chairman, I did not know I said that, so we can---- Chairman Comer. Pursuant to the previous order, the Chair declares the Committee in recess due to votes. Subject to the call of the Chair, we will reconvene 10 minutes after the three votes. [Recess.] Chairman Comer. All right. The Committee will reconvene. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Perry from Pennsylvania for 5 minutes. Mr. Perry. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Galanis, I am going to turn my questions to you. I hope I can see you on the screen here shortly. Are you there, Mr. Galanis? There you are. OK. If we can jump right into another Biden Chinese deal made while Joe Biden was in office, a deal I think you described in your interview as a quid pro quo where the Chinese sent millions in exchange for a post-VP job for President Biden. Can you tell us, what was Burnham? Mr. Galanis. Yes. So Burnham was an 85-year-old financial services company based in New York. It owned an asset management firm and a securities dealer, but relative to the Chinese, it was an unimportant, small player. I will give you a scale: $1.5 billion versus $300 billion Chinese company. Mr. Perry. So, what was Hunter Biden's interest in working with them knowing that that was the situation? Mr. Galanis. I think Hunter Biden was already working with them through the fund that was created. The BHR, Harvest was the ``H,'' and as described in some of Hunter's emails that I had provided to the Committee, he described the activity with BHR, the Harvest activity, as one of his only focuses, and his other focus would be the activity between Harvest directly and Burnham directly and a combination. Stated in his own words in writing was those were to be his only focus and his only priority in working with the Chinese on a go-forward basis. Mr. Perry. Did you also say that he said the interest in working with Burnham was to make billions instead of millions? Is that right? Mr. Galanis. Yes, I did say that, and that was on the basis of looking to become a much larger company where his equity interest would be worth a lot of money. Billions, not millions. Mr. Perry. And you said the Harvest Fund was a $300 billion Chinese financial services company. Was it likely connected or was it connected closely to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Government? Mr. Galanis. That is my understanding. Mr. Perry. OK. And who was Henry Zhao? Mr. Galanis. He has been described to me consistently by Devon and Hunter as the Chairman, but he is essentially the head of Harvest. I think he has had a couple of different roles over the years. He was always characterized as Chairman and the decisionmaker for that entity. Mr. Perry. Right. So, he is the chairman of the $300 billion Chinese entity connected to the Chinese Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and he was based out of where? Where was his base of operations? Mr. Galanis. In Beijing, China, PRC. Mr. Perry. And like you said, you heard him referred to occasionally as ``Chairman Zhao,'' right? Mr. Galanis. Most of the time it was Chairman Zhao out of respect for the Chairman, yes. Mr. Perry. OK. So, now there came to a point where Hunter wanted to bring Henry Zhao, the Chairman of Harvest, and their billions of dollars from China into business with Burnham. Is that right? Mr. Galanis. That is correct. That is correct, Congressman. Mr. Perry. And why would he do that? Mr. Galanis. It was a financial decision. The Chinese offered money, and he offered political access. It was an exchange. Mr. Perry. OK. Fair enough. It is pretty obvious what Harvest brings, right, $300 billion, but why would Harvest be interested in Burnham versus other financial institutions? I am sure there are other ones out there, and, like you said, it was fairly small. Harvest is $300 billion. Why would they care about this small Burnham? What was the interest for them? Mr. Galanis. The self-evident answer is the political access, and then sort of underscoring that is there are at least two emails produced that talk about exactly that. Hunter had characterized as Henry Zhao's interest in the access vehicle, so that was sort of explicit and in writing. Mr. Perry. OK. So, Joe Biden was going to sit on the board of a Chinese company connected to the highest levels of the Chinese Government, to the Chinese Communist Party. Stepping back, in your dealings with Hunter, what was the value that Hunter brought to the table? Mr. Galanis. It was the access to the inducement, to induce companies like this Harvest group to participate in Burnham. So, it was a what we call relationship capital that he brought to the table, not financial capital, the economic value to the business. Mr. Perry. Relationship capital that you described as the Biden lift. What was the Biden lift? Mr. Galanis. The Biden lift was simply Hunter's access to his father and his father's power, prestige, in influencing the growth of a financial services business which is largely reliant on its reputation and ability to attract other clients. Mr. Perry. I am running out of time here, but it sounds like a quid pro quo to me. Sir, did Harvest, in fact, invest money in Burnham? You called it a material inducement. Can you explain what that means, and do you know how much the Chinese paid? Mr. Galanis. I was out of the picture toward the end of 2015. I believe that they ended up paying $4 million into Burnham. I believe, though, as a result of legal entanglements that I encountered, that the transactions did not happen the way people expected or that they had written about in terms of what the Chinese were expected to do. Mr. Perry. All right. Mr. Galanis, I just want one last question. I am going to show you a draft email that you provided to the Committee. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Chairman Comer. Objection on time. Good job. The Chair now recognize Ms. Crockett for 1 minute--or 5 minutes. Ms. Crockett. One minute. All right. First of all, Mr. Bobulinski, do you know who Elections, LLC is? Mr. Bobulinski. Do I know who it is? Ms. Crockett. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, it is not a who. Ms. Crockett. OK. Well, do you know what it is? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. It is a LLC. Ms. Crockett. OK. And is it the LLC that your attorney works for? Mr. Bobulinski. I believe so, yes. Ms. Crockett. You believe so. OK. So, at this point in time, I would ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a document indicating that the law firm representing Tony Bobulinski was paid $10,000 as recently as January of this year by the Save America PAC, which you may recognize as Donald Trump's PAC. Chairman Comer. Without objection. Ms. Crockett. Thank you. Now, so far in this hearing, it has felt like the worst episode of ``The Apprentice.'' I am sure you are familiar with that show. It seems like my colleagues and maybe you and some others are trying to become the next vice president of the United States of America. You are auditioning or something like that because, Mr. Bobulinski, I know that you take exception to the fact that your credibility has been called into question over and over. But when someone comes to testify under oath, whether it is before this Committee, behind closed doors, or in person, then we have to evaluate someone's credibility. And, sir, I definitely have always had issues with your credibility, as I know that you are very well aware of, so let me remind you of what happened behind closed doors. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, you should ask Ro Khanna about my credibility. Ms. Crockett. I have not asked you a question, OK? Mr. Bobulinski. You are? Ms. Crockett. I have not. So, when I ask you a question, that is when you answer. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I thought so. Ms. Crockett. Otherwise, I am talking. Mr. Bobulinski. Excuse me? Ms. Crockett. So, with my time, because it is my time, I want to be clear that when we were behind closed doors, you called a number of people liars. You called the Wall Street Journal liars. You called Cassidy Hutchinson a liar. Mr. Bobulinski. She is. Ms. Crockett. You called the FBI a liar. You called Rob Walker a liar. You called James Gilliar a liar. You called Hunter Biden a liar. You called Jim Biden a liar. And just today, you added to your list, you called my colleague, Congressman, Mr. Goldman, a liar as well. It seems like, according to you, the only person that is telling the truth is you and everyone else is lying, but I want to move on to something else. Mr. Bobulinski. Is that a question or---- Ms. Crockett. It is not a question. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Ms. Crockett. You will know when I ask you a question, I promise. Mr. Bobulinski. Thank you. Ms. Crockett. So, the other thing that I want to talk about is the fact that my colleague from the other side of the aisle talked about the company that we keep, and she wanted to go through a list of people that she felt like were a bad company because, right now, the Majority has been relying upon the testimony of someone who is currently sitting in Federal prison. And we know that your company is the company of somebody who has been found liable of fraud, as well as defamation, as well as sexual assault, and for whatever reason cannot pay his bills at this point in time. But I am going to ask Mr. Parnas, so this is a question to him. Are you aware if Trump had any associates that have been found guilty of anything? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Lots of them. Ms. Crockett. Lots of them. Mr. Parnas. Me included. Ms. Crockett. You included. OK. So, when you were called here to testify, you were not called here to testify for any other reason than to tell the truth. Is that correct? Mr. Parnas. Yes, Congresswoman. Ms. Crockett. Now, we started this whole sham off because of the 1023, and that was debunked by you, was it not? Mr. Parnas. Yes, Congresswoman. Ms. Crockett. Way before we started this impeachment inquiry. And you mentioned a number of times this guy by the name of Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Parnas. Yes. Ms. Crockett. Now, you know, everybody is so stressed about the fact that Hunter is not here today, but, you know, Hunter came and testified behind closed doors for over 6 hours, and every single one of them, they were not limited to 5 minutes. They could ask whatever they wanted to, and there is a full transcript of his testimony, so I do not know what else they wanted to do besides the fact that they wanted to put on a show. But let me tell you something, this whole thing is based upon something that Giuliani came up with. Mr. Parnas. Yes. Ms. Crockett. And we tried to subpoena him. That is what I remember. If anybody else remembers, we tried. We asked. We said, hey, we should subpoena Giuliani, but, you know, kind of like when we were trying to get his cellphone, they shut it down, right? Like, they do not want the facts. But you would agree with me that considering the fact that you were working under Rudy Giuliani at the time that you went over to Ukraine, that he has maybe some valuable information that he could offer this Committee as to whether or not there is anything that we should be investigating in the first place. Mr. Parnas. Absolutely, Congresswoman. I wish that this Committee would subpoena Rudy Giuliani, put him under oath alongside me to get to the bottom of the truth of what actually happened in Ukraine and to the manipulation that Trump and Giuliani and the team went to do. Ms. Crockett. I agree with you, but somehow it does not look like we are going to get there, and I thank you for your time. With that I will yield. Chairman Comer. The time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Biggs from Arizona. Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Galanis, on May 9, 2014, you received an email from Devon Archer confirming, or you wrote an email confirming, that Ms. Baturina was investing with Burnham Investments, $15 to $20 million. Is that true? Mr. Galanis. Yes, Congressman. Mr. Biggs. And let us talk about the predicate for that. Ms. Baturina is the richest woman in Russia, and you knew her, and were you invited to a party that she attended? Mr. Galanis. Yes. In Brooklyn, yes. Mr. Biggs. Let us have the invitation up, please. [Chart] And here is a copy of the invitation that you received. Is that right? Mr. Galanis. No, I cannot see it, Congressman. I did receive an email invitation, so yes. Mr. Biggs. Yes, an email invitation, and did you go to that party? Mr. Galanis. Yes. I did attend that party, yes. Mr. Biggs. And was Hunter Biden at that party? Mr. Galanis. Yes, he was. Mr. Biggs. And we know that he was because we have a confirmation of his calendar, which is the next exhibit. [Chart] It was noted on there, and he showed up there, and so all of that is true. It is all verified right there, and Yelena Baturina and her then-husband, Yury, they were at the party, right? Mr. Galanis. Correct. Mr. Biggs. With Devon Archer as well? Mr. Galanis. That is correct. Mr. Biggs. And during that party, Hunter pulled you guys, the people we just named, pulled them away from where the party is, and you go to a separate little area where it is quieter because there were over 100 people at that party. Is that true? Mr. Galanis. That is true, yes. Mr. Biggs. And all of a sudden, Hunter says, OK, I am going to make a phone call. He makes a phone call, does he not? Mr. Galanis. He does. Mr. Biggs. To whom? Mr. Galanis. He called his father. Mr. Biggs. Then-Vice President Joe Biden, who was Vice President at the time. What was said on the call, please? Wait a second. Before you tell us, the reason you know it is because he put it on speakerphone, right? Mr. Galanis. He did. After he said hello, then he put it on speakerphone, so, I was first party to hearing it, and initially---- Mr. Biggs. Please sum it up. Mr. Galanis. I am sorry, Congressman. I talked over you. The video conference---- Mr. Biggs. Yes. Please sum up that phone call for us, Mr. Galanis. Mr. Galanis. OK. It was a relatively short call, but he indicated that our friends had come in from out of town. The exchange, as I testified, was related to we were going to proceed, things were going to proceed, and the Vice President had said, you look after my boy, and---- Mr. Biggs. And it was 5 days after that party that you received word from Devon that Ms. Baturina was in for $15 million to $20 million with you guys, right? Mr. Galanis. That is correct. Mr. Biggs. Let us go to a different issue. Let us go to the Harvest issue, and I will just refresh everyone's recollection. ``When Devon Archer was there, because at that time he had to come in, he came up and we had this great conversation. And I said, `Hey, did Hunter ever indicate to you that the Chinese anticipated that after his father was out of office, he might join their company with one of their companies as a paid advisor?' Mr. Archer says, `Did he intimate that?' I said, `Did he indicate that to you?' Mr. Archer: `I don't recall, but potentially. I don't recall, but potentially,' and I said, `You don't recall, but it is not new to you. The concept is not new to you. Is that what you are saying?' He said, `No, it is not new to me.' '' Why wasn't it new to him? Why wasn't it new to him? It was not new. Mr. Galanis. It is because that was---- Mr. Biggs. Yes, go ahead. Mr. Galanis. It was an explicit discussion amongst us that that was an inducement to the Chinese to invest in the Burnham business, that being the VP's position post, his position, the official position. Mr. Biggs. On a board of advisors, paid board of advisors. Mr. Galanis. Of the Chinese company, Harvest, yes. Mr. Biggs. When you say ``us'', who is the ``us'' that was discussing that? Mr. Galanis. What I was referring to in just making that comment was Hunter, Devon, and myself. Mr. Biggs. Let us go to something else. Mr. Galanis. There was a broader circulation group about that, and that was reflected in an email from a staff member at Thornton Group who circulated the draft email that also reflected that he had a similar conversation and drafted a letter based on that understanding. Mr. Biggs. How long have you been incarcerated, Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. I have been incarcerated for 8 years, Congressman. Mr. Biggs. And you offered to tell the Southern District of New York and SEC about Hunter Biden's company, Rosemont Seneca Bohai, and they rejected your offer, didn't they? Mr. Galanis. On multiple occasions. That is correct. Mr. Biggs. Why do you think they rejected that offer? Mr. Raskin. Chairman, I think he is over. Chairman Comer. The time has expired, but please answer the question. Answer the question, Mr. Galanis. Mr. Galanis. All I can tell you is what counsel said to me. Mr. Biggs. Which was? Mr. Galanis. Counsel had indicated to me that he had never seen a prosecution reject information, particularly paper-based information, that could have corroborated my verbal statements. Mr. Biggs. Thank you. My time has expired. Thank you. Chairman Comer. Very good. The Chair recognizes Ms. Bush for 5 minutes. Ms. Bush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. St. Louis and I are here today, once again, to focus on the real issues that affect our communities instead of this partisan circus. Let me start by saying that influence peddling is absolutely a very serious issue, full stop. But we all know the truth. Donald Trump is the quintessential influence-peddler-in-chief. Despite this, for well over a year now, House Republicans have spent dozens of hours of precious Committee time hearing testimony from nearly 20 witnesses on their baseless and increasingly embarrassing attempts to link President Biden to actions of his family members and implicate him by association. Even after all this time and effort, they have not been able to muster up any credible links between the President and his son's business dealings. All they have proven is that they will do whatever it takes, including using their razor-thin Majority and chairmanships, to waste the people's time. Let us let today's hearing be the final nail in the coffin of this sham impeachment investigation. I urge my Republican colleagues to admit that their quest to impeach the President has completely collapsed. They have fallen short, and with each passing day, they are losing votes and credibility, even within their own conference. It is time for them to move on, but that is not likely to happen because my Republican colleagues do not care about responsible governance or making people's lives better. They do not have an affirmative agenda. They would rather distract us all with these unfounded accusations against the President. So, it is no coincidence that under Republican leadership, 2023 marked the most unproductive year in modern history for Congress. Aside from a failed impeachment investigation, an unprecedented 3-week stint without a Speaker, and bringing our country to the brink of a catastrophic government shutdown multiple times, Republicans have done absolutely nothing to demonstrate why they deserve to control any chamber of Congress, let alone the White House, for which their cult leader, a twice-impeached, four times indicted former President is running to gain influence and control again. They are just grasping at straws, and it would be comical if it was not leading to real harm and real hurt in our communities. The people of our country are the ones paying the price for their failure to actually govern. Instead of wasting all of our time, hours and hours and hours going down fake rabbit holes and amplifying baseless conspiracies, we could focus on actual policy. We could focus on substance. We could focus on saving and improving the lives of our constituents, not misusing precious time and resources of this Committee. What I would rather focus on is the people who do not have the money and resources to buy influence, the millions of people in our districts who have been harmed by the ongoing refusal of the Federal Government to take full responsibility for the Manhattan Project waste and who are still getting sick from exposure to toxic radioactive waste their own government created. It still lingers in communities all across the country, like in St. Louis, Missouri, where proper cleanup still remains undone. I am Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs. I have repeatedly requested a hearing on Manhattan Project waste and its countless victims. I am still waiting. We could focus on ending the crisis of gun violence in this country. Every day, 327 people are shot in the United States. Every year, 42,654 people die from gun violence. More children die from guns than anything else in this country. Why are we not acting to protect them? How are we not treating this like the public health emergency that it is? We could focus on improving the lives of incarcerated individuals and weaning ourselves off of the carceral state. A currently incarcerated individual is your star witness today. I applaud your inclusivity, and surely, if folks convicted of crimes can testify before Congress, they should be allowed to vote. Why not enfranchise them? What about reproductive rights and freedom? We have a public health crisis in this country where millions of people of reproductive age cannot get the care that they need. People in St. Louis are being forced to give birth against their will. Republicans need and use abortion care just like the rest of us. Why not meaningfully address this issue? We need to focus on ending the atrocities in Gaza and Israel. Since January, malnutrition in children under 5 has doubled, nearly doubled. Global experts warn famine is imminent for 1.1 million people, half the population, due to catastrophic food insecurity. Why are we not acting to reinstate UNRRA, prevent famine and the spread of disease, and ending the continued slaughter of Palestinians? We do not have infinite time and resources. I will stop there. Thank you, and I yield the balance of my time to Rep. Goldman. Mr. Goldman. Thank you very much. Chairman Comer. Ten seconds. Mr. Goldman. I want to just point to a photo here. [Chart] Mr. Bobulinski, you have testified that Cassidy Hutchinson's account, that you met Mark Meadows, then-Chief of Staff for Donald Trump, at a Trump rally in Georgia behind Secret Service cars. You were wearing a mask---- Chairman Comer. The time has expired. Mr. Goldman. Sir, you went over a minute late with Mr. Perry. We could have a little extra time. Trump rally, that you said that she was lying---- Chairman Comer. The time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Sessions for 5 minutes. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, could we have some basic equity here? Chairman Comer. If someone else wants to yield, she had 8 seconds to yield him, and he has got up here with a speech. He has already abused his privilege by making a motion that was not even a motion. The Chair has ruled. The Chair has ruled. The Chair has ruled. Mr. Goldman. What are you afraid of, Mr. Chairman? What are you afraid of? Why don't you let me ask the question? Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes--oh, for what purpose do you seek recognition, Mr. Biggs? Mr. Biggs. Unanimous consent to introduce the documents into the record. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Here they are. One is the invitation that was mentioned. Another is Hunter Biden's calendar. Another is the email mentioned confirming that Yelena Baturina was going to invest $10 million to $20 million with him. Another one is page 180 of the Galanis interview, page 56 of the transcribed interview of Hunter Biden, and also pages 41 and 42 of the Galanis interview. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered into the record. Mr. Goldman. Chairman, I have a---- Chairman Comer. For what purpose do you seek recognition, Mr. Goldman? Mr. Goldman. I have a UC motion, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Proceed. Mr. Goldman. I would like to enter into the record the portion of the Devon Archer transcript where he says that Yelena Baturina never had any business dealings with Hunter Biden and that money went into their joint account was done by mistake. Chairman Comer. By mistake. OK. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Raskin. And, Mr. Chairman, I have one UC request as well. Chairman Comer. Proceed. Mr. Raskin. This is from Salon magazine: ``'It is Embarrassing': Republicans Worry They Have `Zero Accomplishments' to Run on in Elections.'' Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sessions, for 5 minutes. Mr. Sessions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I would first like to enter into the record 302s that were done with Mr. Bobulinski, what is known as Exhibit 400A. Chairman Comer. Without objection. Mr. Sessions. Thank you very much. Mr. Bobulinski, thank you for being here, Mr. Parnas, thank you for being here, and those of you who are appearing extraneously on our screen. Mr. Bobulinski, tell me about, very quickly, about the professionalism of the organization that you work for in terms of paychecks, getting paychecks, providing the IRS with documentation of people who were paid out of the organization. Mr. Bobulinski. I am not sure I am following your question. Mr. Sessions. Were you ever paid? Mr. Bobulinski. I was not. Mr. Sessions. So, you were never paid by this organization? Mr. Bobulinski. I was not. Mr. Sessions. Did you ever receive any enumeration? Mr. Bobulinski. When we were in the process of trying to shut down SinoHawk Holdings, LLC and Oneida Holdings, LLC, I was compensated. It was not a compensation. It was a reimbursement of $50,000 of money that had come out of pocket, traveling around, paying for hotels and stuff like that, so. Mr. Sessions. So, in other words, people did not get paid, or you did not get paid, that you were aware of. Were you aware that other people were being paid? Mr. Bobulinski. The Biden family was paid. Hunter and Jim Biden were clearly paid millions of dollars. Mr. Sessions. And how would you think that that information would be transmitted about them receiving that payment and going to the IRS? Mr. Bobulinski. I am not sure of those specifics. I am just aware that they received those millions of dollars, obviously, based on the brave testimony of Shapley and Ziegler that came public with a bunch of information. And then Senator Johnson and Senator Grassley's report, I never saw. The only bank account I ever saw is the one I set up at J.P. Morgan for SinoHawk Holdings and Oneida Holdings, LLC. J.P. Morgan was well aware that the Biden family were owners in that business. They authorized it, approved it---- Mr. Sessions. What Social Security number was utilized to set up that account? Mr. Bobulinski. For SinoHawk and Oneida? Mr. Sessions. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. We had to represent the owners of the underlying entities, so they were aware that Hudson West III owned 50 percent of SinoHawk Holdings, and they provided their information. On the Oneida side, we represented that each of us owned 20 percent, and I would have to go back and look. I, as the CEO, probably provided my Social Security number. I am not sure if we provided Social Security numbers for all five members, or, excuse me, tax IDs for their LLCs. Mr. Sessions. Or tax IDs, and yet you never received money except reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses that were related to the business? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. I imagine that $50,000 I was paid was actually from the legal side of SinoHawk Holdings and the Chinese while the Bidens had defrauded me and were receiving millions of dollars into their own pockets. Mr. Sessions. Were you aware that they were receiving millions of dollars at the time? Mr. Bobulinski. I was not. Mr. Sessions. Did you spend time with the Department of Justice on this matter? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. I did. I had a voluntary interview with the FBI on October 23, I believe, 2020. Mr. Sessions. They approached you or you approached them? Mr. Bobulinski. My lawyers coordinated me. I, which is obviously public knowledge, went to the second debate. I flew to D.C. with the intent of sitting in front of Senator Johnson, Senator Grassley, and their committee, and then my lawyers sought counsel, had discussions, and decided it was a better focus of my time to walk voluntarily into the FBI. Mr. Sessions. So, where did you do that? Mr. Bobulinski. In Washington, DC. Mr. Sessions. Main Justice, main FBI or the field office? Mr. Bobulinski. I believe it was the leading field office. They did not want to do it in Main Justice for their reasons, they decided. I would have gone wherever they asked me to go. Mr. Sessions. Did they tell you at the time that you were providing information that if you provided information that was not true and correct, that you could be held liable for that under criminal statute? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, of course. I appreciate you asking that question. I was operated as if I misrepresented, misstated, lied, that I was committing criminal offenses, which I take very seriously based on the fact that I was willing to die for this country. And to just correct Ms. Crockett's statement earlier, I did not accuse the FBI of lying. I stated in my transcribed interview that the FBI made mistakes in their 302. My lawyers never saw that document after my interview, until it was made public to the world. Mr. Sessions. And then you attempted to correct that 302? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. Mr. Sessions. Is that the same 302 known as Exhibit 400A that I have entered in the record today? Mr. Bobulinski. It is. Mr. Sessions. Do you have any other dispute with that and have you looked at it, and do you have any other dispute? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, there are numerous mistakes in it. Mr. Sessions. OK. Thank you very much. Do you have any reason to believe that all of these SAR reports that have come out of banks were all fraud? Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired, but he asked a question about the SARs report. Mr. Bobulinski. I mean, just the number of SARs reports should give every American pause. The average American in this country will never receive a single SAR in their entire life, so for a family or an individual to have over, what I have publicly seen, 150 of them, is just extraordinary. Mr. Sessions. OK. Thank you. I want to thank all the witnesses that are here today, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Frost, or who? I thought you said Frost. Oh, Mr. Casar. OK. Casar. Mr. Casar. Thank you, Chairman, and if I could have my full 5 minutes, I would appreciate that. Chairman Comer. Reset the clock for 5 minutes for Mr. Casar. Mr. Casar. Thank you, Chairman. While we clearly disagree on the merits of this meritless investigation, I hope, Chairman, that we can at least come to an agreement on some basics. I believe that you and I can agree that Presidents and White House officials should not be unduly influenced by foreign powers, so, Chairman, I would be happy to yield to you briefly for a ``yes'' or ``no.'' Can we all agree that White House officials should not be bribed or unduly influenced by foreign actors? Chairman Comer. It is your time. You can ask. We have witnesses here. Mr. Casar. I would assume that you would agree. Chairman Comer. We have witnesses. If you want to ask the witnesses a question or you want to waste time with me. Mr. Casar. I am not wasting time with you. I think that we have been disagreeing all day. I hope we can come to an agreement that White House officials should not be bribed or unduly influenced by foreign powers. I think you and I agree on this point. I see you nodding your head. I assume that that is a yes. I am glad that we can work as an Oversight Committee on an investigation, do the work we need to do, and make sure that no one in the White House has betrayed the public trust. We have spent countless hours talking about Hunter Biden, investigating every single person that seems like he has ever shaken hands with. We have not found a shred of evidence that connects it to the President of United States or anyone with any say over U.S. policy, but someone who has worked in the White House did accept money from a foreign power. Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, received a staggering $2 billion from Saudi Arabia for his brand new private equity firm. And while Hunter Biden never had any say over U.S. policy, Mr. Kushner got this $2 billion 6 months after working in the White House as a senior advisor on Middle East policy. Mr. Kushner had no experience in private equity. In fact, he was so inexperienced that Saudi officials tried to block the transfer of the money until the Crown Prince overruled them. While working at the White House, Mr. Kushner pushed through a $110 billion weapons sale for---- Mr. Fallon. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. Casar [continuing]. Saudi Arabia. I am finishing my point and then I am happy to talk about it. He then defended the deal in the wake of the Saudi Government's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And while this may all just be a coincidence, there are many questions, like was any of this money passed along to Trump, was the Saudi money a thank you for a job well done in the White House, was Jared given this money in exchange for anything else, or did someone with no experience just have a lucky payday? These are questions we should have answers to. Mr. Raskin. Will the gentleman yield for a second? Mr. Casar. These are the questions that the Oversight Committee should look into. Mr. Raskin. Maybe we can just add another question. What was the role that Jared Kushner played in covering up the assassination and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi ordered by the Royal Crown Prince? Mr. Casar. We should have somebody ask that question, Ranking Member. Mr. Fallon. Would the gentleman yield? Mr. Casar. And so I want to know, if Hunter Biden had accepted $2 billion from the Saudi Government, I am sure we would be looking into that today. And, Mr. Chairman, I believe we can agree that there should not be undue influence in the White House, and I believe we should be able to agree that we should look into these questions about Mr. Kushner. And, in fact, Mr. Chairman, you were on CNN and said, ``I have been very vocal that I think what Kushner did cross the line of ethics.'' And then, in our deposition of Hunter Biden, the other day, when we were discussing Mr. Kushner, you said, Mr. Chairman, and I quote from the deposition, ``When we deal with influence peddling, we will ask about Jared Kushner.'' Well, today's hearing is titled, ``Influence Peddling,'' so we are here. So, Mr. Comer, I would love to hear from you. Can we fulfill our responsibility as an Oversight Committee and determine if Saudi Arabia bribed or unduly influenced Jared Kushner or other White House officials? Is that something we would be willing to look into? Chairman Comer. We have already had a conversation with Ms. Porter. I am going to answer one time, Ms. Porter and I have pledge to work on influence peddling legislation. We will take up all the people who have been accused of influence peddling. We will try to determine whether Jared Kushner has a real business. We have not been able to find a real business that the Bidens have had yet, now. It is still your time, Mr. Casar. Mr. Casar. So, could we expect to subpoena Mr. Kushner's correspondence with the Saudi Government or his firm's financial records or financial transactions between Mr. Kushner and his father-in-law? Is that something that we would consider doing as part of that hearing you just discussed? Chairman Comer. What was the question? Mr. Casar. If we are serious about looking into foreign money--I saw recently a poster board here about $100,000 to a car dealership--are we going to be serious about the $2 billion from the Saudi Government to Mr. Kushner? With that, my question is, would we be at least subpoenaing Jared's correspondence with the Saudi Government and its firm's financial records? Can we commit to doing that? Chairman Comer. I think it is important to see if they were real legitimate businesses. Mr. Casar. And if you---- Chairman Comer. Let me ask you a question. What business was Hunter Biden in? Mr. Casar. We heard explicitly from Mr. Biden about his extensive business record and his experience on boards. We heard about that. Chairman Comer. The time has expired. Mr. Casar. Mr. Kushner, on the other hand---- Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Fallon for 5 minutes. Mr. Fallon. Mr. Chairman, before I start my questions, I would like to enter into the record, submit to the record an article from the Kyiv Post. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Fallon. And then a second article from the Kyiv Post, entitled, ``Prosecutor General Shokin Resigns,'' and it is updated. If I could enter this in---- Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Fallon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I sat in on the entire 7-plus hour deposition that Hunter Biden gave to this Committee. And one of the things that stood out to me was his assertions, with a rather braggadocious flair, of his business experience and his acumen, his impeccable qualifications. He claimed, with quite some vigor, I might add, that he was a brilliant, accomplished, and highly sought-after business commodity, he is very successful, and he had an unparalleled resume that he recited to us chapter and verse to prove it. That was at least the face his lawyers, this Administration, and the House Democrats wanted him to wear. Of course, there is another possibility, one that, this pesky little thing we call reality, that he was a spoiled, entitled East Coast patrician, with a senator and then VP daddy, who squandered his many life advantages and spiraled into a decadent behavioral pattern of narcissistic excess and criminal addiction. And to feed his very large, carnal appetites, he acted as his family's bag man in an influence- peddling and access-selling scheme that netted the Biden tribe over $24 million in illicit foreign cash. Lots of money, little effort in a get-rich-quick scheme. If he was such a skilled and gifted businessman as he claimed, his services would be sought after, in fact even fought over. Mr. Bobulinski, to your knowledge, how many Fortune 500 companies retain Hunter Biden on their board of directors? Mr. Bobulinski. Now or in his---- Mr. Fallon. Ever. Mr. Bobulinski. I cannot confirm any. Mr. Fallon. Yes, because there are not any. Zero. How many American energy companies retain Hunter Biden on their boards of directors? Mr. Bobulinski. Zero. Mr. Fallon. Zero. Nada. Correct. There was one energy company that retained him on their board of directors. Do you know what that name of that company was? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, Burisma. Mr. Fallon. Burisma, correct. Where is Burisma located? Mr. Bobulinski. Ukraine. Mr. Fallon. Really? That is interesting, and he was hired actually for no small sum, $1 million a year. Hunter Biden said in his deposition he could bring, and Mr. Chairman, I apologize for laughing, but he said his corporate governance to the table. He brought something far more valuable than his corporate governance and his fictitious business acumen. He brought his daddy with him. You see, Joe Biden just happened to have been given the country of Ukraine in his portfolio of responsibility to oversee by the Obama Administration. So let us go over some facts, Mr. Chairman. Fact: Burisma and CEO, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been investigated for corruption. Fact: in September 2015, then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, specifically mentioned Burisma as a corrupt entity. Fact: Burisma was paying the son of the Vice President of this United States $1 million a year to serve on their board. Fact: December 2015, Joe Biden visits Ukraine, demands Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, who is investigating Burisma, his son's boss, be fired. Fact: February 2, 2016, Kyiv Post reports Viktor Shokin won a court order to seize assets of Burisma CEO, Mykola Zlochevsky. Two weeks later, fact, Shokin resigns. President Poroshenko called on him to resign. He resigned. He essentially was fired at the behest of Joe Biden. Fact: 2016 February, 2 weeks later, there is a little email sent from Vadym Pozharsky, COO of Burisma. He is an executive of Burisma, and to Hunter Biden asked him, ``Hey Hunter, will you help us out? We want to get the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine to say that we are a good company.'' Now, the Ambassador just said they were corrupt few months prior to that, and then, lo and behold, with the seal of the United States Embassy, they say that we have no negative information or feelings about Burisma. So, what changed in those 6 months? It was magic. The power of the Vice President's visit, when he demands that the prosecutor who is investigating his son's boss, be fired. And he is going to withhold $1 billion worth of aid--actually, it is, I think loan guarantees--if Shokin is not fired, and then Shokin is fired. The embassy says that Burisma is a great company. Our Democratic colleagues would have us believe, Mr. Chairman, that that was all magic, that there is no coincidence here, and with that, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I was just going to point out that Jared Kushner was one of the key officials involved in the Abraham Accords. How about the President of the United States, what he said in his State of the Union regarding Israel? And how about what the Democrat leader of the Senate said last week, and that Israel should change its prime minister, for goodness sake? That, to me, is a concern. Jared Kushner was doing good work with the Abraham Accords. Of course the Democrats do not want to admit that. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. Chairman Comer. The Chair now recognizes---- Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, I have a motion. I would move pursuant to Clause 2(k)(6) of Rule XI that the Committee issued a subpoena to Jared Kushner to compel testimony related to the $2 billion collected from Saudi Arabia after his service within the White House. Ms. Crockett. Second. Chairman Comer. There is a motion and second. For what purpose does the gentleman from Ohio seek recognition? Mr. Jordan. I move to table the motion. Chairman Comer. The motion to table is not debatable. As many as are in favor of tabling signify by saying aye. [Chorus of ayes.] Chairman Comer. All those opposed, signify by saying no. [Chorus of noes.] Chairman Comer. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And the motion to table is agreed to. The Committee will now resume consideration of this hearing. Now, the Chair recognizes, is it Ms. Lee? Who is next? Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it is fair to say at this point that Republicans on this Committee are relying on Mr. Bobulinski as their star witness, the only fact witness they have brought in in-person before this Committee. So, I think we all expect that Mr. Bobulinski would have extensive inside knowledge about the involvement they allege that President Biden had in Hunter's business ventures. As Mr. Parnas can vouch for, previous impeachment inquiries relied on whistleblowers and witnesses with intimate details of what went on, you know, firsthand accounts of high crimes and misdemeanors. You could point to exactly what the allegations were and understand what was going on. There were laid-out chains of events pointing to a named crime, lying under oath, obstruction of justice, abuse of power, incitement of insurrection, yet we are left floundering here with zero direction and zero real evidence while we watch this kangaroo court struggle to continue on. And today, we have Mr. Bobulinski, whose biggest contribution is that he had ``multiple meetings with Joe Biden,'' but let us be clear. He spoke with Joe Biden a grand total of two times in the span of less than 24 hours in 2017, and each was short: one in public in the bar of a hotel and then for a few minutes backstage of the Milken Conference after Biden spoke about the efforts to fight cancer, which took the life of his son, Beau. I think we also need to clarify that while Mr. Bobulinski is all of a sudden today claiming that they talked business, but at no point did he mention this during his deposition under oath with this Committee. At two different points when asked about what was said in this conversation, Mr. Bobulinski's account made clear that he had zero substantive business discussions with Mr. Joe Biden. Mr. Bobulinski described those conversations twice during his transcribed interview, and both times he provided the same accounts. I will read from the transcript of your interview, Mr. Bobulinski. You stated that you and Joe Biden discussed your ``family background in detail,'' as well as the Biden family's background and Joe Biden's ``appreciation for the military.'' Pages 48 through 52 and 268 to 271 of the transcript had these accounts. Based on your own account, you had zero discussion of CEFC, the Chinese energy company. You had zero discussion on shares of equity or capitalization of this failed business venture. Based on your own account, you simply exchanged pleasantries about your families and shared values, the kind of small talk any person would make if they had the opportunity to meet the former Vice President of the United States, and moved on. Yet today, when my Republican colleagues are so desperate for actual evidence, magically that story changes, and that is really at the heart of everything we are discussing today. Mr. Bobulinski has also been pushing his texts as records as proof, yet the Wall Street Journal found that none of it showed any role for Joe Biden and SinoHawk Holdings. And even Fox News reported that there was zero evidence of business dealings involving Joe Biden. Mr. Bobulinski would have us believe that everyone is a liar except him and except for when he is under oath, that everyone misremembers, except for him and except for when he is under oath. The FBI, the Wall Street Journal, his business associations, all liars. Republicans in this Committee and the culture warriors of Fox News keep saying look at the documents, look at the documents, so let us look. This purported investigation has received over 100,000 pages of documents, and not a single one shows any evidence of any wrongdoing, much less an impeachable offense. And taking a step back, even if Joe Biden had discussed his son's business ventures with Tony Bobulinski in 2017, and this is rhetorical, so what? What would be the high crime or misdemeanor? What would be the impeachable offense? We are talking about what a private citizen, Hunter Biden, was doing with his, at the time, private citizen dad. This impeachment inquiry is not about facts or evidence. It is not even about impeachable offenses. It is about keeping the American people distracted while we do nothing on reducing gun violence, nothing on lowering healthcare costs, nothing on reforming our criminal legal system. This has been the least productive Congress in decades. We are just now in March finally funding the government for this year. That is shameful. This unserious hearing is a waste of our time and our resources. I yield with that, and I yield the remainder of my time to Representative Crockett. Ms. Crockett. Yes, I just want to make sure that I point out, and this is not a question just in case you wanted to know, that on page 174 of your transcribed interview, line 9, it says, ``This is an absolute lie,'' in reference to talking about the FBI, what you stated, what was stated right before that was, first of all---- Mr. Bobulinski. I did not call the FBI agents liars. I said they misstated or made mistakes. Ms. Crockett. I said that I am speaking, and I did not ask you a question. First of all, it does not say Tony Bobulinski told the FBI ``this is a summary of two agents that took notes through my interview and their summary apparently that they presented says Bobulinski first met in-person with members of the Biden family at a 2017 meeting in Miami, Florida. This is an absolute lie.'' That is what it says. The final thing that I am going to say is about this. What we have from Ken Buck, a Republican: ``I don't think that the impeachment of Biden is appropriate, and so House Speaker Mike Johnson's ability to talk me into staying here is going to be about as successful as his ability about talking me into an unconstitutional impeachment.'' Chairman Comer. I let her have 30 seconds over. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burchett from Tennessee. Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On July 30, 2017, Hunter Biden wrote to his Chinese business associate, Raymond Zhao, ``I am sitting here with my father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled.'' Mr. Bobulinski, who did Raymond Zhao work for when this message was sent? Mr. Bobulinski. Raymond Zhao worked for Director Zang at CEFC. Mr. Burchett. Is CEFC connected to the Chinese Communist Party? Mr. Bobulinski. It is. Mr. Burchett. Is CEFC a corrupt organization? Mr. Bobulinski. It was. Mr. Burchett. From your perspective, what had occurred with CEFC from the end of May to this July 30 text message? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, it is tough to go through all these details in 20-second clips, but at the end of July, it is important to note, Jim Biden was broke, Hunter Biden was broke, published by the brave whistleblowers Shapley and Ziegler, and Hunter made the conscious decision to basically defraud the partners of SinoHawk Holdings and Oneida because he needed money immediately. They have published pages of text messages where he is trying to get money into his bank account. And so that night, for whatever reason, on the 30th when he asked why hasn't the commitment been fulfilled, the commitment he is talking about is actually the $10 million funding into SinoHawk Holdings, LLC, really key point. But the next day he decides that he is going to defraud SinoHawk Holdings and Oneida, create a new entity called Hudson West III--well, actually change--Hudson West III--it had already previously been created by the Chinese--and make himself a 50-percent owner in that entity. So, when the Chinese did send money, he would have the instant access to it, really important, backed up with tens of pages of communications. He wanted to get access to the money the second it came in, and in SinoHawk Holdings and Oneida Holdings, he did not have that power. I just want to address one thing real quick. Hunter Biden represents he is a governance expert. That is why Burisma put him on the board. Well, he obviously cannot do basic math. The board of Oneida Holdings had seven votes. Each one of them-- Hunter, Jim Biden, James Gilliar, and Rob Walker--had a single vote. I had three votes. I have a master's degree in electrical and nuclear engineering. I think I can do math. I had three. They had four. They controlled Oneida Holdings. So, Hunter Biden's representations that I was trying to take the business from them or I did not know, is all a shame and a misrepresentation. He wanted money in his account instantly, and that is why he shut down the Chinese, and they were willing to send them that $5 million because they viewed it as a bribe to the Biden family. They say it in their own communications. Mr. Burchett. Are you aware or not that they paid taxes on any of that? Mr. Bobulinski. I can only go from public testimony. I was not involved in their taxes. Mr. Burchett. OK. On July 31, the next day, Hunter says he hopes Kevin should know that the plan to speak is highly confidential, and Raymond Zhao responded, ``CEFC is willing to cooperate with the family, and the priority is to solve the problems mentioned last night.'' What family was Raymond Zhao talking about? Was it the Bidens? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, the family was the Biden family, and, more importantly, in that text is what is he talking about is the confidential matter. The confidential matter he is talking about were four sealed indictments in the SDNY where they were about to indict executives of CEFC that we now know. I did not know that in July 2017, but the SDNY knew. Charles McGonigal, who is now apparently going to serve 78 months in prison, ran counterintelligence for the FBI in New York City where Chairman Ye was dropping $50 million of cash for penthouses in Manhattan. So, who you should be asking all these questions are the Department of Justice, the SDNY, the FBI because they have troves of evidence that back up what was going on in July 2017 and in August 2017. So, I apologize, Congressman, to be so passionate and to take your time, but this is what I need you guys or the focus has to be of your Oversight Committee. This involved the Chinese Communist Party. They were doing a transaction with Rosneft, which was a U.S.-sanctioned company at the time, and the Biden family was right front and center in the middle of it. Mr. Burchett. Thank you. Let us switch gears for a second. I wish Hunter Biden were here because I would like to ask him about his taxes. I want to know if he paid his fair share, just like his dad has asked Americans to do. I want to know if he is current on his taxes, and if he is not, I would like to ask him when he plans to pay up. Mr. Bobulinski, you are a businessman. Did you pay your taxes? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. I am happy to---- Mr. Burchett. Mr. Bobulinski, he actually pays his taxes, unlike the President's son, and yet Democrats on this Committee act like Hunter is the believable one out of you two. Joe Biden has no right to lecture the American people about their taxes until he gets his own house in order. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Very good. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Moskowitz for 5 minutes. Mr. Moskowitz. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Oh, how are you doing? Good? OK. Mr. Bobulinski? Over here. How are you doing? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Mr. Moskowitz. Good. So, I just have a question. We have been at this for 15 months now in Oversight. I know this is your first time here, but do you think Chairman Comer has proven that Joe Biden has committed a high crime and misdemeanor? Mr. Bobulinski. I believe with all the evidence he has gathered, yes, he has proven that Joe Biden has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr. Moskowitz. OK. And, so, I assume you believe Joe Biden should be impeached? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, that is up to you guys. Mr. Moskowitz. But do you believe he should be impeached? It is ``yes'' or ``no.'' Mr. Bobulinski. Do I personally believe or---- Mr. Moskowitz. Yes. Yes. Yes, you. Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Under constitutional law? Mr. Moskowitz. No, no, no. You personally, do you believe he should be impeached? Mr. Bobulinski. I do. Mr. Moskowitz. OK. And you believe that because you believe Chairman Comer has proven that he committed a high crime and misdemeanor? Mr. Bobulinski. No, because I know that he committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr. Moskowitz. OK. Mr. Bobulinski. I was involved and saw them happen. Mr. Moskowitz. Right. But obviously, with all the evidence, you must believe that, all of these hearings for 15 months, that the Chairman has proven that, right? Mr. Bobulinski. Can you re-ask the question? Mr. Moskowitz. Sure. I will sum it up. I assume you believe he should be impeached, but my point is that the Chairman has not yet moved for that. And so, look, Chairman, we got, like, 3-and-a-half minutes here. I mean, let us just do the impeachment. I mean, why continue to waste millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money? If we are going to impeach because you believe you have shown he has committed a high crime and misdemeanor, what are you waiting on? Let us just do it. I mean, by the way, we got Chairman Jordan here also, the double Chairman. Why aren't you guys calling for the vote in your committee? When is it going to happen? When can we tell the American people you are going to stop wasting their money and just call for the vote on impeachment? Mr. Jordan. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. Moskowitz. Sure. Mr. Jordan. We do not do snap impeachments like you guys. We actually do the facts. We do oversight according to the Constitution. Mr. Moskowitz. You are never going to call for it. You are never going to call for it. I mean---- Mr. Jordan. Now you can predict the future? How do you know? Mr. Moskowitz. You guys only have 6 more months probably in power, right, until the election? So, are you going to do it in 2 months? Are you going to do in 3 months? Like, tell the American people. Mr. Jordan. Does the Constitution put a time limit on oversight? I did not read that in Constitution. Mr. Moskowitz. So, if you believe you cannot call for the impeachment now, then what you are admitting is you have not yet proven that he has committed a high crime and misdemeanor. You have not proven it yet. Otherwise, you would call for it, I assume. Mr. Jordan. We are doing our work. We are doing our investigation. Mr. Moskowitz. OK. So, they have not proven it, right? They have not proven he committed a high crime and misdemeanor. Otherwise, we would call for impeachment. Look, you know, the Chairman knows me well. I am just here to help him, right? And so, I just think we should do it today. Let us just call for it. I will make the motion, Mr. Chairman. I want to help you out. You can second it, right? Like, make the motion to impeach President Biden. Go ahead. It is your turn. You second it. No, nothing? OK. We got nothing. So, I want to, with my last couple of minutes, show the American people that they are never going to impeach Joe Biden. It is never going to happen because they do not have the evidence. OK. This is a show. It is all fake. They just want to do these hearings. It is not leading to impeachment. They are lying to their base on Newsmax and Fox, leading these people to believe that they are going to eventually impeach the President. It is not going to happen at all, ever, period. They do not even have the votes. Even if they had it in Committee, they do not have the votes on the floor. They know that. They got Members resigning rather than taking a vote on the fake, faux impeachment. Just ask Ken Buck who said, ``The Speaker is not going to get me to take an unconstitutional impeachment vote.'' I mean, boy, I mean. So, look, I mean, if these hearings were a success, right, if what we have been doing for the last 15 months had convinced the American people that Joe Biden committed a high crime and misdemeanor, you can be damn sure they would have called the vote by now, right, but they want it to go on. They will either want it to go on because they do not have the evidence---- Mr. Bobulinski. Are you asking me a question? Mr. Moskowitz. No, no. I am just looking at you. Mr. Bobulinski. OK. Mr. Moskowitz. But if you want to talk to me, we can talk. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, no, I think you have not read recent data that shows the American people are well aware of the Bidens' corruption. Mr. Moskowitz. Perfect. So, then ask the Chairman why he has not called for impeachment, Tony. He is right here. Ask Comer. Hey, Comer, how come you have not called for impeachment? I will do it. Watch. Hi, I am Tony. Hey, Chairman, how come you have not call for impeachment? When are we going to have the hearing? When is the vote going to happen? I mean, you believe it, he believes it, he says it every day on TV. I just do not know when we are going to have the vote. I mean, let us just go. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, you are asking me to hold the vote? Mr. Moskowitz. No, I just like looking at you. We can save the taxpayers millions of dollars. So I mean, look, I used all of my time to show that this vote is never going to happen because they have no evidence on Joe Biden. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burlison from Missouri for 5 minutes. [Audio malfunction in the hearing room.] Chairman Comer. Switch mics. Restart the clock. We will get you a mic. Do you want to go to that one? Mr. Burlison. Are we good? Chairman Comer. Now we are. Mr. Burlison. All right. I want to start with Mr. Galanis. Mr. Galanis, you have heard the expression, ``Say it, forget it. Write it, regret it.'' Have you heard that expression? Mr. Galanis? Mr. Galanis. Yes, I am here. Congressman? Mr. Burlison. Have you heard the expression, ``Say it, forget it. Write it, regret it?'' Mr. Galanis. Yes, I have. It was a practice that we used in our business. Mr. Burlison. In whose business? Mr. Galanis. Business with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. Mr. Burlison. OK. So it is their expression. Mr. Galanis. Yes. Correct. Mr. Burlison. Let me ask you a question. Who is Hares Youssef. Mr. Galanis. Hares Youssef is the Ukrainian investor originally from Syria, a longtime colleague of Dmytro Firtash. Mr. Burlison. So, he is a colleague of Dmytro Firtash. He was mentioned earlier this is hearing. Who is Dmytro Firtash? Mr. Galanis. He is a Ukrainian oligarch very close to the Kremlin that made his fortune primarily at trading gas from a Russian state oil and gas company. Mr. Burlison. So, connected to Vladimir Putin, correct? Mr. Galanis. Very much so, yes. Mr. Burlison. In fact, during Hunter Biden's deposition with the Committee, he justified his role. I think you will find this comical. He justified his role on the Ukrainian Burisma board by saying, in essence, that it was his patriotic duty that he was serving, you know, freedom, because ``there were two gas companies inside Ukraine at the time. One of them was a state-owned, which was highly corrupt and connected to people like Firtash, which was directly going into Vladimir Putin's pocket. The only independent company was Burisma.'' Now, my question to you, based on this, you know, he is disparaging Mr. Firtash, and yet are you aware that that Hunter Biden did business with Mr. Firtash? Mr. Galanis. Yes, I am. Mr. Burlison. So, let me ask you, what kind of financial transactions occurred between them? Mr. Galanis. Hares Youssef described to me, and it was also described to me by others, including Devon and Hunter, was a $5 million payment that was made by Dmytro Firtash was handled by Hares Youssef through Hunter Biden's law firm that was deemed a success fee in order to quash an outstanding indictment in the United States. Mr. Burlison. So, a Putin-connected Russian oligarch wired over $5 million to Hunter Biden's law firm for what activity? What was Hunter supposed to do for that $5.5 million? Mr. Galanis. He was supposed to perform in quashing the indictment that resulted in an arrest warrant for Dmytro Firtash, who continues to be under house arrest and charged in the United States. Mr. Burlison. Charged in the United States. Yes, being charged in United States, in Indiana, so he is supposed to quash that, use his political influence to do so. So, my question is, of that money, the $5 million, $3 million made its way to a company that you set up with Devon Archer, called Inbloom. Is that correct? Mr. Galanis. That is correct. Yes. Mr. Burlison. And finally, from that $3 million, there was a transfer that was made, and I have got a copy of that, the bank record to prove that, of $275,000. Do you recall that transfer? Mr. Galanis. I do, yes. Mr. Burlison. And it went to which account? Mr. Galanis. Rosemont Seneca Bohai account. Mr. Burlison. Rosemont Seneca Bohai. So, despite what Hunter said during his deposition, based on your knowledge, was Hunter Biden connected to Rosemont Seneca Bohai, was he part owner? Mr. Galanis. Very much so, and he said as much and had direction and control, and was a beneficiary of the account. So, there are emails that document he directed moneys to be dispersed from that account, including to himself. Mr. Burlison. Now, it sounds like despite what he is saying, you know, that what he told the Committee that this guy was a bad hombre, basically, that this Firtash guy connected to Putin, and, therefore, he had to get on Ukraine. Yet, he had no problem doing business for this corrupt Russian oligarch connected to Putin; in fact, had no problem taking $5 million and a direct transfer of $275,000. Would you agree? Mr. Galanis. I agree with that, yes. Mr. Burlison. OK. Now, Mr. Bobulinski, and I have got just a little bit of time left, very little time. So, I want to ask you, you know, for God's sake, Hunter Biden is doing all of these transactions, doing all of this business, and yet his father is Vice President, and we are to believe that his father is not aware of all of these? He has been on the phone calls. He has been in the meetings, and yet he is not aware that his son is doing business with people connected to Vladimir Putin? Are we to believe that? Mr. Bobulinski. It is an absurd expectation. Mr. Burlison. Thank you. My time has expired. Chairman Comer. Very good. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Frost for 5 minutes. Mr. Frost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The claims made against the President of the United States have been so completely proven to be lies that even House Republicans now are admitting that it is time to close this case. Mr. Parnas, I have a few questions for you and limited time, so really, I want to try to get through these. And I just want everybody to know, especially people watching at home, that you are, like, one of the most credible witnesses that we have had throughout this entire impeachment inquiry. First off, I just want folks to know, for people who are not familiar, can you tell me who you were working for between 2018 and 2019? Mr. Parnas. Rudy Giuliani and Donald J. Trump. Mr. Frost. And to be clear, you answered to Rudy Giuliani? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Frost. You answered to Donald Trump? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Frost. Directly? Mr. Parnas. Directly to Rudy Giuliani and Mr. Trump. Mr. Frost. Yes. When former President Trump and Rudy Giuliani flew you to Ukraine to look for corruption on the part of President Biden, did you find any? Mr. Parnas. No. Mr. Frost. And following your Ukraine trip, Senate Republicans, Senators Grassley and Johnson, released their Burisma report, which the New York Times concluded was ``unproven allegations that echo an active Russian disinformation campaign.'' Mr. Parnas, are the unproven allegations that are at the heart of the Republican report the same fabricated claims that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani sent you to Ukraine to go dig up? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Frost. Last summer, you wrote a letter to Congress noting that when the media started to get tired of the smoke screens and using this, one of the authors of the Republican Burisma report would be your ``guy in the Senate to push all the information.'' What did you mean by that? Mr. Parnas. Senator Ron Johnson was our guy in the Senate. It was told to me that when we push the information, he is going to push it in the halls of Congress. Mr. Frost. So, when the media was getting skeptical about pushing disinformation after they have proven it wrong time and time again, the plan was to have a U.S. Senator, Ron Johnson, to push that disinformation even further. Mr. Parnas. Correct, because we had Congressman Nunes already doing it, so, Senator Ron Johnson jumped on board. Mr. Frost. This Congress, both Chairman Comer and Chairman Jordan have centered this entire sham impeachment hearing on an FBI tip sheet. This tip sheet made wild claims about bribery that did not even come close to being backed up, and, in fact, it is all being proved to be one big lie. Mr. Parnas, is the allegation in the FBI tip sheet based on the same fabricated claims that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani flew you to Ukraine to dig up? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Frost. I also want to make it clear that the informant allegedly behind this tip sheet is facing criminal charges for lying about the Biden family and was a known fraud for years before that. The same fabricated claim kept popping up and getting smacked down over and over again. In fact, our colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Committee did some amazing work on this, an investigation, and found that this lie dates back to December 2015, almost 10 years ago. Do you happen to know the article that I am referring to? Mr. Parnas. I do not know the exact article, but I do know that this lie has started way back in 2015. Mr. Frost. It started about 10 years ago. It was an article entitled, ``The Ukrainian Scam of the Biden Family,'' and it was posted to a Russian language media website registered in a city in Russian-occupied Crimea. Mr. Parnas, do you have any doubt that this fabrication claim, the claim that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani sent you to Ukraine to try to dig up more information on, is part of Russian propaganda and an effort to destabilize Ukraine and undermine our democracy? Mr. Parnas. As I sit here today, I have zero doubt that Russia is involved. This is a Russian campaign to interfere in our elections. Mr. Frost. Thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate it from someone with firsthand experience. Look, to recap, there is no evidence that support allegations that President Biden engaged in corruption in Ukraine. We know this. Mr. Parnas himself has made it clear that we should have no doubt that the claims of corruption are lies and conspiracy theories rooted in a Russian effort to undermine our democracy, posted to a Russian language website over a decade ago. This is exactly what Putin wants. And over the years, Republicans have kept moving the goal posts. You just look at the past year, right? First, it was a bribe. Then it was Burisma. Nothing. Then it was Hunter Biden's laptop. Nothing but some, like, nude pics that we keep seeing here. Then it was supposed money laundering scheme that turned out to be a family member making a couple of car payments, and now Republicans on this Committee have left the pretense of a crime behind and are moving the goal post to influence peddling, which sounds more like what former President Donald Trump did in his time in office. Look, we have been laughing a lot about this, calling it theater and a sham, which it is, but I also want to bring up that this is really serious. Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Frost. I mean, we have Members of Congress and this Committee using Russian propaganda meant to undermine our democracy to undermine our President. It is not just theater or laughable, but it is a betrayal of our democracy. Mr. Parnas. That is very serious, Congressman. Mr. Frost. Yes. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The time has expired. The Chair recognizes Ms. Boebert from Colorado for 5 minutes. Ms. Boebert. Well, Hunter asked for a public hearing. Here we are, and he is nowhere to be found. I guess hidin' really does run in the Biden family. Now, Mr. Bobulinski, in your testimony, you state, ``It is clear to me that Joe Biden was the brand being sold by the Biden family.'' In your experience, what is the value to Joe Biden in helping his family collect millions from foreign adversaries? Mr. Bobulinski. What is the value to Joe Biden specifically? Ms. Boebert. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, his children and brothers were enriched, which, to AOC's questions earlier, violate corruption statutes, RICO statutes, FCPA statutes, FARA statutes. Ms. Boebert. Yes. So, you would agree that the Biden family was involved in this corruption and influence peddling and selling access to the Federal Government? Mr. Bobulinski. I do. Ms. Boebert. Mr. Bobulinski, in your experience, did President Biden play a more active or passive role in his son Hunter Biden's business dealings? Mr. Bobulinski. I quantified previously that he acted sort of like a chairman. He showed up and shook hands---- Ms. Boebert. He has been called ``the Chairman.'' Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. He showed up, shook hands, and that is all the Chinese, Ukrainians, Romanians, Russians, whoever need. It is not what the Canadians, the Australians and Americans need, but in those parts of the world, that is what they need. Ms. Boebert. Thank you. And now, I am going to switch over to Mr. Galanis. During his 2020 Presidential campaign, then- candidate for President, Joe Biden, said his son did not make any money from China. Did Joe Biden lie? Yes or no. Mr. Galanis. Yes. Ms. Boebert. Mr. Galanis, you are aware of the BHR Fund that consisted of Bohai, a Chinese state-backed company; Harvest, a China company; and Rosemont, the Biden entity, correct? Mr. Galanis. Yes, I have. Ms. Boebert. And, Mr. Galanis, you are aware that Hunter Biden formerly held 10 percent of that Chinese entity. And would it surprise you, if you are aware, that Hunter Biden held 10 percent of this entity well into his father's presidency? Mr. Galanis. No, I am aware that it was founded, the business that he owned, 50 percent of 20 percent or 10 percent directly from the outset from early on in 2014. Ms. Boebert. And would it surprise you Kevin Morris, Hunter Biden's fake attorney, has testified that he now holds that interest? Mr. Galanis. I do not have any knowledge about that, so not much of this would surprise me. Ms. Boebert. Mr. Bobulinski, in your testimony, you stated the Chinese Communist Party through CEFC successfully sought to infiltrate and compromise the Obama-Biden White House during 2015 and continued through when Joe Biden left office. Would you agree that the CCP compromising the White House is a serious threat---- Mr. Bobulinski. I do. Ms. Boebert [continuing]. To our Nation's national security? Mr. Bobulinski. I do. Ms. Boebert. Thank you. Now, Joe Biden has leveraged his elected position to enable the Biden family, their business associates, and their companies to receive over $24 million from foreign nationals and their related companies. Biden is compromised and is a threat to our national security. After today, it is clear that Joe Biden is a bigger a CCP asset than Fang Fang herself. Will we ever come to the agreement that it is far time that Congress holds the resident of the White House accountable for selling out the American people? Unfortunately, my colleagues to my left have a highly coveted ``Made in China'' product, a brand, if you will, and that is Joseph R. Biden. Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my balance to my friend from Florida, Matt Gaetz. Mr. Gaetz. Mr. Parnas, how much time did you spend in prison? Mr. Parnas. Four months. Mr. Gaetz. Four months. Mr. Parnas. Four months. Mr. Gaetz. But you were indicted for crimes that could have resulted in you spending 50 years in prison, right? Mr. Parnas. Right. They were false crimes. The judge saw through it, yes. Mr. Gaetz. Well, you went to trial and you were convicted, right? Mr. Parnas. I went to trial, correct. Mr. Gaetz. And the crime was that you were trying to acquire marijuana licenses. And you took money from a Russian oligarch, and you tried to use that money to go give political donations and do what you had to do to acquire marijuana licenses. Is that about right? Mr. Parnas. That is what the indictment was, yes. Mr. Gaetz. Right. It sounds like of everyone here today, the only one working for a Russian oligarch was you, right? I mean, I just heard---- Mr. Parnas. Well, I was. It is public information, Congressman Gaetz. Mr. Gaetz. Yes, no, I just heard you wax poetic---- Mr. Parnas. I got paid $200,000. You know how much I got paid. Mr. Gaetz. You are really worried about our democracy, and you are here to warn us, but you were working for a Russian oligarch---- Mr. Parnas. On behalf of President Trump. Mr. Gaetz [continuing]. Wanting to get marijuana licenses, but then you did not even do it. The fraud you committed against the Russian oligarch was that, instead, you spent the money on yourself. So, like, was that what you were doing---- Mr. Parnas. That was not a fraud. Mr. Gaetz [continuing]. To fight against Russia's aggression just taking their money? Mr. Parnas. No, that was not the fraud. That is a lie, Congressman Gaetz. Mr. Gaetz. Well, that is what you were convicted of. Mr. Parnas. No. Mr. Gaetz. But instead of spending 50 years in prison, you got 4 months. As this hearing continues, I look forward to hearing what Mr. Galanis thinks about how he was treated by the DOJ for telling the truth as opposed to how you are treated for lying. Mr. Parnas. The DOJ did not listen to the truth because if they would listen to the truth, you guys would have been all in jail. Chairman Comer. The question Mr. Gaetz had is for Mr. Galanis. Mr. Parnas. They do not want to hear the truth. You cannot handle the truth, Matt Gaetz. Mr. Gaetz. Look, well, the truth for you is taking money from Russians to buy marijuana businesses and then going to jail and then coming here to lie about Trump. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time had expired. Mr. Parnas. You should know better than anybody what the DOJ is about. Chairman Comer. The Chair now---- Mr. Parnas. You should know better than anybody, Congressman. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognize Ms. Tlaib from Michigan. Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much. It is so exhausting. This is really incredibly exhausting, and I cannot imagine our residents sitting at home. Every time I look up and I see our former Chairman, our forever Chairman, Elijah Cummings, first ever hearing in this room was about the high cost of insulin. I think one of the first witness was a mother of twins who had to ration her insulin and lost a child because she could not afford it. I still remember our previous Chairwoman, who really did a phenomenal job, continue to talk about the opioid crisis and how the Sadler family was part of a criminal scheme to increase addiction among family members, people just literally losing their family members because of profit because of folks that were literally drug dealers in suits. All of that to say is, this House Oversight Committee, from our Committee hearings on the Postal Service, which really matters to our constituents; the high cost of prescription drugs; the housing issues; the number of struggles and challenges of everyday Americans, and they say this sincerely, sincerely because what a waste of time. What a waste of time. Just even some of the colleagues of my folks here continue to say this is a waste of time. I mean, Representative Nehls said, ``I don't think we have the will to impeach Joe Biden.'' Just for the record, impeachment is not something you have a will to do. It is something you have to have evidence to do. I mean, you know, you heard about Rep. Don Bacon, who said, ``When the staff tells you that they can't identify a particular crime, there is a problem.'' That is a problem. I mean, you can go on and on. One top Republican admits that, ``There is no conclusive evidence of an impeachable offense that shows Biden acted improperly while in office to enrich his family members.'' I mean, it goes on and on. Former Oversight chair, Darrell Issa, who serves on Judiciary Committee now, I think he goes on and he says, ``There is no clear sense of where the impeachment inquiry is going.'' It goes on and on. I mean, look, you all, this is an incredibly important Committee. We could be doing some phenomenal things in holding, currently the Biden Administration, on a number of issues. Like, I want to know about the American Rescue dollars and where that money is being used. Is it being used toward public health? Is it being used toward the crisis that continues to happen and many of our families being impacted by long COVID symptoms? I mean, these are things that we could be doing right now in this chamber, and we are not. We are doing this over and over again, and it is a waste of time. Literally, every time I talk to my constituents about this, they do not bring this up. They said, god, when is this going to be over with? I tell them, my colleagues do not know how to leave the campaigning at the steps of the Capitol. When we come in here, we have to literally put that aside and work for our constituents, work on getting some sort of understanding where we can prioritize making sure that we have access to clean water, what is going on with the lead abatement program within the Administration, talking about the specific challenges that we continue to see in our healthcare system, all of that. Again, we can hold the Biden Administration together, Mr. Chairman, on a number of issues we can see eye to eye on and say we need to use this Committee to open it up to be the watchdog Committee that we are. Instead, we are wasting--we really, sincerely are wasting the time of the American people doing this. This is awful. For them to see us going back and forth like this, it is so disenchanting for them. And you all wonder why the numbers out there, favorability toward Congress, is so low. They really have no faith in us because of this. This is the kind of stuff we do when, literally, my folks are literally fighting for the right to breathe clean air and to sit there and figure out how they are going to afford asthma inhalers. Yet, we are here wasting the people's time. Mr. Raskin. Will the gentlelady yield? Ms. Tlaib. Yes, Mr. Chair, and, again, I say this out of somebody who is a social worker at heart. We could do so many things bipartisan in this Committee. I know it, and I think we are right now really missing out an opportunity to do that. We really are. Mr. Raskin. Ms. Tlaib---- Ms. Tlaib. I yield to our Ranking Member. Mr. Raskin. Well, it is for a question I just wanted to ask you because you have had tremendous success in trying to clean up dirty water across America. We can actually get things done, right? Ms. Tlaib. Absolutely. And, you know, I know my colleagues on the other side, we all have a clean water crisis. We could, like, literally bring in folks in the EPA, bring folks into this chamber right now and ask where is the Biden Administration on the development of their lead abatement initiative? These are the things that I think very much many of my mayors, my local electeds, many of the state folks are asking. What can we do as Members of Congress to basically have more transparency in where their priorities are. But again, I really say this sincerely to all of you, we can do better. We deserve to do better. I remember Chairman Cummings constantly reminding us that we can be better. Chairman Comer. The gentlelady's time has expired. Before I recognize Representative Fry, for what purpose does Representative McClain seek recognition? Mrs. McClain. I would like to enter something in the record. My friends on the other side of the aisle are desperately trying to deflect from the Biden family's---- Mr. Goldman. Are you going to keep it the same way? Mrs. McClain [continuing]. Influence-peddling scheme by attacking President Trump and his family. Mr. Goldman. Is this for 5 minutes? Mrs. McClain. I would like to enter into the record an article, ``Actually Jared Kushner and Hunter Biden Are Nothing Alike, and Here are the Facts.'' Thank you. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. The Chair now recognizes Representative Fry for 5 minutes. Mr. Fry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the inconsistencies that I have kind of seen is what is on a text message, Mr. Bobulinski, with Raymond Zhao and what Hunter Biden testified to in his own deposition. And so, this is infamous, we have talked about this a lot: ``Z, please have the director call me, not James, not you, or Jim. Have him call me tonight. I am sitting here with my father.'' We have talked about this a lot. We have kind of got ad nauseam to it. And in response, Raymond Zhao says, ``Copy. I will call you on WhatsApp.'' So, on Hunter Biden's testimony on page one of five, he states that the Zhao that he sent this to was not the Zhao that was connected to CEFC. What do you say about that, Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I think what he is simply saying is he made a mistake, not that he meant to send that text message, because it is crystal clear that that message was meant for Raymond Zhao, who was the interpreter for Director Zeng at CEFC. But I think he tried to obfuscate in his testimony that technically, maybe he made a mistake and texted to the wrong person. I cannot speak to whether then he corrected that, but I do know, based on the communications that he got on the phone with Raymond Zhao, and set the record straight, and exactly went through what he thought he was sending him in that message, because it is followed up where they sort of snap to and say, ``We will cooperate with the family.'' Why were they willing to cooperate with the family? Because, effectively, they were bribing the Biden family to get them to help them with the four unsealed indictments in the SDNY. Mr. Fry. Right. Mr. Bobulinski. Which is the only thing that mattered to CEFC. Mr. Fry. And Raymond Zhao, you said he was an interpreter, but he was a little bit more than that, too, was he not? Mr. Bobulinski. He was like a chief of staff interpreter, correct. Mr. Fry. So, he was kind of the handler for the CEFC business. Is that correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes, he spoke good English. Director Zeng spoke very little English. Mr. Fry. All right. So to the extent that this was the wrong Zhao, I mean, I am not a rocket scientist, but if I get a text message and it is somebody that it is a different Russell, I am going to say you have got the wrong guy, correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. His argument is he sent it to Henry Zhao. I am assuming there is a text message somewhere where either Henry Zhao responded, hey, I think you meant that for somebody else. Mr. Fry. Right. And so we just see ``Copy that. I will call you on WhatsApp,'' right? Right. So, if you were perplexed as to why you received a random text message that was not applied to you---- Mr. Bobulinski. Well, that is actually Raymond Zhao---- Mr. Fry. Right. Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Saying I will call you. Mr. Fry. That is what I am saying. Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Yes. Yes. Mr. Fry. So, the issue that he brings up, though, is that he was confused and it was the wrong Zhao. I want to ask you a couple more questions real quick. Hunter Biden's transcript on page 42, he said, ``I officially began to work for CEFC when I received a retainer from CEFC in early or spring of 2017.'' Is that true? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, it goes back to the word ``official.'' He is parsing words. Hunter Biden started working for CEFC in the fall of 2015 and worked for CEFC throughout 2016. That was confirmed to me by him, by James Gilliar, by Rob Walker, numerous face-to-face conversations on it, numerous meetings. Mr. Fry. Right. So, this is not true. On page 48 of the transcript, Hunter is asked, ``he has never interacted with any of your business associates. Is that correct?'' The ``he'' he is referring to is Joe Biden. Is that true? Mr. Bobulinski. That is a lie. Mr. Fry. Hunter lied to the Committee about important details concerning his money demands and threats to CEFC, based on this WhatsApp message right here. On page one of five of his testimony, Hunter states, ``My father had no awareness. My father had no awareness of the business I was doing.'' Is that true? Mr. Bobulinski. That is a lie. Mr. Fry. You also talked about how Jim Biden also lied extensively throughout his own testimony, and that Jim was selling plausible deniability for many years, that he could not tell the truth from a lie. On page 100 of Jim Biden's transcript, Jim is asked, ``Do you recall having a meeting with Hunter Biden and Tony Bobulinski and Joe Biden?'' Jim's response was, ``Absolutely not.'' Jim states that Joe Biden never met with Tony Bobulinski. Is that true? Mr. Bobulinski. That is a lie, and I am shocked that his lawyer sitting next to him, a former U.S. attorney, allowed him to say that lie three different times in that transcribed interview. Mr. Fry. Right. When pressed, he continued to double down on that. Mr. Bobulinski. He got excited. His lawyer had to calm him down, and he continued to lie about it. Mr. Fry. On page 124 of the transcript, Jim Biden states, ``It was Hunter Biden, myself, Gilliar. I don't know. It was the five, OK? And everybody was 20 percent, OK? You know what? You know, it was never executed. It was never signed.'' And he is referring, of course, to the contract or the agreement. Is that true? Mr. Bobulinski. That is a lie. He fully executed the legal document, Oneida Holdings, LLC, as did Hunter, James Gilliar, Rob Walker, and myself. Mr. Fry. Thank you for your testimony today. Mr. Bobulinski. Thank you. Mr. Fry. Yours has been the consistent testimony throughout this process, unlike the other people who have come before this Committee. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chaiman Comer. Very good. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Pressley from Massachusetts for 5 minutes. Ms. Pressley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When Elijah Cummings was the Chair of this Committee, he often reminded us that our role was to be in efficient and effective pursuit of the truth. So, I am going to try to do exactly that because this farce has gone 15 months, 10,000 documents and 11,000 hours too long, and we have got a lot of ground to cover here. Mr. Parnas, thank you for being here. Last year, you wrote a long letter to Chairman Comer, detailing your extensive role in the ``campaign orchestrated by Giuliani and Trump to dig up dirt on the Bidens and to spread misinformation about them through various networks, including government officials, journalists, and Fox News personnel.'' When that campaign failed to find dirt because, well, there was no dirt to be found, the former occupant of the White House demanded that Ukrainian political officials announce investigations into the Biden family in order to smear Joe Biden prior to the 2020 Presidential election. Yes or no, Mr. Parnas, before Trump and Rudy Giuliani tasked you to try to find dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine, did you ever interact with Mr. Trump? Mr. Parnas. Before they asked me? Yes, I have had many interactions. [Chart] Ms. Pressley. OK. And you wrote to the Committee that in late 2018, you attended a holiday party at Trump's White House, as shown in this picture. Can you describe your interactions with Donald Trump during this party? Mr. Parnas. Yes, we came to the event. There was a Hanukkah party. Rudy Giuliani joined us. We were supposed to all go to the residence, but the last second, Rudy said to wait for him downstairs. He was going to go meet Trump himself and update him on everything that was going on. He went to meet Trump at the residence. We waited at the White House, then eventually when Trump came down to make a speech, Secret Service came up to us and said that the President wanted to wait for us at the Red Room. So, we proceeded to the Red Room and waited for Trump to finish his speech. Then he came in, approached me, shook my hand and said, ``Rudy tells me great things. Keep up the good work. Thank you.'' And then we proceeded to take pictures. Ms. Pressley. Mr. Parnas, when Trump told you to keep up the good work, what did you understand him to be referring to exactly? Mr. Parnas. Well, at that point, the conversation was about Ukraine and Giuliani wanting me to go find Viktor Shokin, so that is what I took it as keep up the good work. We would go get Viktor Shokin on our way to Ukraine. Ms. Pressley. Mr. Parnas, after the party, did you interact with Trump again, or were you cutoff from interacting with him? Mr. Parnas. After our trip to Ukraine, we were cutoff because the BLT team was formed, and the line of communication started going through Rudy Giuliani because they did not want anybody to know that is me with him because I was in Ukraine doing the stuff. Ms. Pressley. I see. So, is it fair to say, Mr. Parnas, that you think you were no longer invited to interact with Trump to create a buffer between President Trump and your work with Giuliani to generate evidence of Joe Biden's misconduct in Ukraine? Mr. Parnas. I was told that. I was told that you are going to stop going to the private events and stuff like that while you are doing this. Ms. Pressley. I see. So, despite President Trump's efforts to insulate himself from associating with you, as you sought evidence of Biden corruption in Ukraine, you maintained your contacts with individuals in Trump's innermost circle, including Donald Trump Jr., correct? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely, yes. Ms. Pressley. Well, you know, as the saying goes, a leopard cannot change their spots. And so, Mr. Parnas, you are a prime example of Donald Trump's habit of welcoming people into his inner circle, and then creating distance or the appearance of it from them as he relies on them to commit improper acts. Now, Donald Trump has demanded that Joe Biden be impeached, has enlisted Oversight Republicans to do his dirty work in an attempt to try to win the 2024 Presidential election by promoting the same lies about President Biden, lies that are firmly rooted in Russia's disinformation and propaganda effort to influence U.S. elections and undermine Ukraine in the midst of a vicious Russian invasion. I yield to Mr. Goldman. Mr. Goldman. Thank you very much, Ms. Pressley. I want to get back to this photograph here that I got cutoff from before. [Chart] You, Mr. Bobulinski, you called a number of people liars, six FBI agents. Mr. Bobulinski. I did not call the six FBI agents liars. Mr. Goldman. I am talking. If you go to page---- Mr. Bobulinski. Well, you know better, Mr. Goldman. Mr. Goldman. OK. Go to page 174 of the transcript, and you said it is not an accurate statement. It is a lie related to an FBI report. Mr. Bobulinski. I did not call them liars. Mr. Goldman. I do not have time. Quiet. Now, this is a photo that was provided by Cassidy Hutchinson after you called her a liar when she said that you met with Mark Meadows and received an envelope. Do you see this photo? Do you acknowledge that is Mark Meadows in the red hat? Mr. Bobulinski. Didn't you tell me to be quiet? I do not-- -- Mr. Goldman. I asked you a question. Do you acknowledge that that is Mark Meadows? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, maybe your person can walk it closer so I can see it. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Chairman, would you indulge since he is not answering the question, filibustering? Chairman Comer. Fifteen seconds over, but---- Mr. Goldman. Well, let me just ask it very briefly. Is that you and Mr. Meadows by Secret Service cars with you in a mask? Mr. Bobulinski. Are you kidding, Mr. Goldman? I am sitting 20 feet away from it. Mr. Goldman. Go up to him, please. Go right up to him. Chairman Comer. And your time has expired. Maybe Mr. Swalwell will give you some time. Mr. Goldman. Could he just answer the question---- Mr. Raskin. He can answer the question, right? Mr. Bobulinski. So, what I see in this picture is a Secret Service agent 5 feet from me with a full mask on and a Secret Service agent sitting in a Cadillac Escalade with all the windows up with a full mask on. Mr. Goldman. Is that you---- Mr. Bobulinski. You are making a big deal---- Mr. Goldman [continuing]. Talking to the person in the red hat? Mr. Bobulinski. It is the back of his head. Mr. Goldman. Is that you talking to the person in the red hat? Mr. Bobulinski. Why don't you ask me this, Mr. Goldman? Did I meet Mr. Meadows at a Trump rally in Georgia? I did. I acknowledge that. Mr. Goldman. Is it you? Oh, you did? Mr. Bobulinski. I did. Chairman Comer. Mr. Goldman, I have---- Mr. Goldman. But Cassidy Hutchinson is a liar. Mr. Bobulinski. Cassidy Hutchinson is a liar because she said---- Chairman Comer. Time has expired. Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. That he handed me an envelope. Mr. Meadows did not give me a single thing. Chairman Comer. The Chair recognizes---- Mr. Goldman. I am glad we have the clear story. Chairman Comer. Your time has expired. Maybe Mr. Swalwell will yield us some time. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Langworthy from Buffalo for 5 minutes. Mr. Langworthy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Glad it is so quiet in here. On the first day of the Biden presidency, then-Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, claimed that President Biden's objective and his commitment was to bring ``transparency and truth back to government, to share the truth even when it is hard to hear.'' That is obviously laughable, just about as laughable as when Hunter Biden claimed that he was trained to avoid wire fees when he had Rob Walker launder a $1 million payment from a Chinese company through 16 different bank wires to Hunter, Hallie, and Jim Biden's accounts. If you are trying to avoid wire fees, then why send four different wires over 3 months to the same account? It is a total joke. A glaring example of President Biden's failure to live up to his promise to bring transparency is his influence peddling in Ukraine, where he pressured the Ukrainian Government to fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the owner of Burisma. While Joe Biden was Vice President, in 2014, his son Hunter Biden was asked by Burisma's owners to join the board, a paid position. The Committee has sought documents from the administration regarding Vice President Biden's influence peddling in the Ukraine. The Administration which claims transparency has failed to produce these documents. I will give you an example. On September 2015, the United States was steadfast in its belief that the owner of Burisma was the face of corruption in Ukraine. The Administration vowed to work with the prosecutor general to tackle corruption in the country. However, that all changed after a phone call from Hunter Biden and the owner of Burisma to Hunter's Washington, DC. associates in 2015. A few days later, Vice President Biden delivered his speech to the Ukrainian legislature and privately pressured the Ukrainian President to fire the prosecutor general. The Oversight Committee has asked the White House for drafts of Vice President Biden's speech to the Ukrainian legislature from 2015. They have withheld those draft speeches for nearly 7 months. To this date, we have not been able to review them. We all want to know whether there were edits to the speech after Hunter called D.C. We all want to know whether the then-Vice President changed course to protect his son and his corrupt business associates. We all want to know whether the Biden family's business dealings affected American policy toward Ukraine. The White House claims to be committed to bringing truth and transparency to government. It just seems like it is only interested when it is convenient for his Administration. Now, Mr. Bobulinski, did Hunter ever tell you at any point the value of the Burisma income to him? Mr. Bobulinski. I do not recall him ever mentioning that to me. Mr. Langworthy. OK. Did he ever say it was his only income at that time? Mr. Bobulinski. Oh, OK. Actually, I stand corrected. There is a text message. I never discussed it with him. I was in Monaco at the Grand Prix. He was in Monaco for the Burisma board meeting. He set up a meeting with me. He did not show up at that meeting. Obviously, you can imagine I was not too happy, and he responded to a text, me asking him what is going on. And in that text, he states he is on the back of Khola's yacht, fighting for the only income he has, but it was not from Burisma. It was from the Kazakh deal that he is talking about. I never discussed that with him after that. That was a single exchange between him and I. Mr. Langworthy. Well, corruption and a lack of transparency from the Biden family have been common themes through the House Oversight Committee's investigation. And even when asking for simple drafts of then-Vice President Biden's speech in the Ukraine, the White House has been anything but transparent. President Biden has done and will continue to do everything in his power to cover up the truth, especially when it is hard to hear, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back--Mr. Bobulinski-- yields back to me for 1 minute. Is there anything that you want to respond to? Do not worry about Mr. Goldman. We do not pay any attention to Mr. Goldman either, but is there anything that anyone said up here that you want to take about 55 seconds to respond to? Mr. Bobulinski. It is tempting. I mean, my biggest appeal to everyone in this room is, I wish you would spend the time focusing on the fact that the Chinese Communist Party infiltrated the White House of the United States of America through the Biden family. I do not say that lightly. It is not a joke. I was willing to die for this country, as was my father and both my grandfathers and my brother. It is a serious, serious stuff. We should be asking how that happened. Take the Biden name and the Biden family completely out of it. How did the Chinese Communist Party infiltrate the White House, the United States of America? Let us start there. Focus on those facts, what they did, how they did it, why they used money, why they used private enterprises instead of military stuff and other stuff? That is huge to our national security. So, I appreciate you yielding that time to me, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Comer. Well, thank you, and I will just say this, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Pressley criticized the investigation, but I think most Americans care about public corruption, and they realize the FBI has not done the job, that DOJ has not done their job, the IRS has not done their job. They have been told to stand down, all except the House Oversight Committee, and we will do our job. And pursuant to the previous order, because votes have been called again, the Committee stands in recess. Subject to the call of the Chair, the Committee will reconvene 5 minutes after floor votes. [Recess.] Chairman Comer. The Committee hearing will reconvene. The Chair recognizes Mr. Swalwell for 5 minutes. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Bobulinski, in your interactions with the Biden family, which you have told us all about throughout the day, did you ever observe the Chinese Government grant 22 patents to any of Joe Biden's children while Joe Biden was in office? Mr. Bobulinski. I did not. Mr. Swalwell. Did you ever observe Joe Biden ever own or operate any hotels while he was in public office and take millions of dollars from foreign governments? Mr. Bobulinski. I did not. Mr. Swalwell. Did you ever observe Joe Biden employ any of his children or their spouses in the White House as Vice President or President? Mr. Bobulinski. I did not. I cannot speak to that. Mr. Swalwell. Did you ever observe, while observing the Bidens, the Bidens install a family member to be the co-chair of the DNC? Mr. Bobulinski. I am sorry. Ask the question again. Mr. Swalwell. Did you ever observe the Bidens install a family member to be the co-chair of the Democratic National Committee? Mr. Bobulinski. I did not. Mr. Swalwell. Did President Biden or anyone in his family take $2 billion from the Saudi Government? Mr. Bobulinski. Not that I am aware of. Mr. Swalwell. Did President Biden or anyone in his family get fined $355 million for tax fraud? Mr. Bobulinski. Not that I am aware of. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Parnas, as you have observed Mr. Bobulinski today in his fealty and dedication and loyalty to the Trump family, is that something you recognize as somebody who was also in that cult before? Mr. Parnas. Absolutely. Mr. Swalwell. Is there a hope for our man Tony here? Mr. Parnas. Very little, I think, until he hits a brick wall. Mr. Swalwell. And in your experience, on a scale of 1 to 10, how eager was the Trump Campaign, in your interactions, to manufacture dirt on Joe Biden, 1 to 10, 10 being the highest. Mr. Parnas. Ten-plus. Mr. Swalwell. Ten-plus. Would it surprise you, Mr. Parnas, that the Russians in their disinformation campaign outlets have often cited Chairman Comer's testimony and allegations against the Biden family to make their own allegations against Joe Biden? Mr. Parnas. No, it does not surprise me because that is exactly what they want to happen. Mr. Swalwell. Mr. Chairman, it is over. It is over. It is time to pack it up. I want to give you the top 10 reasons why impeachment is dead. Number 10, your key witness today is testifying from the slammer. Number 9, key evidence of a bribe that you all relied on, the guy who said that has been indicted for lying about that bribe, and he is a Russian asset. Number 8, another key witness has been indicted as a Chinese agent. Number 7, during the Hunter Biden interview, Mr. Chairman, you did not even stay for the whole time. Number 6, Chairman Jason Smith did not show up at all to the Hunter Biden interview. The same day, number 5, Darrell Issa said it is a big nothing. Number 4, today, Jim Jordan began his remarks not by relying on any evidence for this investigation, but he went off attacking the DOJ about what they are doing with the Catholics. Number 3, you all still have not sent the articles of impeachment for the Mayorkas impeachment to the Senate, and that happened last month. Number 2, you are now talking about a criminal referral, but if you had evidence for a criminal referral, then you have evidence to impeach somebody for high crimes and misdemeanors. And number 1, and I am sorry to say this, Fox News is not even carrying this today. In fact, one of their anchors, as they broke away 10 minutes in, said this is the same hearing over and over and over. At what point are you going to fish or cut bait? So, I just have to tell you, it is over. Impeachment is over. Dunzo, bye- bye, rigor mortis, lights out, curtain drop, mic drop, peace, adios, sayonara, au revoir, or a language that you all understand, ``Dasvidaniya.'' Did I say that right, Mr. Parnas? Mr. Parnas. Yes. Mr. Swalwell. I dare you to impeach, but you will not because you do not have the evidence, and because you do not have the evidence, you do not have the votes. Guys, it is dead, and so I am here to pronounce the time of death, 5:16---- Mrs. Luna. Say it in Chinese. Mr. Swalwell [continuing]. Impeachment is dead. 5:16, Biden impeachment is dead. Joe Biden has been acquitted. Chairman Comer. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair now recognizes Mrs. Luna from Florida for 5 minutes. Mrs. Luna. Mr. Parnas, I want to read to you a few quotes from a letter that you wrote to the House Oversight Committee. First you said that, ``I will remind you that Zlochevsky's answers are in the report that the House Oversight Committee published.'' In this document he stated that Hunter Biden was never asked or assigned to speak with anyone in the U.S. on behalf of Burisma. Mr. Parnas, are you aware that, according to Amos Hochstein, a U.S. State Department official, in a transcribed interview with the Senate, Hunter Biden requested to have a meeting with him in November 2015? Mr. Hochstein testified that he met with Hunter Biden and they spoke about Burisma. So yes or no, that statement that you made to House Oversight was incorrect? Mr. Parnas. The statement was correct because the statement---- Mrs. Luna. Yes or no. Mr. Parnas [continuing]. The statement is coming from the-- -- Mrs. Luna. So you said, yes, it was. Mr. Parnas [continuing]. Words of the CEO of Burisma. Mrs. Luna. It is directly conflicting the testimony. Mr. Parnas. This was his answers---- Mrs. Luna. Next question. There were no political or lobbying firm---- Mr. Parnas [continuing]. Those on behalf of the answers from the CEO of Burisma. Mrs. Luna [continuing]. Efforts on behalf of Burisma in your statement that you made to House Oversight. Mr. Parnas, are you aware that Burisma's engagement of Blue Star Strategies, which was a lobbying firm that was lobbying the U.S. Government on behalf of Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky, and, according to Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano, the heads of Burisma? So, that statement, again, that you wrote to this committee was incorrect. Yes or no? Mr. Parnas. No, you are incorrect because I said---- Mrs. Luna. No, that is incorrect. Mr. Parnas. No, the---- Mrs. Luna. You are directly conflicting with that. Mr. Parnas. No, no. Mrs. Luna. My final question for you, Mr. Parnas, is actually that nobody from Burisma---- Mr. Parnas. The answers were given, but not by me. By the CEO of Burisma. Mrs. Luna [continuing]. Has ever spoken to Joe Biden. Chairman Comer. The witness will say---- Mrs. Luna. It is OK, Chairman. I got him. Mr. Parnas, Devon Archer testified to this Committee that Vadym Pozharsky, the corporate secretary of Burisma sat down for dinner with Joe Biden. So, that statement also was incorrect that you wrote to this Committee. Yes or no? Mr. Parnas. No, it is not incorrect because---- Mrs. Luna. Mr. Chairman, I think this witness' credibility is shot. I would like to give the remaining of my time to the amazing representative from Florida, Representative Matt Gaetz. Chairman Comer. Very good. Mr. Gaetz. The Democrats could have sent anyone. They could have sent Hunter Biden. They could have sent Joe Biden. They could have sent Rob Walker. They could have sent Devon Archer. The Democrats could have sought any person to come in and refute the direct evidence backed up by bank statements, backed up by calendar entries, backed up by emails, backed up by text messages. And who did the Democrats send to clear the name of Joe and Hunter Biden? They sent Lev Parnas, Lev Parnas who was charged with enough crimes, violating our campaign finance laws to, like, serve 50 years, but he gets 4 months. And, like, the big, like, grand criminal conspiracy Mr. Parnas is involved in is using Russian oligarch money to try to get marijuana licenses, which seems odd, and then using that Russian money to plow into campaigns in order to achieve that objective. But the fraud he committed was not just on our election system by plowing Russian money. It was also a fraud on his own investors who did not get it. So I guess, Mr. Bobulinski, as you hear Maxwell Frost, my colleague on the Democrat side, say that Mr. Parnas, fresh off of his prison time is the most credible witness we have had to address these business dealings, what is your reaction to that? Mr. Bobulinski. I think it is laughable that the Democrats are asking Lev Parnas to weigh in on my credibility, a convicted felon that served jail time. I have an impeccable record. Now, he warned me earlier in this hearing that they are coming for me. I look forward to that. Mr. Parnas. I did not warn you. I said, ``Just keep talking. You will be there soon.'' Mr. Bobulinski. I look forward to that, Mr. Parnas. Mr. Parnas. Keep lying. You will be there soon. Mr. Bobulinski. Well, and is that a threat, Mr. Parnas? Mr. Parnas. No, it is just the truth. Mr. Bobulinski. No. Did you say they were coming for me? Mr. Parnas. No. I said if you keep lying, you will end up in prison. Mr. Bobulinski. I am not lying. You are the one who was lying. Mr. Parnas. Well, I have nothing to be scared of. Mr. Bobulinski. You are the one who went to prison for lying. Mr. Parnas. What am I lying for? Tell me what I am lying for, Mr. Bobulinski. Mr. Bobulinski. What? Mr. Parnas. You do not even know what you are talking about. What am I lying? Mr. Bobulinski. You went to prison for---- Mr. Parnas. What lie? Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Lying and defrauding your investors. Mr. Parnas. What am I lying here? What am I lying here? Mr. Bobulinski. Oh, the list is long. We do not have enough time. I think---- Mr. Parnas. Exactly, yes. Mr. Bobulinski [continuing]. Mr. Gaetz only has a minute. Mr. Parnas. I think you are a little scared just like Mr. Gaetz---- Mr. Bobulinski. So, what crime---- Mr. Parnas [continuing]. Because Mr. Gaetz does not even ask a question. You are filibustering. I have been here for 6 hours, and not one of your Committee Members asked me one question. You want to hear the truth? Mr. Gaetz. Well, I asked you--hold on. Mr. Parnas. No. You---- Mr. Gaetz. I asked a question about your illegal business dealings---- Mr. Parnas. I have been here for 7 hours. Mr. Gaetz. Mr. Bobulinski? Mr. Parnas. Ask me some questions. Mr. Gaetz. Fraud is a crime, right? Mr. Parnas. Go ahead. Mr. Bobulinski. Correct, fraud is a crime. Mr. Gaetz. Fraud is a crime, and you observed fraud on the part of the Bidens, right? Mr. Bobulinski. I did, crystal clear, so much so I had an independent law firm spend $300,000 to analyze that fraud and put together a fully ready, fileable lawsuit against the Biden family. Mr. Gaetz. And bribery is a crime, right? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Gaetz. And what you observed with Joe Biden trying to get you into this business deal with Hunter Biden, what you later learned about that business deal, and how the money was flowing from the Chinese Communist Party to Hunter Biden, to other members of the Biden family, did that concern you as a potential feature of money laundering? Mr. Bobulinski. It did. It did. I started to grow concerned after I met Joe Biden, and then I sat down with Jim Biden and used the term ``plausible deniability'' with me. And that is documented because I went back to my lawyers and I asked them something is starting to feel not right. And they went and hired another law firm to give me a full FCPA workup to go through the details of what could be done and what could not be done. Mr. Gaetz. Sounds like high crimes and misdemeanors to me, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Comer. Very good. The Chair now recognizes the Chairwoman of the House Education Committee, Ms. Foxx from North Carolina. Dr. Foxx. Ms. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank my colleagues for what you have been doing here today, unraveling these issues. Mr. Galanis, in your written testimony, you state that your ``objective was to build a diversified private equity platform, which would be anchored by a globally known Wall Street brand together with a globally known political name, Biden.'' Is it correct that Harvest Fund Management, a $300 billion Chinese financial services company, closely connected to the Chinese Communist Party, CCP, was interested in partnering with you and your business partners? Mr. Galanis. Yes, that is correct. Ms. Foxx. Thank you. Why was the CCP-connected Harvest Fund Management interested in doing business with you and your partners, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer? Mr. Galanis. The only plausible reason, and the reason we even discussed, was because of the access to the provider. There was a quote that is attributed to Henry Zhao, the Chairman, that talked about the access that it provided. So, there is documentation that was contemporaneous that said what their interest was and that interest was political access. Ms. Foxx. Thank you. Is it correct that Harvest Fund Management believed that Joe Biden would take a seat on that company's board after his vice presidency ended? Mr. Galanis. Yes, that is correct, and there were emails to that effect around that time that were circulated by people who were there as part of those conversations, including the golf outing. Ms. Foxx. Thank you. Are you aware of Hunter Biden ever speaking to his father, Joe Biden, about the plan to have him join the board of Harvest Fund Management? Mr. Galanis. Yes, I witnessed that. Yes. Ms. Foxx. It seems clear that Joe Biden was aware of his family's use of his office and influence to do business with America's adversaries and, therefore, a choice to pursue personal gain over national security. Mr. Bobulinski, is it true that former Vice President Joe Biden met with Ye Jianming, the Chairman of CEFC China Energy? Mr. Bobulinski. It is based on Rob Walker saying yes to that in a transcribed interview. I personally was not at that meeting. Ms. Foxx. When did this meeting take place, based on what Mr. Walker said? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. In my understanding, it would have been February 2017. After they had a meeting in Miami, I believe James Gilliar got on the corporate jet of CEFC and flew with Ye Jianming and Director Zhang to D.C. in preparation for that meeting. Ms. Foxx. After this meeting with former Vice President Joe Biden and Chairman Ye, were any payments made to the Biden family or associates? Mr. Bobulinski. Yes. Well, it gets to that point of obfuscation. Three million dollars was wired to Rob Walker's account on March 1st. Actually, they sent two wires. The first wire got kicked back, and then they sent a second wire on March 1, 2017, to Robinson Walker, LLC, and then, as your Committee has walked through today, they parse that out to the Biden family in numerous different payments. Ms. Foxx. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, it is clear that Joe Biden is the common element in all of Hunter Biden's attempts to do business with China. There is a pattern emerging that the Biden family and associates, including Joe Biden himself, deliberately chose personal gain over the safety and best interest of the very Americans Joe Biden was elected to serve, protect and defend. With that, I will yield the balance of my time to Mr. Gaetz. Mr. Gaetz. Hunter Biden's deposition, question: ``Do you think some of your business associates we have spoken about today--Mr. Archer, Mr. Bobulinski, Mr. Galanis--do you think they had an expectation that your dad had any role or involvement in any of your joint business dealings?'' Answer from Hunter Biden: ``Not an expectation from me. There was never a single time I can remember saying, hey, we will get my dad involved. Hey, let's get my dad on the phone. Hey, let's, you know, what can we get out of dad for this?'' Mr. Galanis, what is your reaction to that testimony from Hunter Biden in light of you describing the Biden lift? Mr. Galanis. I think it is patently false as belied by emails, and I think that there is documentation that says that is just an untruthful statement. Mr. Gaetz. And what I am trying to understand, Mr. Galanis, is there you are sitting in a prison cell for a financial crime where you were an associate with Hunter Biden and some of the others players there. And they are out enjoying Southern California and you are sitting in a prison cell, and they have got the ability to come and give this false testimony to Congress. Is it your belief that the Biden Justice Department retaliates against people who speak out against the Bidens and their crimes? Mr. Galanis. I am living that. I think, to clarify, I took responsibility for my clients. I pleaded guilty. I have served 8 years, clean conduct, and I think I have rehabilitated myself quite a bit in that period of time--in evidence and track record, but I would say that there is unquestionably a pattern of two tiers of justice and that has become a popularized term, and it is something that I have lived, experience that I have gone through. Mr. Gaetz. I yield back. Chairman Comer. Before I recognize Mr. Waltz, for what purpose does Mr. Biggs seek recognition? Mr. Biggs. I want to include an article in the record. The article is entitled, ``Tlaib Renews Her `Impeach the MF'er' Call Against Trump.'' Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Chairman Comer. For what purpose does Mr. Gaetz seek recognition? Mr. Gaetz. Mr. Chairman, I seek unanimous consent to enter into the record the press release from the Department of Justice, ``Lev Parnas Sentenced to 20 Months in Prison for Campaign Finance, Wire Fraud, and False Statement Offenses.'' Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Waltz from Florida. Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I find it incredibly rich, Mr. Swalwell was going to come to this Committee and lecture us about how China penetrates our government. I think that is something he may know a thing or two about, but let us talk about how China has penetrated the highest levels of this government, including this President and this White House because I think the visual is incredibly important. [Chart] Mr. Bobulinski, Hunter Biden portrayed Chairman Ye, the Chairman of CEFC, to Jim Biden as a protege of Xi. Is that accurate? Mr. Bobulinski. Not only is it accurate, and it was not just Hunter Biden. It was James Gilliar, Rob Walker. I would not have used the word ``protege.'' They just basically, you know---- Mr. Waltz. You do not run China's largest state-owned energy company without being close to the chairman. Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Waltz. Right? Fair enough. And by the mid-2000's, Chairman Ye ran a business empire estimated, as much as you can estimated a Chinese state-owned enterprise, tens of billions, and from a national security standpoint, this is the critical piece here, including implementing China's Belt and Road Initiative, not just all over the world, right here in the United States. Is that accurate? Mr. Bobulinski. A hundred percent. So, CEFC was effectively the shadow arm of the Chinese Government, deploying tens of billions of dollars around the world, very well documented. At its peak, I think it was doing $50 billion of revenue per year, one of the top five largest---- Mr. Waltz. Debt diplomacy where they are taking electrical grids, they are bribing officials. They take as collateral, not just grids, ports, airports, key infrastructure that the Chinese Government could then leverage and use against any country, but also here in the United States. I mean, that is how the Belt and Road Initiative works. Heck, I was just in the Armed Services Committee with the Commander of INDOPACOM, the AOR Pacific Command, talking about how China is basically gobbling up infrastructure around the world, including here. So by the mid, what, 2015, 2016, Hunter Biden has developed a very lucrative business relationship. By 2017, Hunter Biden has forged such a partnership with Chairman Ye, that he planned to share an office space with him, and then just removed Vice President Biden at the House of Sweden in Washington, DC, correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Waltz. So, here is what is interesting, and building on Chairman Foxx's questions, within days of him leaving the vice presidency, ostensibly for work performed, $3 million flows through the shell companies that we have depicted here. I mean, you could see how complicated this is, but the key piece is the flow to Hallie Biden, to Jim and Sara Biden, to Hunter Biden and his various affiliates. And the kicker here, Mr. Chairman, is that we know Hunter is then complaining about paying all his dad's bills. He is complaining to the other relatives saying, ``You freeloaders, I am having to use all this money to pay the ``Big Guy's'' bills, house renovations, and all kinds of things,'' correct? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. And it is important for the American people to understand that $3 million was $3 million of $20 million that the Bidens expected to be paid for the work in 2015 and 2016. Mr. Waltz. Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Bobulinski. And that is not just my word. That is documented---- Mr. Waltz. That is all documented, bank records, text messages, emails. So, Mr. Chairman, Bob Menendez's wife cannot get paid by the Egyptians and then provide that money over to pay Gold Bar Bob's, Senator Menendez's, bills. I cannot have my daughter get paid by, I do not know, Kazakhstan, Russia, and China, and then pay my bills. Chairman Comer. Correct. Mr. Waltz. And we know also that they had co-mingled funds with the Vice President of United States. When we talk about crimes, let us talk about the crimes. We know he perjured himself. That is a crime. We know he was acting as a foreign agent, and was he registered under FARA? Was he registered as a foreign agent? Mr. Bobulinski. Not that I am aware of. Mr. Waltz. Was his dad complicit in him acting as a foreign agent through meetings and dinners and what have you? That is crime. Mr. Bobulinski. A hundred percent. Mr. Waltz. That is crime No. 2. He was clearly acting in that capacity. We have the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we already have them, thanks to the work of this Committee, for tax evasion. So, Mr. Chairman, there are multiple crimes that this Committee has established, ample evidence. We must move to impeachment. We cannot allow this to stand, and I look forward to seeing those references to the Department of Justice for this alone. This is a critical national security issue. The Chinese Communist Party call it the princelings. They do not go after the principal they want to influence. They go through the son, and it is right out of their playbook, and they have done it at the highest levels of the U.S. Government. I yield my time. Chairman Comer. Very good. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, I just have a couple of UC requests, if it is all right. Chairman Comer. Proceed. Mr. Raskin. One is from Devon Archer's transcribed interview testifying that Biden, Joe Biden, had nothing to do with any of Devon Archer's business ventures with Hunter. Second is the declassified intelligence community assessment from the National Intelligence Council, March 2021, detailing efforts by Russian actors to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections. And finally, most importantly, the U.S. District Court decision from the Southern District of New York in United States v. Galanis where Mr. Galanis was described as a con artist who wanted to be in business with Hunter Biden but never was and how they thought that they could add layers of legitimacy to their con operation. If I could have those introduced. Chairman Comer. Without objection, so ordered. Now the Chair recognizes Mr. Gaetz from Florida. Mr. Gaetz. You are a serious business person, Mr. Bobulinski, right? Mr. Bobulinski. I am. Mr. Gaetz. Unlike the convicted felon next to you, you have served in the military, right? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Gaetz. You have done big deals. Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Gaetz. Complicated deals, deals that involve foreign businesses, right? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. Mr. Gaetz. And so, what I am trying to figure out is when you came to realize that you showed up at the wrong party, because you kind of strike me as the guy who showed up to do a legitimate business deal, and you ended up instead at a bribe. And so, as you are looking at CEFC, as you are having this meeting with Joe Biden, as Hunter Biden is introducing you to his web of contacts, when did you go from serious businessman, Tony Bobulinski, working to make a buck in a capitalist system, to a guy worried that you had been unwittingly ensnared into Hunter and Joe Biden's bribe operation with the Chinese Communist Party? Mr. Bobulinski. I appreciate the question. It was not a aha moment. It was more of a process. I am a serious businessman demonstrated by the different deals I have done around the world and the success of them. But remember, the Biden family was not my entry into this. James Gilliar, who I had known for over 10 years, who traveled the world doing business, kept trying to get me involved. I really had no interest. I sat down in the spring of 2017 to walk through things, and then I quickly put together two businesses, SinoHawk and Oneida. After the meetings in Los Angeles with Hunter and Joe Biden, bells and whistles started to go off when Jim Biden used the term ``plausible deniability.'' Mr. Gaetz. Plausible deniability is the first moment, straight from the lips of Jim Biden, right on the heels of your discussion with Joe Biden, where you start to think this might not be legit? Mr. Bobulinski. Correct. And my lawyers at the time could attest to that because I reached out to them saying, listen, I am a former naval officer. I held a Q security clearance. Somebody could not take me to dinner for $50. This just does not make sense to me. Mr. Gaetz. But you proceed, but you proceed, and then later this thing starts to get a lot uglier. What is the moment you go from, OK, your Spidey senses are up, you are analyzing this, to now you know this is a crime that you are bearing witness to? Mr. Bobulinski. The end of July when the Biden family put them right front and center in the middle of a $9 billion transaction between the Russian state-owned energy company, Rosneft, and CEFC, a surrogate for the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Gaetz. And was there ever a time in the deals you were involved in where you started to see the money move around the legitimate business enterprise and toward the pockets of the Bidens? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, the challenge, Mr. Gaetz, with that is, at the time, they moved the money, right, you guys have the text messages where Hunter Biden shook down Director Zhang, but I was not aware of that. I spent a year asking questions of this does not make sense to me. Where is the money?? I stepped in and had lawyers work to dissolve the two entities. I did not know until years later that they had defrauded me. They had gotten paid all this money and all this craziness. The amount of facts---- Mr. Gaetz. This seems pretty simple. This is either a bribe or a business. Mr. Bobulinski. It was a bribe from the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Gaetz. And---- Mr. Bobulinski. And I do not say that lightly. There are 1,200 pages, 8 days of testimony in the Southern District of New York. I encourage everyone watching me, hearing me say this, they are publicly available, go read them. Our Department of Justice outlines in intimate detail the corruption and bribes that CEFC was deploying to political officials all over the world. Mr. Gaetz. It was not just the United States. Mr. Bobulinski. So, I am here to believe that they did this in every other country, but with the Biden family, it was pristine. It was an actual clean business. That is absurd. Mr. Gaetz. And you came to know that, and that is when you blew the whistle, right? That is when you started to get worried when you saw Joe Biden---- Mr. Bobulinski. I stepped away from it. The whistleblowers, I cannot give them kudos enough for the bravery and the risks they put their family in. They published stuff where I am voicing the concern of the Rosneft deal. Mr. Gaetz. And you animated your concerns when you saw that this was not just a corrupt bribe, a corrupt business deal happening to a guy who used to be a Vice President. Everyone has made a big deal, like you are a bad guy, that you showed up at the debate, or you are trying to give life to these facts that you have observed, that it is so bad that you did that during a political contest. But observing this, it kind of seems like it would be unpatriotic for you to stay quiet. Mr. Bobulinski. Of course. Mr. Gaetz. And so, I mean, Joe Biden running for President clearly motivated the Chinese to consummate this bribe. Did it also motivate you? Mr. Bobulinski. Well, I did not want to go public. I wanted to simply unload all the facts, personal experiences. It is funny there are 18 people on this Committee with law degrees, including, I think, Mr. Swalwell. Evidence, firsthand testimony is the most powerful evidence you have. I have given it. Mr. Galanis has given it along with a whole host of other witnesses. Then on top of that, I have thousands of documents and pages of legals and stuff like that. Mr. Gaetz. Well, that is what---- Mr. Bobulinski. I wanted to simply give this information-- -- Mr. Gaetz. Yes. Mr. Bobulinski. [continuing]. To Congressman, Senators, and let them do their job. Mr. Gaetz. Well, that is the thing. No one questioned any of your facts. No one brought a single piece of evidence that even for a moment discredited any of the truthful testimony that you have given us. Mr. Bobulinski. No, they did not. Mr. Gaetz. My time has expired. I yield back. Chairman Comer. The gentleman yields back. That concludes our questioning. Again, I want to thank the witnesses. We are going to close now, and I will yield to the Ranking Member for a brief closing statement. Mr. Raskin. Great, and I will take an extra 32 seconds as Mr. Gaetz did. Well, and while we are on Mr. Gaetz, he seems to be upset about a couple of different things. One was fraud, which is fascinating to me, given that his hero, Donald Trump, has just been convicted civilly of banking insurance fraud in New York in a civil case, and now owes, I think it is $454 million, unless that has gone up with interest. I think he is having a hard time making that, but I am sure that Mr. Gaetz's constituents will help him out as they are shaking down Republican voters. You can pay either for Donald Trump's criminal lawyers or his civil lawyers. That is the big political choice, I suppose. He is also upset about China. Well, if you check out the Democrats' report, ``White House For Sale: How Princes, Prime Ministers, and Premiers Paid Off President Trump,'' you will find that China actually gave more than $5 million to Donald Trump while he was President of the United States in direct violation of the Emoluments Clause, which says that nobody in Federal office shall accept a present, an emolument, which means a payment, an office or title of any kind whatever from a king, a prince, or a foreign state. And we spent a day again jawboning about Hunter Biden, who has never held public office, and he has never done business with a government, and yet we have right in front of us, in front of our very eyes, mammoth corruption, unprecedented in U.S. history, by Donald Trump as President. And my friends do not say a single word about it, but he wants to lecture Mr. Parnas about the illegal donations he made on behalf of Pro-Trump Super PACs. I have noticed something interesting with the people who have finally disenthralled themselves and gotten out of the Trump cult, as Mr. Parnas puts it. People like Michael Cohen, Sarah Matthews, Cassidy Hutchinson, Alyssa Griffin, there are articles about them. There are dozens of those people, and I would be fleeing for the exits now too. What is so fascinating to me about it is that they do not mind when these people lie for Donald Trump. Then when they get out and start telling the truth, that is when they call them liars for what they did when they worked for Donald Trump. Mr. Parnas, they are not mad that you lied and went to prison for it and did your time. They are mad that you stopped lying for Donald Trump. Mr. Parnas. Absolutely, Congressman Raskin. Mr. Raskin. So, when I was a state assistant attorney general, Mr. Chairman, I saw a judge on my very first day of work castigate a lawyer by saying, ``Son, you forgot the very first rule of lawyering. When you go to court, you have got to bring the evidence with you.'' You forgot to bring the evidence. There is no evidence, hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, dozens of hours of testimony, but not a shred of evidence of Presidential wrongdoing, much less an impeachable offense by President Biden. And you are making not just the Majority a laughingstock, the whole Committee a laughingstock. So, it is hurting us. My Members are saying when will they call off this nonsense? So, here we are. Again, Mr. Parnas, I want to thank you. You have explained to America that the allegations at the very foundation of this inquiry were predicated on Russian propaganda and disinformation just as they were at the start of the hit job that you and Rudy Giuliani were sent to do back in 2018 and 2019. And I want to thank you for showing America what real intellectual honesty and personal honesty look like and how you can grow out of the deranged Trump syndrome that so many of our colleagues are still suffering from today. It is time to call this investigation for what it is, Mr. Chairman. It is not just an embarrassing failure and an historic failure at that, but it is a historical betrayal of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, as Vladimir Putin tramples the freedoms and the democracy of people in Ukraine. We should be spending our time standing up for democracy and not tarnishing it with spectacles like this. I yield back. Chairman Comer. I should have brought my waders from the farm. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. Mr. Bobulinski, Mr. Galanis have delivered testimony in front of the American people directly implicating President Biden and his family's influence peddling schemes, schemes that brought over $24 million into the Biden family and their business associates' pockets. For what? I never heard the Minority say what they did or what business the Bidens were in. Mr. Bobulinski and Mr. Galanis have provided documents supporting these claims and provided hours of testimony to this Committee. Mr. Bobulinski and Mr. Galanis have not changed their stories. Mr. Bobulinski and Mr. Galanis did not ask for this hearing, but they showed up for it because they have nothing to hide. I also invited Hunter Biden to this hearing, in part due to his own request that he be allowed to provide transparency and testimony before the American people, or at least he did request this hearing, and then he sat for a deposition with the Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Now he is nowhere to be found. Mr. Bobulinski, Mr. Galanis, and others have implicated Joe Biden in the Biden family business. Hunter Biden denies his father's role in the Biden family business. This is a material discrepancy among witnesses of the highest order. I attempted to solve this problem by getting the witnesses in the same room together to straighten out any misunderstandings. It should be clear to the American people that Hunter Biden's word is as valuable as the fake services he was selling. And this Committee will not play games or belittle the institution of Congress by allowing Hunter Biden to call the shots about who he testifies with or when he does it. At this point, the only person who can resolve this discrepancy about Joe Biden's participation in his family's influence peddling schemes is Joe Biden himself. As I said at the beginning of this hearing, Joe Biden was either used by his family over and over again and paraded in front of his business partners to rake in millions of dollars, or he knew exactly what he was doing to enrich his family. Joe Biden was either complicit or incompetent, and the American people deserve to know which one it is, which one it was, but neither is acceptable for the leader of the United States. I do not think anyone believes that this is acceptable behavior for the family of the President of the United States to receive tens of millions of dollars from our adversaries around the world and they cannot say one single thing they did to receive the money. Nobody supports that. I do not care if you are Democrat or Republican, if you are from a big city or a small town. That is not what this democracy is about. That is not what the founding fathers set up. They set this up that we have public servants come and provide their public service and then go on. They did not set this up for public servants to enrich themselves through their family, through influence peddling. Has anyone denied, Mr. Raskin, that the Biden family was influenced peddling? Nobody denies that the family was influence peddling. What we have here is a major discrepancy on what role Joe Biden played. We know the three former Biden associates say that Joe Biden was actively involved and knew full well what the schemes were, what the family was up to, but we have Hunter Biden testifying under oath that his dad did not know. So, in the coming days, I will invite President Biden to the Oversight Committee to provide his testimony and explain why his family received tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies with his assistance. We need to hear from the President himself, and I assure the American people that they will be able to evaluate for themselves the President's honesty and fitness for the office he now holds. With that---- Mr. Raskin. Mr. Chairman, are you going to invite Donald Trump to come and talk about his violations of the Emoluments Clause? Chairman Comer. You all have investigated Donald Trump for years, and I am pretty sure I have read in the paper that there are a lot of investigations of Donald Trump. No one has investigated---- Mr. Raskin. But when we impeached him---- Chairman Comer [continuing]. Joe Biden---- Mr. Raskin [continuing]. You were invited to impeach Joe Biden. Chairman Comer. Are you going to work with me to see that Joe Biden comes and answers these discrepancies? I mean, this is a big deal. Mr. Raskin. There are no discrepancies. There is nothing-- -- Chairman Comer. No discrepancies? Mr. Raskin. No, there is no evidence at all that he has committed any high crime and misdemeanor. What is it? Chairman Comer. In closing, I want to thank our panelists once again for their important and insightful testimony today. With that, and without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses which will be forwarded to the witnesses for their response. If there is no further business, without objection, the Committee stands adjourned. [Whereupon, at 5:49 p.m. the Committee was adjourned.] [all]\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In a recent video message from his desk at VA Central Office, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins addressed media concerns that Veterans’ benefits might be targeted for cuts.\n“I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut,” Collins said. “In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.”\nHe went on to emphasize that the Veterans Benefits Administration is clearing cases faster than ever and that VA remains mission-focused by doing what it is supposed to do.\nNow, in his first full week on the job, Collins also addressed concerns about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and rumors regarding access to Veterans’ personal information. He clarified that DOGE representatives at VA are reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans.\n“I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,” he said.\nCollins reinforced VA’s dedication to fulfilling its mission under President Trump’s leadership and concluded his message with an assurance of ongoing transparency regarding developments at VA.\nTopics in this story\nMore Stories\nBridge My Return (BMR) is a military-only platform designed to offer free career and job services to Veterans, military members and their spouses.\nThis post contains links to job listings for the week of Nov. 24, 2025. Each week, we’ll continue to post relevant and timely jobs as we receive them, and for the locations listed.\nVA tests ambient AI scribe technology, an AI-powered tool that listens, records, and processes the conversation between health care providers and patients. Early results show improved efficiency, more accurate records, and a better overall care experience for both Veterans and VA providers.\nI’m a veteran trying to live,\nOn less than,\n$2,000\nI am a retired Army Warrant Officer. I am concerned with the number of 100% disabled veterans I see and heard about in my circle of friends and family. I may be uninformed but appears there are a lot of grifters that are able to work a flawed system and get benefits that should only be going to those that are truly in need and deserving. I’d like to see a review of all those receiving disability to ferret out the abuse.\nSec Collins, while I really appreciate your videos, unfortunately, it is clear that your employees are not getting the message clearly or understanding what your promises mean, so they can change their attitudes to one of being customer-focused. It is clear that too many are little more than bureaucrats pushing papers rather than being proactive in addressing real issues.\nI have been a frequent poster here and on ask.va and I have received absolutely no help or support as promised in your video.\nHere is the latest questions, A-20250313-2151871, which contain SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS for those of us who live outside of the USA (under FMP)\nHere is another request for HELP A-20250227-2122402. I got a non-answer that told me nothing I didn’t already know but failed to answer a simple question.\nIn both cases, I got absolutely nothing of any value or help. All I got were canned responses to “call the VA,” which is not only time-consuming (the last time I spoke with the VA, I was on hold for 5 hours before I got a real person) but also expensive. As phone calls cost about $2/minute, the phone call cost me close to $600.\nThe problem is that what you are promising is really great, but your staff just don’t seem to understand that we expect them to help us solve the REAL PROBLEMS we are turning to them to solve.\nThe first IMPROVEMENT would be to stop expecting people from outside the USA to make phone calls. The VA needs to adopt Zoom or Microsoft “Teams” so we can talk with a REAL PERSON without incurring high expenses. You also need to direct your people to provide a NAME and their TITLE. Unless we have a name and a title then it is impossible to give compliments (as I did for one person from the OK office) or complaints.\nThank you in advance for providing a way for us to communicate DIRECTLY with your office, as many of these messages seem to “disappear.” Why can’t or won’t you identify an OMBUDSMAN team consisting of people who are committed to initiating ACTION to help solve REAL PROBLEMS?\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDoug Collins is a liar. He is Trump’s VA puppet.\nThese politicians will say whatever they need to say to make it seem as if they care. They don’t care about me or you. I have been fighting for disability compensation since 2018 and my claims continue to get denied by someone sitting in a cubicle making decisions about whether or not my injuries were caused by my service to this country. The way the VA is set up is backwards. The VA shouldn’t be denying anyone their benefits that they earned. In fact, the VA should be the ones to prove that the injuries you sustained weren’t from the military, not the other way around. The way this country treats its veterans is shameful. Now we have a new Secretary of the Va but the same old BS. No transparency . I would love to talk to this Va Secretary but they have no interest in fixing this disaster. Just collect a paycheck that is paid for by you and me .\nDAC (Disabled American Veterans) has nothing to do with and does not receive any money from the government. DAV exists to help veterans, their widows/widowers and dependants deal with VA.\nI sent am email to the DAV a month ago asking them to help me with my claim.. I still haven’t received any response. It is good that the President is getting rid of the dead beats.\nDon’t expect anything from these incompetent fascist liars. trump actively hates veterans. Stop falling for his bullshit.\ns south korea 67-68 agent orange–7 years + if presumption of exposure is verified by VA\nif diseases are on the VA list that VA excepts THEN why would the VA deny benefits it may be the system GOOD LUCK\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 2,238 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans. This forum has been open since 05 November 2010, this thread has gotten the most comments ever and some are positive other’s are honest. I want to leave a food for thought moment, you are drowning in the ocean and the person who can save you is from across the aisle your political opposite. Is our divide animosity so strong that we may think it best to drown instead of receiving support from a fellow American.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nFuck that. Fuck trump and fuck anyone who supports him. They are a threat and should be treated as such. Your both sides nonsense accomplishes nothing.\nWe need to get rid of nonVetrans in Key administration positions of regional VA Offices\nYes! They are mostly contractors. They are in charge of approving our benefits.\nIt’s sad that there are so many misinformed or ignorant postings on this site against President Trump. The government is going to run out of money and no one is going to get any benefits if the US goes bankrupt and the currency is devalued and we lose the dollar as a reserve currency. Most government offices, need to be reformed, but accurately reformed.. the number of NGO’s ripping off the taxpayer is phenomenal.\nEat shit, moron. Trump supporters are traitors and fascists.\nI don’t trust them yet.\nDon’t trust trump loyalists ever.\nThis person was on a network espousing how they cut only those who need cutting. Acknowledging he states lawyer first in his bio, where does he get his healthcare? Have gotten nothing but excellent service at the VA as did my father. Thank you Veterans.\nMore talk—–Wants you to think ,he talks the talk, to make things happen—-I can not see the end of my claim and it’s on it’s 13th month —-no communication anywhere in this Circus, travel on your time and gas and then wait for ages to even get reimbursed ——this is a like real life scene from FBI last Monday——-that was the truth.- check the reruns on Paramont that is what 100’s of our Vets are going thru.\ngreat now find those files and pay them been ready since 2023 oct was to pay may 2024 o ou are the only one per admirals etc who is at that pay level to okd and pass to payables then after 286 pd they are the oldest wating then take pf the next bunch it is not hard sit down and get this done about 3 hrs of your time also cant communicate stil waiting for pass code so where is that email. next is there no funds to take care this tell the yrue factsor jd is over this dept need help i will drive there and read each file you neglecting for some reason retirement is noexcuse so sPitit out i am older than you. so man show some guts if this postion is beyond your norm then step aside\n.DO YOU HAVE REQUIRED MANAGEMENT AND GET THESE THINGS DONE SKILLS. PROVE YOURSELF\nI’m wondering what happened to Mike Nachinek over the department of Veterans affairs? I couldn’t even get a case number through my father’s illness John Paul Brewer retired US Navy. My cases are at oscn.net Mayes county in appeal . I sent complaints today online to HHS and I would like prosecution due to a letter from Donald J Trump President to stop false hospice.\nVery unliley that anything gets better, when so many people (incluyding a ton of VETS) are getting fired. Sounds like more fo that “Just Believe me” stuff. Would love an IG that is a retired VET put in place and the VA leadership actually woirks with him to cut waste but employ imprvement prgrams WITH Measurable metrics.\nOne of the problems I have experienced is when I ask for a referral for community care outside of the VA. Sometimes it takes several months. Case in point, it took me from September last until March 11 this year 2025. I found out it was sent to VA several times. It was found to be on head dentist in Tuskegee since Jan 18 of this year. Had to get another’s Doctor to override last week. This happens quite often with my primary doctor at the Podeshef Clinic in Columbus Ga.\nThank you\nBilly Cumbie\nDear Honorable secretary of Veterans affairs. Please contact the President to force prosecution around a Sept 17 2019 VA case filed in the Mayes county courts with inspector general HHS complaints made today. I will have to go back and submit Medicare and Medicaid information. Please study cases at http://www.oscn.net for international false profiling around healthcare that led to inveigling,elder abuse,medical restraints through false hospice under Sheriff Mike Reed Pryor Ok\nYou will not get a meaningful response from these incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans.\nThese community care are kids fresh out of college. Community Care really SUCKS!!!!!!!\nDo,you really expect Vets to believe this pack of lies? Trump just cut 37,000 VA jibs!!!!\nWell, you’ll be happy to know that a federal judge just ruled that no employees at the VA will be terminated. Those who have must be reinstated immediately. VA secretary Collins has lost all credibility with the veterans and really should step down.\nOn behalf of veterans everywhere, go fuck yourself.\nThe harm against Veterans has been going on since 1979, not just ten years!!! Will a female disabled Veteran be harmed, treated badly, and attempted lethal harm if she goes to the VA now? West Virginia VA treated me very well and cared about my health. But in other VA hospitals, there was way too much violent, destructive, intentional harm!!! Acting above the law like we don’t matter only certain ones. Never corrected, or those attacking Veterans never held accountable!!! Can we female Veterans, whistleblower Veterans, and Veterans that people don’t like to get to go to the VA without being harmed in any way? I hope so without people toying with our lives!!! Than you for being there for us!!!\nDear Sec Collins, Here is an email I sent out earlier today CONGRATULATING one of your employees but offering CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS/SUGGESTIONS to improve the services being provided by the VA FMP office to those of us who live/work outside the USA.\nDear Ms. Grace, (and Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311)),\nMore great news!!! I received notification yesterday that the VA had been SUCCESSFUL in transferring my first payment from the VA ELECTRONICALLY. So, thank you once again, Ms. Grace, for making this happen so promptly!!! I hope that Sec Collins’ office has commended you on your outstanding CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\nHOWEVER, consistent with the promises that Sec Collins made on 5 Feb 2025: https://news.va.gov/press-room/secretary-collins-message-to-veterans-and-va-employees/ still leaves me with more questions.\nWe’re going to deliver timely access to care and benefits for every eligible Veteran, family member, caregiver and survivor.\nWe’re going to put Veterans at the center of everything VA does, focusing relentlessly on customer service and convenience.\nWe’re going to challenge the status quo in order to find new and better ways of helping VA beneficiaries.\nWe’re going to celebrate the vast majority of VA employees who do a great job every day and hold employees accountable when they fall short of the mission.\nWe’re going to provide Veterans with the health care choices they have earned while maintaining and improving VA’s direct health care capabilities.\nIn the context of these promises, and given I am still holding Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) accountable for all these SNAFUS, given the original amount the VA transferred was $8,278.18 but the actual money credited to our account was only $8,139.08, I want to know WHY was I PENALIZED $139.10 (1.68%) when you were told originally that my preference was to use a dollar-dominated account? Does this meet the letter or intent of what Sec Collins has promised us? Is this what any Vet deserves for his/her service?\nimage.png\nSo here are the questions I am raising with the expectations that the yet-to-be-identified Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311), will not only provide ANSWERS but will be PROACTIVE in making or facilitating the appropriate changes to bring the EXISTING policy and procedures in line to REFLECT the LETTER and INTENT of the COMMITMENTS Sec. Collins promised.\nQUESTIONS NEEDING ANSWERS AND CORRECTIVE/REMEDIAL ACTIONS from Mr/Ms. No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) to meet the letter and intent of Sec. Collins promises:\n1) I originally provided a local USD dollar account with my local bank, but the VA informed me that they cannot/will not transfer to the dollar account, only to an Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) dominated account. Why should I, having provided my services to our country and now as a CUSTOMER of the VA, be expected to incur the risk of exchange rate fluctuations? Why have I been penalized $139.10 because the VA cannot/did not follow my original instructions?\n2) Why isn’t the VA ITEMIZING the payments? The VA paid $8,278.18, but how much of that was against the DISABILITY ($471.23 X 13 months = $5,482.49), and how much of that was REIMBURSEMENT of VA APPROVED payments for out-of-pocket medical expenses? ($29,775.06 through 23 Jan 2025) Without a detailed itemization showing what the VA FMP has paid and what you have not yet paid, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for either you or us to manage the cash flows.\nAs noted, this email with attachments is being submitted on Sec Collin’s message page. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/#comment-827171\nThank you again!!\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDr. Paul D. Giammalvo, CDT, CCE, MScPM, MRICS\nSenior Technical Advisor, PT Mitrata Citragraha\nYou will not get a response from those incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans. Don’t believe their lies.\nYou are a liar.\nQuit lying and eat shit, trumpie.\nFuck you and fuck doge and fuck trump you fuckers. You have alienated queer veterans and you are fucking liars. Rot in hell where you belong. I hope this administration crashes and burns and takes all you supporters with it. Fucking traitors all of you. Piss off.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted? That just proves that the basic intent of the current VA administration is to manage what we hear and say in this forum because the administration is about to screw us out of our disability and benefits, While they swear they aren’t going to eliminate them. 80,000 firings will surely devastate veterans care and services.\nNo mention of a national day of rallies IN SUPPORT OF VETERANS… in state capitols.\nMarch 15, noon, GO to your state capitol please.\nOk chief I’m a 60% DV served in the Air Force so you say there is no cuts at the VA. So all the Veterans that they laid off is made up that’s why no one believes in the government anymore its just hurry up and wait BS. if you served you know what that means. How can anyone work for a person that has dodged service and made fun of veterans all the time. This fool lost my respect when he talked shit about Sen. John McClain and now he has a Nazi doing something about waste ok, where is the money that he has saved its are money tax payer money not the governments. God save the USA from these idiots.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted?

It took me over an hour just to figure out how to sign in. Do you think a guy at my age could do this? Having to take numerous pictures of my driver’s license is just over the top. I had to take several pictures to get an approval. I am really upset with this nonsense. I am not a computer expert. What do you mean having to put in a website? Most people do not know their website.\nThat is what I would like to know. I haven’t been able to log in since December becuase of it.\nOk so it isn’t just me having this issue. Since late mid December I haven’t been able to log in. No matter what site I am sent to in order to correct the issue it fails.\nThank you for that information, my husband is 100% Vietnam vet,he also have PTSD,and agent orange disability.Glad to know he will be taking care of.We both are disable.I used to work for VA Hospital in the 1990’s and they were not good at all,a lot of messy people who was really mean, even before Trump was president,I had a hard time getting help from VA, and the hospital was awful, we had a hard time getting him approved for disibility.Still have a problem getting appointments and things he need,I hope things get better with Present Trump.\nI am so pleased that the Agent Orange claims. Will not end.\nI was exposed in the 1960s and now suffer from CLL leukemia.\nMy claim was opened in September of 2024.

He is just another lying puppet MAGA MAGGOT!\nHe is a veteran\nDoesn’t matter; still a fascist traitor.\nBeing a veteran doesn’t automatically make you a good person. I’ve known many great people during my time in the service but also plenty of not so great people. I bet this new puppet is just as greedy and gluttonous as his master regardless of years of service. Stock up and get ready vets, I don’t see this ending without bloodshed on US soil.\nMy husband, Wayne A Pfuhl, was a US Army veteran and a retired police officer. His ashes were interred at the Ft Snelling National Cemetery in Minnesota on December 23, 2024. I placed a request for the Presidential Memorial Certificate for my husband to be signed by Donald J Trump. Can you advise if or when this request will be honored?\nGlad to hear this. but not convincing enough about Dodge. Dodge is BREAKING every law in its path, and he had not one word to say about that. He must be another Trump suck up.\nIf you are associated with Trump Administration, I don’t believe you.\nThat’s why you’ll always be a sheep.\nI hear Putin unzippig his fly. Line up to service him like a good tRumper. ?\nLick that boot, bow-n-scrap like a good tRumptard.\nSheep are the ones who don’t blindly follow something?\nAll this is confusing. I was trying to check my husband’s appointments on My Healthevet and got into this website. So many changes – they just changed the login procedures and now not sure what is happening. My husband uses Community Care for many appointments as getting appointments at the VA clinic was impossible or took months. Hopefully, the new Fredericksburg clinic will change that. It is very nice, but empty. As the speciality clinics are moved in I’m sure it will fill up. Most of the staff members are pleasant and do a good job. Mostly, the procedures for getting care could use some changes.\nWoundering why the VA clinic In Athens ohio will not put our president’s picture up .They had know problem putting Biden picture on the wall !!!\nI can’t stand looking at Trump, he is a criminal grifter.\nMR. Collins keep up the great work. I for one have had nothing but good experiences with the VA. There is a lot of hateful comments in this thread must be the Air Force. Keep up the good work, people need to relax and trust the process.\nwell, don’t expect those good experiences to continue as these cuts will result in fewer personnel to help with paperwork, doctors to find and treat illnesses, and facility maintenance personel.\nNext they will be requiring all disabled vets to be “re-assessed” under requirements that will push them out of care and into the streets. Trump doesn’t like losers that get captured or injured.\nfellas… fellas Much emotion discharged in all this commentary. BUT I FEEL YOU ALL! This battle for benefits is real for many a soldier who deserves what’s his… But for all the others who never proved themselves during their time of service, then shame on you for taking what’s not yours!\nAs for our new secretary, Doug Collins (and regardless of political orientation), we deserve to give this man the benefit of doubt but keep him in the “cross hairs” by measuring every word he says…. Verifying every promise he makes… Monitoring his deeds! And if he fails, let’s expose him then…. BUT if he performs and “does what he says he is going to do when he says he is going to do it”..then he deserves our praise and support.\nThat’s right fellas, lets grant this man the opportunity to prove himself battle ready.\nTime will ALWAYS either prove you or expose you!\nWhat the hell are you talking about. Does everyone who served have to receive a Purple Heart. I am USN and went to Nam and was washed over the side of my ship off the coast at 2 in the AM. We were pulling plane guard for the Midway. I served 3 tours, so bite ne. KMAMF.\nWhy would anyone trust him when he’s straight up lying to us?\nI am outraged that, as the purported leader of the VA, you are not doing everything you possibly can to disrupt and thwart this clear authoritarian plan to cut federal jobs, VA healthcare, and every other society-improving program that actually does good in this country. You should be ashamed of yourself, but it appears no one up there in the exec branch even has the ability to feel shame. So I am ashamed for you, and all those like you, who talk out of both sides of your mouth when trying to justify your actions. It’s reprehensible, and if you are not willing to lie down in front of the DOGE bulldozer for your constituency then you should just resign for principle and let someone more qualified and dedicated take the reins. Get out while you still have some semblance of a soul. Not that you ever did, by the looks of it.\ntrump hired him. Of course he’s a loyalist.\nI am completely shocked at the betrayal of this administration to its veterans. From mass firings across the federal government not based off performance of duties which affect numerous veterans to now cutting all their benefits and forcing the veterans around our nation who paid in blood t o have the bean counters turn their back on our veterans and have them suffer medically and possibly face homelessness is very disturbing and shameful. These actions will come full circle when all the veterans get a chance to vote this next go round and based off the above this administration is going to have to own this when the chips fall on them. So disgusting and shameful. May god have no mercy for these actions. I pray that we have no veterans die due to these actions.\nMr. Collins needs to crawl back into the hole he crawled out of. This is a privatization scheme. This is capitalism run amok. This is corruption in broad daylight. Someone’s going to have fat contracts and it won’t help the veteran. Traitors, all of you.\nDoug you are blue falcon , and a coward!! I bet you are receiving full benefits, while veterans are getting their taken away. Everyone sees through your lying Ass!\nWhy did you make a video to lie.? The cuts are posted on the Congressional Budget site. What is your problem? Can you read? I’m not sure you can because i am not sure you are qualified to hold the position.\nAs a service connected veteran I will be looking for a more streamlined VA system with better care. Staff that actually care about us the veterans.\nVa Secretary. Please stop acting incompetent. You have not been in office long enough to know what is or not good for the VA. Certainly letting Thousands go to any other means than Retirement is not being responsible or competent. Veterans signed a contract: Service Time and in return, life time treatment by VA. Not even you can or should try to do anything to derail such.\nYou took an oath of office. That Oath was not to a Man, King, Queen, Lunatic, or wannabe Dictator. The VA cannot afford to let anyone go without cause. Stop listening to Trump or anyone else.\nLiar.\nReduced service levels are just the first steps towards privatizing the VA.\nYou create a problem by cutting funding and service levels, and then say the solution is to privatize the system so the rich can get richer.\nComplete BS from this guy, he accepted slashing jobs in the VA. Then when people actually working at the VA say hey this is hurting us and hurting vets he goes on air and denies that lost jobs are causing issues. A total scumbag who will throw us all under the bus and rip away our benefits just to benefit himself and his masters.\nDoug Collins is the definition of a Bravo Foxtrot.\nRespectfully – This sounds like you’ve never called the public phone number for the VA. How is cutting your workforce going to make a vital and already understaffed department better able to help our Vets&their families? A huge percentage of VA workers are vets themselves, including disabled vets. Isn’t one of the goals to get Americans working? In past administrations when specific Fed jobs were deemed redundant the workers were retrained and given the opportunity for more efficient, needed jobs at equal if not higher pay. How is kicking these hard working Americans into the unemployment line pro-America? It seems like the ‘cuts ledger’ has only 1 side; these people (who’ve never served in the military, some of these kids are barely old enough to enlist) who are taking a slegehammer to the workforce seem to be (purposely?) neglectful of the future losses these cuts will cause. It can already take months for vets to be seen for therapy, medical care, job training etc. The faster our vets can get the benefits they need, to stay healthy and back to joining their families and communities, the better off for all of us. There are reports the VA Suicide Hotline is going to stop training because .. heaven forbid.. there are mentions of ‘LGBTQ’ in the training materials. While individuals are free to fear whoever they want the fact is LGBTQ people exist, there have always been LGBTQ Americans who have served our country. Shame on anyone trying to blame them for these ridiculous cuts -Turning your back not only on them, but on every other service member who is at the point of considering suicide is unconscionable. Please show what the US Military is supposed to stand for: protect our fellow Americans. Countries are not ‘businesses’ working to make profits for a handful of shareholders. The measure of ‘greatness’ isn’t a high profit margin. Stop selling out our veterans for a handful of businessmen who’ve never served and see those who did as ‘suckers’.\nI live in a rural area. We do not have local VA health care. This requires us to travel sometimes hours to get health care. I’m the last month travel pay has been turned over to a new agency that will not allow any contact from veterans and is denying my claims that have been verified valid requiring us to overload the appeal system to wait years to have valid claims paid while we suffer to obtain care so that someone in Washington can claim they are reducing fraud. There is no fraud here, when you can assign a contact number for vets to call in and review travel claim I will believe that you are not cutting. I have had 3 claims denied in the last month and need care. If you care, contact me… Then I will believe you aren’t blowing smoke.\nSure my stepdad been dead 3 yrs and still no grave marker.\nThen why Mr Secretary is the Legion having to push the Major Richard Star Act. Currently, combat-injured veterans face a reduction in their retirement pay for every dollar of disability compensation they receive. You lie. What’s next? Thank you for being another puppet in the Trump Musk Romper Room show. Resign sir.\nI find your videos to be absolutely arrogant and condescending. You do cheerleading for a POTUS who a 34x felon who DOES NOT respect vets. You say none of these haphazard cuts will affect healthcare but that is absolutely NOT TRUE and you know it. Stop lying! You KNOW the Veterans “Veterans Access Act” paves the way for pushing most and eventually ALL VA provided healthcare out into the Community so… Stop Lying (or hey, if you were unaware, see the assessment of this bill on Military.Com). You must be aware that there’s a GOP proposal to REDUCE VA disability payments by 30% once a disabled vet reaches 65.. right? Where are ya with that Mr. Doug? You’re also aware of the GOP proposal to reduce the healthcare services to those under 30% right Doug? Where are you with that? VA’s routinely SCORE HIGHER during Joint Commission audits than their civilian counterparts…. WHY Doug, would you want to dismantle a system proven to be better than outside hospitals? VA should be “the model” as their focus is on providing top-notch heath care rather than maximizing profit.\nAll those recent illegal firings now have the backing of a Federal Judge and have been ordered to be restored. Where were you for these employees? You just went along and broke the law… Then started spinning it. WHY? What is your motivation Doug? OPM’s now blaming the Agencies saying they never “ordered” you to do it… The OMB genius guy VOUGHT wants everyone traumatized. YOUR WORKFORCE is traumatized Doug… How do you expect a traumatized work-force to deliver top-notch care? How do you expect to attract and keep the best when YOU are literally terrorizing your staff and their families? Employees wont trust management for the next decade or longer and just how many of them are Vets that are being affected? You have to do better. If you cannot stand up to POTUS and his illegal actions, you aren’t fit to represent Veterans in OUR Affairs. If you are unable to tell the truth or do your job, please do the right thing and just resign. Right now you are absolutely tarnishing any legacy you might have had… The question is why? You ain’t no good ole boy, so stop with the bs ‘eh?\nWhere I am, my VA Doctor is the best doctor I’ve had. She is attentive, takes time to listen, and is very compassionate. She is leaving the VA because she is overwhelmed with the workload. The VA counselor I’ve been seeing for my PTSD is getting ready to leave because he is overbooked and sometimes double booked. I’m lucky if I get to meet with him once a month, (at my VA disability hearing I was instructed to see a therapist at least twice a month). There aren’t enough personnel to meet what is required. The pay is low, they get treated like robots, so they are leaving for the private sector. I have no idea how I’ll manage without my doctor and therapist. Getting hung out to dry after my service.\nI am not having fun or enjoying life as much today as the Veterans Association says their accounting records show I was overpaid by them a couple of years ago.\nI am told the Biden Administration and his Veteran System says I overpaid. The employee stated my old pension of $1413.00 a month would be $327.00 from now on. They reply,”there is nothing I can do about it as their accounting shows the proof. They never sent me any accounting or proof.\nThank god. I am 72 and get $1060.00 a month for social security. It was kind of a surprise for this old Vietnam veteran who is now having to live on $1387.00 a month.\nI just remember my old motto,”Things can only get better.” I am grateful though as I have God, family and you, my great friends in my life. I hate to post this but per the internet and on the Veterans sites it is an ongoing problem for over 50,000 veterans who are currently appealing this. Anyway, just wondering, can you help? Get the word out?\nThank you.\nJOHN BLANCHE/DBA ELVIS\nplease stop the cuts – you can’t cut your way to better health care. firing VA employees and reinvesting the savings doesn’t make sense. Government employees provide better service than contractors and in most cases at less cost.\nBlaming the press for news about significant cuts in VA personal is bogus. We veterans are not stupid. The fact that thousands of people are in fact being cut from the VA employee rolls (including veterans) is bound to have a detrimental effect on the delivery of benefits.\nAnd you did not address the question of whether Musk and his team of slash and burn expertise executioners will have, or do already have, access too our personal information. Instead you spoke about their reviewing contracts These actions are extremely worrisome to me and many others like me.\nIn this day and age, when “retribution” seems to be the operative word, I may be sticking my neck out by posting these comments, but as a conscious veteran I feel compelled to speak my piece, which I assume is still permitted in this great country!\nI retired from the Army in May of 1995. I didn’t apply for any disability rating until 17 years after I retired. My experience through out this entire time has been that the VA operates in a 3 word doctrine , Discourage, Delay and Deny. I watched as my neighbor who was a decorated Vietnam veteran of the 1st Cavalry Division kept applying for a disability rating for years due to combat wounds and Agent Orange exposure and after 5 years of trying he was awarded a whopping 0% disability rating. He passed away 2 years ago. I am rated at 70% currently but should be higher . My question for you sir is : Who sits on these revue boards and what qualifications due they have to make these decisions ? From some of claims that have been denied I think they are just unqualified people who can’t see the obviousness of why some claims are submitted. Please look into this ! I would also like to add that wait times for appointments at the Floyd Lindstrom VA clinic in Colorado Springs is way to long as it also is at the Rocky Mountain Regional Medical Center in Aurora Colorado. The excuse they both use is lack of staffing . When I ask for community care because the wait times are so long it takes another long period before you get an authorization. When there is an issue with getting a response from someone for anything and you contact a patient advocate, it takes sometimes 10 days to get a response from the. and just today I received an email from the the VA western Colorado health system that the Patient Advocate office hours are now limited again due to staffing issues. PLEASE FIX THIS !!\nWhy has the Indianapolis Radabush VA Hospital project to build a new Hospital been put on Hold??\nPlease assure us that The PACT Act will remain intact. We fear that laws passed by the previous administration will be targeted for DOGE scrutiny and removal. My husband is a “Bluewater Vet.” His Parkinson’s Disease and dementia are related to his Navy service in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam era, and we are grateful for the financial assistance provided by the PACT Act for his increasing need for care. Respectfully,\nThe out sourcing of disabilty claims is a nightmare for Veterans in many cases. Secretary Collins VA has our records. Many of us have records on file tha VA can provide by contacting a non VA intermediary. They often don’t have the Veterans records and the ask the veteran to to do the leg work in acquiring the records on their own. That can be beyond the capabilities of many us and a valid claim of a veteran may bo by the wayside and may be denied. Thiscan be simplified by VA keeping outside services who are I’ll equipped to provide proper service to the veteran. The want us to travel to their arranged places for tests. Many times they are many miles from our homes. When we have VA facilities in our local communities. I just had serious brain surgery and can not travel to locations for An EEG and another for an EKG and another for an XRAY and another for a psychiatric exam. This is out of control when all of these tests are in the VA records already. The aneurysm claim is linked to my service disability for high blood pressure. I need my claim to be expedited and granted 100% due to unemployability. I can not work with all of the issues that I have. This is not unique many of my fellow veterans are in this maze of VA red tape. I will assure you my local VA Clinic is outstanding but VA disability benefits go to outsourcing for further testing. Not necessary. This needs to get to VA Secretary Collins desk.\nI want the medical services at a VA Health care facility. Stop sending veterans to the private sector unless they specifically ask for that. Reducing staff means you’ll be trying to force veterans out of the VA health care system and into the private sector again. Stop denying it and stop doing it.\nThank you for saying this part. This has been my experience with the VA since 2020 and I hate it. When the VA was forced to use the private sector due to the CARE Act, I ended up being lost, forgotten and ignored by the private sector with the VA being unwilling to intervene. I’ve been without care for 5 years now. It took me years to get in to now have nothing and no faith in the system.\nGlad I left my VA job then too because I would’ve been fired for sure.\nThanks, Trump for fucking me and many other Vets over them and continuing to fuck us now, you Russian traitor. How the hell has any of what Trump has done has been good for us Vets?\nPlease partner with habitat for humanity to provide homes to vets. There are thousands of abandoned houses across the nation that they could refurbish and give to homeless vets\nI truly agree with this. It saddens me to see our boys in the streets… wondering about with a million thoughts in their minds…. No mission….no battle buddies….HOMELESS!\nI will personally work on this! Not via HUD and their red tape protocolos and policies, but via the private sector. I am designing $30,000 handicap-ready compact homes that can be built on a large track of land as cluster homes and be financed via our VA home loan benefits.\nIn essence, these will be Communities for vets only.\nMr. Collins\nAs Secretary of the VA, your job is to fight for Veterans Benefits rather than just accept the loss of 80,000 jobs. If you plan to just accept this loss you should resign.\nChet Hebble\nI will be asking the VFW,DAV , American Legion , Vietnam veterans of America, and all veterans groups to appeal to DOGE not to destroy the improvements that President Trump made in his first term in office. As someone who has personally dealt with downsizing of a organization I can understand the hard choices we need to make by contributing to the National Debt. I will be asking that Veterans Administration do a Four percent reduction in force for the first year 2025, Then five percent in 2026 . The total distruption of the Veterans Administration is not needed or necessary.\nYou are piece of crap Mr Collins. You and your drug addled south African asshole and go jump off a bridge. Its pretty clear that you, POTUS, and all republicans could care less about VETs.\nGO piss up a rope you fascist.\nDon your comments to Mr. Collins are totally uncalled for. I hope you don’t always have this attitude.\nHe has only been in the job three weeks. Your nasty post should of been deleted…………………………….\nGOLD STAR WIFE\nWhile your intentions sound good, why should anyone believe what you are telling us now? Trump and Musk are cutting things daily and the VA was already short. While the contention is that nothing will change for us Veterans, there have been too many lies, changes, etc., coming from the top, on a regular basis. Why should anyone trust you when you take your directions from these same unreliable people? With short staff already in place and open positions, cutting will only contribute to decreased care and less top notch providers.\nYOU ARE A FASCIST TRAITOR. I SEE A CHAPLAIN AND A VET. WHAT? A SINNER AS WELL.IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES.I HOPE TO GOD YOU ARE NOT A FAMILY MAN.YOU ARE A HUMILIATING EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COUNTRY GOOD LUCK GOING OUT IN PUBLIC YOU WILLBE MORE HUMILIATED. God is watching you\nAs the saying goes: You can fool all the people some of the time and You can fool some of the people all of the time but you can’t fool all of the people all the time. Unfortunately you may be fooling enough of the people in the short term. I’m waiting to see improvements to the system not its demise. In the short term you may find yourself to be the bureaucrat hearing “YOU ARE FIRED”, And it may not even be your fault. You may not have been able to find enough fraud and abuse or at least to say that you have. There will be no next comment. I am a registered independent voter. A veteran who has thus far been treated fairly and respectfully by the VA. What is going on now does not have the appearance of fairness. Why call for balancing the budget while at the same time asking for tax cuts? Show some common sense first make progress on the deficit and come back in two years to get paid for any progress made.\nSelf promoting political hackery. Not a word is sincere or believable. The current VA secretary has no intention of honoring commitments made to veterans. I recently had a visit to the ER at a VA medical center, and the nursing staff is freaking out. How does frightening and overworking medical staff improve veteran care?\nIt is sad and embarrassing to see the comments from the free loaders that did nothing to earn the benefits talking crap based on their mistaken political beliefs. Grow up and get a job instead of expecting handouts. They should cut the benefits for all that didn’t serve in combat or do a full 20. No more welfare for the lazy.\nGary, I served 20 years, and in 2 combat locations. I dont expect handouts. I am not a free loader. DID YOU????\nIt pisses me off that this Administration full of draft dodgers and notorious for disrespectful comments about veterans are now in charge, what a mess. YOU SIR NEED TO REEVALUATE YOUR COMMENTS OR MOVE BACK TO RUSSIA, YOU FIT RIGHT INTO THE TRUMP MINDSET> .\nGary, KMA and lick trumps boots.\nCombat does not happen with all of the support people also in boots—Medical corpsman here—was medical staff on the ground back home in hospitals that serve those who come back also important to you. Maybe that view from your high horse needs to adjust. We were ALL important in our jobs so that you could do yours.\nI have the upmost respect for Dog Collins. I listened to his video presentation and it left me with more questions than answers. As a service connected veteran, not 100%, I have been able to access the on base recreational facilities for camping with my family and guest for the last several years. We recently reserved camping sites as before and paid the necessary fees. A week or so later I received a call from veterans services on base that the regulations have changed and the benefits have been restricted to veterans with 100% disability and of course the normal active duty, retired, and reserve. The Service Connected veterans with less than 100% disabilities have lost some of their benefits. I would like clarification please. Thank you.\nHow much money does the VA spend on promo items like pen sets, coin purses drink coolers and MANY OTHER ITEMS FRIG MANEGNETS A TPON OF CRAP?\nHey, Comrade Collinski…I hate it when someone pisses on my leg and tells me it’s raining out. And I hate it more when it’s a Trump ass-kisser doing it. Do everyone a favor and keep your lies to yourself.\nSecretary Collins:\nCutting 82,000 jobs will indeed cut our benefits. This proposed cut is not a media fantasy, it exists in an official memo–and you know that.\nI am a Purple Heart Combat Veteran, and I want you to know that the VA provides excellent health care with its very limited resources. The VA has been running on a reduced budget already, so it cannot absorb a slashing of 82,000 personnel and still provide benefits we now have. Wait times will further degrade. My local facility has already eliminated paid reception and desk jobs and replaced them with unpaid volunteers. There is no slack.\nPlease honor your pledge to ensure our VA will continue to provide good health care. Go to bat for us.\nVa has been trying to get the iu and they are trying take away after 67 will the 200.000 over 67 will get the shaft and loose loss what states provide. Like home tax, free fishing licenses and much more Texas will give no home tax relief for my wife if i die. I am 82 years old and it want long before I will die .\nYou piece of garbage! You, trump, musk and vance are ALL GARBAGE!!!!\nMaybe you should have done something and served in the real military rather than talk crap.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what they seek, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. They, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the working and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with very little experience in the processes involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash the system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better.\nAt first, 1400 probationary VA employees were fired. And, now, you recently announced another 80,000 to be fired. How do you expect the VA to better assist Veterans, especially in areas like getting appointments more rapidly if you are firing the people who answered the phones? You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” And, from everything I have you say, you don’t care about veterans either. You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote. We had a term for “shipmates” like you, Bravo Foxtrot. So far, you have earned it.\nGer Elon Musk OUT OF THE VA. He doesnt care about VETERANS. NO PRIVATIZATION\nOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just noticed your disclaimer that whatever a Veteran post, the post is going to be changed to more moderate wording. To that I say what I post is my 1st amendment right, so hand off the wording…………………..\nDam!!!, I cannot believe you took the time to make another video with NO Factual basis (all lies). I am 80 years old, Disabled Vietnam Veteran, and your good old boy down home speaking is as phony as the word coming out of your mouth. The V.A. clinic where I go for healthcare has a hard time servicing all of the Veteran who need help due to MUSK and Trump cuts. The more you cut employees the Longer and longer it is going to be to schedule an appointment for care. Not enough Doctors, nurses or medical folks with the right expertise to care for Veteran’s needs. I believe MUSK and TRUMP would rather have all of the Veteran who served this Great Country Die off rather than help them with their healthcare. I guess you don’t remember what NON-MILITARY (draft dodger) said about the Navy Hero Senator McCain. Trump doesn’t RESPECT him because he got CAPITURED, Tortured, something he or Musk will never experience…………..\nI just want to know, why is it that the first thing every party, democrats and republicans always wants to cut veterans benefits and social security??? I would think the kickbacks being taken away from the politicians would pretty much take care of the deficit, wouldn’t you agree??\nPlease secure jobs for the healthcare providers at the VA. These GREAT folks are overwhelmed with veterans requiring their services. It would benefit our veterans if you could increase the number of healthcare workers and decrease the number of bureaucrats (most of whom are quite useless). In fact the folks at the Wisconisin Evidence Intake Center have NO idea what they are doing when it comes to Vietnam Navy Veterans. These people cannot even determine longitude and latitude on a map when determining where a ship was stationed according to the ship’s deck logs. This puts our Navy Vets at a disadvantage when applying for benefits. Please Mr. Secretary sort out this bureaucratic MESS!!! Thank You\nYou overwhelmingly voted for a reduction in EVERYTHING, so stop whining. Trump was correct when he said veterans are a bunch of suckers.\nCollins, you are lying. Stop lying to veterans!! We have been betrayed. Lincoln made promises when he created the Veterans administration to care for those that shouldered the burden of this country’s wars. Trump, DOGE and Elon Musk are bragging about cuts. Trump has never respected us. He calls us suckers. He says he has no respect for POW’s because they are losers for getting captured. He doesn’t want the most injured of us all to be brought out at public events. We remember. I will never forget this country’s betrayal. I used to take great pride in serving my country. No longer.\nI have been dealing with the VA sense I retired in 1998. The past month VA help has been better than the past 20 years. I got a referral that I needed for back issues I have had for worn out hip joints from running 5 miles a day while in the military.\nI see many posts on this site condemning the new administration. Most are unhinged. With nothing more than Ad Hominem attacks on a man they never met. Whom they hate, with a hate a demon would be proud of. Not even willing to hear the truth, but are influenced by a political party that would leave them to die on the battle field just like in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, or Abby Gate in 2021.\nThank you Mr Collins for taking control of a broken health care system for us veterans that in the past would allow us to die in pain rather than give us the treatments we earned for our service. May God be your guide and give you his wisdom and strength to write the ship that was left to list in the mothball grave yard.\nVeteran care is being impacted already.\nAlong with many of the previous comments I don’t believe anything you say. You are allowing a draft dodger who knows nothing about military service and is known to badger and insult military people make decisions on something as important as our veterans, he is getting rid of the pact act for revenge my husband gave up so much and is now a 100% disabled. I can not express how disgusted I am with this administration\nDOGE wants to fire as many as 80,000 VA workers. How does this not impact Veterans who receive care at facilities around the country that are being threatened with closure and the loss of workers? Providing easy to access care to our Veterans is part of their benefits we the people (via our government including our Presidents) promised to them, is it not?\nAll we ask for is the earned return for our signature that’s it nothing more nothing less.\nHe’s a liar. It’s been a right wing project for decades to defund VA until it barely functions. Then they complain about how it’s too big a bureaucracy and it’s failing vets. This is all in an effort to give the medical contacts to their wealthy friends. The VA is the only public healthcare in this country, and it is much beloved, so they have to destroy it. Hands off VA!\nYOU’RE JUST SPOUTING THE PARTY LINE! TIME WILL TELL THE REAL TRUTH.\nMr. Secretary,\nThe biggest issue I see with the current mandate to cut jobs is that it focuses solely on reducing headcount rather than improving efficiency or service quality. If the goal were truly to streamline operations, the mandate should focus on identifying inefficiencies within the department—many of which appear to be intentional. The VA routinely slows the processing of claims and services, seemingly as a cost-saving measure. By creating delays, veterans are forced to wait for care, which in turn reduces the VA’s immediate financial obligations.\nA personal example: My therapist switched practices, and I requested that my authorization be transferred to the new location. Despite providing all necessary information immediately, Community Care first authorized the original practice instead. When I pointed out the mistake, they canceled my authorization entirely. Then, only after I followed up multiple times, I was told there was a two-month backlog for new authorizations. A simple administrative change took four months to resolve, during which my mental health deteriorated. I can only imagine what happens to veterans with more severe conditions who lack the ability to advocate for themselves.\nTo make matters worse, I was informed that this authorization was intended to close my need for therapy. That decision should not be made by bureaucrats—it should be between me and my therapist. Given the lasting impact of my military service, I will likely need mental health support for the rest of my life.\nIf the VA is serious about reducing waste, it should start by identifying policies and procedures that seem intentionally designed to create bureaucratic delays in services. These inefficiencies do not just inconvenience veterans—they actively harm those in need of care. Additionally, the VA should conduct audits to identify deceased veterans whose benefits are still being paid, preventing unnecessary financial loss without restricting care for the living.\nThe current approach to cost-cutting prioritizes hitting a number over people. It’s time to focus on real reform.\nAdditionally, another approach to improving efficiency and accountability in military and veteran affairs would be to consolidate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget into the Department of Defense (DoD) budget. Instead of the VA receiving a separate allocation, a designated percentage of the DoD’s total budget could be earmarked for veteran care.\nCurrently, VA funding is a little over 41% of the DoD’s budget. Setting a benchmark of 40% as a starting point would save approximately $5 billion, while still maintaining strong veteran support. This shift would place greater responsibility on the DoD to prioritize the long-term health and well-being of service members, ensuring that decisions made during active duty do not create unnecessary burdens on the VA system later.\nAdditionally, this reform would introduce accountability mechanisms within the DoD. Right now, the DoD operates with virtually no financial checks and balances, as any effort to reduce or restructure its budget is often framed as being anti-military. By tying VA funding directly to the DoD’s budget, poor decision-making or inefficiencies within the military would have real financial consequences, forcing leadership to be more strategic about both spending and personnel policies.\nOf course, there would also need to be a separate accountability mechanism for the VA to ensure that the reallocation of funds results in better, not worse, services for veterans.\nI previously submitted similar ideas to the White House for consideration by the Department of Governmental Operations and Efficiency (DOGE), along with an offer to volunteer my expertise as a BA and MBA-educated veteran honor student. Unfortunately, I received no response. You have my name Mr. Secretary, I’m the only one I know of, feel free to have someone contact me.\nWould be even better if you didn’t reduce the benefits for a 100% disabled veteran because YOU made a mistake and paid me $1600 too much educational benefits when we’re sending money to every country, known and unknown, to pay for:\n* $1.5 million to “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities”\n* $70,000 for production of a “DEI musical” in Ireland\n* $2.5 million for electric vehicles for Vietnam\n* $47,000 for a “transgender opera” in Colombia\n* $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru\n* $2 million for sex changes and “LGBT activism” in Guatemala\n* $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt\n* Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations — even AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation\n* Millions to EcoHealth Alliance — which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab\n* “Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria”\n* Funding to print “personalized” contraceptives birth control devices in developing countries\n* Hundreds of millions of dollars to fund “irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan,” benefiting the Taliban\nBut good on you taking back $100 from me every month\nI appreciate what you said in your video. I have 3 claims that have been in limbo for months. Just trying to get the disability rating I deserve is a task I shouldn’t have to fight. I served in Desert Storm and Somalia (PACT ACT) and keep getting denied. Please fix that. It’s been months on these claims and they haven’t moved. DOGE needs to get involved with that aspect. People like Marc in his rude statement, should not be listened to. I’m a proud Veteran and I appreciate you. Thank you, sir.\nDeleting veterans comments because you dislike the words is not going to change the outcome for those that steal our benefits. Don’t forget who trained us and what we were trained for a$$clowns.\nYou were an election denier who signed his name to a brief seeking to overturn a free and fair election. No facts in that brief just made up hog wash.\nNow you are head of the VA appointed by Trump. You got your payback for supporting him.\nYou should be ashamed of supporting that lie on the record.\nFiring VA staff for no reason will only hurt veterans.\nEvery time I go to the VA I now have to avoid looking at your picture as well as Trumps.\nThere is no reason to be nasty to Mr.Collins.He has only been in the job a couple of weeks. Totally disrespectful.\nGold Star Wife\nGet off your knees and grow a spine. It’s unbelievable how a coward like you can actually run Veteran’s Affairs.\nMr Collins thank you for your post and video. I am a Air Force veteran from the 60’s and over all the VA has been good to me. However I hope you will look at the VA billing system which in my opinion is in great need to be upgraded, I am on a copay for some things and the way the VA handles this is a total mess. Just have someone check my account and it should be oblivious. I am treated out of the Columbia MO VA.I would be more thank happy to talk to someone about this. Thanks John\nYou miserable asshat! All you are is a “Tool” for an “Orange Painted” fool of a fascist. Your plans will harm those who you say, that you are there to serve. Grow a Spine!\nWow! A *lot* of comments here! Just wanted to say that I’ve been dealing with VA since ’76 and realistically in the past 6 years or so has it been consistently great for me. But now I can imagine which services are going to be axed, delayed and impaired with cuts… And basically cuts just for the sake of cuts (with a sword not scalpel), without actually looking at and identifying areas that could be cut, or further improved for matter. I hate to say it but it feels like, “hey let’s do what Elon’s doing because, hey, he’s the richest man in the world” even though helping veterans who served their country is far cry from buying satellite and rocket companies.\nSadly, I have noticed a slow down with processing claims Since the election, I am a supporter of President Trump but I think there’s been a mistake at the VA and it’s gonna cost all of us pain. We cannot even ask for a projected date for the resolution of one’s claim. Normally it would take about 45 days to approve or disapprove a claim now I am at 60 days in step number two and Fear that there will be no definite time resolution it could go on for months or years. I’m losing confidence in the system. This is very scary at 71 years old now I don’t have a lot of time. And from reading the comments below from my brothers, it appears that I’m not alone, the secretary remember is a politician first. So it appears that these cuts at the VA are in fact impacting veterans in a negative way. That’s why I came to read these comments one can only come to the conclusion that we as veterans are going to be hurt. How sad.\nThis administration gives a ratsass about veterans. Hell, the Dictator in Chief called us losers.\nWe will pay the bill for our votes.\nReally Johnny? So that’s why POTUS DJT started the Veteran Crises Hot Line in his first 4 years? Giving us Veterans a hotline to call if we need help. Maybe you should stop watching the paid for media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.\nYou actually believe that Trump created the VA helpline? The suicide prevention line? He did not. I worked in the field. Trump created nothing but problems for the active duty and now veterans. Those lines are not the work of Trump. Anything having to do with mental health related lines were already in practice. He takes credit for others’ work.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line in 2007 as a 24/7 resource to provide confidential help to veterans and their loved ones in need of support.\nIn 2022, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline transitioned from the standard 10-digit phone number to the more recognizable 3-digit number, 988.\nTo reach the Veterans Crisis Line, callers can now dial 988 and press 1. The line is accessible through call, text, or chat.\nThe intent of this shift was to make the phone number for the Lifeline easier to remember and more accessible for people who need immediate crisis support.\nJerry the veterans crisishotline has been going since 2007 you couldn’t be more wrong\nSo, what did you think he was going to do while you watched him lie to the American people? Then you voted for him. You are a fool for believe his lies!!! The Bible warns of increasing lies and deception in the “last days,” with passages like 2 Timothy 3:1-9 describing a time of moral decay and a strong delusion where people will reject truth and embrace falsehoods.\nIn 2000, DOD and VA conspired to drive off grass roots groups. We used\nto be invited to Pentagon briefs. But, with the creation of Deployment\nHealth – only members of the military family alliance that were chartered\nby Congress were allowed to attend any more. Service groups were fine\nwith this. Less disruptions. Less to compete with. DOD cuts us off.\nBy 2002, DOD slowly started to also cut off the service groups from certain\nevents as well. Limiting access to information. By 2003, all were distracted\nwith OIF OEF.\n2004, Deployment Health did all it could to pad, and hide any medical problems\nsurfacing from Afghanistan, Iraq. West Nile Virus, Acinetobacter Baumannii,\nVisceral and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, and IED as well as EOD injury issues.\nBy 2005, VA no longer allowed grass roots upstairs to meet with staff. Only\nservice groups. Service groups were fine with this. IOM / NIH began cutting off\ngrassroots and service groups from its workshops.\nBy 2010, VA started driving away the service groups. Not briefing them on\ncertain things. As did DOD. Sec of VA Eric Shinseki had grudge matches with\nanyone publishing news or materials he didnt approve. Then he resigned\nin disgrace.\nBy 2012 VA and DOD actively started removing advocates from committees\nand functions. Started rigging VA committees with internal ringers that would\nnot publish, seeking out congress, or rock the boat. Media started writing less\nand less veteran stories.\n2016 would be the last serious batch of veteran related congressional hearings.\nCongress no longer wanted the service groups and limited them to there\nbudget proposals in the spring. After this, it was mostly OEF and OIF till the\nPACT act became necessary.\n2021 came along, Covid let VA and DOD keep every one at bay. Limit meetings\nto video conference. Stopped answering phones. Now media is on board and\nno longer writing veterans stories. Cutting VSOs out as well. Google started\nblocking any websites that said anything harsh about VA and DOD.\n2024, VA started removing public comments from its meetings and ignored\nany still up. VA stopped writing anyone outside of VA that wasnt part of\nthe inner circle. Openly opposing the service groups. No one was welcome\nupstairs and the dont have to answer phones, email.\n2025, Trump and Elon step in to take advantage of this vacuum to gut most\nagencies, and with VA disregard for veterans – there is no loyalty. So no job\nis secure and everyone is threatened. Your public comments here are largely\nangry veterans spewing at you with no loyalty. You may have a few ringers\non the inside still supporting you, yes men, its not enough to stop the wave\nof cuts coming. because there is no unification across the boards.\nThis all started with DODs need to hide in plain sight, and lump all wars into\nthe Deployment Health catch all. Make everything generic. Seems like now is\nthe time to team up with all sides, eras, and the service groups like it was\nbefore DOD undermined all this. Strength in numbers. Now is a good time\nto post a public voting format within VA of what its veterans want. Instead\nof telling them what they want.\nKeep the current path, it all ends in chaos. Stop insulting people, keep things\nsimple – and just provide the service you supposed to minus the games. At\nleast with this purge at VA, you will unite people alright – an angry mob that\nyou betrayed protesting in unison in front of your doors. The elitist days of\nsnobs looking down on the public is about to unravel. More of the same\nand worse failed. Each angry vet created is for a lifetime, and dont think they\njust plan to keep taking this. Millions betrayed, Im so thrilled Im not you.\nThank you for breakdown.\nSecretary Collin’s, I hate to see anyone lose their jobs but the answer to the problem isn’t quantity of people, it’s quality of people. My amazing VA primary care doctor retired and was replaced by a provider who personally insulted me the first time she saw me and has treated me like garbage. Now shdoes not want me for a patient and I don’t go to the doctor even when it is needed. I suffer daily! we have a beautiful new facility here in Columbus GA but I’m not sure what the purpose of building it was. It appears to be a big empty building.\nI am grateful for t he OUTSIDE care I get from the VA. Seeing outside providers is the only way I get quality care except for mental health care I receive. Why can’t I see someone outside the VA for primary care?\nIf you are going to reduce the VA work force by 83,000 employees. That means that 82,000 veterans will loose their jobs.\nAs a veteran, how is that supposed to be OK with me?\nAbsolutely Trump propaganda!! DOGE, project 2025 & Trump’s entire agenda is anti American, anti democracy, pro Russia & meant to advance the mega rich. Cutting the VA workforce by %20 (70,000) is not advancing the mission, it’s sabotaging the delivery of services to veterans. Musk/DOGE could start by eliminating the waste & abuse in Musk’s numerous billion dollar government contracts. You are part of Trump’s “revenge/retribution administration. We are not fools. Those who speak out I’m sure will be targeted by Trump’s administration.\ni have being trying to fight the VA for over 18 years and the only goal for the VA is to see us die and never get our entitlements. Sadly the VA is not here to help us Veterans but to impede us from getting help, aid and ensure that many of us never get our entitlements. I have seen many brothers and sisters die because the doings of the criminal organization known as the VA. I have being trying to disability retire from my current job but all can only be attainable if i ever get my 100% total and perm but even as my law firm fights for me, I still do not see the light because the criminal organization known as the VA will do anything to ensure we vets never get our entitlements and just die to completely push us away.\nMyself and many of my brothers at arms have been fighting the VA for years due to the VA denying everything illegally, unlawfully and simply in spite. I personally have being fighting the VA over 18 years and they illegaly remove % for our records to lower our profiles. after many years and many law firms i was able to get a 90% because they denied many ailments that where proved to began while in service but they have continue to deny myself and many of our brothers and sisters our rights. I was even downgraded illegaly to 80% without no appt, no proof or anything.\nWhen I left the military in 2007 I have no idea what i needed to do with the VA because nobody ever helped me or guided me to what my entitlements were, i had no idea. So since then i have been fighting this uphill battle. I have helped dozens of vets so they do not have to go through what i have been going thru for almost 20 battle. and thankfully most have been able to get their entitlements assigned properly due to getting out prepared and with good guidance.\nI am pursuing disability retirement from my current job due to my ailments but finally receiving my 100% total and permanent that I deserve is imperative and hopefully my current law firm will be able to finally.\nThe VA is supposed to be here to help us Veterans but they are only here to hurt us and worse.\nYou are a LIAR!!\nHell yeah he is. He must think we’re stupid.\nI’m a disable Vietnam vet and have been dealing with the VA since the early 70s.\nAll I can say about Secretary Collins’ “kicking the can” message is that it’s just more self serving BS from the Draft Dodger in Chief and his MAGA minions.\nThe VA has always been chronically understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed by requests for care so how is removing 1000s of employees, many of them veterans, along with programs and funding going to help anything or anybody, let along improve things?\nThe plain truth is that it’s not and if Sec. Collins goes along with this farce it just proves that he’s more interested in keeping his place at the tax payer funded feed trough than he is in helping veterans.\nAll you boot lickers are disgusting.\nStop by Doug Collins office, make him tell you to your face that he supports cutting 80k VA jobs.\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 2042\n#VeteransRally\nI’m decorated, injured and former member of socom with full benefits, and have NEVER had an issue with my benefits or staff. Yes, there’s been a few messups but always resolved. We as veterans earned benefits and should greatly appreciate what we get. The members of other agencies who also put in work have often gotten none. Can it be inproved? Always !!!! It hasn’t even been 2 months. Breathe in people.\nWhile I am not in the same league at 60%, I also have had the best care at the VA for my SC injuries. However, I do not want to wait while my fellow veterans are harmed by the actions by this political appointee Collins. He does not appear to speak truth.\nCentral to these efforts is a pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care benefits and services to veterans,” said Collins. Collins is in support of cutting VA health care workers. He is a fake Jesus loving liar. He will need increased security\nArmy veteran.\nI listened to your comments on “making the VA more efficient”.\n70k job losses….are NOT the way you make the VA more efficient.\nMy suggestion? Check yourself into a VA mental ward.\nOoooh my mistake…the wait will increase from 6 months to 2 years to see a doctor with your cuts in VA.\nJust lunacy.\nWhy is the va allowed to use there own math when dealing with veterans disabilities I happen to be 100 percent disabled but va math makes it 70 percent to me this is a huge slap in the face of veterans who put there lives on the line then find out the very agency that is supposed to be helping veterans comes up with this formula I am not naive they use this tool to save money off the backs of those who have sacrificed themselves I would love to new secretary to address this issue.\nThanks\nSo please explain to me why I’m still a homeless veteran trying to deal with SSVF or VASH and human beings that should not be working in Customer Service or social work in Sacramento CA.\nJust saw this liar on PBS. “Veterans benefits aren’t being cut”.\nWhere does Trump find these dumb hicks to run his government?\nWho is this joker…?\nDOGE needs to focus on the top and work its way down. Why don’t they first look at how much The White House spends daily? Or why in 2000 we had a surplus and now in the trillions in debt. Hmm could it have been that we were in two conflicts for almost two decades. It was ridiculous the amount of money spent there. Why don’t they look at how much we spent on defense contracts all those years. Or maybe we increased our force during those times for the surges. Why haven’t we drawn down the force? It was done after Vietnam and first Gulf War. DOGE is focusing on making the rich richer and the poor poorer. I defended my country for 21 years active duty with multiple deployments. Is this what our country has become, full of lies from the top down? If each person in our Nation could do one kind act WE the people would become a Great Nation Again.\nHey 1sg, Newsflash, in 2000 the United states didn’t have a surplus. Check your facts before you spew bullshit.\nHow about you get the fact Cpt. Clueless.\nn 2000, the United States federal government had a budget surplus of $236.9 billion, the largest in U.S. history at the time. This was the third consecutive year of a surplus.\nDetails\nThe total revenue for 2000 was $2,025 billion, an increase of $197.7 billion from 1999\nThe total outlays for 2000 were $1,788.1 billion, an increase of $85.2 billion from 1999\nThe surplus was 2.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nThe surplus was the largest as a share of the economy since 1948\nOther budget highlights\nThe surplus was the result of the Clinton administration’s economic policies\nThe surplus was the result of a $363 billion reduction in the publicly held debt between 1998 and 2000\nThe surplus was the result of eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement\nAdditional information\nThe federal budget for 2000 was a spending request submitted by President Bill Clinton to fund government operations for the period from October 1999 to September 2000.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nIn your recent X post, you said the word duplicative. Please consider this: When a veteran is considered for benefits, the VA will send the member to a VA-sanctioned vendor to confirm the disability. Why do this when the member was already tasked to have a certified MD acknowledge the condition via a Nexus letter. Are the physician’s credentials, words, and signature stamps not worthy of acknowledgment of the condition?\nAnother cost-saving measure might be to allow retired members who utilize TRICARE Primary Managers (already sanctioned to care for veterans), as the determining authority. Adding a VA vendor to this process is duplicative since TRICARE Primary Managers are already vetted to care for retirees.\nTheir is a memo CNN obtained from your office requiring the firing of 70,000 DVA employees. That’s 20% of the DVA workforce. You stated, “concerns that Veterans’ benefits might be targeted for cuts”, “I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut”, “In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.” The memo is published and factual. How is removing the workforce by 20% improve healthcare services, compensations and pensions, the PACT ACT, DVA medical housing, suicide prevention, and other disabled veteran services. It takes 9 months to get an appointment with a neurologist in Tucson DVA. Veterans have died waiting for DVA appointments. Senator McCain took actions to improve the Tucson DVA by adding the doctors you want to fire. YOU LIE and must have no care for veteran services, just veteran service reductions. Prove me wrong with facts, not lies. I had lots of respect for Republicans, but not for the person, proven a liar by a court jury, guilty of 34 incidents of fraud appointing you as Secretary of DVA. I have no respect for the Republicans siding with fear of this fraudster. You too sides with the Fraudster with praise due to fear to stand up to the fraudster.\nNine months is too long to wait in order to be seen by a VA neurologist. I also would like to better understand how removing 70,000 to 80, 000 VA employees will lead to better care for veterans.\nI stopped believing you at CNN.\nI personally visited the Fredericksburg 3 VA Clinic in Fredericksburg, Virginia on 3 March 2025. It is a beautiful facility that was not adequately staffed. I was told that the lab would only be open until 2 pm and that none of the specialty providers were available at that location due to funding. Secretary Collins, I implore you to have the honor and morals to do the right thing for your fellow veterans. We are hearing you tell us that VA services are not being affected as we watch it happen in real time. You have a moral imperative to do the right thing for the women and men who have honorably served this country. I expect more of you than this.\nMy husband has enjoyed VA benefits for many years and I am glad to read in this article that benefits are not going to be cut. I believe this info needs to be published on every news channel over and over. The American veterans need to know for sure that their benefits are not going to be cut in this attempt to make our country more accountable in the spending that is done.\nPlease tell the people . The left media seems to be spreading false information about Care for our veterans.\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/192252/trump-lawyer-alina-habba-fired-veterans-arent-fit-job\nmy son was wounded in Iraq 2006,with TBI then MS. in a wheelchair, and went to Sneedville,Tenn. with a woman he married.

I was told died from MS> but I have alot of info. and statement from EMT. ,my son was left to starve to death. and I also found out more info. about other wounded . and us mothers call them “military maggots” who marry disabled vets for the funds. and I have dates ,times, and people who allowed my son to die this terrible way.

Dennis Keoki Cabanting served proudly ,only to die alone and neglected by so many\nAP article today 3/5/25 reports on an internal document outlining plans to fire 80,000 VA employees.\nAmerican veterans demand an explanation from Doug Collins.\nHow does this benefit veterans and their families?\nWhat services will be affected?\nHow will benefits be affected? How will they be “improved”?\nCan Doug Collins provide an explanation? Or is Doug Collins lying to veterans?\nhttps://www.wmtw.com/article/sen-angus-king-reacts-to-job-cuts-coming-to-veterans-affairs/64059551\nAs a 100% disabled vet (after a long 10 year battle) why does not the spouse get full benefits? They aren’t covered by the VA, they do not get Dental, they have to us ChampVA which alot of physicians do not take. Seems it would make alot of sense if they were covered just like the veteran is and could use the VA benefits he/she is entitled to. When you break it down, the spouse really doesn’t get benefits that are needed. Why is this:\nDefine faster. My 95 yr old mother is still waiting . Her case was filed for Aid and Attendance in Virginia in March 2024 and has been ” open ” since October 2024. It is now March 2025. Since she is over 85 , they were supposed to expidite it. I think they hope she will die first.\nGood day Secretary Collins, I got to say that something needs to be done to stop trump and maga. Tariffs! Really! The cost of living is already ridiculous. Folks working 2 or 3 jobs to make rent. I came from a Military family. My Dad, Brother and Myself. How can this person justify what he doing to us? Now he claims the flag is his. Bull Shit Sincerely. Alan Anderson\nI am pretty sure it has slowed down dramatically since Jan 20th. It was a 15 day turn around between steps, now its months before we see any movement.\nThe bva wing of the VA are full of unscrupulous lawyers and liers denying everything they can from veterans that need help the most. They don’t even try and hide their lies. It’s abysmal and this Collins fellow looks ominous and definitely insincere. He’s a lap dog for Trump. Good luck Vets\nHad hearing test at local VA add was told witch hearing aids I was getting and I told him I didn’t want that brand and he ordered them anyway. I told him again I didn’t want that brand and he said they are what I need and try them. Twice going back for adjustment and still ringing in my ears. Went back because the right one quit working. He said he would send it off for repair and once again I explained I didn’t want them. He said it’s been over six months and he couldn’t send them back. Once again I told him he should have done that on day one. He had no words. So now I have to go to Costco and get a new pair of what I want.\nI would like to see the VA look into the current practice of hosing the retired military on their disability payments. Any veteran who serves long enough to be eligible for disability gets the full amount tax free. if you are retiree, you get hosed out of the amount of your disability right out of your retirement payment. This inequjity applies to anyone with less than 50 pct disability. This is a capricious and wholly unfair practice referred to as the “VA waiver”. They take your money that you earned, with one hand and give it back to you as your oh so generous disability payment. The kicker is it is tax free. BFD. The standard deduction accounts for that if you are not filing long form. In the years since I retired in 1991 I have been stiffed out of several hundred thousand dollars by this asinine waiver. your reward for extra decades of service is to get hosed out of your actual disability by having it removed from your earned retirement. Bravo! If they overpay you for any reason on the disability side, they come after you as if it was not your own money in the first place. Honestly speaking, other than a slight tax advantage, there is NO disability for the military retiree should he fall under fifty percent. I would have more than my presenet 40 pct, but you can only fight them for so long before you just give up. Someone in power ought to look at the so called VA waiver and return fairness to those of us who served long and faithfully and are treated like second class citizens compared to those who did not stay til retirement and get the entire amount without any money coming out of their p;ockets.\nDear Mr. Secretary, At the VA here in Atlanta, they have a third party reviewing xrays. We used to be ale to view the reports and images on MyHealthEVet but now, we are unable to see either of those because of third party review. Those are our records and the y should be put into our records and allow us access to them so that we can see and understand what’s going on. If a third party is used, it must be made clear that the images and reports belong to the veteran and must be available for the veteran to have access to. Also, the VA uses some kind of strange mathematical formula to determine disability ratings. They like to brag about the fact that they aways err on the side of the veteran. That is an absolute lie. Can anything be done to change the formula that they use to determine ratings?\nDear Mr Secretary; I had a dental procedure done in Dec 2024,that I had to pay out of picket for. I mailed in the proper form 10-320 for reimbursement, with explanation and receipts. Today they are telling me I can appeal it. This isn’t how the President set community care. Go to any doctor pay for it and get reimbursed. Needs to be fixed! $1500. For a root canal.\nAre Vietnam vets claims given quicker consideration because of advanced age?\nAre Vietnam veterans claims addressed in a different manner than others? I.E. advanced age given more consideration?\nI am an 81 year old Vietnam veteran with 13 years military service (Infantry and Intelligence) and another 17 years working in DIA and the Old Soldiers Home.\nI know used car salesmen with better pitches than this. You should resign rather than allow several thousand VA employees to be summarily fired. It is hard for me to believe that you were a military chaplain. You are a disgrace to the uniform you wore and should be ashamed of yourself. Do the right thing and resign.\nToday March 2, 2025 White house Froze VA funding! I am deeply sad and just beyond words as to how horribly cruel it is of our own government to freeze funding for the VA.\nHas the President or his $ slashers stepped inside a VA hospital recently??? If they did they would witness many America Loving Veterans who have suffered severe atrocities of war or put their lives on the line for the benefit of all Americans to live safer lives. These same veterans are waiting and waiting and waiting for the serious medical care they need! They are all suffering in fear of dying in the hospitals because our government is showing a callous, uncaring temperament towards these hero’s!\nIt’s not just that many are in pain waiting for surgeries, it’s that the anxiety and panic amongst everyone, personnel included are at a high pitch!

That’s thousands of families suddenly without an income and millions of veterans carelessly put at risk.\nThis will mean longer waits for medical appointments, fewer VA home loans, more homeless veterans, longer claims, and worse PTSD support for vets in need. Of course, Trump isn’t just breaking our commitment to veterans for no reason. All of this chaos is an attempt to give a $2 trillion handout to billionaires .\nThat’s the Republican agenda in a nutshell: More for billionaires, less for vets.\nThis isn’t what people voted for.

Reading all these comments it is hard to understand when I took my job to heart and gave it my all. It is a shame that all of you have to play a waiting game. Gold Star Wife\nInstead of American Taxpayers being forced to thank Veterans for their “service”, Veterans should be forced to thank American Taxpayers for their money. Veterans are a fat and self-entitled class of government-dependent parasites whose very existence is unAmerican.\nYou pos you veterans are parasites? WTF are you talking about asshole us veterans put our lives on the line so you can live your cushy life.\nIt’s obvious you never served your country, you are probably on welfare sucking the tits of American taxpayers. You sir should fu$k off.\nMr. Bender, I do hope that you will be able to allow your anger to eventually dissipate and know that Veterans are citizens who chose to volunteer to enter military service. As a five year old child, I was sitting on my father’s lap watching President Kennedy giving his speech after taking the oath of office. I was struck by his presentation and especially when he said “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what can you do for your country”. President Truman served in WW1 as an Army Captain of artillery, his unit was in combat throughout the war in France, President Kennedy was the Commanding Officer (in the Navy) of the PT-109, in WW2 which was engaged in seek and destroy missions in the South Pacific. President Lyndon Johnson was a Navy Lieutenant Commander who served in Australia and the South Pacific during WW2. My father volunteered for the Army in 1950 and served in the Korean War as a Medic in the 23rd Infantry Regiment. He was in the invasion force that landed at Inchon; he was wounded three times in separate battles and was awarded the Bronze Star with’V’ for Valor in late 1952. He was a quiet Veteran and was simply a citizen who went to War as it was his duty to serve. He and the millions of other citizens that have served were all honorable individuals and your ugly statement demeans their sacrifices.\nRepublicans haven’t told the truth since president Ford.\nSomeone is bitter…..Thank you for your taxpayer money. It will help provide the much-needed medical care after putting our lives on the line for ungrateful people like you. People like you assume you’re safe and secure because you are in the United States, the police, the FBI, etc. are a barricade and will protect us. Let me ask you this, who protects them? What are they going to do when a military-like Russia’s or China’s attack us? Do you think the police are going to be able to stop them?? Negative my ungrateful friend it takes young men and women like the ones in our military and our veterans to take the fight to our enemies thus returning to keep America safe. So next time, instead of running your mouth and being bitter towards what our country and its citizens have promised to provide us for our willingness to put our lives on the line, say thank you and move on!\nMy dad’s va check. Is short 1900 dollars they told him that the program that pays him for at home help care is being cut? I want answers and another thing got cut also they told hi m it was an executive order\nGood video, although I don’t necessarily believe what he says about the press and Doge, and current VA actions certainly aren’t a positive for we veterans. In addition, your actions as a Representative and current actions by Trump & Doge certainly make me, and others question whether we can believe you. But for now, I certainly hope you’re right. If not, you’ll get this video sent right back with a remark that his word isn’t worth the space it occupies.\nDirector Collings is a joke; he doesn’t have a clue. The most recent round of cuts has impacted my VA healthcare in two ways. First, I was to have a laser ablation procedure in my throat in April. When I called the VA yesterday, I was told that the contract for the laser machine had been cancelled due to the Trump/Musk/ Collins initiative. (Several of the hospitals in the area have a lease agreement to share the machine to reduce the cost. Now the hospital is waiting to find out when and if the contract can be renegotiated.\nSecond, I have two VA compensation claims on hold evidently because the DOGE administration let go the workers who are assisting with the claims process.\nNow the administration has rescinded their idiotic decisions, but the damage is done.\nMy procedure is delayed, and my claims are further delayed.\nWhat the administration is doing is fraudulent and a disservice to our veterans.\nDenying and/or reducing benefits for which Vets have qualified- especially when they have been receiving those benefits and relying on them- is cruel and un-American. Equally cruel and unwise is curtailing of survivor benefits. Who will want to serve this country when all incentives to do so are removed entirely? Also, once the disability is designated, along with the qualifying percentage, and the Vet is receiving compensation from the VA, it is unconscionable to reduce or curtail compensation on which that Vet relies. I am aware that some Vet benefits appear to be windfalls. However when time served earning what is essentially a minimum wage is considered, this seeming “windfall” looks more like appreciation for service. In addition, I have to note that disparaging and smug comments, (made by Vets who are not experiencing problems with benefits), are inappropriate and not in accordance with the spirit of service. Sanguine comments that mock and dismiss the harm caused by indiscriminate denial of benefits to fellow Vets says a lot about the integrity of the commenter. I would not choose to be in a situation wherein I would have to, as a service member, rely on such an individual to honor their oath and commitment.\nYour extreme right views and support for all Trump’s wants and desires and your stint with Georgia’s 9th Congressional District, one of the most Republican districts in the country, belie your claim that no cuts will be made to the VA system. And your support of DOGE, claiming that they are doing exactly what is necessary is laughable. Rolling Stone reports: “Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins’ tenure is off to a rocky start. The former Georgia congressman and unapologetic Donald Trump loyalist began by releasing a series of videos assuring that “despite the rhetoric, there would be no cuts at VA.” These videos preceded two rounds of layoffs at the department — first, 1,000 employees, many of them veterans, and then another 1,400 last week. Notably, Collins was not being forced to make these cuts by Trump or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead, he appears to be slashing VA jobs simply to win favor with Trump and Elon Musk.”\nYou may not like Rolling Stone, but even the AP has reported: “VA pauses billions in cuts lauded by Musk as lawmakers and veterans decry loss of critical care. The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. ”\nI could quote many more news outlets, but you would simply falsely state they are all false claims. I give up.\n“Extreme right views” is all these veterans need to hear. You are a fake news consumer, aka Pravda Propaganda. Do some basic research. Your cognitive dissonance won’t let the facts in. Yes, the VA is notorious for their delay, deny and die ideology with it comes to veteran benefits. I’ve been fighting the VA for ten years. The battle continues. I will beat them at their own game.\nThe Democrat Communist Party Pravda Propaganda machine feeds us nothing except FEAR PORN. Fear is an emotional reaction. Using Critical thinking skills, logic and commonsense is the cure. Fight, Fight, Fight and win.\nMy heart goes out to Vets like Malcolm (who wrote on Malcolm February 28, 2025 at 09:01), and :\n“VA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at (Udon) Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof”.\nI am a registered nurse formerly employed by the VA. Meddling with the disability qualification requirements and percentages is CRUEL, SENSELESS, UNWISE, and just WRONG. If they are eliminated or reduced (and they should not be), then the Vets or their survivors whom are already qualified should not be denied the disability benefits earned and that they have been receiving. It is not wise to eliminate any of the few incentives for Americans to enter the military, as it is. They give life and limb. How can this be happening in the United States of America?\nThank you, Barbie Roelofs, for speaking out. At 74 that was devastating news. I’m sure all of these comments fall on deaf ears…\nWhat about Health programs?\nNot to be trusted. Trump will push him to eat his words. Especially since VA personnel are being disrespected and “fired” by the thousands.\nThank you Mr. Collins. May God Bless you in your job as new VA Secretary.\nWOW, what a used car salesman presentation\nKeep it up va I go to Hampton va for my\nTreatment and meds thanks\nFor the service sir no complaints and wife gets her champ va everything is great for her\nSir, I think you need to rescind your assurances that veterans benefits would not be cut.\nthe CBO is beating the drum again this year for reduction or elimination of va disability pay.\nThey do this annually and cause much angst among veterans.\nIt appears to me that if their scheme is enacted, it drive thousands of widows into poverty\nbecause of the loss of Total disability by their husband and concomitantly DIC.\nVeterans who have been receiving IU 100% for years have been unable to establish IRAs’\nand other retirement instruments. They are unable to work. They also are uninsurable\nfor life insurance because of their disabilities.\nI voted for Donald Trump, I can say factually that the veterans community are re-thinking\ntheir decision. I am 100% p/t from Vietnam. There is a tidal wave coming, these ill advised\nproposals will pave the way for the Democrats to retake the house and senate.\nI can state unequivocably that if these idiotic actions become reality I will be changing parties.\nIs this really what these bureaucrats want for disabled veterans\nLOL. Trump worked hard for over eight years to tell the world that he would dismantle everything great about America. Real Americans warned you a thousand times. You failed America with your votes for Trump. Own it.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at Udorn Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof\nImagine your 1SG letting another 1SG come into your company and discharging Soldiers at will. Collins let Musk do that. Proof that Collins won’t even protect his own workforce for the benefit of veterans.\nImagine your 1SG sucking up to the CSM like Collins sucks up to Trump.\nSecretary Collins … I would like to apologize, sir, for the need to say what I am about to say. Simply stated, I do not believe a word you said. On the one hand, with only a month on the job, you have not had a lot of time to prove your loyalties. On the other hand, we all know your reputation and, to be frank, do not believe for one minute that your priorities and loyalties are to the Veterans who defended our country and whose sacrifices have made your job possible in the first place. On behalf of millions of American Veterans, living and dead, I challenge you to prove to us, in the same way that we have proven our loyalty to our country, that you intend to be loyal to us. That’s it in a nutshell. Forgive me again, sir, but now the ball is in your court. History will record for all time where your loyalties lie.\nI second what John Washbush said here 100 percent. History and The Lord both will record your actions!\nMr Secretary Collins, I would like to extend my sincere THANK YOU to Ms. Grace Brumley, from the International Direct Deposit Team, VA Regional Office 351 – Muskogee, OK, for solving the 14 month long delay in my payments by getting Electronic Transfer rather than paying by checks being issued by the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Office https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/\nMs. Grace Brumley exemplified your challenge to ” focus relentlessly on customer service and convenience” and I hope that your office will recognize her efforts to “solve REAL PROBLEMS” being faced by Veterans in receiving payments or other services we have earned.\nThank you!!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nStop doing videos and stand up to Trump and tell us what you’re doing instead of on a video. I do not trust this.\nWhy aren’t you doing press conferences instead of videos? These one-way videos make it seem like the director is afraid soemone will ask questions and demand real data.\nWhy are they firing most researchers ones that are in the middle of studies that was already paid fo outside the VA makes no sense and all was to try and help the veterans i thought that was your job to help the veterans i was in the hospital on the 24 th. And everyone was scared about having a job if you think that helps the veterans your wrong and i voted for trump.\nWelcome to the Find Out stage of FAFO.\nWhy is the VA not properly paying its Community Care Providers, specifically Therapeutic Massage. We took a 24% rate cut in October of 2023 in the middle of the worst inflation we have ever seen. This caused many providers to cancel their contracts and others to reduce the number of veterans served. This action is directly responsible for the suffering of our Veterans. Please fix this problem!\nVA Secretary Collin’s ….DOGE= Dog “Shit”…They are cutting essential Personnel, How are us as Veterans suppose to get the care we need when the VA Facilities & Community Care are empty…..These are some of the most dangerous & corrupt cuts that ever could happen…..Rag-Bag Elon Musk(not even From our United States)..?? You need to explain yourself Sir, when you say you agree what (So called DOGE) is doing or are you committed to standing up for myself & my Brothers & Sisters (Veterans)…these cut @ VETERAN AFFAIRS… Secretary Collin’s has done nothing to speed up anything (except THE AGENDA) Veterans want “REAL ANSWERS” not the Politically Correct answers…..Our Veterans Employees deserve better than this Crazy Shit that is happening to them & thier Families….Lead,Follow or get out of the way!!!\nListening the emotional outbursts of liberals are annoying and bothersome. Grow up do some research.\nWhy are the VA facilities empty?\n“Collins said he would seek to bring more employees into the office rather than allowing them to telework, though he noted he was bound by collective bargaining agreements that represent 80% of the VA workforce. He similarly pledged to follow labor contracts and all other legal processes when seeking to fire more department staff, though he said he would ultimately not be restricted in getting rid of malfeasant workers. “\nThe VA demeans veterans when it does not permit admission into the VA medical system because of an income above some low level.\nI hope Doug can help with the LOGIN.GOV over reach of Veterans personal information. I’m absolutely disgusted with the VA as it pertains to that, specifically!\nThe VA is indeed clearing cases faster than before, but only because they are declining more than ever. Veterans hospitals are not improving, they are getting worse, The VA hospital I attend is very short handed on doctors and I learned yesterday that 2 more of our really good doctors are leaving the VA. Loosing Doctors and the hiring freeze is causing a 2 to 4 month wait to get an appointment. I applied for counselling at my VA due to depression and am having to wait almost 2 months to see a councilor. I have been fighting for my VA disability since 2010 and am still being denied. I can truly understand why Veterans commit suicide.\nNot worried about privacy info being exposed. After all, Equifax was hacked to the tune of 143 million citizens, so it figures that all of my info is already floating around the dark web somewhere!\nYour living in a friggin dream world!!! The VA in both NJ and wills Barre have done everything and did DESTROY\nMy ability to pass any background check by leaking out flat out toxic gaslighting lies all were from a fake woman rep 1 when I used to live in Jersey and now in wills Barre pa both were not related to each other but the pa VA hates vets so much when I applied for my PTSD and my broken bones from army they will call either 2 things “Nutzo or slutz”!! They deliberately infected me with a toxin from a surgical instrument in wills Barre pa and made me so ill I couldn’t even walk! The top brass gives orders to make sure you don’t get your benefits and if they find out you got them before admin finds out they litterly make sure you never go there again, so I tried waiting 2 years and went to one in upstate NY not only did they tried to lie to me, they wanted a surgery to go to the Bronx NYC for the dental surgery that would “take months” to recover when I said you know how can I have surgery when there is no teeth to pull? I knew the last wills Barre didn’t pay the community care dentist and I had to call a congressman to get the va to pay the dentist that and I’m guessing did not sit well with the top brass in Willsk Barre so a vendetta was made without my knowledge, so it’s a good guess that they want to give you the same dental treatment that John Gotti got in prison. The gov gave him cancer in a dental filling, and that’s what I’m guessing they have tried to do to me, this was a warning for me never to go back to Any Va!!! Willsk Barre is run like the Mafia.!!!!\nRep Collins , I not writing this to complain about the service of care providers in our community but, lol I have one small issue that we don’t have a VA hospital in Anchorage or Fairbanks,Alaska. I am lucky enough to be able to go to Chief Andrew clinic in Fairbanks and just to let you know I have received the best care I have ever received from VA. My issue is if I go to the VA clinic it’s over a damn computer and a nurse doing everything a Dr is supposed to do to help me. I don’t know how you feel about having to sit and talk to a doctor over a computer. When just down the street I get to see a doctor in person and God as my witness I can say that I have never been seen and treated like I’m a King ever time. We’re wasting our money on a clinic that works over a computer and I don’t see why we should pay for that kind of treatment. I would like to see that my fellow Veterans get the same treatment that I do thank you for listening to me. Per capital we have more veterans than any other state. Thanks Ron\nMr Collins , you are saying one thing , but in reality you do the opposite. I do not trust you, along with other veterans. You are allowing VA employees to be fired, possible changes in healthcare and disability. Whenever there are budget cuts, veterans are the first on the chopping block. Veterans do not want a yes man for the current administration. We want someone that will fight for us. We have earned every damn VA benefit. The current administration could care less about us. Trump is allowing an unqualified and unelected man to make decisions about the VA programs. Musk is the hit man for Trump and they are destroying everything that we know. You are either for veterans or you are not. Find your spine, voice and protect veterans. We have served our country through wars and conflicts. It is your responsibility to fight for us. Freedom is not free.\nGreat to that we got a Secretary that cares about Veterans. Let’s see if he’ll get us more than an annual 1-2% COLA increase. Congress goes and proposes a 40% pay increase for themselves and only about 10% served in the armed forces defending our country and the citizens of it.\nSome of us are deemed unemployable and struggle paycheck to paycheck. Like myself.\nI honestly don’t believe, or trust you.\nAs a Trump loyalist, your true allegiance is not to us, the veterans, but rather to the President.\nFrom your previous term, you should be well versed on the “Concurrent Pay” issue.\nWhy hasn’t this been taken care of. Even (then) Sen. Harry Reid made it his FIRST bill submission. It always gets buried.\nI was ripped off for half my 30 years of disabled retirement. When I received $400 for disabiliy, my meager enlisted retirement check was struck with a $400 deduction.\nPresident Lincoln established Concurrent Pay to help the enlisted soldier. It also was meant to put the responsibility of disabled Officers (then Aristocrats) on themselves. This is no longer close to fair today (although I have no idea why an officer gets 2-5 times more than this combat/retired/disabled Green Beret).\nShow us what you are made of. You should be our Governor or Senator. I hope you are the man I think you are.\nLead the charge, Sir!!! I have no dog in this fight as I’m now 100% (after a 29 year fight). But, our Brothers in Arms don’t deserve this.\nAnd, if President Trump wants to give away money, skip the people who won’t work and slide it over to us who have been screwed and fighting with our finger nails to get a fair shake. Otherwise, take care of the brothers behind me.\nGod Bless\nDe Oppresso Liber\nHe is correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nI am dating a 78 year-old veteran and I am 72 and all we do is argue because I’m a Trump supporter and he is not any throws in my face that this morning the president said he was going to cut the veterans benefits. What can I say back to him to quit listening to the fault narratives that are on the news but he said that Trump said it so can you clarify it for me?\nTell him that his statement is, as labeled by the great Gen. Swartzkoff…. “bovine scatology!” LOL! Just a thought! :D\nI’m a veteran and this administration has declared war on us… WHY?\nDo I believe that Collins has any control over the matter???…Hell No! Anyone who sits across the table from this president or Elon Musk will toe the line of the administration’s conjured up policies, regardless of whose lives they destroy. Wise up, and don’t be a party to this foolishness, Mister Collins.\nMy experience with the VA is that of honest people attempting to do their best with little time, resources, and management support. I pity them, but wholeheartedly thank and respect their dedication to. the cause.\nYou obviously don’t know Mr. Collins. He doesn’t cower to anybody. He shut down the Trump Impeachment with his legal prowess.\nYour experience with the VA is similar to mine, except I find several persons hanging around with seemingly nothing to do.\nI pray that God Almighty creates a special place in hell for anyone that wants to privatize the VA.\nDO you support the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025’s framework for restructuring, reducing and taking benefits and disability ratings from the veteran community ? Please answer this question.\nEnough of the Fake News lies: Project 25 is from a private organization. It has nothing to do with President Trump. Do some basic research.\nWill health care professionals be let go? The VA has made vast improvements in last 10 years or so. I was dealing with the medical issues. The whole operation seemed to be chaotic. Nobody would return phone calls. Sometimes there would be a neurologist on staff. Other times the nearest neurologist was in Buffalo. You never knew what to expect. I really dreaded dealing with the VA. I’d have to drive to the VA to get information or prescriptions or to get a simple question answered. Those days are over. Please don’t let them come back. You’ve made such great improvements. The VA has a new facility here (ROPC). I’ve had the same medical team for eight or so years now. The staff is friendly and concerned about my health. My meds arrive on time. And other vets I’ve talked with feel the same way. I can’t adequately express how much the VA has improved. The care I receive at the VA is better than civilian care (they seem to be going down hill). Please don’t let the VA slip back into chaos\nI was notified by my local VA that community care service is being eliminated. I had to cancel my next appointment. They said I could either go to the community care but then could not go to the VA. That doesn’t make sense. Now I have to drive an hour and a half to my closest VA instead of 2 blocks to local hospital. Also some of my appointments\nare further apart due to staff reductions??\nAlso since Trump started all of the funding cuts my medication deliveries have been stopping and I am constantly calling to straighten. Out the mess. Things just seem to not be working smoothly anymore.\nIn no way do I trust the current CIC, any of his appointees, and certainly not the “DOGE”. Looking for inefficiencies in all Federal government agencies is certainly a necessary endeavor, napalming those agencies is unacceptable and un-American.\nThey cut my benefits\nWhat? Are you kidding?\nWhat benefits were cut?\nExplain your situation, my benefits have not been touched. I don’t know where everyone is lying about their benefits being touched. Can you please give more details\nI got my disability cut from what they say is from 100% to 90% from apllying for the pact act and got cut from over $3800 to $2297 starting March 2025 and talking about going down to just over $2200 and wished I never put in for the fraud Pact Act to give others our money and I’m going to be homeless and starved to death and Unemployable that’s the thanks for our service is all we get and they hope we die before we get to 100% and decrease it. Just like the cadence says “they give you a hundred dollars and take back 99. I’m telling my grandchildren stay out of the military from grandad’s expeirience until they get the benefits right without the paper chase beuracracy\nYou didn’t know the Pact Act was a setup to do exactly what they did to you? If you were already 100% WHY did you file another claim??????\nYeah, you are a complete idiot for touching your claims after already having 100%\nThis is a sad day when people are on here rooting for this idiot from Georgia who is part of the problem. The Trump administration just fired the company that cleans the surgical tools in the operating room before they operate on a veteran they also just let go of the company who checks the radiation on the MRI and X-ray machines to make sure the veterans don’t get too much radiation. But some of you are on here praising this man they’re trying to sell the headquarters of the VA lol but they can actually sell the Federal building but they tried. And I see a couple people in their talking about give the man a chance you guys are pathetic. Cutting $80,000 jobs when the VA was already struggling and then you have somebody that is actually showing you they want to take veterans out anybody that voted for this crap is getting what they deserve.\nWhy is a company called Veterans Evaluation Services being used ? It has been my experiences with them to be a waste of time and “our” money ! All they have ever done is look at my VA records and confirm that my records are valid ! I’m sure that my 12 year old Grandson could do the same thing if I gave him access to my files ! And welcome aboard Secretary Collins !\nI really hope that I don’t get cheated as I been for 13 years, with concussion that has caused me demihelanation of brain,chronic high\nblood pressure, sleep apnea, seizures when anxiety is elevated and many others secondary disabilities.i have been unemployable since 2009 and not rated.\nI applied for an increase in my disability rating on 6/10/24. Since then I have received requests for employment info that I have responded to. However it seems I am in a loop without end. I respond and then receive another request, then I respond again. I feel that this is a delay tactic to avoid making a decision. It is frustrating to say the least. I hope with the leadership change with the VA that this can be resolved. I have always been grateful for the care I received through the VA, and by and large have been very pleased with the level of care its provided.\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new appointment. My husband was a veteran. He was shot in the head in Vietnam. He was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The VA took care of him for 55 years. Several years ago, a CT scan was done, and we found that injury took 50% of his brain. The VA paid for his rehab, education and ALL of his care. They even helped me through many difficult times. They hired him as an Educational Therapist and later as Prosthetic & Sensory Aid Services Representative. He was employed for many years and retired in 2000. We both felt that if he had been taken care of in the private sector he would not have survived near as long. The multidisciplinary team approach plus the knowledge related to veterans’ long problem lists allowed him to survive the 55 years. I realize there is waste in the VA and the waste needs eliminated. However, do not let anyone eliminate the system. It was certainly a blessing for him and me. Thank you.\nWhere is the waste? Elon Musk will gut everything and ask forgiveness later. You cannot encourage the reckless behavior of billionaires who have never known hardships. They don’t care what they cut as long as the number is big.\nYou are correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nActually I think you are a communist spy, trolling this site and spreading propaganda and lies, like a good little comrade. Please go take your cut and paste post and shove it.\nBottom line, a Vietnam draft dodger and a corporate welfare foreign national (the latter unelected) running and destroying our government and thus our country that we here lived and in some cases died for.\nSir, please don’t cave in to the spoiled Brat Billionaires who never served and don’t give one shit about us veterans. Anyone that calls POWs loosers can rot in hell – yes I’m talking about Captain Bonespurs Trump, he said that, check tape.\nI can only pray that current VA leaders have the spine and backbone that politicians left at the door.\nI am a 1980s Cold Warrior till I die, and you poster are in fact a commie if you support a Putin, Xi, Kim loving president.\nAnd I call BS on your post. It simply isn’t true, and you are probably a Russian spawed bot anyhow.\n(yea, Musk isn’t even a real American, he’s from South Africa and only naturalized in 2002, holds citizenship in 3 different countries, so yea, where does his allegiance lay?)\nThank you for the information, transparency and congratulations on your appointment. I’m a veteran, but also a proud spouse of a VA employee (also veteran). I’m hopeful that in the coming days you and your leadership team will be providing transparency to VA employees and staff so we can anticipate any future changes. I know the situation is changing daily and quite fluid and I’m sure we aren’t the only family looking forward to this information. We appreciate what you are trying to do. Best wishes.\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 1,955 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans and veterans. This situation we are living through can be overcome but we must work together, remember our discipline and memories of how we work together as a team even in the most dire of situations. We must hope and expect the best from our current chain of command as our success or failure is coalescent on their decisions and actions. Health, fortitude, peace and humor as we navigate these next few years but above all optimism that things will work out.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nHey Santos, you going to be so polite when your orange Jesus deports you?\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new job. I see all these comments and veterans are confused and need their questions answered. I see Kirt Love postings and he has many unanswered questions that need your support. Why doesn’t someone from your office get back to Kirt Love for some real questions to get answered. Please follow up. Ed Bryan\nCongratulations Mr. Collins on your appointment and your transparency. I receive excellent care all throughout the VA – way better than civilian care. Now, to all the negativity a select few continue to post – We are all proud that President Trump is back (I repeat, BACK!) in the White House.\nNo, we are not all proud that white supremacists who want to end the Constitution are back in the oval. You sure don’t speak for me nor millions of other patriots who want to PRESERVE the Constitution.\nI’m dealing with a really bad case of bone spurs. LOL\nGuess what over 50% of the people working at the VA are not Veterans, they don’t even know what a Veteran has done for this country, their families. You work somewhere, your boss ask or the book keeper as what you did that week before you get paid. Hey you can tell them and will tell them to keep your job. Realize that a lot of people took advantage of the virus, stopped going in to work, but continued to get paid by the taxes you and I pay to the government, then got another job or moved to an foreign beach and send in work by computer if at all. Notice how you can’t get anyone to answer the Phone. Wake up, they need to go and only those who care and want to work should be kept.\nI wrote to you last week, I have been a claims agent accredited for years 20 or so. The problem is here in Arizona Doctors are needed in community care. However, a chiropractor in Camp Verde put his application in again to help and was turned down and not answered as to why, he has to be creditionaled only by one company and that company want you to pay them and you have to take all of the insurances they have or you can’t be part Of them. Kick back in sure. For all of central and no. As there is one chiropractor. This is wrong and should be checked. Verde Valley Family Chiropractor Kyle French was at one time signed with VA, but stopped working for a while family diffaculties. Now they won’t let him help. Hope you can find out the problem. All doctors and nurses are needed in this area and across the country.\nI watched the video several times and all I heard was “the media is telling you things I don’t like. Well, nuh-uh!” but in a folksy voice.\nAgreed. What a waste of hot air.\nThe Veterans Health Administration is America’s largest integrated health care system, providing care at 1,380 health care facilities, including 170 medical centers and 1,193 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (VHA outpatient clinics), serving 9.1 million enrolled Veterans each year.\nI suspect that many of the negative, fear-mongering comments here are people with memory deficits. As a caregiver of a 100% disabled Veteran since Vietnam era, I have seen the VA rise and fall with each administration. I distinctly remember the previous short 4-years under the first Trump administration as being a breath of fresh air after the Obama administration’s middle finger to Veterans. By the end of his first term, President Trump had managed to clear the backlog, get enough doctors and medical specialists hired and streamlined the process of getting care. https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-putting-veterans-first/ Within just a few months of Biden in charge, it went right back to the boondoggle of the pre-Trump years.\nThe VA is a HUGE beaurocracy with multiple layers of services for every type of veteran from WWII to present. If you expect the system to change in 30-days, you’re only kidding yourself. You can yell or you can do something. Every county is represented by a Veteran’s Service Officer. Every county is represented by both State and US Congressmen and Congresswomen. Most, but not all, VA employees serve veterans and will do everything possible to assist you with information, processes and procedures, communications and expectations. If you’re not a jerk, one or all of these avenues are open to you. Even if you are a jerk, most will still try to help deserving veterans and their families.\nDoug Collins and Donald Trump have been elected to try to straighten out the mess once again. Work with them instead of against them and you will see a dramatic improvement once the waste, fraud, abuse and red tape of previous administrations are cleared out of the way. They truly do need to “clean house” at VA to make room for dedicated people with the will, training and dedication to help with this mission. There are a lot of them but we need 100% mission-driven patriots from the front door to the top floor and no slackers need apply.\nIn what bizarre world is A Vietnam War draft dodger who badmouths POWs, Veterans, even service members killed in a helicopter accident, a patriot???\nOh, and his buddy Musk isn’t even a real American. He’s an immigrant from South Africa naturalized in 2002, look it up. So yea, also not a patriot.\nThey are both self-serving billionaires with billionaire cronies, who don’t give two shits about Vets. That means you Reader, regardless of which party you vote for. These guys are gonna screw you in a heartbeat.\nHow can you tell a republican is lying? His lips are moving.\nCollins may believe he’s telling the truth but as soon as Con Man Trump determines the time is right, he’ll screw all veterans. You should expect nothing less from the draft dodger. And when he does change his mind, Doug Collins will be right there kissing the ring and do nothing to support veterans. It’s almost like I can see the future – right Doug.\nAs a veteran enjoying the benefits I earned after serving for over 32 years I can personally attest to how great The Community Care program is for when I need care that’s not offered at my local clinic. This program was introduced during President Trump’s first term. I can also remember how bad the VA was during former President Obama’s administration whenever I attempted to get care. Thankfully I had healthcare insurance through my civilian job. May I ask if you’re a veteran? If so, what has been your experience?\nYou may want to research that further. It’s so tiresome that people are always looking in the rearview mirror to vilify past leadership in an effort to elevate the current traitor, even if it is a lie. Pres. Obama signed it into law!\nThe “program started in 2014 following a scandal over wait times at Veterans Affairs facilities. The program was created through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill that was signed by President Barack Obama.”\nFact Check: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-veterans-free-health-care/\nFact Check: https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trump-veterans-choice-program/\nGlad to hear you are having a good experience and it is working well for your healthcare needs; however, it is not the same for everyone, everywhere.\nWhere I currently live it is not efficient. Females are farmed out to the community for basic healthcare, and the claims are routinely denied for stupid reasons, regardless of an authorization. Community care is limited to a monopoly healthcare system, and Veterans are not always treated with kindness or respect. The whole community care program is also untimely.\nFor example, getting a mammo or other female care should not require multiple intermediaries to get an auth and schedule the care. Furthermore, if a mammo is abnormal, and follow-up is required with further films or an ultrasound, etc. It’s back to waiting for the process, again.\nThat said, if I receive an unfortunate diagnosis and need to navigate community care program for cancer care, etc., it would be a nightmare. In my line of work, I saw what Veterans had to deal relative to unpaid community care claims, etc. The process could definitely be streamlined.\nNOTE: Any misogynists or sexists who feel the need to make negative comments about female Veterans can keep them. I’ve already heard it, seen it, and experienced it for years.\nThank you for setting it straight. I get so tired of hearing what Trump has done when it iks just an extension of Obamas work and I have been in VA care the whole time so I have experienced it personally\nI know of a lady who works for the Social Security. She told my wife that on the horizon are works in place so that we have to choose between SSN and our Veterans benefits. Maybe this is a rumor started in house to provoke us to behave badly. I trust my government, and that this is just a silly rumor perpetrated by opponents of our duly elected president.\nDoge is not a government entity. I insist that you stop working with a bunch of criminals.\nThey are not vetted or have security clearances. They are a bunch of egomaniac punks.\nDodge serves as the pleasure of the President. Legal\nAt the pleasure of a convicted felon, lifelong grifter, and someone convicted of sexual assault. Why would I trust him?\nThe predator in chief serves at the pleasure of an incompetent nepo baby. Clear the GOP lies from your ears and look at what’s in front of you. Donald Trump doesn’t care about you and never will. Elon Musk comes from a family of billionaire emerald mine owners who were literally proud members of the nazi party.\nI cannot believe how easily so many of you gave our country to a bunch of billionaire oligarchs who are cozying up to mass murdering dictators. Victor Orban, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un were the only people voting against the UN resolution condemning Putins illegal invasion of Ukraine, and your idiot president joined them.\nCongrats Mr. Secretary\nWould you please consider the letter on Panama Veterans submitted by 34 members of congress to identify Panama Veterans under the Pact Act/\nHe is lying.\nSenators (all Rep except Hawley from\nMO) rejected an amendment to the budget outline proposed on February 20.\nThe amendment brought by a Democratic senator I believe From Connecticut requested the VA healthcare funding be at the same level. It is now to not reduce those levels in the new budget. It was rejected by all, except that one Republican senator. All the Democrat senators and the independence voted for the amendment. They want funding for veterans healthcare to at least stay where it is now and to not be cut.\nA lot of people claim to be for the military and for veterans but when it comes down to it, they are not. They are for lining their own pockets. Rolling Stone has a great article about how doge has not found fraud in the VA all they’ve done to save money as fired, doctors nurses office workers and things like that.\nGoing to pitch a idea for everyone coming here. Instead of you posting once\nand walking away, look for others you share similarities and unite.\nVA does not want any of you to rally. They want you to remain individuals\non here and bicker. That way they can claim there is no common interest\nand nothing to answer.\nBest possible place to try: Change.org and set up a petition of things you all\nwould support. Single idea, easy to agree on. Dont write a book, Get the\nfirst or second idea running with a few thousand on board. Then VA cant\nignore you. Like “Open door policy at VA”.\nRight now, they just want to see who the loudest people are to ignore. This\nis a test bed on who to turn away or frustrate. Even the service groups. These\nfolks want to rule by keeping you all “Armies of one” No matter how good the\nidea, VA only responds to numerical support – angry mob.\nBeen doing this 28 years, watched what hasnt worked. Been pitching this to\nadvisory committee to bypass there own deadlocks. You only have to be a team\nfor that one idea folks. Regardless of personality.\nOther wise, sec of VA Doug Collins is going to ignore every one of you. He is\nalready doing that with me. All talk, same old song and dance as the others.\nIts easier than you think folks. Commit to a idea, and unite on it.\nI just got my second denial letter for VA referred community care since there are no in-house women’s programs where I live. As a 100% disabled vet, I’m once again a subpar citizen simply because I don’t have male genitalia. I get to bleed to death from a military related injury. Thanks guys!\nHi, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance.\nI agree!!! Same here! I don’t even bother to get female care anymore because it is an effing nightmare! Every time I was sent to the community, it was denied and not paid, regardless of a prior auth. Optum is notorious for denying payment even after they give an auth. I finally escalated it, with all the receipts, and nothing.\nHow many current and planned positions have already been lost since January 20th?\nHow many families have uprooted to move for a promised position only to have it canceled since January 20th?\nCan you explain why a pharmacist can change the dosage of medication prescribed by a heart specialist?\nSeems a bit strange.\nCongratulations on your new job. I am happy to know that you were selected for this job. I know that you will do great for us veterans.\nFor years democrats have controlled the VA. Now that President Trump and his team are in charge, democrat vets are singing the same disrespectful songs of the fake news radicals. (See comments) Secretary Collins has been in office for less that two weeks and they are already saying he is a failure. For God’s sakes men, give him a chance. The entire administration has only had a month to improve things, and the improvements in every area are significant. God bless you, President Trump, and your entire team. AMERICA FIRST!!!\nBernie Sanders and President Biden have done fine jobs on helping veterans but you want to believe a draft dodging LOSER and his lies over actual proof of those first 2 men obviously supporting veterans. I mean you do remember that President Biden had a son in the military he lost? All of DJT family dodged serving their countries, even his granddaddy first immigrated here to dodge his country, Austria’s draft to come here. You do know that means every time he dodged his draft other men were selected to go in his place? You’re worship of one of the most greedy money hungry loving conman actually makes me sick. You’re the type to have joined a hunting party to go after escaped slaves before and during the Civil War, just reading your comment tells me a lot about the type of person you really are. Probably joined the military to get to kill more than animals too, well I joined to help defend my country and to get more education and to travel the world and learn about different cultures etc\nShut down the VA go to medicare. I’ve been waiting for a consult for 3 months and no one can say why. They have lost some of my records when they can find any. Doing away with the VA is not cutting benefits. I can almost write a book of the disrespect and l ack of care I’ve received from the VA. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/\nAMEN!!! EXCELLENT reply, Ron!!\nI only hold them to the promises they made. No one forced them to claim they would lower groceries on Day 1, they said that . I say hold them to it or they lied for your vote and you still back them? Sad\nYou people are the biggest bunch of crybaby whiners I’ve ever seen. Not a positive comment in the bunch of you about what good the VA does; just complaints and “give me more”. Try a little gratitude for what good comes your way from the VA instead of all this entitled bull**\nEntitled? Are you even a veteran or just commenting to be a good little DT bootlicker? You do realize that some of these people have been waiting for decades to be able to get benefits like healthcare that they need in order to be alive? I know this one guy that said he’d fought for 20 years because he had to dump toxic waste for the military, but he lied about his age to join and they did something with his service record and he’s got witnesses etc but they’ll literally wait them out to death so they don’t have to pay out\nRoger That, Doug!!! It’s really difficult to believe that most of these brainwashed, Crybaby Whiners could have ever served our Republic with service in our Armed Forces!!!\nGood soldiers are not afraid to ask questions. Some of the people that you are censoring may have a question that you did not think of to answer. Stop badmouthing these heroes who are exercising the right that they fought for.\nThis sounds like the same attitude that our Vietnam Veterans received after the war when years later we found that their complaints were real.\nWell Doug (Collins), is this how you treat disabled Veterans. As “crybaby whiners”. This is why you should be last to be the Sectary of DVA. You finally responded to my request to view these complaints. “Not a positive comment in the bunch of you” makes you look like the biggest “crybaby whiners”.\nThe comments I made are relative to the community care process, not the VA care. The VA has provided excellent care and is my preference. My providers are outstanding and caring and very professional. Unfortunately, the facility doesn’t provide a lot of female care.\nOf course, this will be a reason for misogynists and sexists to vilify female Veterans.\nMy dad died in a VA hospital because of a lack of human resources. He sat in the ER for over 6 hours missing his medical golden window to survive and then spent 30 days in ICU with sepsis where he died. Veterans like my father deserve THE BEST.\nSo why, are so many veterans being intimidated about what they’re doing at their job. So excuse me for not believing a word you say, because you don’t really know it’s not you, is that criminal in the White House Trump and his pet muskrat, that will destroy veterans lives. It already has disrupted them by forcing them to answer by Monday night. I know a lot of veterans at the v. A, that I confused disturbed about what’s going on.So what do you have to say about that\nThank you for the comment. There are plenty of videos and quotes proving how little the current administration cares about veterans and anyone really\nRight on, Thomas! We have a right to ask questions. When I was an NCO, whenever a commander got in front of us for questions, I threw my hand up and encouraged my soldiers to do the same. Let’s keep doing the same thing. We are not a bunch of mindless infants. We are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that answered the call. Ain’t scared of nothin’!\nThe 1991 agent orange Bill was pass for all Vietnam Veterans that had agent orange Health Problems. in 2002 the V.A said had boot on ground. Congress passed Years later to 12 miles off shore. Many Vietnam Veterans server pass 12 miles but are got agent orange and toxions . Please help us to get the back to the Vietnam service medal like it was in the 1991 agent orange bill for all Vietnam Veterans with Health Problems. Please help us. we are dieing out that need Benefits. that had got Bad Health Problems.

To vote for someone who has absolutely no integrity ,releases criminals from prison because they adore him , which is what he believes we all should do . Because after all he is the king . Money and power for him and his rich supporters is his agenda . The rest of us be damned . Shame on all of you!!\nI’m appalled by this gaslighting and it was a Democratic President that passed the PACT act and has helped veterans immensely and because his son was a veteran, President Biden obviously cared a great deal about us veterans, especially those of us who were disabled. I also remember Senator Bernie Sanders a liberal,(Independent/Democrat) doing a wonderful job when the VA was struggling with backlog by years and even decades in some cases. I myself am still struggling at 70% when they stole my silver fillings and replaced them with the then new composite crap that’s cured with a blacklight. The 70% is for the agoraphobia they caused but they also caused PTSD and aggravated all of the previous to my service, mental health disorders. I feel like they tried to make me a mindless thing they could control and the programming failed if I was 1 of 5 from my squadron all in the hospital the night of the Air Force’s Airman’s Ball with the 17th Commander of the Air Force attending (his wife started the digitized blue, white and gray in all shades ? BDU idea, like people don’t need to “blend” into sky, they’ll be seen, duh ???) for trying to end our lives early. Yeah I know I’m giving to much personal information but it’s partly due to my manic phase I’m in right now.\nHow anyone would trust a man who was well known not to pay his contractors, cheated on all 3 of his wives as an unrepentant adulterer after he vowed to honor and cherish them, lusted after his own daughters (there’s plenty of interviews that are cringe AF with him describing baby Tiffany’s rack size and legs being like Marla’s and the Katie Johnson interview describing her looking like Ivanka and he made her wear a blonde wig when she was with him and to wear gloves so she couldn’t get any DNA from him because he had to see them get destroyed after use, he was careful not to leave behind evidence and she was a Epstein girl and happened to be close to his daughter in age at the time, he also stole her purity according to her account of their last meeting) and y’all think he didn’t and doesn’t LIE to y’all EVERY SINGLE TIME he opens his yuge gaping mouth?\nSir, what you described is literally what the Biden administration and democrats did. President Trump and Mr. Collins have only been in office for weeks, doing more that Biden did in four years. Shouldn’t we wait and give them a chance to set things right again, or are we going to continue to allow our feelings to dictate blame without facts? Personally, I am very confident that President Trump and his cabinet members will do everything in their power to correct what is wrong and then build it back better. Because the majority of the voting population to include a lot of the Democratic legislation are finally acknowledging how criminally unjust he was treated during his first term and are now supporting him. Don’t you think its time to trade our feelings in for observable merit-based accomplishments?\nNO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT CONCURRENT BENEFIT DOUBLE STANDARD …. VETERANS WHO EARNED BOTH DESERVE BOTH\nMr. Secretary,\nYou are not telling the truth; Veteran’s Administration staff are being terminated by email. You know this, if you really stand behind every veteran then you also need to be standing behind every VA staff member who has been terminated by the weakness and constant lying of Donald Trump. Every veteran served by the VA has been on the front line, in harm’s way they trusted the soldier, the marine, the airman, and the sailor next to them. It is time that you not only step forward, that you step up and call out the ignorance that this coming from the White House.\nVeterans have paid the IRS federal & State taxes for many years. I have paid taxes since I was in college until I retired in my 50s. Will veterans who pay no tax on VA benefits get a “DOGE Dividend Check”? I’m certain the IRS used the tax money for fraud, that veterans have paid as civilians, and we deserve a refund, as well.\nJust curious, has our care gone to crap becasue DOGE is trying to make it better? I used to have great care at my local VA healthcare facility. I believe a big chunk of the staff is gone. So how is that helping vets? I think waiting over 2 months for a Urinary Tract Infection is unacceptable. If you look online it states the average wait time to be seen is 2-15 days. Oh, and don’t fall for the lie of using the local urgent cares. The VA doesn’t cover the labs if they decide to do a urinalysis. I paid $149 to pee in a cup of which the VA will not reimburse.\nWell done and well said Mr. Secretary!\n34 years I been waiting on just one ounce of truth behind how I was Deserted in Desert Storm and how the Government has destroyed records and the time is coming to answer to the International Humanitarian and War Crimes major violations. I am an American Fighting Machine I will never give up on Justice or my innocence because I’m an American soldier and veteran. Put your seat belt on Mr. Collins. Because the final battle may come on your watch\nCan you explain how laying off probationary workers and offering buyouts to our underpaid healthcare providers is eliminating waste?\nWe need more people, not less. Instead of letting some kids who aren’t old enough to rent a car screw around with your systems, maybe hire some actual veterans to audit the system who give a shit. You do not have our consent to be doing this and it will come back to haunt you.\nBelieve it when I see it. The president is a lier and has always hated veterans. He avoided service. The idea of privatization of the VA is just a money grab by private insurance companies and private health care. They will deny care and keep our money. The VA isn’t perfect but works leave it alone. Many are happy with it.\nThank you, Doug. My husband is going through the process right now, and we received a phone call just yesterday, and our case is moving forward. Looks like the Democrats are spending every penny they have embezzled on trolls again. The only time I have ever seen attacks like this was after a pro-Trump post in 2017 when they targeted Trump. Just remember that liberals do not like losing power, and they have lost it all. Their following is only about 15% of the population, but their voices are always loud. We are winning. Keep moving forward as fast as you possibly can. All the right people are united in this administration. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world how wrong the liberals have been. Power and money are all they care about. I’m sure Elon is going to find a great deal of fraud and abuse. That money is for the veterans, and I trust this administration and you to put the funds right back into the veterans’ needs. God bless this administration, and God bless you, Doug. Thank you for stepping up.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Laura!!!\nThe VA does EVERYTHING in Slow Motion. From needing to see a Doctor (several weeks) to getting prescriptions (2 to 3 weeks) New glasses (6 to 8 weeks). God forbid I should get really sick! Someone needs to light a fire under under the VA!\nUs Vets have already shown we are willing to put everything on the line. Now the Rich want to cut our benefits? Lets find out. Glad to know my post will flag me for DOGE or some authoritarian response.\nI received a letter from VA a few days ago telling me that I was over payed in my benefits. The number is quite very high. They didn’t give any time frame of the over payment. I’ve been receiving service connect payments since 1993. What the heck, why did it take this long and why didn’t they give me more indepth information on the matter. All that was said is I owe money and my entitlements will be garnished. Sounds pretty lame to me. Now I have to pony up for a lawyer because VA just can’t get their act together.\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nThis is just a complete lie. There is no sense in which arbitrary firings can possibly lead to improved care.\nThere is also absolutely NO plan to *redirect* funds to VETERANS. The only “beneficiaries” you’re talking about are the rich paying less in taxes.\nShame on you. Shame.\nAre you a draft dodger too, Bryan?\nWe hear this all the time; however, the VA has been broken for a long time. I’m not holding my breath. The VA policy is delay, delay. and aways tell you what they can’t do never what you can do . As long as you have clinics like the one in Bismarck ND There are many others, but this one has to be the worst-case of incompetence. Talk is cheap, let’s see if we see any actions. I won’t hold my breath.\nYou will justifiably suffer if you believe you will be told the truth by anyone who has been given position and power under the Musk/Trump administration.\nDoug Collins DID NOT ANSWER the question about Musk&Minions having access to PRIVATE/PERSONAL information as with Medical information–An outright HIPAA Violation!!!! I DID NOT “release” my records to DOGE! Did you???\nThere is NO transparency and/or accountability amongst the lawless incompetents and robber barons accessing veteran/private citizen information via the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other government agency that tRump has opened to a billionaire TechBro that knows he’s buddied up to the perfect ‘mark’ giving him access to Data Mine the entire US Government. INFORMATION is POWER.\nNo doubt this DOGE activity will emerge as the largest (sanctioned) THEFT OF PERSONAL DATA of every Vet/US citizen (for misuse and monetization) in the history of the world. There will be ZERO recourse as all the avenues of reporting and enforcement are simultaneously being dismantled and/or lead by and stocked with tRump/MAGA castrati at the top and lots of sheep in the ranks.\nDoug Collins, Musk and Trump are liars and time (very soon in fact) will tell. The bad thing is our vets will have to pay the price when they have already paid so much to defend this country. Why treat them like they don’t matter.\nDan, your wrong. These people are known liars with intentions to lower the disabled veteran population to reduce the expenses of DVA. Less disabled veterans. My issue is the rest of the republican’s siding tor lies, injustice against the American ways. They are not the Superman’s except in their dreams.\nIt will be 2 decades before republicans can be trusted again.\nI admired Reagan and the Bushes, especially with the concept of “War against terrorism”. These were trusted Republicans. Now they are humbled, by Dictator Putin. What republican now believes Putin did not start the war?\nDoug Collins, prove us wrong and get the current president to promise VA disability, Social Security, and VA health care will not be lessoned like when he wanted to reduce social security to the 100% IU’s on a $ for $ ratio, to pay for his wall. Get the president to promise he will not treat disabled veterans like he did with the Honorable Senator John McCain, the last republican I could trust..\nMake that promise yourself. Promise to follow the Constitution over Trump.\nSorry Dan for the statement that you where wrong. You are right that the vets will pay.\nFWIW Mr Collins, most of us MIL vets don’t believe you have any power – Trump & Musk tell you what to do and you do it or get fired. They have demonstrated this thousands of times in the past month.\nAnd worse yet for us and what’s left of the VA you occupy office space at, this article was posted by Wired . com just 2 days ago – “DOGE’s USDS Purge Included the Guy Who Keeps Veterans’ Data Safe Online.”\nI’m a Disabled Veteran & I suppose when I posted the last time it got moderated…..but all of us Veterans need to think about all of the Employees @ DVA & thier Families that got walking papers and will not have a paycheck next month…..Really Sad for all involved…. Be Blessed\nMr. Collins…I very much liked your plain and to the point INTRO to believe! As DIS VET myself, it took me 11 years to convince the VA that a documented service connected disability was warranted coupled with my effort to have been massively complicated by attempting to do so via normal mail from an overseas location! I would like to see the VA promoting solid guidelines to the federal managers/selecting officials in the federal employment arena to consider job appointments for jobs applicable to qualified and certified 50% +, disabled VETs!!! Veteran preference is an absolute optional in my subjective opinion…as a Master’s degree holder, re-instatable federal candidate, TS security holder with 25 years+ experience, I quit applying for federal jobs after my 40th attempt!\nSome pretty harsh comments here. Gotta give Secretary Collins credit for not blocking them. But then maybe he didn’t see them, being busy as he must be talking up DOGE and Trump’s accomplishments so far, which can’t be impressive, considering they’ve only had a month to make a mess of things. Personally, I thought VA care improved a lot in the last couple of years, at least it did down here in the Texas coastal bend. Seems not all clinics and hospitals are run equally well. Mr. Secretary, I am sure you are a nice guy and want to give Vets the best care you can, but here’s the rub, your boss doesn’t seem to care much for Vets. Will he stay out of your hair?\nWhy would I believe this lying POS any more than I would believe bone spurs. The draft dodger said he will cut benefits in the V A, Social Security, and Medicare and he is doing it one by one with the help of that illegal immigrant musk. It’s just a matter of time. VA employees are being fired all over the country. They aren’t cutting fat, they’re cutting out the heart and soul of the V A and the country.\nThe “real truth” is my retired Army husband has oxygen tubes follow him around the house and is so disabled he never leaves the house. To get his 40% disability re-evaluated for an increase to 100% or at least 70% would require a 3 hour trip each way to Winston-Salem even though we are only 40 minutes from the Durham VAMC. He can’t even leave the house but a long trip is required. Retired Army were promised health care for life.\nThe last time we went to Durham VAMC he had to wait in the car for ten minutes because they ran out of wheelchairs. Civilian doctors say he needs a motorized wheelchair and home health care, but the home health care company needs orders from his VA physician and say his doctor doesn’t respond. I’ve called many times trying to get his physician to put in the orders. They say they relay messages but they never respond. It’s obviously due to cutbacks and poor organization since the last election.\nMr. Collin’s, you should be wearing a diaper on your chin for all the shit you are talking. They are cutting Veteran Employees who served in the military. If that is not a cut to the hard working veterans that served. You sir are just another Trump and Musk disappointment.\nAs a disabled Viet Nam war veteran, I have found the VA to be very good for all of the needs my condition requires. After discussions with the American Legion rep I found that many of the problems vets are having getting the care they need comes from failure to follow the rules in applying for and keeping up with the requirements of the VA. The other problem I see in all of these comments are the failures of the writers to show respect by making demands on others when they have not complied with the requirements properly. If you are confused or think it is too difficult, then contact your Legion rep and ask for assistance. Also, anyone who thinks that denigrating and disrespecting our President will help them, they are mistaken. Ask the Desert Storm vet who rode home on Trump’s plane whether they think he is not a good person.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Don!! There sure are a whole bunch of brainwashed, Communist CRYBABIES on here for the past couple of days, aren’t there??! I find it very hard to believe that most of them ever truly served our Republic in the United States military. If they really did, they sure aren’t displaying the characteristics one would expect from Warrior veterans!!\nNo cuts to VA staff or benefits? Unbelievable that our own Secretary is trying to have us believe this nonsense.\nI live in the Worcester, Mass. VA service area and was unable to see my Primary Care Physician on the two occasions I called for an appointment in the past 4 weeks. When I finally was able to reach someone in authority at the Worcester VA, that person explained that Worcester was experiencing sever Staff shortages and appointments for urgent care were being redirected to the ER’s in the area as well as commercial Urgent Care facilities. Ever try to get chronic disease related care at your neighborhood Urgent Care facility of ER? If you are near death due toa coronary issue or perhaps a stroke they are pretty good…but honestly they don’t really care about RSV or Sinusitis…both of which were misdiagnosed while I suffered with both for 4 weeks until I finally found a specialist through Community Care and was treated with antibiotics..cleared the sinusitis in two days. No reductions in VA care for Veterans? Nonsense…and shameful.\nSounds reassuring, seeing is believing.\nIt doesn’t matter where you go, you can’t escape chronic TDS. And frankly I’m beyond sick & tired of those more ons. It’s only the bottom of the first inning yet they’re already predicting the game is lost. Go away, PLEASE.\nI am glad to have seen the time come when veterans that have served this country get the care and benefits that they deserve and have been promised for years. The VA system is broken and needs restructure. Put administrators and department heads on a fixed salary that is appropriate to their skills, and expertise. Do away with the bonus system of saving money for the VA. Remember the VA is supposed to serve the veteran. It should not be about administrators and department heads withholding services and medical supplies to the veteran in the name of saving money and getting a bonus for themselves.\nDoctors and practitioner’s need not be sitting at their desk looking at the clock when the veteran is their to be treated. If additional medical staff needs to be hired, hire them. Spend some of that money that normally goes in the pockets of administrators and department heads in the name of boniness’s, in the name of money saved and cost reduction\nMake the system of filing for disability more efficient and in a timely manner instead of just “rubber stamping” denied to his or hers claim hoping that they will get discouraged and go away. Or even just die.\nOne other item that is important to me and most veterans i am acquainted with, is the prescribed drug program. If the veteran needs a particular drug made by a particular pharmaceutical company, prescribe that drug to him or her. Don’t prescribe a lesser quality drug instead. Which I have experienced personally. And address the issue of having the veteran pay for drugs, or even a portion of the cost. Remember the veteran has written a check to the Government that has no expiration date or amount on it. Giving his or her life for this country. What I have stated here are situations I have personally experienced and true to my knowledge.\nSo I would ask that the new head of the Veterans Administration, being a veteran himself, take these comments by this veteran into his consideration.\nYeah, no, the DOGE team shouldn’t have access to anything. To lie and claim they do not have access to the health records is laughable. They have access to our records. Also, they made sure the VA is an unsafe environment for LGBTQ veterans.\nGod bless you Sir, and God bless President Trump too. Clean it up please. Too many of my brothers and sisters have been waiting far too long for adequate physical rehabilition and/or adequate medical care. The disability review and decision process needs to be examined for more efficiency no doubt as well. Thank you Sir.\nLying puppet of the administration. Get bent, tool!\nThere is a reason he releases videos through youtube, and that is to circumvent actual reporters who might call out his blatant lying.\nI am sorry but when they fire the people that are in charge of our nuclear weapons and struggle to find them to hire them back is not a media problem. It doesn’t take a genius to know that if you are firing thousands in days you are not putting much thought in what you are doing. When you are telling people they are being fired for performance issues and your supervisor is telling you that is not why you are being fired. It creates a problem. There has been no time for performance issues to be evaluated on thousands of people. It’s not what DOGE is doing, it’s how. You people at the top will never get it. Thanks for trying to quell our fears but I am not feeling quelled.\nI see mostly sour grapes coming from what i believe to be disgruntled democrats. As far as I am concerned the VA is a god send for myself and vets who can still think for themselves and not be one of the bleating sheep who drank the joe and kalama kool aid\nAnything will be an improvement. My 95 year old mom has been waiting to see if she can get Aid and Attendance in Virginia since last March. Supposedly you expedite claims for those over 85 yrs old., if this is the fast track, lord help those younger. I guess you are hoping she will die first.\nHi, Betty. Thanks for commenting.

Now, I see\nall the comments…And I “KNOW!” of many, many veterans who VOTED FOR TRUMP. I said, this guy, with his\nrecord and his philandering….his treatment of General MILLY, his treatment of General H.R. McMaster (A roommate\nof my son at West Point)…\nNow you’re pissed off……I had a four year AF Airman First Class….who wanted all the Mexican kick out….He who\nworked with many Latinos…Voted for Trump!!\nSO YOU VETERANS…WHO WORE THE MAGA TO THE VA FOR TREATMENT!! Now suck it down……….\nCan’t cut what they don’t give. Veterans are not taken care of\nI do not DOGE anywhere near any of my information in the VA database. Doge is not House or Senate appointed or established entity and Elon Musk is not an elected official with legal rights and responsibilities for any of the actions he has been undertaking.\nIrene A. Abels, CDR, USNR, Ret\ni would rather you be focused on HELPING the veterans. not pushing your own numbers….\nIts why i am continually failing to recieve proper treatment, with BLOOD IN MY STOOL, and BLOOD IN THROW UP. Yet its not worthy enough to help a 100% disabled vet\nno…. no…… Cases. cases. cases. number number number\nMark my words……………….. I will die from this illness from lack of treatment, and then my autopsy and written testament will be plastered all across the country\nHi, Jared. If you’re having a medical emergency, please call 911. Please know that we’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nSay what you like, trump does not care what you think. Its going to take Congress to stop these cuts they are all to spineless to do their jobs but even if they took trump to the Supreme Court we all already know what the Supreme Court thinks too.\nThis is Trump’s agenda for the VA…\nTo revamp the Department of Veterans of Affairs with proposals to increase privatization, narrow the eligibility criteria for health benefits and replace civil service-style employees with political appointees in its ranks. – he basically wants to make money off denying care. Kinda like united health (whose CEO was recently gunned down) And to turn the VA into an extension of MAGA.. as in hire January 6er’s instead of career civil servants..\nThank you for looking out for veterans and their families and caregivers. I have been taking care of my 100% disabled vet since 1999. In 2000 he had a major stroke. During the next 20 plus years, hip replacements, open heart surgery and now suffering from dementia, parkinsonism, diabetes. I gave up my retirement money to help raise our children and in down payment for our home. He volunteered at an adult day care where he was placed to recover from the stroke until the last few years. The only retirement I have is Social Security and a small one from Wells Fargo. I just learned of the caregiver program about a year ago where I was able to get the stipend. My husband collapsed in our living room last December–heart failure–he is now in a nursing home (not a very nice one–none want to contract with the VA cause they do not pay enough). I now have to make a 40 mile trip (one way) to visit him. 3rd UTI and hospitalization since being there. Wehn he passes away, his disability pay from the VA and SS will be taken away along with the stipend. I will then have to apply for survivor benefit–which is not even half of his disability pay. In addition, last March he was diagnosed with arterial dementia and the VA supplied a wheelchair and walker. I knew I would be responsible for hauling him to appointments etc….and my 2006 vehicle was too small–so I purchased a 2020 vehicle that had more room. Now I am left with not even half the income and car and house payment (yes we purchased a different home as stairs in our split entry were too hard for him–so we got a rambler). I wish they would eliminate the survivor benefit for those married to vets long term and just let them at least keep the disability pay–sort of a retirement plan for caregivers. I hope you will consider this. It has been a difficult road for us.\nThe VA has been good to me. I have a good doctor from India. A concrete truck hit me from behind and I got surgery to correct a hernia. I fell 19 feet and cracked ribs and had a collapsed lung…the VA paid for the hospital and treatments. I would have been 5 figures in debt to the hospital if I didn’t have VA benefit. I consider myself lucky, most people have to pay horrendous amounts of money on insurance, and for the many things their insurance company refused to cover. I did complain when I first got into the VA because it takes so long for appointments, but I changed my tune when the VA stepped up to cover my emergencies.\nThank you, I think we all need to hear the real truth and not rumors. The main sream media likes to spead rumors just to get everybody all worked up. Again thank you and the VA to taking care of us Veterans. And I would like to send a BIG THANK YOU out to all those employees that are taking care of us, they are always courteous and caring to us.\nI and many others appreciate the efforts of ALL within the VA that strive to assist veterans. Thank you to ALL within the VA doing so much to help us in many ways!!!\nI don’t trust anything you say.\nComing from the state that you used to represent, I find you to be a very partisan politician.\nAs VA Secretary, I was hoping to hear something out of your mouth that didn’t sound like we are stupid and not smart enough to research facts. Instead we got a political soundbite.\nTime will tell what happens to us all.\nThe doctors at the VA Medical Center in Birmingham, AL said that they are worried – they’re hearing that VA Centers are going to be closed and many doctors and nurses are going to lose their jobs. Also, I have confidence that President Trump will keep his promise. The Biden admin gave VA money allotted them by the federal gov’t to Mayorkas to use for illegals. Our SS money has also been used for illegals. If people are given checks because DOGE has found fraud and abuse, then please give the same to our veterans. Social Security was in a private trust acct until Pres. Johnson used it for the Vietnam War – it continues to be in the general fund and is being used for anything they want. It’s so amazing how the Biden admin ignored any laws they didn’t like and broke them. Also, those who are slamming Pres. Trump for not being in the military – neither was Obama or Kamala Harris. I didn’t hear anyone saying anything negative about them – at all. President Trump will make this country operate as it should – he’s a business man who knows exactly how things should be done – fraud and abuse of taxpayer money isn’t going to fly with him.\nSo far I have been shown NO reason to believe we vets will not be targeted. Especially the disabled. There are changes that really need to be made. Start with Congress and their leadership abilities, moral and financial. I expect this will be be deleted.\nTo those pushing the “Leave a comment” conspiracy theories…the majority of negative comments are real and heartfelt. Veterans and retirees have always felt as if they were battling to obtain healthcare, especially for service connected conditions. They support system has perpetually lagged behind our nation’s desire for a capable and forward deployed military. It is not the general fault of an existing or prior administration. However, and with emphasis, there has never been an internal assault on our military operations and support systems as we have witnessed in the past couple months. I wont delve into the detrimental effects on other Federal entities…but they are all connected. VA healthcare is being negatively impacted, and political mouthpiece gaslighting cannot allay our concerns.\nYou get what you vote for…just dont complain about it after the fact.\nPlease add dental care to the Care in the Community program. Delta Dental insurance costs over $53.00 per month and offers only partial coverage for fillings, crowns and bridges. The VA does not offer dental care except for rare service related problems. I know veterans that avoid social interactions because of the poor quality of their teeth. Thanks.\nYou wrote: “Secty. Collins said. ‘In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.'”\n“He went on to emphasize that the Veterans Benefits Administration is clearing cases faster than ever and that VA remains mission-focused by doing what it is supposed to do.”\nGood, but not good enough. At a regional VA medical center town hall this week too many veterans complained of delay and inaction on their cases. My personal experience is PACT Act claims procedures need improvement. This was affirmed in Congress with proposed legislation last session to additionally resource VA claims processing but it was not fully voted on. There are too many processing errors due faulty procedures and rework is 3x as costly as getting it right the first time. Clearing a case is not a measure of success when the final disposition is incorrect.\nThat’s great thanks. But I think it is somewhat over-kill. There are a lot of problems and I am not happy with the VA, so many things I won’t even get into here.\nMy biggest concern though is and has been Why I have zero Dental coverage.\nThe other issues will work themselves out in the coming years.\nThank You\nAnd President Donald J Trump\nGod Bless\nI just don’t believe him. The 20 somethings with no military background will cut as they see fit and whether on purpose or accidentally benefits/services will be reduced. Will sooner rather than later. It will come like a thief in the night but be assured it will happen. If they can fire leadership, cutting services will occur. When your benefits are delay remember his comments.\nI have been at the VA 3 times since the election everyone is positive and looking for bigger and better. Doug Collin’s has been the head of the VA for what three weeks and he has communicated to the Veteran twice . I can’t even tell you who led prior … I have been involved with the VA since I got out of the Army in 1971…. I have good stories and HORROR stories … So let’s look for success\nYou talk the talk, NOW WALK THE WALK\nCome on my fellow VETERANS, how about giving the new SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS the opportunity to prove what he has said. Before you get on my case, I was drafted on Jan 17,1966 and sent to South Vietnam on Dec. 1, 1966.\nWhile there I went hospital twice. First time had a hernia the size of an ostrich egg. Second time,malaria two other tropical deseases, worms, and my temp hit 104.9 degrees. The only thing I currently qualify for is PTSD @70%.\nI also meet those other listed requirements, but have been denied compensation for them.\nThe VA DOESN’T DO THE INITIAL EXAMINATION OF CLAIMS ,THEY USE DOCTORS GROUPED UNDER THE VETERANS EVALUATION SERVICES! A doctor in Maryland decided that I didn’t meet the VA ‘s standards! I LIVE IN LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY , I HAD NO INTERACTION WITH SAID DOCTOR!\nNot Sure I can believe this. The present administration is fire-bombing most federal offices with major firings and layoffs across the board, including at least 1,000 in the Veteran’s Administration. I contacted my local VA Medial Center’s administrative office to ask about buyouts affecting staffing levels in the VA healthcare system and was told that, while buyouts were offered, medical staff was exempt and could not take advantage of the buyout. Still not sure how support staff, administrative staffing, etc. would be affected. The person I talked to said that there were still questions, particularly about any future actions. I guess we will have to wait and see what the future of VA medical care will look like. As a Vietnam Vet on disability, I am very concerned and this Rah, Rah speech didn’t do much to ease my mind.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them [Musk’s DOGE team] to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans, …”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what to look for, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. Your existing VA OIG team, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the internal and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices; that is what you are looking for. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with little experience in the processes and practices involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash a system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better. You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote.\nThank you!!\nI have a tough time understanding all the comments regarding mistreatment by the VA. I am USAF Veteran in the upper Midwest, I have nothing but good to say about the treatment I have received. It’s either me or just there are different VA’s out there. I am more than please with the VA. Thank you…keep it up!\nThanks Doug\nVETERNS NEED HELP WITH VA AND COMPENSATION- VETERN GOES TO IRAQ 2004-2005 ATTACHED TO 1ST ID QUARTER CALVES AT FOB MACKENZIE COMES HOME HAS A WIDOW MAKER AT 47 ANOTHER HEART ATTACK A MAJOR STROKE A SEIZURE BUT THE VA CAN NOT HELP HIM VA CAN NOT LINK ALL THIS TOGETHER. VETERN HAS NOT WORKED OVER A YEAR BECAUSE HIS CONDITION BURN PIT OINLY GETS 10% A JOKE EXPLAIN TO THIS VETERN WHY NO HELP VA SERVICE OFFICER WITH CLAIMS QUOTE THE BS RULES AN REGULATIONS VA SAYS NOT SERVICE CONNECTED VETERN NATIONAL GUARD FILES FOR PTSD VA CLAIMS TOLD HIM HE WAS NATIONAL GUARD DID NOT QUALFI FOR PTSD WHY\nThis is the classic Republican response when they want to cut spending:\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ”\nAnd yet, it is Republican run government programs where fraud, waste and abuse exist!\nFor instance, Republican supporters on this forum claim that fraud, waste and abuse exist evidently in the VA!! So OK you folks, can you point out anything you have seen or found in the VA system that is fraudulent, waste or abuse? I want facts baby and not your assumptions! My VAMC is great and takes care of all of my health problems. Hardly if ever had any problems with their servicing me! It seems that every Republican administration-Congress always tries ways to cut spending from the VA! Any anytime budget considerations come up VA funding-wise, they find excuses to vote against them. In reality, the VA medical system would not exist if not for Democrats!\nAnd please don’t give me this all liberals are communist bull! With Trump basically in bed with Putin, Xi and Kim Un, you know how he says he has love affairs with them, well–face it–they are all real communists. And anyone here who supports Putin and Russia (really still the Soviet Union) is in fact a communist or a communist sympathizer! And right now, its Republicans who fall into the communist category! It is the Republican party that does not want free and fair elections and supports a wanna be autocratic dictator in Trump! Trump has always said he wants to rule like Putin, and he sure as heck is trying really hard to do so!\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ” Hmm.\nI would like to see the exact cases made for each fired VA member accuse of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. These employees need to be given the facts rather than the opinion of DOGE or the president. Did they provide specific incidences or just told them you loss because we suspect you of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. Where is the Due Process within the Constitution that Trump himself applied to himself?\nThe Fraud part is at the top, with the person who got the due process and was guilty of Fraud. It is his second nature. To commit fraud is to lie. Therefore, Trump is a proven liar, and he will lie about his lie, like the Big Lie he did not lost to Biden.\nDoug Collins, prove Daft-Dodger Trump is not a liar. Prove to us that you served in the military and actually care for the disabled veterans. It is on you. If you do not respond here, then you show your lack of respect for people who served in the military., and people will not trust you.\nYeah? And trump said Medicaid wouldn’t be touched hours before endorsing a house plan to gut medicaid.\nI sure hope you’re willing to fight for this nation’s veterans Mr. Collins.\nHopefully, but time will tell. For those concerned with their information… really? Come on, your on the Internet answering this message and more than likely on social media, your information has been bought and sold long before DOGE had anything to do with it. The Patriot Act guaranteed that. Google and Meta are the ones you need to be concerned with.\nThe malpractice this administration is going to commit and the expense of veterans do to extreme incompetence and narcissism is going to be devastating and you, sir, are complicit and will be held accountable.\nWas this message put out before or after they decided to cut 1000 employees at the VA Administration..?? The date is the same.\nI, for one, am so glad that Doug is at the helm. Right man for the job, in my books.\nMr. Collins, please take a moment and actually listen to the people that are doing the job in C&P and see how it can be improved. There is still a backlog, these workers just got off mandatory overtime due to reduced backlog. Now with the firing/buyout there is a known fear that they will experience another backlog. Because whom is going to do the jobs of those people you let go? Then when those persons that are left to cover their work and those who left, and fall behind, then they are in fear of getting put on PIP and losing their job! The PTSD/Anxiety associated with helping veterans as a many are veterans of not knowing if you are getting a letter for firing, is unfair to those whom serve to serve others. THE BACKLOG IS NOT CAUGHT UP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE AND THEY SAID THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Someone is fudging numbers!\nPlease listen to those persons who are doing the job, not the GS 14s and up, heck too many of them!!! if 19, 20 years olds can work for DOGE, clearly you can listen to the GS 12s and below. Heck, I have a few names to improve the processing!\nWhile you are at it, can we get 2 increases a year, or 5% will truly assist us!! TOO MANY Chiefs at the VA and that is a fact jack!! too many petty managers that will fire hard workers because NOW they can for their own personal agendas.\nNo one should be allowed to touch veterans benefits or to privatize the VA hospital. It’s quite alarming that the two people who wants to cut our benefits never served in the military.\nDon’t believe you.\nI won’t file a claim because of the Hassel I have to go through, I’m a Vietnam Vet and desert shield Veteran, Please cut all the red tape.\nIf there are ANY interruptions to my benefits, Doug Collins, I will hold you personally responsible. There will be no explanation that will satisfy. Cooperation with DOGE is all the proof I need to know who to blame. And I think I speak for many Veterans when I say, “The only thing I have left to lose is my benefits.”\nI’m excited that the President and Mr Collins are working together. I believe what Mr Collins stated. We have enough negative comments coming from the Democrats and the fake Media. They lie with no shame. President Trump is the best President in my lifetime and I served under President Nixon. Great things are going to happen in President Trumps watch.\nSecretary Collins,\nWith all due respect the VA needs to decentralize it’s VA Hospital management. Directors should be free to make whatever changes they feel need to be made without having to check with their boss who has to check with his boss. As a 20+ year volunteer and patient I have witnessed first hands this absurdity. Let managers manage and if they cannot, counsel, retrain and if necessary fire.\nPLEASE REMOVE THE PHRASE BELOW FROM THE HIRING PROCESS. This statement is embedded into every Veteran’s healthcare job posting.\nPursuant to VHA Directive 1193.01, VHA health care personnel (HCP) are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 subject to such accommodations as required by law (i.e., medical, religious or pregnancy). VHA HCPs do not include remote workers who only infrequently enter VHA locations. If selected, you will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and submit documentation of proof of vaccination before your start date. The agency will provide additional information regarding what information or documentation will be needed and how you can request a legally required accommodation from this requirement using the reasonable accommodation process.\nAnnouncement #: CBTA-12690744-25-MTS\nThank you.\ni am a vietnam veteran and very happy to see the changes being directed to more services for our veterans 58,000 of my brothers sacrificed on that battle field they deserve the benefits they have for us it has been a long fight but it was woth it for the soldier who tookhis life at the trump tower was sending a clear message we need more or better services my prayers and thoughts go his family\nOkay, Please ‘listen’ to his statement. “Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut.” Maybe; but where they are going to slice and dice the VA, is reduction in VSRs, ratings staff for compensation, medical staff, hospitals and clinics. DOGE is looking for the “waste” in gov’t contracts, e.g., assistance with transportation, cuts or elimination of travel pay, costs shares will skyrocket up for medical needs, and we will pay for it out of OUR own pockets.\nMr. Secretary,\nI aske for proof VA appointment would not take longer to make. You did not respond.\nI asked you to guarantee VA and Social Security would not be lost on a dollar for dollar ratio as Pres. Trump attempted in his last term. You did not respond.\nI asked you to ask the president to promise VA health care, disability and social Security would not be negatively affected. You did not respond.\nI asked you to respond to all comments listed here on this page. You did not respond to my comment, did you respond to others?\nI asked you to not affect to retribution for these complaints on this site. You did not respond to me.\nI can only believe everyone comments will be used to lower all health care and disabilities from veteran complainers on this site. You collected our names.\nAs the president wanted to publish the name of anyone involved with the Jan 6 investigations, are you collecting name for retribution?\nPlease respond to each complaint and suggestion listed here. Assure VA will not be affected and the disabled veterans here will not be negatively affected. Ask the president to promise us. Until then, faith in you is not real. The news uses facts (except Fox uses hearsays). The president and staff uses innuendoes and hearsay, with lies.\nBe not one of these and protect disabled veterans and assure us what you are doing is authentic. Get the president to promise us. You promise us. You respond to all complaints positively. Or faith in you is not real.\nThere are 1679 comments on this site at the time of this comment. None show a response from you. Are you listening or is this a waste of time to you? I can only expect the worse since you wont truly assure us disabled veterans.\nNo response from Doug Collins yet.\nFirst, Mr. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. YOU ARE AWESOM, Thank you for taking on this responsibility, and We notice alreay a HUGE difference in Improvement since President Trump took office, and with you there.\nI’m also a consultant, and noticed a Lot of waste with paper being used and sent with Prescriptions. Rather than sending us Lots of paper that adds to the weight of postage, how about allowing us to just go onlinie since that info is already there.\nYou sound like a political hack!!!\nHow is cutting the VA workforce going to help us vets? The answer is IT IS NOT!\nLess people doing more work does not equal better care!\nDo your actual job – Serving us Vets & not Trump or DOGE.\nAre you trying to reassure us or go on a rant about the “media”? Very unprofessional and NOT reassuring.\nThey have a lot of political propagandalists in this forum. They only believe what they hear from others. The hackers only want to find out who is draining the coffers,If you are one then, you have a reason to bitch. If not then all the years in the military should have weaned you from the political tit and shit show. Its always been a SNAFU and until they let someone get it right it will be the same. The demo/socialists destroyed, piledged and stole from the US coffers and person that dont need your money are trying to fix it. Most of the persons on the cabinet are ex patriots or rich enough to not get paid for their service. Why the hell would they do that for US? I dont feel its a gainful reason to eliminate waste from a government that taxes the shit out of you, no matter how much money you make.\nI’m reading a lot of complaining, as usual. So let me say this. For YEARS, I have received VERY GOOD overall healthcare from my local VA. It’s much better care than civilian insurance plans that I’ve had in the past. ALL personnel have been nothing but pleasant and helpful during all of my visits. Thank you, VA.\nHaving endured pay delays and other suffering due to political budget shenanigans, it is hard to believe that DOGE led by an unelected official with no public accountability interference in VA management will benefit veterans. For decades Republicans and their wealthy supports have sought to privatize or deregulate government affairs to the detriment of the military, veterans, and the public.\nIts an awesome team that the greatest president of the US history has put together to gitter done. I really hope its not just another fight between political opposition.\nWas at the CBOC in Cottonwood,AZ and the picture of our President Trump was not up either, I see this may be happening across the country.\nI have told all of my Veterans that the Pact Act had no money behind it, as anyone that met the requirements the VA gave 0 % which means no compensation but they would take care of you medically. That is all it was good for.\nI have been a volunteer Accredited Claims Agent/ VSO for over 20 years. the biggest problem I think will save funds and a few trees is in the mailing. When I become a POA for a Veteran, I file the documents and when there is a decision or letter that needs to go to the Veteran, It is also in his electronic file that the Claims Agent can see in VBMS system. BUT, the VA sends a letter to the Veteran and to the VSO/Claims Agent/ Attorney who ever the POA is. This is not necessary as the VSO has it in front of them on the computer. Thousands and thousands if not millions of these secondary letters are sent for no reason.\nMaybe this will save a lot of funds and the eqrth.\nYOU CAN NOT BE CARING FOR VETS IF YOU LET A BONE SPUR COMMANDER IN CHEIF AND HIS hERMAN gOERIENG PARTNER RUN THE AXE OVER YOU YOU NEED TO STAND UP FOR VETERANS AS THEY ARENOT. OR ARE YOU IN LINE WITH HIS GOALS TO PUNISH US TO PAY FOR HIS TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH????\nThanks for the RIGHT information.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General.

Thank you Kent\n“clearing cases quicker then ever” yeah by denying them! waited 5 years for my cancer claim to be denied!\nglad i was hit with DU, got cancer and having the VA at least pay for my treatments….\nI am not sure I believe you. We have heard too many times that this won’t happen or that won’t happen in other areas and then jobs are cut. I also know President Trump has always wanted to privatize services, including Veterans Health Services. One stop shopping and home and community-based services streamline veterans’ health services by consolidating them into one facility. You and President Trump should pay a visit to the Veterans Administration and Hospital in Kansas City, MO. It is efficient, wait times to get services and in to see medical providers are optimum, we are treated with respect, always thanked for our services, and get good mental health and physical care. Contractors and sub-contractors are currently providing jobs to over 100 workers to build an annex to move all the administrative staff from downtown KC to the new location upon its completion. The VA has already seen cuts and there has been a hiring freeze for six years. Veterans cannot afford to have to go to various doctors and specialists in the community as many cannot, or do not drive and Medicare premiums would be costly.\nWho is to find “things we need to get rid of”? I feel certain that it is not a Veteran and if they are do they get their care through VA? I doubt it on both counts. How about you do something radical and ask those who go to the VA for what is and is not helpful. Do not just chose by cost and money, the way the current crew works, it’s all about money, ande them having it, not those who need it. May our democracy, country and VA survive.\nYea, right, after 40,000 lies from dump you want me to believe that a man appointed by a draft dodging traitor is looking out for my best interest. Bullshit.\nWhy is it taking so long to get disabilities evaluated?\nThe gulf war veterans need the VA Secretary Collins help in our quest. 2-21-2025 2;40 pm\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So, CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo, it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\nThe gulf war veterans need an open-door policy to act on our serious health issues.\nThe Whitehouse hotline and the VA-IG system doesn’t work unless Secretary Collins fixes the complaints system.\nA fast food chain and the health care system for veterans have absolutely 0 in common. It is insulting that the people that choose to care for us as veterans medically are now without jobs, ways to support their families and themselves. As us veterans individually, has any of the actions taken in the last 31 days helped any of us. Ask us. Because when you ask us, you will receive a truthful answer of you are making our healthcare worse, not better. Also a large demographic of employees that you improperly and unjustly fired, are Veterans themselves. You make no sense. You don’t care about us veterans. You make short videos saying nothing. You answer no questions. Show data. Show documentation. Your words mean nothing. Where is the proof to back up your false claims? Where are the receipts? Down right disrespectful. A spit in all of the faces of veterans. Shame on you.\nYea, like we are supposed teo believe you. Retired back in 2008, and still fighting to get benefits that I earned. Why am I having to fight for it? I met all the qualifications for the pact act, had Lymphoma, been to the places listed, and still got denied. PACT act is a crock of lies that the dems made to make it look like they care for veterans when the fact is they don’t, nor do the republicans. Have back issues that I have had ever since I retired, and well, because I never went on sick call for back problems, they didn’t service connect it. Guess it was nice of my back to wait til the week after I retired to start having issues. And those commenting well it takes time, yea I know it takes some time, but, how is it when they send you correspondence, they give you a week to have the proof sent to them or all the sudden they can give you a decision in a short amount of time.\nDear Hank: If you look back you will see that it has always been the Republicans at the White House always hinting at cutting our benefits and Social Security for the elderly. Trump and Elon are Republicans. Also, you might want to try a different avenue of applying for your benefits. I went through a VSO after being denied, while other went through other agencies that try to help veterans get what they deserve without a fee. Some even got lawyers. If you ever complained about your back to a fellow soldier or if they witness an event that probably caused the problem, you can get witness statement from them stating what they saw or heard. Good luck and don’t give up.\nHank, why are you blaming the current admin?? get help resubmitting you request!\nGary\nWhen I was having troubles like yours I went to the American legion. They will help fill out the paperwork and send it to the proper persons. They also have personnel embedded in the va to hurry the process along. Give them a shot they have come through for me several times\nI know that is hard, but it there is a reason I always told me Soldiers, no matter what, go to sick call. I can’t blame the VA for their choice when in fact there is no documents in your records. My bother had the same issue with his knee, never got it looked at, and the VA said nope. Your best bet, is to get letters from people you served with that can contest to your back issues.\nThat’s your problem. To get benefits, your problems HAVE to be service-connected.\nWell let’s see if this comment gets totally censored out like my first two. Under the guise of moderation.\nRetired in 93, finally got a 10% rating last fall. Now I get a small check monthly, oh, but same amount is taken out of my retirement, so potentially I get to maybe save on taxes. Over the years I have known many others who did get disability, strangely, none were retirees, another significant %, well if I comment it would be falsely attacked as lifestyle prejudiced.\nPACT seemed a no brainer. After all my initial claims except 1 were denied, further checking revealed all the denials were done without any medical records, no recognition of RVN service. i had to even get and file copies of all my DD214’s and they still got my periods of service wrong.\nPlease, some improvement definitely needed.\nI would love to believe your comments, but looking at the current administrations ability to speak out of both sides of their mouth, and past/current actions I want to see it before I believe it.\nLet’s talk about cuts or better yet severing an established service connection due to glaring VA errors. Service connection for my sinus cancer was granted and then summarily severed due to the VA erroneously asking provider after provider for an opinion for “skin” cancer rather than my sinus cancer. DBQ Derm does not allow for a positive opinion on a sinus or any other respiratory cancer and as a result my service connection was severed then eventually restored after one provider pushed back stating she could not provide her opinion for a sinus cancer on a DBQ Derm however even though I have clawed my way back to even 100% now I am still waiting for the VA to recognize that my dental issues due to radiation damage that I claimed in October of 2020 are service connected. Cutting out the errors that result in such awful decisions will go a long way to providing better care for all veterans\nIn plain English, does this mean that DOGE has access to my personal health records? If so, I demand access to all the members of DOGE personal records and even Trumpy. They can’t have it both ways.\nI want to know as well. What information are you, Doug, giving them?\nI want to see President Trumps picture hanging on the wall at my VA center in Mobile, Al. It is unacceptable that it’s not up yet. They said they ordered the pictures jan 22,2025… Why?? He was nominated President Nov. 5th. No accuses. I am very upset. Please make that happen yesterday. Thank you\nI’m sure you are looking for his recently released “Long Live the King” photo… We took an oath to the constitution , not some jerk who thinks he can be a king.\nI’ll vote for that.\nDefinitely, should have been waiting in the wings.\nBro, Please re-read your statement. a) it took about two months before Biden’s photo went up. b) “He”, was nominated in July (or August), and elected (won) the presidency on Nov 5. Your putz is getting his face all over the VA soon… sadly.\nThat’s your big concern? Laughable.\nI was at my local VA Office this week. It was a relief not to see his disgusting picture there.\nYou are among the dumbest people on the planet. You are triggered but silly stuff and spend your time online crying about nonsense. Grow up and read a book someday?\nYou Go Mike!!! Let Us know when that happens…\n“No accuses” people are worried about their benefits, they are worried that the government is not holding up their end of the bargain.. and you are upset about King Trumpy’s portrait?\nI totally agree with you\nIs that going to make him more of a president than he already is. Get over it.\nHis picture is hanging in the bathroom.\nYou wont have to worry about anyone’s picture in any office. President musk is closing down all the V A offices in the country. You’re lucky that’s your biggest problem. Most of us have more important shit to worry about.\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nFellow veterans, read up on the Bonus Army. (https://department.va.gov/history/100-objects/object-21-bonus-army/)\nTrump and his cronies do not support us, and will do all they can to destroy our military. Here’s what he just did to our top military leadership: https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-fires-the-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-fd4a4d07\nStand up and speak out against Trump’s attempt to destroy democracy, Americans.\nYou and Trump are NOT to be believed…you are just one of his sycophant lapdogs who will do ONLY what is directly approved by Trump, his number one Lapdog-e Musk. Trump and Musk will cut our services and those in the VA who provide it. You will only respond by regurgitating whatever talking points provided to you.\nAsk Donnie T. how goes his famous heel spur that his daddy used to keep him away from military service. After all, according to Donnie T.’s own words that we–those who served are “suckers” and “losers”.\nNOTE Also: Musk is a native South African and immigrant who would not know the first thing about military service, where country comes before self.\nSpread your hate elsewhere! New admin takes time to sort out the mistakes of the previous administration!\nGary\nUSN Ret\nYour ignorance is absolutely breathtaking.\nI have set and read many of the comments and I think it’s hilarious that many of the comments are about having access to your private information. There is no way that you can so naive as to think you have any private information. All private information went away with the invention of the computer and the internet. probably 85% of you use your cell phone for transactions pertaining to money or with all of the little apps installed i.e. Tick Tock which pulls every bit of information off of your phone and sends it to China. the United States is constantly participating in conflict somewhere weather it’s on the news or not. I’m not saying it’s a perfect system but the Politicians that we have and continue to vote into office have done absolutely nothing for more than 50 years while becoming multi-Millionaires on a little more than average salary which the receive for life as well as medical benefits. so, for those complaining about Trumps administration after a month, Go call you Representative (if they’re not out in the street whining and singing like first graders) and ask them why they haven’t worked on this stuff. I spent almost 23 yrs in and have been through 19 surgeries, so I have earned the right to call you out.\nAt the risk of getting on a MAGA-DOGE future revenge list, as a disabled veteran I have to say that this disgusted me. It was purely partisan political apologetics. The “media up here” that he dismisses is doing its job of the Fourth Estate being a watchdog on government actions, and that’s why he has to be defensive. His boss doesn’t care about veterans, having repeatedly and publicly made it clear that he thinks service people who are maimed or killed or POW are suckers and chumps. And this guy should be fired for letting Musk and his DOGE minions into our data: I gave the VA permission to maintain my health care information for its use, I didn’t give it permission to reveal it to an unelected band of idiot thugs to mine. Maybe we were chumps to serve instead of paying quack doctors to certify “bone spurs.”\nMan you really need an attetude check. This news is all old false unfactual garbage.\nThe media were often proved right. While most media are probably biased, so are … who? Trump? DOGE? Absolutely! Cost cutting eliminates potential wasted spending on “loser” POWs and war-injured veterans. (quoting Trump). Sadly, we may all suffer in the end. I heard required follow-ups for suicidal veterans are delayed, sometimes by weeks or months. I’m sure there is waste potential everywhere, but let’s not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Trimming waste is hard work and takes time.\nI’m an army veteran ( peace time). I do have service connection for tinnitus and kidney cancer. Loma Linda VA saved my life. A doctor at Loma Linda said I was cancer-free. I sold my house. I moved to a new state. 6 months later I found out I had blood cancer through a biopsy from the El Paso VA. That was 3 years ago. Zero treatment for my cancer. Zero medication. All my pact act disability claims have been denied by someone in Waco Texas. I live in New Mexico. Oh yeah I’m a retired California state firefighter and EMT. Obviously these knuckleheads are retaliating against me, so I will never receive any of my VA benefits earned. I had to go out and pay for medical insurance just to get sleep medication. I have numerous medical issues and I will never even ask for help from the VA ever again. VA is junk. I recommend the leadership team and doctors and nurses be removed from the El Paso VA medical system indefinitely. The Las Cruces cboc ran by the El Paso VA Medical center is horrible. The nurses there call it the “Sh*t show!” El Paso VA medical system along with the Albuquerque VA medical system has it been a disservice to this veteran since December 2021. I will testify to this any day of the week.\nWritten by an army Cav Scout and retired Cal Fire firefighter and EMT.\nDid you think it’s the VA staff that gets bonuses for turn you down. Here in AL the head of VA disability service was fired a phew years ago because he received a bonuses for the longer wait time. Took 10yrs to get mine, it was in my medical record in black & white. Like you I went 1 1/2 years with cancer my first time before any thing was done. Now just yesterday was dx for my 4 round. Good luck\nHi, Jared. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWhy is this war hero a POW OF THE VA ADMINISTRATION?\nI know Mr. President Trump cares about very much, and is extremely busy cleaning up ( “finally” ) the mess. I’m hoping you free me so i don’t have to bother him.\nIt’s called being in “Lockstep”, to be in complete agreement or to conform with someone or something else; whether or not it is right or wrong. Did you hear how Virginia is going to financially assist those in their state who have been canned by Trump? It’s NOT the state, rather, it’s TAXPAYERS who are going to have to swallow this! That is, THOSE WHO STILL HAVE JOBS!\nMr Secretary, how do veterans, veteran families and caregivers contact you directly with their concerns? I read the OMB new director Vought’s plans for veterans disabilities. Now I can not steep at night over the worry. Vought is no friend to veterans. I would like to believe you sir , but I am not letting my guard down..\nI don’t believe you, nor do i believe Trump. What i do believe is that you will do whatever it takes to deliver tax cuts for the rich and cut wherever you can to get the funds for those tax cuts.\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are intitled to feel any way you want. But as Secretary Doug Collins stated, the reality is what actaully happens, not what folks may think or feel.\nDoug Collins knows what he is doing and knows how to do the job of making the VA as lean and efficient as it can be. However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. I hope you have a blessed day.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nThanks for clearing that up. Hurray!!!\n“However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. ”\nThis applies to Trump and Musk and the rest of the 1% way more than to ANY veterans receiving benefits or federal employess or other hard working middle class Americans. I hope that what is stated here by Sec Collins is true and that veterans retain their benefits and support from the VA, but it’s hard to ignore what is happening every day and the stories I’m hearing from friends, federal workers and VA nurses being fired without cause. The disruption in people’s lives by all this is real and not positive for them or their families. Why should we believe that we’ll be safe when others are not?\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are entitled to feel any way you want. Secretary Collins, lied, because DOGE does have access to the medical records. He doesn’t know what he is doing because he has never ran an organization, let alone a government one. Last time we heard the words “Lean and efficient” a lot of veterans lost access to care. I guess you support that kind of thing though. Also, NO ONE IS TAKING advantaged of any funds that were allocated by CONGRESS. Love your gaslighting.\nFred,\nYou’ve been duped, pal. (Unless you’re lying on purpose. ?♂️)”Probationary” doesn’t mean “new”. A lot of skilled career employees – veterans included – are being summarily canned because the incoming regime wants to assert dictatorial power and give tax cuts to the rich. It’s not to benefit us, and there’s not even any way it *could*.\nTrump just called himself king! Wake up already. If you still hold to the Constitution we all swore to defend, then there is no excuse for you to be repeating this nonsense. The truth is out there, and the proof is a search query away.\nI appreciate the change from the new Secretary and look forward to the new concern for Vets. I am a vet, 80 years old and the only benefit I have used was when I bought my first home in 1973, I am fortunate.\nThey are looking to get rid of Medicaid funding. So, all vets with certain conditions living in elderly homes will not have the ability to pay and stay. A daughter of a vet suffering from alzheimer, whose home costs $16,000 a month, is scared for her dad. Medicaid pays 1/4 of the bill every month, and they can’t afford to take up the cost. There is no new concern for Vets. If you cut employees, all VA interactions will take longer.\n“I only used my benefits to purchase a home when they costed 10k, shame on other vets who need services. Only for me but not for thee”\nI completely agree, that is what his first term was all about, tax cuts for the rich. I wish some people would read ACTUAL news and NOT just your right wing echo chamber where you hear what putin wants you to. When will they realize ALL cult leaders are evil?\nWe are all just frogs in a pot now. Some of us can can feel how bad the situation is getting, and some of us will deny to the end that there’s anything wrong with Trump’s moves to consolidate power and remove all checks on that power. Putin’s Russia is his model, and we are heading that direction quickly. Surface level freedoms to preserve the charade is all we’ll be left with while the billionaires loot everything else.\nLike what Mr. Collins had to say, and I liked the way he said it. Direct and to the point in language you could understand. Not a lot of blah, blah, blah and say nothing.\nYes, very direct, but was it the truth?\nI Love it.\nSir,\nI’m attaching a picture of a woke hallway in St. Cloud VA\nDon’t know what woke is do you?\nWhat is “woke”? You explain that to me…is it so called ‘woke” because you don’t agree, or is it because something just might be true! I am a veteran just like everyone on this chat, I’ve this before just like many of you have but I guess depending on what side of the aisle you sit on will determine how you comment. Every chat always begins with the issues then it turns into a political blame game, or who is oh so great. Politicians are all about “self”, and people are perfectly fine with things that happen or don’t happen until it affects them, then it’s the other parties fault…aren’t you tired?\nAccording to the US Office of Personnel Management, military veterans made up about 30% of federal employees in 2021, and many of them had service-related disabilities.\nThis entire administration is complicit in mass firings of veterans. They don’t respect us. They don’t care for us. They don’t work for us.\nAll of you who believe they do and support them are guilty.\nIm sorry that many of you think this is twitter. One line commentary.\nYour going to turn VA off, and they want this. To make this location\nthe scape goat to shut down future channels.\nSome folks caught on and wrote there public letters to the Sec of VA.\nThat this is a public soap box. Others think a ugly or vulgar one liners\nis all that is needed. Those are the ones going to get us call cut off.\nDont blow your only chance to be heard other than knee jerk reactions and\nspew pointless remarks. There isnt anything else left and VA wants to\nshut this down too. So they claim people are rude, and so they can go\non ignoring us. Already trying this at the other sec post location.\nIf you have nothing, stand by some of these other people who wrote\nparagraphs of interesting materials. Show them some support. Reply to\nthem and show some form of unity.\nUnity on something, anything. All of you agreeing on one idea would\nchange everything. Not even a person, just the idea. Areas that could\nchange if you all said it together.\nCan go on 1 thousand one liners, or all of you saying one common idea\nat a time till VA deals with it. Vote as a group. Take charge. Get past the\npersonality part, focus on content. Something simple, super easy. Like\nopen door policy so you can be heard.\nVA wants to say it lost control here, dont let them. Its already showing at\nthe VA Secretary Doug Collins addresses Veterans benefits rumors in latest\nvideo. VA wants this quiet again, no problems. Silent hallways.\nRealize what is happening here. Censorship is already raising its ugly head.\nYeah…and our social security is safe too…President Musk will take his chain saw to all the benefits of Americans paying taxes, while the Manchurian Candidate Trump serves as the puppet!\nHistory has proven ithat if lies are told often enough, they become truth. SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!\nThis guy is lying to us.\nHe’s not to be trusted. Now he’s also looking at ways to privatize our care – in the false interest of “efficiency” – when in reality it’s all about shifting the money to private insurance where we know care-denials are rampant and 21% is siphoned directly off of the top for overhead,\nFor a guy who has been on the job about a week, I hope he really knows what he’s talking about. There is a lot at stake here: I’m in the process of qualifying for a lung transplant. My condition is slowly worsening and ANY interruption in services will put me at risk for the rest of my life, bothe pre- and post-operation. There are lots of reasons for being incredulous, especially since my sources aren’t just the media. We’re forced to ride this rollercoaster to the end and I really pray that everything works out well.\nAnd we all pray with ya brother at arms.\nThere is very little chance that your hopes will be met by this man. However, there is still plenty of room to resist.\nFor one, you can educate yourself and others on the nature of “probationary” status in federal service. These aren’t necessarily “new” employees, and these cuts are NOT targeted to any reasonable notion of “efficiency” or “improved care”.\nYou can also contact Congressional representatives, or even attend a protest (health permitting). Let’s not throw in the towel just yet.\nI would like to know if you are a veteran ?\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nHere at the Milwaukee VA, programs are already being abolished without replacements and veterans with PTSD are getting LESS care. The art programs here that have helped a lot of veterans are being closed and deemed as unnecessary. It is very important for vets with PTSD to have more than talk and group therapy, we need to truly connect with our emotions and art, music, and recreational therapy does that and connects us with other veterans and the community. Changes that are taking away programs that veterans care about is actively happening.\nI don’t believe any trump appointee.\nNeither do I,\nI can only hope the words you say are true but I don’t trust any of you MAGA radicals, show me! The trend on the right is to put down true patriots and cut everything so the rich can have everything, stripping away things that benefit the rest of us. We are all for trimming excess and have our taxes spent wisely but the problem is in determining what is essential and not, and how it is done!\nWhat is this about cutting VA benefit payments. We laid down our lives for this Country, what more can we do. I’m 76 years old and cannot work anymore, I have service related problems that prevent me from sitting or standing for longer than about 20 to 30 minutes at a time.\nDelta Echo India – hire: Collins\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nThere is too much hatred on this website. You folks if you have a real problem at your VA, then immediately ask for a patient advocacy to help you with your situation.\nIn his first term it was clearly documented Trump lied or made stuff up on the order of 30,000 times. Now his co-president seems to spout stuff clearly not true. You do their bidding. How can I possibly believe anything you say? This whole government just makes stuff up.\nMore than 55 years ago when I was in the Navy we had a verb, a transitive verb I should add, that meant to discard without thought and depending on context to discard with contempt. It was to shitcan. Neither of our co-presidents served or have a clue about what it means to serve and the one who would be king avoided service and has clearly demonstrated contempt for those of us who. When it is expedient or useful I fully expect you and they will shitcan us without hesitation. I will enter all my information below so you can target me for shitcanning.\nObama didn’t serve – he said that he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala didn’t serve – she said nothing at all about it. So, I only hear people slamming President Trump because he wasn’t in the military. Biden et al and Kamala lied much more than 30,000 times – probably 300,000 times – as everything either said was a lie or some kind of unintelligible statement that made no sense at all. The Biden admin broke laws constantly because they felt that the Constitution and Bill of Rights have no placed in the government of America. All they wanted was to make sure the com mie doctrine was in place everywhere they could get it. During Trump’s first term, promises made/ promises kept. He has made this his pledge again. DOGE is making public all of their findings – transparency is taking place every day. Trump has done more in 1 month than Biden et al did in 4 years and all of it is good for the average person – DOGE is showing where all of our tax money is being spent – it sure isn’t being spent here in America. The list of items is unbelievable – there are many people in Congress who are getting kickbacks of money to add to their coffers, millions of $$$. Trump wants the budget balanced, just as in any business. It will happen under his administration. Promises made/ promises kept. The promise list is getting checked off quickly.\nGetting appt. Less than60 days\nJust because DOGE finds an item due to noticeable $Dollar signs does not mean the entire item needs to be scrapped. The slash and burn attitude of DOGE is reckless and irresponsible thereby not good for the Vets and their families. DOGE is having a negative effect on our population.\nSadky I agree with everything you write.\nUP to this timrI have always received excellent care from the VA.\nWhy sadly? Like you the va has only done well by me since the day i returned from nam. Kudos and thanks to the va. I will however say that since 1971 the va has gotten better as time went forward\nDOGE is only having a negative effect on the population who didn’t vote for Trump. He won the popular and electoral college vote. DOGE is NOT being irresponsible and they are not harming any veterans or their families. My husband and son are disabled veterans. During the Biden admin, my husband couldn’t get in to see his primary care doctor for over 2 years. His appointment was canceled every time. Now that Trump has taken over, my husband has seen his primary care physician twice and he will have a cardiac appointment for the first time in 3 years – all of those appts were also canceled. So, things are looking up for our family with President Trump at the helm. The last VA secretary, Denis McDonough, gave the money that was allotted to the VA for the veterans, to Mayorkas in order that he would have more money for the illegal aliens. Our social security money has also been going to illegals and they have been given free health care – Medicare and Medicaid – which American’s have to pay for – even Medicare. So, I think you better read something other than what you’ve been reading or watching on the news. You’re badly mistaken about Trump – he love his country and will do everything in his power to make America a wonderful place to live, again.\nThank you very much sir. We all know the news media likes to put out false information to confuse the Veteran’s who haven’t any way to see the real info put out by the VA unless they go to the VA for an appointment. My son works for you all and he was worried and I told that his job was safe.\nDEI hire.\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nI have read some impending doom remarks. I am appalled by some of the things being stated. Those of you waiting on your money, that’s not new, that’s the military units not knowing what needs to be done. Paperwork for retirement must be done 6 months out from your MDR. Disability claims take time with processing. I’ve been through it and if you don’t get the right physician and the verbiage isn’t correct it takes longer for them to adjudicate your case. All this again is based on the assigned people with individual cases. Remember you are not the only person applying for both retirement or disability. Since it’s only been one month as of today, please be patient with changes that are yet to come. The VA didn’t get this way overnight, so Secretary Collins is working hard to correct the negligence from years of not caring about the veterans. Keep positive and keep pushing for Veterans Rights.\nI agree. Been waiting 18 years but can still walk, talk and have all limbs. I can wait a little while longer. Cervical and Lumbar spinal replacement. Let those with better reasons to go first.\nAgree Peggy. I am a disabled veteran who fought the VA and won. My case was a lot of work on my part, the VA will not help and no one knows my case better than I do, so I treated it like a job . President Trump runs his mouth a lot so is misquoted a lot, that’s just who he is. He is NOT a politician, thank God for that. He has never disrespected us, and he will cut disability to veterans. DOGE has nothing to gain by looking into individual medial claims, that is not its mission. BUT to look into the VA itself, oh yes lots of DI there. Go to the main hospital and see groups of 2 or3 employees standing around chatting with each other. Obama did that–“created” jobs by splitting the job of one making it two.\nNo. While it’s true that this is a poor choice of forum for benefits issues, it’s not entirely irrelvant here. We already suffer obscene wait times and disturbingly careless denials of claims. “Probationary” does not mean “new employee”. It also includes anyone who recently received a merit promotion.\nThere’s no patience to give here, and asking it is harmful and insulting. These acts are not the march of positive progress. If the VA was actually overstaffed, that argument might have some play. But there’s simply no sense in which that is true. They are directly attacking on our benefits, in an underhanded and possibly illegal way.\nThere’s no honor or decency in the behavior of Trump or his loyal sycophants. Please stop spreading disinformation.\nI also was in Vietnam from January 1968 to February 1969. I was also exposed to Agent Orange. When I returned, the only help was to get a house or a loan to go to school. There was no medical help. I had a host of problems and didn’t know what to do, so I became a heavy drinker. Luckily I married a woman who refused to give up on me.\nMr. Collins, I’m copying a fellow vet’s comment. Heartfelt.(You know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been)\nSincerely Vincent A.Velasquez\nMr Secretary Collins\nThank you for standing up for our Veterans. I believe with your expertise and willingness to do the right thing will allow our Veterans a sense of honor and dignity. I would be willing to help in anyway I can here in Arkansas. I feel with my 35 years of military expertise\nI can be of assistance in the VA system. Thank you for your time. Respectfully,\nMAJ Penny Smith (Retired)\nWhat expertise would that be? He has no medical training.\nThank you for your service, I think some people here are just mad because they lost the election. Give the man a chance, then comment. Lashing out without merit is just petty.\nThis is Bull S—T, our VA System is loaded with too many top level managers, out dated web site, not easy to navigate and slow in following up on care. I’m 86 , 87 this and it appears to me ., that gthey drag my needs out and make me do cartwheels and the deny, it appears that they can’t wait till I expire ? so they don’t have to deal with me. Our commander in chief just froze VA workings and when you go in the Drs Nurses and workers are not smiling any more. NUFF said, Anchors Away, Hooraa, Semoer Fi.\ni do not know how any veteran could vote for this coward. my family has a total of 68 years in the army. we are not suckers or losers.\nPlease do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation. Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit. Our family goes back to Revolutionary War days. Take care my friend, thanks for your service, and have a Great weekend.\nIn context, he called service members suckers and losers and he has denigrated US on more than one occasion. Furthermore, his disgraceful actions have led to friction between our allies and the USA, caused the deaths of countless members of both the military and special agents out in the field, and has sowed hate and distrust within our own population, all while kowtowing to the most oppressive regimes on the planet.\nAnd lets not even start with what happened on January 6th, 2021, when he called on his supporters to attack the capitol in one of the most brazen insurrections in US history, while allowing for his own vice-president to face the gallows.\nThis man is not fit to be the president of the United States, is an active participant in the destruction of our government, and a puppet for foreign powers that enjoy seeing the chaos Trump is sowing in the USA.\nHe isn’t taking it out of context, friend. When a man says “I don’t respect you veterans,” believe him.\nMy family was of the original Virginia planters, and no one has ever reneged on their military duty. Your “boyfriend” has received SIX deferments (heel spurs) for service in Vietnam, yet his orange ass is all over golf courses! And, remember how the CRETIN refused to honor our WWI vets during the 100th anniversary while in France because “it” didn’t want to get “its” hair wet in the rain! Here’s your threat to the previous post, you SNITCH! (Please do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit). Put my name on your list, you coward! You’re thinking like the Clown in your making threats to fellow veterans. Remember who always had your back!\nSo why not post the context then, if that’s your sticking point? Maybe because it doesn’t make it any better?\n“In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.”\nLove the gaslighting you done.\nyou are lying , Trump never said that….. it was even never proven, quit spitting out lies\nThen you better tab Obama and Kamala cowards also. Obama didn’t serve – he said he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala – she didn’t have anything to say about serving in the military one way or the other. Walz – he lied about what he did in the military along with some other candidates who also lied about even being in the military. So, if you have nothing to say about the above people not serving, then don’t say anything about Trump not serving. Also, you have taken what he said out of context, like all good little com mies and the legacy media. All of you are NOT supporters of our President, you apparently voted for the opposition.\nThis is awesome news. Finally, sense making in the government. Slash waste, fraud and abuse, and focus the money on where it does the most good. As for Elon Musk and DOGE, if the paid for political hacks in the Washington swamp and career bureaucrats can’t stand getting an audit…that should tell you something.\nThere are three parts of Government. Executive, Judicial, and Legislative. The Executive branch is headed by the President as such he has the authority to open anything to anyone he wishes. This is the way any large business is run. To be effective he must delegate duties since he can’t do it alone. I have received a number of letters in the last few years about data breach’s regarding my personal information, so I am afraid my secrets are already out there to a lot less honest people then those working for DOGE. Do I agree with all the things going on in Washington? No, but I am sure that no matter the person running the place in the last few years the Executive has be run by various people in a fashion that has been shameful and needs an adjustment. Unfortunately going after new hires is the only way to do this until a system is established to weed out the deadwood in some of the offices.\nTime will tell but given President Trump’s well documented history of mockery and distain for America’s veterans coupled with his near total disregard for the qualifications, political courage, or character, of his appointees, it is difficult for this veteran to remain optimistic about the future of VA healthcare.\nWell said.\nSo, here is the thing, you survive the President….that is how it has been for the last 30 some years…we’ve never been given a good choice…so you survive the roller coaster ride, I am hoping that we will come out better on the other side. But, I will tell you that no matter what happens, the VA (and all of us veterans) will still be here. I mean, hello, how much have you overcome since getting out of the military? I was in during the Cold War era, and even as a female I was treated horrible by civilians (so that is my vote for NO PRIVATIZATION)…the civilian world is full of a bunch of greedy a-holes that we have to deal with on a daily basis, so if we need to cinch our belt for 4 years, figure it out. You were not given the tools you got while you were in the military service to wallow around like a civilian, so honey’s SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP. WE WILL SURVIVE, we did not learn the skills we learned while we were in to just turn into a big baby….we ARE survivors and we WILL survive whatever this presidency throws at us…\nAnd not for anything, but I agree with what they are doing, not HOW they are doing it, should have started with a FULL AUDIT….but, the waste in our government (wouldn’t you like to be able to give yourself a raise??) is out of control. I do hope that the country continues to back its veterans, because FREEDOM is NEVER FREE. It is paid for by those of us who choose to raise their hands in defense of our country & Constitution (not the government). So, stay true to yourself and don’t just go with the flow. Find what you need to do to keep your future bright, because it is UP TO YOU…I am scared of what will happen, I only have the VA for medical, but I will survive no matter what happens, because I survived being Active Duty! If you survived Active Duty, you can totally survive THIS!!\nI trust Musk and Trump to do for us what Biden only lied about.\nTrump promised to abandon our allies and take away American freedoms. You voted for that.\nI have been a Republican all my voting life, all the way back to the Young Republicans for Nixon’s 2nd election.\nHowever, I will not vote republican as long as Trump and his lackeys are selling our country.\nI can’t believe you and others are allowing this to happen.\nYou had two chances to stop it the first time around and did not! I did not realize it at that time either, but that is no excuse for what is happening now. He is killing people, don’t you see that?\nPlease show me I can vote GOP again. So, STOP LYING, and empowering liars. You’re handing our country over to, well I don’t even know what to call them.\nPlease wake up and stop him!\nWhen will you honor your pledge,,,,\n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic”\nYou are full of S–t\nVeteran’s medical records & personal information privacy was not addressed.\nWould like a straight answer.\nIs DOGE having access t this information??\nHe just addressed it and stated they do not have any interest in our info, they want to make sure that any contracts that are in place to service us veterans, that money is actually spent on us. Please stop listening to people who haven’t a clue or just spreading misinformation. By the way the SSA and IRS have people in the same capacity as DOGE and they look at your information. Do you trust them not to divulge your information. Just relax.\nI trust them more than I trust a bunch of tech-bros and a billionaire with hundreds of billions of dollars in potential government contracts to decide how our taxes are spent. Musk wants SpaceX and Tesla embedded in government spending so he can get richer. He doesn’t care about you, and Trump will go along with everything he says. I can’t understand why people like you continue to ignore the blatantly obvious conflicts of interest this administration continues to inflict on our country. Did you buy Trump stock, or his rug pull meme coin too? How many times must you be scammed before you wake up?\nMy friends work for VA and are veterans, their data was breached by DOGE!\nThank you for your input on our concerns over our benefits that might be cut!?….\nSincerely,\nMrs. James R Cales\nThey will not be cut!\nOf course they will! It’s in Project 2025, and so far they have been following to a T. People said it was not the president’s agenda, yet everything being done right now is straight out of the Heritage Foundation agenda. The budget proposes to stop any funding of Medicaid. Any vet in an elderly home or on long term disability depends on Medicaid to cover costs of healthcare. Vets in memory care will be left forced out of their homes.\nGood initial message. Let me know if I can help.\nI can’t believe what little faith you have in president Trump and musk after what you had under Obama and Biden. Neither one loved our military and Doug Collins is a good guy. I’ve watched him for a while now and like him a lot. It’s been a month give them a chance. The other two presidents have tired to ruin our country. I know it’s a long process and it’s hard when you’re hurting. My husband was 25 years navy and never wanted to put in for his VA” he said others needed it more. But we finally got him to realize how many problems he has. We’ll see what happens. I love America and president Trump.\nFirstly, I’d like to thank all my fellow veterans for their service !!\nIf you don’t believe that there is fraud, waste, and abuse of your tax dollars then you are absolutely right not to support Trump and his designated representatives in DOGE. You can join in with the politicians who are fighting against the audits of organizations like USAID, but unlike those politicians, you won’t be making any money off of it. The entire process is going to take time and will require some sacrifice, but the ultimate goal is to improve the economy, shrink the deficit, and put more money back in the hands of the taxpayers instead of other countries and economies. Refusing to believe the promises made by the president are somewhat illogical as he has most definitely worked to keep so many promises that he made during his campaign in the past 30 days.\nIn the end it’s all up to you and, of course, this is only my humble opinion, but I choose to believe that the purpose of the cost cutting and auditing of our government offices will eventually help us all to be stronger financially and fiscally.\nI would never see a fellow veteran hurt, and do not believe that in the long run we will be. If you disagree then is your responsibility to get in contact with your elected representative and make your concerns known. If you do not do this writing something here will not help you at all. Let your voice be heard where it will help.\nWe are strong and we are many !!\nI’m the wife of a highly decorated US INFANTRY Corporal. we’re in our fifties. My MOM has TDS. I am a 3xTrump voter& hubby voted Trump/Vance in 2024 after YEARS of political apathy …WHY is my Mom(&many others) he’ll bent on saying that Trump will cut Veterans’ benefits/cut seniors’ medicare etc etc…\nI’m honestly confused. I live in “stoopid liberal Colorado(Yea gangs of Illegals!)” It really seemed as though things were better 2016-2020…\nPatience is a virtue. It took four years of tyranny to completely destroy the US economy and security, it will not be fixed in a month. I wish all would look at the way it was in 2016-2020, he did his best with a democratic/Socialistic Senate and House. He knows what needs to be done, and now he has the citizen, senate and house republicans majority backing him. Just got a few bad weeds to pluck to get the garden producing real produce.\nAll I know is my 87 year old father’s VA funded homemaker services are ending this week. The VA did not call him or notify him of this. They notified the health care company that they would no longer be paying for services as he no longer qualified. Nothing about his condition has recently changed. His housekeeper stated that about 10 of her client’s home care services were cut this week. She states she will need to look for another job. When the VA cuts benefits it effects many different people. My father is not able to care for himself. I will need to do more for him now. This will make it more difficult for me to work. Everything has gone up in price and I am no longer able to afford groceries most weeks. Now I will not be able to take extra hours at work. I am poor now and it appears things are only going to get worse for the working poor as prices on everything continue to increase. I don’t believe what this man is saying because I read the recommended report that called for drastic cuts to the VA. I also know that Trump has made very rude comments towards Veterans on more than a few occasions. He has never shown any respect for Veterans, and I doubt that will change. I am sad for our country today and just hope that the US does not abandon it’s Veterans. God save the USA\nHi, Melissa. We’re sorry to hear about your father’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWill the Manila VA get upgrades . Not only are there older vets here\nThere is a growing community of DS,OIF,andOEF vets coming to the Philippines. Plus many at the VAhere wish they could offer more services (non-admin)\nMr. Secretary could you please look into what I am about to tell you please sir. The VA is making veterans like me that got separation pay pay it back by taking our disability checks away from us to pay back the separation pay. This separation pay was given to me almost 30 years ago and they are taking my disability check away from me that I need and I know a lot of veterans had this happen to them also. This isn’t right. As a veteran we shouldn’t have to pay back any separation pay. That pay helped me transition from military life to civilian life. Veterans like me depend on our disability check to help us each month. Please look into this and please get this stopped not just for me but to all the veterans, Thank You\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nI’m concerned about African national has access to my information not only on VA.gov. but also social security. I request that my name and info be removed from what ever info he has.\nIf you ever used PayPal he has it already.\nIt seems to me that you have never been independent and always pushed right wing policies. Will that change in your new position?\nwhat absolute bullshit. Trump Doesn’t Give a Damn about Vets and Musk’s Team of Juvenile hackers are attacking agencies that were investigating Musk. Paying Vet’s their Benefits or providing healthcare Doesn’t Profit the Billionaires one bit, and so will fall under the category of ” wasteful spending”. Trump has already Violated the Constitution averaging about Once per day since he Entered office, why would he stop at those of us sworn to uphold and defend it?\nOh! It seemed as though doge is a good things. I certainly do NOT want one more illegal alien crossing the border. Poor Jocelyn Nungarye, Laken Riley and too many others DEAD at the hands of illegal criminal aliens. We’re home owners, live less than 5miles north of EDGE OF LOWRY….THIS CRAP must end…our children deserve much better\nThey’re not doing a single thing for the American people, except taking our money. The president should care about ALL of the people. Not just some. He refused to send disaster relief to CA because we have a democratic governor. He has sent not one cent. That’s disgusting, and I’m sick of it!\nI would assume that you know for certain that DOGE is doing good things as you call it? Although I am in no way advocating illegal crossing into the US, those “Aliens” as both the president and you call them are human just like you…oh wait, their not from here so that would make them aliens…I see now! Do better\nHow can you sit there and blatantly lie. We were at our VA today half of the staff are gone. No one to help take him to the 3rd floor . You are a disgrace . You do not support the veterans only yourself and orange.\nShort and to the point – Well Done. Looking forward to the ramp-up of even better VA Healthcare. Best wishes to you and your team.\nWell done President Trump appointing Doug as our Secretary. I have nothing but the highest praise for our all three departments of the VA. Specifically, the VA Health and the VA Benefits Administrations. Excellent health care since retiring in 1991.\nDoug, you know where the Left and Democrats get their information. It’s truly sad when veterans feel disenfranchised. I’ve always recommended fellow Vets visit one of the well-qualified Veteran Service Officers (VSO’s) at the various veteran organizations. I am a Life member of both the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). America has great veteran organizations that provide support and guidance. BZ to you and your team.\nThis is a weak scripted response, as a Nam era veteran having served this country it is a disgrace what Trump and Musk and his bunch of cronies are doing to our country and hard working Federal Workers. Actions speak louder than words Mr Collins.\nMy uncles BOTH served Viet Nam in the Marines. I am still not convinced that “Let’s Go Brandon” would’ve been better for our Vets&Seniors’…. MY HUBBY is a Ver(US INFANTRY CORPORAL 1988-91\nMy husband is a disabled veteran and receives very good care at the VA. With that being said I know that there is much wasteful spending within our government. I wish President Trump would drain the swamp and not go after the Department of Veterans Affairs employees who only make 60,000 a year.. go after the big guys who are cheating the system. Why are so many people in Congress millionaires?\nThat’s not what DOGE said they have laid off 1000 employees though it’s not a large amount we have been having trouble with appointment’s and reliable transportation to and from appointment’s. So I guess I’ll just have to wait and see if things get any better which I seriously doubt.\nEver run this past the attorneys, Doug. Is this use of government resources for politicking? Does this violate the Hatch act? Just askin’, ole buddy.\nI’m a disabled Army veteran of 32 years, and a bi-lateral amputee. I’m still waiting on my SMC case to be heard, and I definitely can’t afford to lose what I do receive from the VA now. Trump should be hands off on a lot of things, and the VA should be one, as well as the Pentagon.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nHe has only achieved in destroying our democratic govt. It’s gonna take decades to pay off all of the lawsuits due to the illegal acts of Trump and Musk. You just can’t fire govt employees, especially those who have employment contracts, just because you want to.\nSubmit a congressional inquiry to your state’s congressman. This expedites your claim. If i remember correctly, from the time congress sends your inquiry over, the va has 72 hours to respond? I used to work in claims department and I myself have personally submitted a congressional inquiry and it did get addressed right away. *stuff they don’t tell you*\nThank you Sir.\nUnder no circumstance do my husband who is a US military veteran and myself support Trump and allowing Musk an unelected private civilian have access to any federal agency or make changes that can impact our well-being negatively. You, the VA, have the responsibility of protecting veterans their families and dependents from losing or reducing their monetary, health and mental healthcare, and other benefits. As it is the VA system is very dysfunctional and nearly impossible to navigate through, making unlawful and careless changes to the system makes it more difficult to almost impossible for veterans to access such a vital component for their well-being, especially the elderly, mentally incapacitated, and those with brain injuries sustained while serving to protect this nation.\n?? Veterans Deserve Better – Why Is the VA Ignoring Its Own Laws on Missing Service Records?\nThe VA is failing thousands of veterans by ignoring its own regulations regarding missing service treatment records! 38 CFR §§ 3.303, 3.304, and 3.307 require the VA to accept secondary evidence (lay statements, medical opinions, post-service treatment records) when service records are lost or destroyed. Yet, veterans are being denied benefits because of the VA’s own recordkeeping failures.\nThe VA Secretary has no power to say there will be no cuts. The Elon/Trump dictatorship will cut whatever they want, without regard for anything except their own pocketbooks. They will cut our benefits long all while adding to Elon’s billion $ government contracts. Don’t pretend like anyone in this administration is there to do anything other than make money for themselves.\nI got ripped off by the VA for 8500plus. All I got was a run around,not even a disabled tag for my truck.\nI am retired DoD employee, and a Vietnam Veteran that is 100% TDIU and I find it very hard to swallow that we have DOGE who is going around pulling people from jobs. The people that they’re targeting are those who are on Probation, and the government hire these people because of the downsize that they have had over the years. A person have to remember that when a person retire, they need to train another person for that job, and in most cases they’re hiring two for the one person, because of all the work a excuse my words (an old timer use to do). I know as a retiree I filled the work for two or three personnel at time, and now a new person have to come on board an learn the work by themselves without the aide of an old timer. Yes, a lot of stuff has gone internet or through google, but there’s lots to be said about book knowledge and not just Google knowledge. I hate the fact this administration is firing people without knowing the work that is being performed. As far as the Secretary saying what he’s saying, I to will hold you to your words. After all Congress passed a lot of others to their word, and now they’re going around chopping people from their jobs, just be of trump says so or this person name musk. The word must to mean only a bad odor, and this guy is a bad odor waiting to happen. You may not like my words and I don’t care, I’m a veteran and retired federal employee who did his country proud, and I’m honor to have served both. Now, treat your veterans right and hopefully in the future the Veteran Organizations that support the clowns we put in office, will keep their mouth shut and not support any politician and see if they can elected on their TRUE words. If anyone comes after my ss, accounts or any of family information, lookout.\nThis dude must think we’re all stupid. The mere fact that he used this snippet to attack the media tells you everything you need to know about him. Donnie D*mb *ss doesn’t give a damn about veterans. We’re props when he needs us for a photo op and we’re disposable when he doesn’t. Never forget these words spoken by Donnie….\nOn disabled veterans\n“Why do you bring people like that here?

In addition to the combat injuries, he is now being treated for leukemia which was most likely caused by exposure to toxins and other hazards in Afghanistan. Based on the PACT Act, he applied for a higher VA disability rating due to toxic exposure, but he has not yet received a response to his applications for over six months. Could you please expedite this slow process.\nLeukemia is a high priority claim. Those are USUALLY expedited. I’d get in touch with your vso or submit a congressional inquiry.\nI was denied benefits for secondary ed because of my advance prostate cancer. informed the va that, I tried penis pump, pills penis ejects still waiting to here back from them\nThanks to everyone for their concerns.

Hey, I felt it was time to retire because I was treated fairly. So, here’s my question; Will the government\nallow the full amount of SS allotted to those, like myself, the framed amount over the time we spent in Private Industry work without losing that money, for working under the States PERS scheduled money allotted? Thanks\nfor your reply. Mr. Keenan PS. Word has it that President Trump is going to pass it thru to follow the new guidelines of Social Security Monies and Government Work Monies. Thank you very much for your reply\nI don’t believe that Trump really cares about our Veterans we need to spend a lot of money to take care of them which is exactly what we need to do ? problems though are that doesn’t help the 1%\nI certainly do not and will not trust any sort of message from The Traitor’s Cabinet. DJT, the draft dogger, called veterans like us “loosers and suckers” and naturally will not stop President Musk from destroying the VA. The VA is extremely understaffed yet 1000 employees from the Crisis Line were summarily fired. Action must be taken to restore democracy in the US starting with Congress stopping the illegal actions by DOGE and the DOJ arresting Musk for his violations of US Law including his fraudulently obtaining US citizenship.\nI cant trust President Trump or Elon Musk to speak the truth when they don’t seem to care about the Ukrainian nation and more about what pleases Putin !!!\nHere here, trumpy has lost his mind.\nHe’s not interested in Ukraine because he has no financial interests there like he has in Russia. And I guess post WWII, the Iron Curtain, and spread of communizism have been conveniently forgotten. Let’s see, Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Crimea was part of it until Puti stole it in 2014. You don’t annex by force or coercion. Puti didn’t stop with Crimea…. will he stop at Berlin this time. Trump makes America great again after he makes Trump interests great again. Putin’s puppet.\nI’m pulling into your way as secretary of the veteran administration. I’ve been trying to get my disability for the last 56 years. Haven’t got anything.

IF YOU ARE NOT DISGUSTED BY THAT, THEN YOU ARE WORTHY OF THE POST YOUR IN!!!!!\nI hope things get better with clearing cases. I’ve been waiting since July 2024 just to add my dependent and there’s not been a single update to it on the web site since it was submitted. I’ve called several times to inquire about it, all they can tell me when I call is that’s it’s “pending.” Secondly, it took nearly a year for my disability claim to be processed and came back with only a partial rating. I’ve resubmitted additional information, it that going to take another year to get feedback on? Finally, I’ve been trying to get a community care referral for a procedure that is authorized by the VA, and if authorized for one Veteran, it should be available for every veteran. However, getting this referral is proving to be very difficult with multiple hoops to jump through and the providers at the VA hospital not being very helpful or being cynical at best.\nI just find it disappointing that illegal aliens, those on welfare or receiving other benefits seem to get signed up and receiving these benefits with little to no effort while Veterans have to run a gauntlet of numerous obstacles to “maybe’ get the benefit they have earned.\nI wish Secretary Collins much success in his new role and I’m hopeful he can make the highly needed improvements. Hey, how about reassigning those 87,000 positions authorized for the IRS to the VA instead?\nI do not trust Doug Collins nor any other Trump appointee. Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, is taking a meat axe to our Federal Government, firing people with institutional knowledge and civil service protections, while Trump shreds the Constitution and the Rule of Law. We will be lucky to come out of these next years with our democracy intact. Quacks and incompetents are being installed to head cabinet positions. Real people are hurting as a result of Trump and Musk’s actions. More cuts are in the offing and no program is safe.\nTime will Tell !\nGlad to hear benefits earned will continue. Perhaps vets can finally receive the federal mileage reimbursement for medical appointments vs the .41 cents per mile and a deduction of $3 each way. Fifteen years ago, homecare nurses here got $.58 per mile. Wonder what VA employees get for their qualified mileage reimbursement.\nOoooorah! You said it, now stand by what you’ve said and do it! Semper Fi!\nI see when he was asked about DOGE getting access to Veterans personal information how he really didn’t answer that question just like the rest of them avoid answering a simple question.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, you need to resign effective immediately and should be banned from any position within the VA or any Federal position.\nThank you for your comment.\nThank you Secretary Collins! I am looking forward to your leadership with this Department. I really appreciate your transparency and your energy! As we say in the Navy….BRAVO ZULU!\nFiring thousands of employees… but healthcare won’t be affected? How dumb does he think we are? Has anyone else been at the VA and heard anyone talk about being over staffed?\nTypical trump boot licker trying to save face while he plans to stab us in the back later\nI’m a 77-year-old veteran (1968-1975, Honorable Discharge). I just watched the President of the United States with his [virtual] arm around Vladimir Putin, announcing to the world that Ukraine started the war that has devasted their homeland and killed thousands, followed by a rebuke by Vice President Vance of members of the European Union who had the audacity to suppress AfD’s assault on a demoratic society, and a clear move to abandon allies of 80 years for a war criminal. So perhaps you can excuse me for being skeptical of anything coming from this Administration. The G.I. Bill gave me a career after service, for which I am extremely grateful. It is devastating to see what has become of a once-proud nation.\nThank you for your service. I wish you well\nAction has a Reaction. Ukraine did start the war and Putin said “OK, let’s go”, and moved Armored vehicles into position. Biden got USA involved with dollars and the game was afoot.\nWatch your back veterans! He sounds like a Trump suck up. Remember that Trump dodged the Viet Nam war and has no respect for veterans!\nTrump did not dodge the VN conflict. Bone spurs are identified by X-RAY not by a letter from daddy who was a land developer not a government official with pull. Clinton dodged the war by fleeing the country.\nThere is a special place in hell for you and the others that bend the knee and kiss ring. Sacrificing veteran care to line your pockets. Utterly shameful. You are a disgrace and I hope both sides of your pillow are hot in hell.\nFull cowardice on display. They break us in their wars and then get upset when it costs money to keep us healthy. DOGE and trump will cripple the VA. Firing thousands of “probationary” employees to save a buck in the name of “efficiency”… what a disappointment and disgrace.\nI was out drinking… I just woke up… what’s going on? aslo… how did you get my email?\nMr. Secretary,\nI was not deceived by the rumor reports but appreciate you prompt reassurance.\nAlso I regret that the VA is subject to such false reporting.\nI don’t understand what ‘website’ is required to leave a simple comment,\nThank you for the straight dope on the situation. Much appreciated.\nThank you for your service to America’s Veterans !! Please keep up the Great Work !!\nVery disappointing message delivery and content. Hypocritical and disingenuous when thousands of VA employees have been axed by an administration that is doing immediate and lasting damage across all Federal agencies. As happened with the Bureau of Land Management 6 yrs ago, there is no concern for the impact, only moving in a manner that eliminates opposition and any effort to reduce costs responsibly.\nMr. Collins, your political invocations show you are as crass and uncaring about Veterans as the angry orange you serve. You do not serve nor honor my 20 years (and 3 family generations) of Navy service.\nPlease inspect the Tuskegee va\nI found Mr. Collins remarks about veteran benefits being cut or threatened as a standard “talking point” that is the answer for any DOGE complaint about acting as a legitimate branch of our government. Congress needs to stop allowing him and his team to have access to any records of any Federal employees. Don’t trust the media but trust Trump, Musk and you? Your actions speak contrary to your message. Will you resign your position if this continues or will you stand up to Trump and Musk?\nMy experience with the VA where I live has been A plus for 35 years. I have watched them deal with staff shortages, uncertainty with funding and now the threat of having their position eliminated without a valid reason. I appreciate everything they have done in the past and worry about how the future will look.\n50 years in the VA healthcare system since 1969 Vietnam I am in Shock and want to Scream\nMike R, that is straight left-wing conspiratorial fear-mongering garbage. You’ve trusted an incompetent federal government with your personal information your whole life, and didn’t think twice anytime they’ve asked you for your personal information. It’s utterly laughable that you think Trump and Elon are going to take your banking to steal your VA pension.\nI’ve been waiting 3 months for approval…To have a tooth fixed!!! The government has ALL our information already.\nYou either work for them, are 100% leftist, or NEVER had to deal with the VA.\nQuit bellyaching…Most of us want the VA FIXED.\nWalter Cook\nDo you honestly believe there is no waste that can be addressed? They need to go over all the contracts from govt. contractors go bankrupt without finishing a project. Salisbury NC VA. Contractor won a bid for a 3 story parking garage. Stopped at 2 levels because of structural problems. And most of the 2nd story is unusable because of those same problems. The contractor got paid $10 million and declared bankruptcy. The VA needs to stop paying for shoddy construction. And seeing how the democrats are the first ones to call for cutting DD funding. I am more worried about them. The standard talking points I’ve heard over the last40 plus years is everything is good. While waiting weeks or months for appointments. especially to see a specialist. No communication between VA hospitals or clinics. Ask about it being computer generated and was told they don’t talk to each other unless specifically asked. There can be improvement. If I believed the media rhetoric the world under Trump would have ended in 2016.\nSecretary Collins,\nI am going to hold you to this. I am in a 6x month estimated waiting period myself for backpay owed. I, also, 100% support DOGE. It needs to happen, and that much is obvious to me. I read a lot of scathing comments below that make me think there are simply bad actors who aren’t actually a part of this crowd within them, specially the ones that have nothing to do with the VA or your message since it appears that anyone can comment here. I can tell you that it has taken many years to get as far as I’ve gotten with the disability process. It shouldn’t take actual years for this. That’s ridiculous.\nDear Secretary,\nI hope your words are of truth: only time will tell. Please help the displaced federal workers that need help as well.\nRespectfully,\nChief Johnson\nIt won’t be understaffed if you privatize it\nNEVER PRIVATIZE. VA offers the best care. Average wait time in Civilian Hospitals for new patients, 26 days. I never wait that long. The VA offers community care if they can’t see you in a timely manner. Privatized Care will cost taxpayers (you and me) lots more money. The care givers are not specialists in war time injuries. This is a money grab scheme.\nGood idea! But I am 1-Hr+ away from any VA facility anyway.\nWhy not just cut the VA down to just those required to treat and work with serious war injuries and severe PTSD. For the rest of us, make it so we can go to the Dentist, Doctor, etc. without having to wait weeks or months for approval from “Community Care”. I have been waiting over 3 months to get my tooth fixed. THAT is RIDICULOUS!\nBut, yes, privatizing would be better than it is now.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nTrump/ Musk, sounds like brown shirts to me.and all off his picks have drank the cool aid.\nI served three tours in the Nam with the USMC, was wounded twice ,suffered broken bones and am a diabetic from exposure to agent orange. I do not trust you or any of Trump/Musk appointees, none of you are qualified for the jobs you have. I firmly believe despite your statement that if Trump/Musk says slash and burn the VA you will be the first to light the match . I believe that the VA secretary should always be a COMBAT VETERAN!!!!!! How can we trust a president who buddies up with a Russian dictator????????\n100% Agent Orange Killed Us In Vietnam We Just Haven’t Died Yet Sprayed and Betrayed 1967\nI agree with you he sounds like a Trump suck up! Please remember this in the 2026 election when no Republican is standing up to Trump!\nIgnorance. Remember this, no Democrat stood for us. Or cancer kids,gold star moms ECT. Y’all are all about me me me me. Pogs\nTotally agree, he’s going to prove to be another spineless jellyfish making excuses for commander bone spurs, who dodged the draft.\nSince when did he buddy up with a Russian dictator you ate up POS.\nYou did not address the firing of 1,000 probationary employees, many of whom at Vets.\nDoug , STOP! We know from the video you are a Trump Boot Licker\nAnd we also know you’re a liberal. You are using hate and media propaganda instead of common sense. We have a $70 trillion debt. Mostly to China. $5.6 billion a day interest payments. A almost $2 trillion deficit. Now give me any examples of democrat cutting or even slowing of any spending. And I’ll give you one to start. They always throw the Dept of Defense out first for cuts. Guess where the money for the VA comes from. It’s all part of the DOD budget. But the democrats always say they would never cut VA spending. But like many it seems to be a case of don’t touch my govt benefits. Go after someone else. right. There are many Vietnam veterans who voted for the change. I’m one . The country is going broke. The left doesn’t care and spends taxpayer money on their agenda instead of the people who need it most. Homeless Vets and other citizens.\nI don’t believe that it’s only Liberals as you call them that use hate or media propaganda instead of common sense. Yes we do have a huge debt, many people act as if it juts happened in the last 4 years. Government spending has always gone both ways, when one party is in office, the said spending is just right, but the other party is in office they are wasting tax payers money. We have a tendency to make excuses for whoever we voted for so hat we can feel good about our choice…but always remember, common sense is not common to everyone!\nWhen will choice program come back. President Trump said he would privatize the VA, I can hardly wait.\nMe too, John. VA incompetence is stunning.\nThis is embarrassing, you’re just towing the maga republican line blaming the media for your parties inability to lead. You sound like a used care salesman. Your fast talking isn’t fooling anyone but the fools. Keep your politics out of our medical care.\nQuick question, tell how firing people is going to improve the speed of getting an appointment?! Get your head out of this administrations a$$, the military is apolitical and so should be the VA. You’re an embarrassment to the uniform.\nWe have to take to the streets\nFor what. If the democrats would agree to cuts for their pork barrel agendas like sending 50 million to house illegals in hotels in NYC or for DEI programs in other countries. Building a roads to nowhere. Maybe the deficit and $70 trillion in debt would be addressed and our benefits would be better. Instead of attacking the ones trying to fix the mismanagement of the country for the last 50 years.\nWhat about the reduction of disability benefits due to household income thresholds with reductions of disability payments to start at houshold incomes of 125k and a reduction to zero benefit dispursed at 175k. That was voted on and put in place that is supposed to take effect in April of 2025 , but keeps getting pushed out and delayed, please address this.\nTypical Trump dog. No substance with more BS. Agency under staffed but does best it can. Then it gets cut more. Doesn’t look like anyone has any balls. Your just another puppet.\nWhere has it been cut. 1000 probationary people out of 475 thousand. Nationwide. If it’s like the FAA firings it’s janitorial and lawn mowing people. $70 Trillion in debt to China. $3.6 interest on that debt daily. Almost $2 trillion deficit every year. Is that BS. You find running a home or business in that economic state good? Which party always calls for the first cuts to be the DOD? Democrats. And guess what that’s where the VA gets its budget from.\nTrump spent $15 million to attend the Super Bowl. He spent $5 million to take a lap around the racetrack. Numerous times golfing while Americans are crying and unsure of the future. Disgusting. He cares nothing about us.\nI would like to know why the V.A. took the 100% rating from me and put me at 30% by in 1988 . Now the V.A. a few years ago gave me the 100% rating. I was in the Army 1966-1988 . August of 1968 I was in the Army hospital at Fort Polk La. The Army doctor said no more active duty for me. He said I had a bad Heart and could not stay in the Army anymore . So from August 1968 to October 1968 I had no duty . So I sat around for 3 months till they said I could go home with only 30% disability rating . With a bad Heart it was hard to find a job. In August 1981 the V.A. said that they are going to put a artificial heart value . I was rated at 100% 1981. In 1988 V.A. said that I wasn’t sick anymore. They put a valve in so I am OK . So from 100 % back down to 30% . So a few ago 2023 THe V.A. put back to 100% . So my Questions are Why wasn’t given a medical discharge in 1968 . Question 1988 to 2023 why wasn’t I given back pay . I have had a very sad life because of not being able to work .\nTypical VA BS. Over and hour drive for me so I use Community Care, but approvals take forever…But so does sitting at the VA.\nSounds like they should give you a LOT of backpay, but wouldn’t hold my breath. And what’s the deal with all these people in the comments bashing Trump??? He ain’t even been in a month. Not like he can make it much worse?! Bunch of Hanoi Jane wannabes trolling the comments!\nPraying for You and all our Brothers & Sisters dealing with the bureaucracy.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nWas your bad heart the fault of the military..\nI hope all of you that have posted comments or asked questions including me know that the only ones reading these comments/messages/ETC are us and the waste basket, but its interesting to see that many of us have pros and cons on the VA service and the past and present Government. the race of the Turtle and the Hare that the Turtle won bec of caution, determination and a a real consistent approach Once again todays venture Haste makes Waste\nSecretary Collins, I am Henry Dittman, Major, USAF (ret). I just watched your Video Message, re Real Status of VA vs Rumor Mill Vapid, Vacuous B.S. Thanks for the update.. I look forward to seeing you and the NEW Leadership in VA providing support and help for ALL of Veterans.. I have confidence that Pres. Trump wouldn’t have selected you for this position if he didn’t have the UTMOST confidence in your capabilities. Press On, Sir…”Kick the tires and light the fires” and get this Bird in the air!!\nMan have you drank the cool aid!!! This guy is a suck up to Trump who was a draft dodger for Viet Nam! On the plus side the V.A has treated me with respect so I wonder how many of them will be let go?\nIf you look at the rest of the very unqualified people filling cabinet positions, you should understand this one is only marginally better. He’s still a Trump sycophant but if you think that’s okay, so be it. I don’t hold people who openly flout the Constitution in high regard.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When his only self-serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nJust a note. Most of us totally support President Trump’s efforts with DOGE. I for one am very thankful for my local VA and the truly dedicated staff (Topeka, KS).\nI have to believe the new Director of the VA is sincere in his remarks but I have to add my story. I’m 75, I previously applied twice for VA Health Benefits, denied both times. Since the PACT Act I did extensive research to establish and prove my ship did gunfire support in areas of Agent Orange exposure. After 40+ years I was granted VA Health Benefits under what is labeled “Naval Herbicide Service”. I guess no-one wants to say Agent Orange out loud.\nFurther research indicates I have several conditions related to NHS/Agent Orange and I have applied for compensation. That was right at five months ago. I do understand there are probably thousands now applying. Most of my Vietnam era group do not have much time left.\nI received a letter February 17, 2025 dated January 31, 2025 from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs saying they are still processing my application for compensation and apologize for the delay, I would be notified upon completion of processing. No estimation of anticipated date of completion.\nToday I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.\nDoes that sound like a disconnect to anyone else?\nRome wasn’t built a day, and good things take time. I want to believe the Director’s optimism will come tobe.\nMost of us DO NOT totally support Cap’n Bone Spurs, speak for yourself!\nonly 2 types of veterans exist that don’t support trump. 1 the stolen valor veteran 2. the never seen combat veteran with no pride in their country. put down the kool-aid and your M.A.P magazines.\n“Today I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.”\nwhat proof do you have of what you are saying or are you just repeating what the trumpers are saying? so much of what has been said as truth turns out to be lies. i pointed out the story in Military.com and for some reason it never showed up here. it is about the firing of over 1000 VA employees.\nI’m sorry it’s been delayed for you. I think the statement about completing faster than ever is because of the recent hiring of claims processors. Especially since the PACT Act, the submissions has increased. Compared to years past, they are moving quicker, slowly chipping away at the backlog in addition to working priority claims (think terminally ill, old Veterans). You can view the current inventory and backlog plus more online. Currently sitting just under 950k.\nUntil recently, processors were working mandatory overtime. Since that is no longer the case, the backlog and claims inventory may go up.\nI hope your claim will be completed soon so you get the benefits you deserve!!\nYou know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been. The armed forces of America plan and hope everyone gets KIA. It’s cheaper. Much less Veterans to deal with. The only thing is they do need clinics for their budgets. It makes it easier to steal the money. Because it damn sure isn’t going into my bank account. When I see this BS rhetoric. It just pisses me off. I was so ripped off spent 4 years in. Did a good job. I volunteered for extra duty. I went to extra schools so I would be extra qualified so I could volunteer for extra duty. I was passed up for promotions because I am a white man. I entered the Army as an E3 due to four years of JROTC. I GRADUATED Lieutenant Colonel and battalion Commander. I earned drill team Commander for the last three years of high school. We won every drill meet. My Jr. and Senior years to give others schools a chance we went as exhibition only. Because we were so strong and flawless. I and team did not mind. I was even in honor grad in basic training as best drilled individual. I have letters in my file of accommodations. But my skin was too white. When I got to permanent party every single private was promoted to E4. Going through the ranks before me. I entered the Army as an E3 but time in service and time in grade did not mean a damn thing!!! I was even a sponsor for a few of the new E1’s. I was married for 2.5 years before ever joining the Army. Reverse racism really is alive and well. I shook the hands of all of the privates that out ranked me. I was happy for them they did very well and deserved the promotions however I thought I worked as hard if not a little harder due to my volunteering for extra duty. I just wasn’t dark enough. You know you have to keep the numbers in balance. Don’t want too many white men getting a head due to white privileged you know.\nOh Daryl…..so sad you are….and a racist too….white supremacist?\nI read your post. I agree with you. If you’re not black or LGBT or over qualified you get passed over. Black and queer privilege now. I’m praying things change. Thank you for your service. I served in the Navy.\nWow, you actually said that out loud, thank you for being transparent. Many people who have that mindset don’t they just simply smile and deny the most qualified person of color. I am unsure what world you experienced, let me know where this is at where people of color are moving ahead of white men, white women, asian, indian? Please we want to go, quickly!! Minorities always have to have more education, more experience and change our appearance to be considered. Hey all you blacks, listen up there is a place where we are getting put ahead of white men and women WITHOUT EXPERIENCE and EDUCATION!!! We going please tell us. Believe it or not, some people are actually more qualified than you, yep even black and brown folks. I know in my family alone we have: Neuro Surgeons, medical doctors, lawyers, chemist, educators, high ranking military enlisted and officers and News reporters for major channels, but they all have that 1 thing : EDUCATION and they have to EARN their positions and watch people with LESS get the positions. BTW, I watched young white girls get positions without experience because white men wanted their cute faces over qualified WHITE MEN, and us others!!! S\nI read both your posts and I totally disagree, if you really did your homework you will see that there are far more white soldiers in the military than there are black or any other race, and I know that LGBT isn’t a race or on any soldiers report card! Do I think that there is bias when it comes to promotions yes I certainly do, but to say that you have to black or queer (as you put it) to get ahead is just not true. Also there has NEVER been and will NEVER be Black or queer privileged in the military, and praying that things change says something about you!!!\nI am a third generation veteran who is currently APPALLED by the actions of the new presidential administration. Reading through the comments of my fellow vets, it is clear that the overwhelming majority DO NOT HAVE FAITH in Trump or Musk, or that their actions won’t end up hurting the VA. You know, so they can free up funds for giant tax cuts for the wealthy. What we really need now are strong advocates for the VA, not apologists for Trump.\nIts interesting about the Office of DOGE Government efficiency is a big joke i am from CA so i am very aware of\nGovernment efficiency i continue to watch one of biggest income state in the USA 5th largest in the world going downhill every day because of the ridiculous spending of taxpayers money Just like some of the large major companies that have gone bankrupt because no one is controlling the expenses I hope that the rest of the country doesnt follow CA I just hope that Trumps effort to Make America Great Again Hasnt gone to far in Haste Makes Waste\nit would be better to proceed with caution\nI have no faith in this new administration. The lack of professionalism is astounding. All my years working with Veterans I’ve never seen such unprofessional behavior by a top leadership. This isn’t a campaign rally it’s a honorable institution serving honorable Veterans. Secretary your statement about not reducing Veterans Administration funds is a very empty statement. 1000 VA staff members have been fired. Many of them are Veterans and some are Disabled Veterans. You are a not in service to Veterans. You are only serving the traitor Trump.\nWell, at least the news is good, we’re finally getting what we voted for, even if the video link doesn’t work ( yes, I tried it in both email and browser, it doesn’t let me watch it because it says I’m not signed in, even though I’m signed in over on YouTube. And it doesn’t give me an option to sign in on the video itself).\nYou are an absolute liar. Lying to veterans is a total disgrace.\nIf you think trump/musk care about you, you are not very intelligent.\nnever trust trump and musk to do what’s right for veterans. I understand there could be a real reason behind the job cuts, but I’m do not understand the inhumane way it was done — no respect\ntrump is a draft dodger and has already called veterans “suckers and losers”. He does not care\nYou sound like a liberal communist. Trump cares about Veterans . Biden had soldiers sleeping on a garage floor, Trump put them in his Hotel. He is cleaning up government waste and strengthening our military and stopping this woke crap. Things will be way better under this administration. I’m sick of ignorant people commenting negativity.\nHey Kiva, Sounds like you should do a bit of fact checking before you accuse people of sounding like a “liberal communist” and being “ignorant people commenting negativity.” How do you interpret Trump caring for veterans when he faked a bone spur to dodge the draft, calls us suckers and losers and does not want to be seen in our company? Maybe you’re watching too much Fox News.\nWrong, Trump doesn’t care about veterans or the military, never has, never will. Maybe you should wake up, read something other than drivel, and realize you’re supporting a draft dodging coward.\nClearly, your TDS has warped your simple mind. Clinton was a draft dodger and all you dimocrats still worship the Clintons. Trump never called our veterans “suckers and losers”. Where was your outrage when Biden said “clap, you stupid bastards” right to our active duty military? Typical dimocrat hypocrite!\nYou might look into just who the new sign in procedures are supposed to be helping. I am an 82yo Vet who has been using the MyHealth.va site for probably as long as it has been in existence with varying degrees of success. Now comes the new double sign, double verification system which is completely beyond my grasp. I have spent many hours trying to comply but as things stand now, On March 4, I will no longer be able to access my information. I suspect this is make work for contractors. How do you “make thing simpler by adding extra steps? Anyway, I’ll survive until I don’t. Good luck in your new position.\nHi, William. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThanks for sharing that was total BS. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nDon thinks we are suckers\nand so must you.\nI’ve had several issues with injuries/issues caused from the military service that have been denied several times. I really don’t expect anyone under Doug Collins or, Doug Collins himself to read this, but my faith in the VA is very little.\nHi, James. Thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank you for caring for our veterans.\nI feel like we have one of our own (veteran) watching our six. All the best to him and president Trump.\nThis is the “VA”!!!! I believe are benefits will probably WILL be taken away. It’s just a matter of time. We do not get any raises! Except for COLA. That’s all we are worth. I do not believe President Trump will take it away but I know we will NOT be getting any raises!!!!! We are veterans. They don’t get raises. They aren’t worth any more money than they are getting now. We can’t say a word in fear of it being taken away. It has taken 34 years to break the $500.00 mark of monitory payment. That’s Thirty four years!!!!!\nThis sounds good, but doesn’t align with reality. Perhaps the large # of VA employees released occurred after this video was cut. Regardless, it’s difficult to believe that this downsizing will improve services. There has to be an impact when those who operate and support the Veteran Suicide Hotline receive notices of termination. Veterans are reporting scheduled appointments are being canceled. The messaging from the VA needs to be factual and convincing. Today that is not the case.\nBut no medical personell have been terminated from the VA. Only staff positions, most of which were working from home and did not want to return to the office. Regardless, these personell were offered a buyout which many accepted.\nPersonally, I have had no problems with appointment or staff having received 2 appointments in the last month. I think that we need to be a bit patient considering that the new administration has made many promises and is working tirelessly to keep those promises. Cutting waste, fraud and abuse….Money that is going to politicians instead of to the deficit or the taxpayer… is going to go slowly but I choose to believe that the process will ultimately prove to be a good one for our country.\nPoliticians never fight so hard as when their illicit money is threatened and a lot of our politicians really seem to hate the idea of organizations like USAID being audited.\nLet’s not make it a problem before it is a problem. If you really think that there is foul play afoot you should contact your senator or congressman and voice your concerns.\nJust my humble opinions…. Thanks for your service !!\nLarge number? 1000 out of almost half a million VA employees. Probably like the FAA firings. Janitorial and lawn maintenance staff. I’m sure that will create a care problem from the medical staff. Or those doing claims.\nDoug: Tell me what DOGE and the Muskrats are cutting and eliminating that constitutes waste, fraud, and abuse in the VA. Tell me exactly how you and the Muskrats are improving efficiency. I’ve had enough of ‘it’s gonna be great’ BS. No transparency, no TRUST!\nElon Musk literally posts on x all of the fraud and wasteful spending that DOGE finds. Just because you don’t bother to go read the information, doesn’t mean that it’s not out there.\nI am positively tickled that we are finally purging these money laundering mafias like US”AID” that have infested our government, squandering tax victim money on ungrateful foreign parasites.\nI’ll believe it when I see it. With all due respect, I don’t buy anything that comes out of trump’s mouth, which makes me extremely disinclined to believe anything that you tell me, Doug. You seem to be in lockstep with this administration, and I don’t trust them at all. Trump likes to give lip service about caring for the troops and for our veterans, but his actions tell another story. The bottom line is, you have to prove it, or it’s just more glad handing and empty promises.\nI would like to know why so many Veterans that spent as much as 25 years in the military and took a government job that are at the end of their probation was cut just because they are on probation.\nThey spent their entire life in the military and now fired, regardless of their job and outstanding skills just because they had not completed their probation period.\nVeterans are losing their homes because our President doesn’t want to take the time see what their job is. If you are telling the truth then make Veterans on probation exempt.\nGood Morning. Thank you for reaching out with this video. Unfortunately, your words offer little assurance to the disabled veteran/military retiree communities. You talk about “media” stories mentioning “possibilities” that veteran benefits may be cut, that “means testing” may be used to determine disability benefits, and the privatization of VA services in general. I read a lot and can honestly say I’ve never read a story about veteran benefit cuts originating in main stream media outlet. What I’ve read are main stream media stories reporting on alternative media sites bringing forth this type of information. Isn’t that the job of the media? To inform us? You say none of this is true. Not surprising, you’re the only person saying this. You come across as a fast talking late night TV Cal Worthington and his dog Spot type car salesman. Hello! Red Flag! Here’s the deal. We all know your unwavering loyalty to the current occupant of the White House(forgive me, in no way can I type or say his name) got you the job. It’s just too difficult for many of us to trust you for choosing loyalty to a convicted felon over the millions of veterans you now serve. Good luck.\nThank you so much for communicating with us Veterans! Please keep on doing this. Maybe a monthly meeting online summarizing what is happening with the VA.\nWhen will these benefits be published in a handbook print again with ALL contact information.?\nWhen will the VA have a functional phone system that is user friendly to discover these benefits that only a few have knolage off?\nMr. Collins:\nThank you for your video about VA benefits not being cut. Your information is appreciated.\nA suggestion….begin your videos with the information you wish to share. Do not belittle the media. Much of what you criticized the media for is exactly what this administration is doing on a daily basis.\nI am proud to be a veteran. And I applaud the VA for the excellent care I have received. And I hope the VA continues to care for all veterans in the best ways possible.\nI am an elderly female veteran who lives on my VA and Social Security benefits . If this administration touches either of these two things, there will be an uprising like you’re never before seen. We’ve worked all our lives to get here, broken down and barely getting by. And I’ll be damned if I (and millions of others) will stand by and allow billionaires to play with our lives and our money!! Our government had better put protections in place and stop this madness going around!\nThank you so much for running this explanation. WE never know who or what to believe when so many negative “reports” come out the “liberal media”. So, it is really important that our SecVA comes right out and clears up the matter. JRMack, IL Army Vet\nWow! So much hate and discontent on this forum. I’m surprised the VA allows. This content to be on a veterans administration site. So many people really showing their ass. Sad. To the folks who screen these posts I would recommended to your chain of command, that this forum go away. The hate and finger-pointing here solves nothing. There’s a VA phone number to call and I’m sure there’s a VA email to send your grievances to. This forum is nothing more than watching MSNBC.\nAgreed. US ARMY vet.\nAmen my Brother Veteran. We served with Honor and our president Trump did us right in his first term, and why would he change now. Anybody remember serving under president Carter. I do.\nYou could always volunteer to not come here or comment yourself first. How about that & not parroting far right propaganda? I vote for that.\nI applaud the VA keeping all comments. It’s important. To provide some context, I’m a retired veteran (25 years, from E-1 to O4), and just yesterday, I was speaking with my neighbor and good friend who is 86 years young. He had tears in his eyes as he asked me if his 30 years of service (ending as CMSgt) meant anything, given the state of the government right now. Grow up and read the comments. You might learn something about people who’ve sacrificed and then who get the runaround, or worse. Not everyone has a great story to tell; some have reasonable grievances and concerns.\nVince, I totally agree with you!\nTell me how these DOGE clowns and Musk are qualified to tell Veterans what is a waist of money on them? Musk has never served in the military. He knows nothing of sacrifice or hardship.\nMusk is a naturalized South American……and the richest man in the world. Donnie despises him because he is richer than Donnie. His time will come\nMy faith in the VA is now in question. I don’t trust the officials in charge under this sorry presidency and administration. Waiting for the next Russian hammer to fall. I’ve had wonderful care for the past 30+ years and now I’m concerned. I’ve already had medication issues over the past year.\nI’ve already had medication issues over the past year….That would have been under Sorry President Biden.\nI appreciate all the good work that you and the new Administration are doing. Here’s a stupid question, tho – why is there a higher threshold & harder process for us veterans to get the help that the government’s already promised us, when they already have all our paperwork and we already proved ourselves to them, than it is to get welfare, even as an illegal? ??\nDoes *any* other government agency penny-pinch down to a fraction of a percent? Is that *really* a necessary part of the process when tax victim dollars are walking out the door by the billions and trillions unaccounted for (until DOGE), squandered on thankless foreign parasites?\nmy prayer is that your leadership will I have been trying to get my case settled since 2014 my claim was successfully remanded 10/2024 but still no settlement information to this date.\nIs the Russian hammer in the room with you right now? Geez, are you hearing yourself?\nDid anything happen to our VA benefits in the first Orange Age? No, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized only after president Trump with the VA into shape, and VA Healthcare massively improved (and then went back downhill under Creepy Joe).\nSrsly, seek out the mental health services on offer, this paranoid hysteria is not healthy, and is frankly unbecoming of a former servicemember. The Cold War ended over 30 years ago, let it go.\nThank you! People bashing Trump and saying stupid ignorant comments are ridiculous! A bunch of liberal Commies…\nWell, you folks keep on calling liberals commies–Right? Well how about Trump supporting Putin against Ukraine and Europe! Last I knew, Putin is a commie! But I bet you people love him as Trump does! Yupper, Putin is innocent regarding his invasion of the Ukraine. And it is Zelenskyy who is the Dictator and the Ukraine which started the war? Donald has serious mental issues it seems. And as for the VAMCs, if not for Democrats, they wouldn’t exist. Republicans time and time over the years have never voted to increase funding for veteran services! And in fact the opposite is true. They love pulling the wool over veterans eyes by putting forth their age old argument, that my cutting out waste it will help veterans, when in fact, what they really mean is that they believe way too much money is spent on veterans care and services.\nAnd as for you all complaining that you are waiting years for VA approval of care for your conditions, just read this and then go thank your Republicans for trying to do nothing to help our veterans:\n“The legislation is an attempt to hide the fact that House Republicans already voted to immediately rescind $2 billion from funding for claims processing and appeals, health care both within and outside of VA, research, and education and training for veterans as part of the Default on America Act.\nThis bill:\nDrastically underfunds by $14.7 billion the Toxic Exposures Fund, created with bipartisan support in the PACT Act to ensure veterans exposed to Agent Orange, burn pits, and other toxic substances will always be cared for.\nUnderfunds other veterans’ medical care needs by allowing the transfer of $4.5 billion in medical care funding to areas outside of health care.\nCuts funding for critical military construction. The bill backtracks on our promises to our servicemembers and their families by cutting military construction by over $1.3 billion compared to the current level.\nBuilt on a framework that fails to treat veterans’ medical care as its own funding category, thereby jeopardizing veterans’ health care.”\nBut regardless, thank you all for your service!\nBut I guess it was ok when it was Biden or Obama getting bashed…People have the right to their opinions, you don’t have to like it or agree but its their right, it doesn’t make them commies (as you call them), it makes them American!\nDear Secretary Collins,\nRegarding the 1000+ VA employees you just fired, what are you doing about them? Why fire them with NO heads up, in the dark of the night, no severance, or opportunity to move to other positions? What about those VA employees that you pulled the rug out from under who are Veterans that wanted to serve the Veteran community by working for the VA? Those who you fired that are Veterans, disabled Veterans, who moved cross country specifically for that job? For those who are living paycheck to paycheck that now may need to seek out homeless services?\nFrankly, if you want to cut costs, try examining the obviously CORRUPT Compensation and Pension “examination” process!!! I’ve been to numerous of those hideous “exams” where the “examiner” flat out LIES on their DBQs/opinions!!! Seriously, they flat out LIE!!! And even though the Veteran is supposed to have the benefit of doubt, the VA ONLY goes by the lying C&P “examiners” who strategically move the conversation from the Veteran’s symptoms, issues, residuals, etc., etc. to get the Veteran off track and then say, “Well, we’re out of time, now. Thank you for coming in.” And they got their nice big pay check and bonus from the VA!\nThe Veteran NEEDS to be able to have access to the blank DBQs ahead of time, to submit DBQs from their own doctors who know the Veteran better, and have immediate access to the C&P “examiner’s” completed DBQ/opinion immediately following it’s completion… PRIOR to the VA making a decision, so the Veteran has a chance and PLENTY of time to respond appropriately! That whole system is corrupt, corrupt, corrupt, and causes far too much stress and anxiety to Veterans who already experience much of that! And I know I’m not the only one who knows this.\nSUGGESTION – reach out to YouTube channels: CivDiv and Veterans InfoTap (or Veterans Daily which is a collaboration between the two).\nAll that said, I understand the reason behind the job cuts, but I’m at a LOSS for the nasty, deceitful, and inhumane way you went about it… much like running those employees, and their families, over with a bus!\nPlease do something to help them get back on their feet after this disaster? Are you going to help them with job placement services? Food assistance? Rent/mortgage assistance? Please do SOMETHING for them!\nAlso, PLEASE do something about the anxiety inducing corrupt C&P “exam” process!?\nThank you for your attention, and for tolerating my “passion” and deep frustration with this “system”!\nThank you for your service, and God bless!\nSandra (Sandy) Sutter\nHow is firing long-term employees ( a lot of them are Veterans themselves) helping to streamline our services? Will you stand up for us when things are wrong? Or are you just going to let Musk cut our programs that help Veterans????\nMR Collins,\nHow can you possibly believe, we believe,\nthat Trump/Musk will leave the VA unscathed?\nMusk is tearing thru the Gov’t agencies at alarming speed, with NO oversight. He is not an elected official, nor does he have the authority to de-evolve the Govt just because Trump has such a big grudge against everybody.\nMusk is overbearing and has ABSOLUTLY no cares for/about US Servicemembers. Neither does Trump.\nWill you RESIGN if your statements prove UNTRUE?\nBy the way this was on the latest feed from Military.com , “VA Crisis Line Employees Among Those Fired Amid Federal Workforce Purge”\nGood afternoon, Sir. I just read about the lies that the VA is looking into cutting down service for us veterans. At the same time, you just stated that is not true, thank God, please keep doing whatever you can for us Sir. I wrote a letter to our REAL President Mr. DONALD TRUMP, about the fact that us veterans must wait years after we applied for our disability. I applied back in May 1923, and I am still pending for that to be resolved.\nI personally, have seen other veterans that have waited for a very long periods of time, and the representatives that are performing this process, at the VA department, I am not sure of what the problem is, but it takes years to receive their so needed and well-deserved disability pension after serving our country, and plenty of us, like in my case, I was exposed to Agent Orange during my service in the Army while in Korea during the times specified by the V.A., within the notification that I received in order to apply, the VA informed me that I qualified to apply for a disability pension.\nI have submitted every piece of documentation, including letters of support from all my doctors’ Nexus Letter on my behalf my documents that the VA asked for, but I am still waiting for a positive resolution to my case.\nI am now wearing a pacemaker because I had a stroke back in 2023, receiving an IV Infusion once a month, and according to Doctor Viviana Temino, MD Section Chief, Allery & Immunology under her treatment since 2014 and I must continue receiving the Infusion for the rest of my life do to the fact that I was exposed to Agent Orange, also now I have spots on my lungs do to the same exposure and I am also been treated with Sulfamethoxazole 800mg 4 capsules a day for the infection in my lungs for at least six months. Furthermore, I have to take numerous medications every day, three different inhalers because of COPD and Asthma, blood pressure medication, blood thinners because of the stroke because different blockage in my veins, including my brain and to top it all, I also have been seen by the Psychologist due to all the stress and a counselor once a week because all the waiting, going into three years. Medication for my stomach, (acid indigestion). Under the care of DR. Eduardo J Lopez M.D. with the Blue team at the VA Hospital, him, Dr. Lopez, also reiterated the fact of that my treatments are forever Dr. Italo Novoa M.D., my cardiologist, and I am constantly going to the VA hospital for all the treatments that I need plus all the medications that I have to take daily because my immune system has been destroyed by the effects of the Agent Orange that was, not only this chemical agent was sprayed in Camp Stanley because of this camp was so close to the DMV zone, but also was stored in the same camp, Camp Stanley.\nPlease Sir, we can use all the help that we can get.\nThank you,\nArmando G. Torres\n[Editor: Please do not publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nAre you claiming to be over 120 years old and that agent orange was used in Korea rather than vietnam? ? Something about your story doesn’t quite add up.\nI know how you feel. Took me several years to even get my records. Vetrecs kept telling me they didn’t have them.\nWith all due respect Sir, you must be the oldest veteran alive. Thank you for your service.\nIn other words, “DOGE” which doesn’t really exist, does have access to our personal records. Thanks for clarifying.\nthey are screening emails. Trump: “Senator McCain was a loser “he got caught” You Trump-loving vets need a reality check. Trump was Never a friend to vets. His only friend are stacks of 100 Ben Franklins. He refused to visit the American cemetery when invited in France…and then labeled them “Suckers & Losers”\nFour more years of lunacy. I pray we still have a country after he’s gone. Don’t forget, he is challenging the 8-year term limit. He wants to be a Putin or Stalin. Die a King.\nIt’s funny, after president Donald J Trump took office, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized, and I got enough of those Benjamins that my wife and I were able to buy two homes.\nJessica, please look into the mental health services offered by the VA, this hysterical paranoia is not healthy.\nAs for mccain, well he should have known better to stay a hero rather than letting himself become the villain. Please, enlighten me as to what is respectable about an old man wanting to throw young men into a meatgrinder of *his* political ambitions?\nSpot On Jessica!\nNice try! Got any other fantasy BS you’d like to share with us! Got to admit that people like you sure have learned from your dear leader, how to lie so well!\nTDS – was debunked!\nhttps://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/06/27/biden-trump-first-presidential-debate/about-those-suckers-and-losers-00165625\nJessica, quit telling lies….. Trump loves the Veterans….. sucker and looser was more then once debunked as a lie…. you people get all upset bc he wants to clean house. you know there is a lot of waste in the VA….. office staff is the once who got let go, didn’t want to go back to office, nor medical people……. I had never problem with my VA in Asheville, you believe anything the left made you belief…… you had no problem the media told you Biden was fit for 4 years, I bet you voted for crackling Camel\nTrump did not refuse to visit the American cemetery in France.This excerpt from American Military News offers an explanation: “President Trump reportedly had no say in the decision, as the Marine Corps and White House Military Office made the determination collaboratively with the Secret Service that Paris’ overcast and rainy conditions posed too much risk for Marine One to fly to Aisne-Marne, which is about 60 miles northeast of Paris.”\nHow many of the staffers fired were veterans themselves?\nCan you tell me how many veterans have already been fired from government jobs\ni am a Viet Nam veteran. i was exposed to agent orange. I am receiving benefits because of this exposure. please continue your vigilant concern regarding veterans benefits. Thank you, John Brich\nI see you are a TRUMP fan so I do not know what to believe.\nFirst and foremost advice, stop the politics. This video and message grated on my severely. An assurance that benefits will not be cut would have sufficed. I assure you, inserting politics into the MISSION of serving veterans will only lead to undesirable outcomes. I previously worked at the VA at the management level and political stances and opinions are not to be voiced publicly.\nThank you for the reassurance, good luck, and best wishes in your new position.\nFor the moment, I will take the Secretary at his word that VA benefits will not be cut. In comment on his remarks about DOGE and the press, I emphasize the following: First, it is the responsibility of Secretary Collins and his staff to fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. Our tax dollars fund this audit and investigative function of the VA and other law enforcement agencies. Elon Musk and DOGE should not assume this duty. Second, the rule of law and ethics in government matter. Musk is riddled with conflicts of interest as a large government contractor and an owner of regulated businesses. Numerous Americans have lost their federal jobs based on the untruthful disparagement of federal agencies and disregard for the rule of law. We have regulations that provide fair procedures for the reduction of the federal work force and expenditure of our tax dollars, which have been dashed by DOGE. (BTW, the name “DOGE” is an unethical promotion of Musk’s favored cryptocurrency and misleading because it is not a Department of government.) Third, demonizing the press has long been a tool of regime change. Information is power and both Musk and Trump control significant media outlets. Secretary Collins should not attack the press, especially when transparency in government is in peril. (As an aside, our names and emails are required to post on this site. I do not consent to allowing anyone connected to DOGE to have access to my email. )\n“An” email address is required, but it doesn’t have to be yours. I’m using Senator Rand Paul’s\nI’m so excited about our new administration straightening this mess out. I’m a veteran and a RN and know first hand the system is broke. Change maybe hard but it’s very much needed! You have my full support! I’m thankful accountability and common sense are now being used, years late but better late than never.\nI have no faith in the VA as long as Elon (the Pillsbury Doughboy) is in charge. Keep politics out you say? Impossible. Everything about the grift-meister Trump is politics. Victim politics. Retribution politics. If put my name to this post, guaranteed he and his band of adolescent hackers will ferret me out and deep six me in the VA system. Trump IS a pathetic example of a human.\nDo you deny Trump & Elon are using the presidency to profit beyond their wildest dream? Wake up-smell the coffee.\nWhat does any of that hysterical paranoid rant have to do with the good news from the va?\nPlease, look into the mental health care services that are on offer.\nWhy would we trust what you are saying? Time will tell and I hope you are legitimate, prepared and successful in protecting/improving our care. Thank you.\nI had to wait 3 months just to get a dentist appointment. I’ve been waiting 3 months just to get community of care to approve a doctor that I’ve already selected. What the hell are you fools doing? No thank you King Trump. I don’t like what you’re doing.\nMy husband has to wait longer than 3 months!\nHi, Carl, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nRight!!! The firings have already started in the chem dependency program. Doug will role over like all the rest of the lackeys.\nP.S. I have been under the care of VA medicine at Lovell FHC for 20 years. I would not trade it for any amount of money. I’m not going to bore with how they discovered my Agent Orange cancer on my very first visit, or how they rebuilt a badly mangled foot from and accident, or any of the other dozens of services they have provided me over the years. I have sat in waiting rooms and listened to vets my age and younger complain about waiting 30 minutes. Complain about this. Complaining about that. OMG….millions of people in this country never get to see a doctor and these entitled little f-cks just complain about services they get for mostly free. I’m going to offer a totally white American suggestion. If you are so f-cking unhappy with VA medicine, take your sorry -ss back out into the private healthcare industry and die sooner.\nThe worst thing VA did previously was ordering referrals of Veterans to community service. VA administratorts , prior to referral, never checked the delays in the private sector service being requested, which in Albuquerque are ~twice the delay at VAMC. VA administrators never insisted on getting reports from the referral doctor, and paid for private care before checking that reports were received: payment should always be deferred until reports are in the VA record. A delay of 6 months to being seen in the private sector can change a cancer prognosis from operable to inoperable. All attenmpts to “privatize ” VA should be strongly resisted. In most cases VA offers the most rapid access, excellent care ,and adequate follow-up.\nA reduction in force is a reduction in benefits. Our VA office wwnt from 4 to 2 people, and changed the blood draws from appointment to walkin. My friend who has advanced parkinsons had to wait 2 hours for a blood draw. He is in no shape to wait that long. Please try to keep in touch with ground conditions so you wont look so out of it.\nBro, IDK if you noticed, but the VA offices have been short staffed ever since the red-plague lockdowns, just like every place else.\nIs there anything that this Musk “presidency” would lead you to believe anything they say ? unvetted..not elected…has added billions to his private funds…please, we had to take tests (ergo the ability read and comprehend) to join the military…we are not stupid!!!\nDid you pass a basic civics test about how the American government actually works??\nDo you understand that Elon Musk is *not* the president, nor was he on the ballot, nor can he ever be POTUS, because he’s South African by birth?\n“I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans.” So we “get rid of…”, people. Firing approximately 1000 staffers, is sure to help with veterans health, claims, well being, etc. Great quote from the White House clown show.\num….you do know there are 371K VA staff in America right?\nReally want efficiency get the contractors out of VBA. My experience is unimpressive. I was referred to a contract nurse to assess my heart. Nurse did not take an EKG. Nurse asked me about medication and measured my scars from the heart surgery. Later I received notice that I must have an echocardiogram and drive about 40 miles to the contractor’s site. I live less than a mile from from a hospital with clinics. Finally I was told I needed to get a echocardiogram and have it faxed by a suspense date. Called my cardiologist and arranged for the echocardiogram. Contractor is churing account for profit. Sent to a NP with post doctorial work in PTSD and the NP was to evaluate me for hypothyroidism. Said I had no symptoms. I suggested I had no symptoms because I have been on medication for years and treated by the head of dendrochronology at the Univ Maryland Upper Chesapeake Hospital He wrote a letter that said I he has been treating me for this for years and stated that I had something that was 30% disability in the law. VBA questioned. Seems the VBA contractor has a list of service providers and picks the next on the lit rather than a provider that is near the veteran. Look at that scheduling process.\nFunny my simple dependency update has been sitting untouched since submitted back in July 2024! Can’t imagine those actually needing something done when a simple dependent correction can’t move.\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAre you a disabled Vet? I am and it sounds like you are not…\nI am a disabled vet and agree with his comment\nWow the true TDS is someone who worships an orange, privileged, racist, silver spoon, veteran hating, criminal draft dodger.\nI agree with all the people pointing out that the Muskrats are not qualified to do any adequate work on saving money… except for moving it to Musk and other billionaires — and the criminal draft dodger, as you rightly point out.\nI also think that military leaders should hold strong to truth. If all people would speak up, we could stop the tearing up of our country.\nDOGE under Musk has only hackers. They have NO forensic accountants to look at the data they have stolen. The are yelling fraud and waste but can’t prove any of it, and they are not being held to account. I don’t believe that the VA should show then a thing unless there is oversight by competent independent accountants and others who understand how things work. Musk and his bunch no nothing about how government programs function and they have no idea how many people they have already seriously hurt. And they don’t care.\nAnother LIE from the musk trump regime\nAnd your evidence for this is where? Surely, as a fellow former servicemember yourself, you would have enough integrity to not be making false accusations, would you?\nYou and the new administration are cutting VA workers without justification ( or even knowing what they do) how is this going to help veterans ?\nAnother trump liar. Its sad you are lying to our brave veterans. And horrific that you support the self proclaimed King!\nHe doesn’t care about anyone including you. You are a pawn in his ugliness. He will get rid of you and retaliate against you too.\nVeterans deserve to be treated like hero’s, not rump and muskrat.\nI feel sorry for your family, they must be so disappointed and shameful you.\nI am extremely skeptical of what the Secretary is saying. What exactly is doge doing? What has the Secretary permitted them to access? There appears to be little or NO transparency!!!\nMr. Secretary, No, DOGE is not a government entity and the VA should NOT partner with musk.\nYou will be striped by so called DOGE and the veterans will suffer. Mark my word.\nEach tim Trump has said that something is off the table the cuts happen anyway. He said he would review his list of insurrectionists and if they were violent they wouldn’t be considered. Welllook what happened. Now he’s looking at Madicare. My dad CMSgt. Z.C. Littleton is 93 and served in the Air Force in SAC and involved in many operations during the Cold War including Operation Chrome Dome and in and out of Vietnam while we lived at Naha, Okinawa and Clark, PI. Don’t blame me if I don’t trust him at his word!\nWhat insurrectionists? Are you talking about the political prisoners that were kidnapped for simply exercising their First Amendment rights at a public government building? Yeah, you sound like another big mouth civilian Army brat who never actually took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\nNaval officer Robert A. Heinlein was absolutely right, it was a mistake to allow civilian political power over us by something as unearned as birth.\nAirman….you are so wrong. Killing a cop and causing multiple injuries to those protecting our democratic process, was not ‘Patriotic”. They should all still be in jail, not pardoned.\nCDR USN (ret)\nCDR, the only shooting was done by a Capitol police Lt who has since been promoted. He took careful aim, stepped forward and shot Ashley Babbott in the neck. Ashley bled to death as the camera rolled. WE saw this happen LIVE. And there were Capitol cops with long guns right behind her. A cold blood case of murder. That Lt should be in jail, not promoted. Only Capitol cops brought weapons on Jan 6.\nIt’s well documented that the VA recently fired one thousand probationary staffers. This means that benefits are already “cut” for those veterans who need VA services, as the pipeline will get even slower. I feel for my fellow vets who rely on the VA for healthcare and related services and I worry this will only get worse.\nWhy does the VA only allow 100% disabled people to access dentistry?\nthats avery good question i wanted to ask that My guess is that the VA Dentist clinic is most likely an outside referral\ngroup and the VA doesnt want to pay for anyone not havent 100 % disability\nThat’s actually a fantastic question, the answer to which I have searched for far and wide myself. The best that I’ve been able to find is an answer is that way back when, the dentist industry lobbied tooth and nail to not have to accept certain forms of insurance, and here we are today.\nThough that still doesn’t explain why the va’s *own* in-house dentist office is so hard to access even for those of us who are at 100% disability.\nHow many veterans died of Covid 19 from misinformation?\nSir, someone needs to advise you that the Veterans Crisis Line has been cut by approximately 1,000 employees. These people provide intervention when a Veteran is contemplating suicide – a recognized epidemic among vets. Please use your authority to get these people their jobs back with back pay. Allowing DOGE (an illegal and unconstitutional entity) to damage veteran healthcare simply cannot be tolerated. Any and all veteran deaths will be at your doorstep and for you to answer.\nFunny because already up here in Connecticut I’ve been knowington VA thinks I’ve already changed. Their people who are sending emails out to Veterans saying they’ll be out of the office until further notice people aren’t getting through it can be an hour and a half sometimes before you get through to somebody and the folks just seem to be in some kind of turmoil there. And I’ve actually heard it said that yeah we don’t know what’s going on but something’s going on. So when he started his conversation with Trump is doing what he said he was going to do I knew we were for an -ss wipe yeah I don’t think we need to believe this guy look at what’s actually going on they’re cutting people from the Veterans Administration I was told that the only people there weren’t cutting at one of the veterans Administrations are the nurses because they’re essential but yeah they’re chopping people left and right\nWe shall see! Are you sure that there are not medical professionals losing their jobs at the VA???? Because that is not what I heard! Not even those on a probationary hire??? Historically, the Republican Party has given nothing but lip service to the vets! Check it out see how many republicans voted against veteran’s bills! Prove me wrong! Rest assured if I or any other vet suffers any reprisals the news outlets will be notified.\nYou understand president Donald J Trump is not the Republican party, right? He’s the fire we elected to burn the GOP to the ground, and on its ashes build an actual pro-America party.\nBut let’s talk about how many bloodthirsty Democrat cowards sent our people to die in unjustified illegal wars ( fun facts, every American war after World War II has been unconstitutional because it hasn’t actually been voted for by Congress), or how Democrat Golden Boy JFK wantingly sprayed agent orange on our troops knowing that chemical warfare was illegal.\nthey didn’t vote against Veterans, they voted against the pork the Democrats added to the Bill. They only said “veterans” to blast Rs. The worst R was mcCain who voted against Americans, including veteran.\nRemember that his boss called us veterans “suckers” and “losers”.\nDon’t be a sucker or a loser. We worked hard and lost much for the benefits we have.\nHis boss has a 50 year record of reneging on promises. Do not believe him or any of his mouthpieces.\nIam a veteran never had any problems with VA or care . One think I believe tho is that Combat Veterans should never have to beg or depend on anyone but the Goverment to take care of them if you are a combat Veteran you deserve everthing you need to help get your life back and their spouses and kids should also be on the health insurance. Combat Veterans are entitled to more period\nDoug Collin’s word is not enough. There is a $6 billion budget shortfall for 2025.\nOn February 13, 2025, the VA announced the termination of over 1,000 probationary employees with less than two years of service. These dismissals affect various roles, including researchers in mental health, cancer treatments, addiction recovery, prosthetics, and burn pit exposure.\nI don’t trust a word from Collin’s as he was selected by Trump both of them are pathological liars.\nIn their Budget they show $9 trillion in cost savings. No comment on where the savings are coming from;. Trump is not sharing this as he is simply arraigning as none of this will matter anymore.\nMr. Collin’s,\nAnything that has to do with improving the VA and Doge is an oxymoron! Cuts to help improve? Layoff notices at the Milwaukee VA or any other VA facility? Vets have seen this disrespect from our Commander in Chief before. Do not insult me with this BS. You should know better.\nHmm, tell that to the vets working at the VA who got laid off for BS “poor performance”. Vets are speaking out how some of them got stellar performance reviews only to be let go days later. Way to look out for us vets. As some have pointed out, especially those who were laid off with disabilities, there is legal recourse for wrongful termination.\nMy husbands appeal has been waiting for a judge for years. His body is breaking down due to his past military career. He is in constant pain. He fought Multiple wars and conflicts. Gulf war veterans are being pushed aside. He was one of the first to cross the burm to Iraq in the ACE tanks. He don’t even try to talk about Somalia or the other conflicts. These men deserve better. Please help these soldiers. They fought for us and risk their lives for us. The government doesn’t have time to waste. Make our Veterans a priority!!!\nAmen ! Praying your husband gets his help asap.\nfirstly this site should not be used to attack the media or your political enemies Mr Collins. secondly I’d like to say that I have been very satisfied with the service that I’ve received from the VA both in Iowa City Iowa as well as in Des Moines\nSUBMIT A CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY TO YOUR STATES CONGRESSMAN. THEY FORWARD YOUR REQUEST TO THE VA AND THE VA IS REQUIRED TO RESPOND WITHIN 72 HOURS OF RECEIPT!! This action should expedite the claim. It did when I did it.\nI find it interesting that the day after this article posted, another article talked about VA people being laid off and the crisis line purged. Anyone who thinks our benefits aren’t on the chopping block is drinking the koolaid.\nAnd you expect us to believe this? VA staffing has already been cut by Trump. We have fewer VA representatives at different levels than we had two months ago. You are completely right about the media and how they work. But their spin on things is nowhere close to the spin that the government puts on things expecting us to believe them. And it has been worse these last two months with all the government firings and the cuts, human and financial, at many of the government offices. Why do you continually believe and treat us as if we are so stupid we cannot figure this out and are not able to know the truth? And the truth about DOGE and their requests and demands for personal information does nothing to help any of us, but is another verification of us losing our personal and private lives and information. This information they receive will do nothing but hurt American individuals. That can be verified easily by looking at the person that is in charge of that.\nThe VA already does not have enough employees in healthcare to provide veterans with healthcare services they need. Which means if Doug Collins and the VA are working on good faith to improve veterans access to healthcare, they should be hiring new employees, not firing va healthcare workers.\nAnd a lot of those unnecessary VA workers y’all just fired were veterans, disabled veterans, and spouses of veterans. Y’all are actively harming the veteran community by firing these folks.\nDoug Collins and the federal government can do all the hand waving and all the complaining they want about the media. I have eyes and ears. I don’t need the media or government officials interpreting reality for me.\nDoug Collins is up here pissing on veterans, and telling us it’s raining outside.\nI find these statements to be very bland and general in nature and appears to be a casual sound bit and a shot at the Fourth estate. The What quality control measures for contract performance were in place when you took office? How much time did you personally spend verifying this before bringing in an outside entity to do this routine job? Why don’t you use your inspector generals to do this task that they routinely do? How many VA employees have been terminated to date to “improve service”? How many of those terminated employees were veterans? This appea\nExcellent information grate to have you on board Honorable Collins.\nGreat report I am a 80% TBI Disabled awarded 100% Unemployability Benefit. USArmy Military Police in the Vietnam Era conflict.\nThis from The American Prospect:\nIf left unchallenged by VA patients and caregivers, veterans’ organizations, and members of Congress, Trump’s appointee will continue to slash and trash services for veterans long after Elon Musk has likely returned to the private sector.\nOn the same day that protesters assembled outside his new office, Collins dismissed 1,000 probationary employees at the VA, while claiming that this move “will not negatively impact VA healthcare, benefits, or beneficiaries.”\nIn a quick rebuttal to Collins, Murray pointed out that those laid off included staffers working on treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. “I’m hearing from longtime VA researchers in my home state of Washington who are right now being told to immediately stop their research and pack their bags,” Murray told the press.\nWho got all the money for healthnet in 2017 ?\nWe all know who you really work for, so save the empty promises. Why not be transparent and just tell us when your billionaire business daddies are planning to sell us down the river. I would rather be able to prepare for losing my benefits so I can at least try for a soft landing.\nI hope you have enough of a spine to stand up for us to the Musk/Vance Whitehouse because we will not forget, and we will not forgive.\nYou can talk to me about the weather, which I have no control over, or you could outline the services you’re making available to help me deal with the weather…and yes, part of that is making sure service providers have the support they need to be effective at what they provide. This felt a bit too focused on the weather.\nVery party line here – I take issue to the kids at DOGE having such access without being vetted. I would think that there would be forensic accounting involved – not hackers if the intent were to find waste.\nI’m on the same page as you. Although I don’t take issue with “vetting” per se. I take issue with granting what amounts to top secret clearance to guys with backgrounds that should be disqualifying.\nI mean, take Elon Musk as an example. Soldiers and veterans can lose jobs/clearances for pissing hot, but if you’re rich enough you can do drugs on a podcast and I guess that’s okay.\nMine has been stuck at level 5 since Dec 30th 2024.

There is always room for improvement and the outside eyes of DOGE are probably best suited for determining what is best. What has been televised as cases of waste, fraud and abuse are mind boggling.

He, like virtually every other trump appointee are all going to kiss his a** and sing the praises of Musk.\nI agree!!! 57 days for a primary care visit, unless special circumstances or 100% disabled you can’t even get routine cleaning at dental, specialist without referral is not possible at my VA. Pulmonary only 2 days a week at my VA despite pact act. There is a local clinic that sees no new patients without being on waiting list for year or more. 80 miles one way to VA. Trying my best to move most to community care. Not best choice but 2.7 miles away. Did get Pulmonary care moved to community care. Have had my CT, Pulmonary fitness test and pulmonologist visit all within 10 days versus weeks. Same old story with most people here.\nLast, the question regarding vietnam and agent orange deaths. Here is just my personal story. Raised in town of less than 1000 people. Tons of fathers were WWII vets so lots of us went. 5 died in country, 7 more since of AO exposure have died. I have severe COPD, one of friends severe Parkinson, 2 more with kids born with spidabifada (sp). Same with every small town around me. Until PACT VA flat didn’t acknowledge. It’s going to get worse. I’m 75. Like the vets before us most vietnam vets dying quickly. Damn shame I believed the promise of health care for life when enlisting.\nUnfortunately, my comfort level is not very high.\nI would at least hope for status quo at a MINIMUM.\nAnother LIE from the trump musk regime!\nI would like to see spouses having CHAMPVA able to be treated at VA clinics. They are lifeline of assisting their disabled spouses.\nAs a DAV Chapter Service Officer I am very pleased that you have not hesitated for a moment to set the record straight. I have already heard from veterans that are concerned about their disability claims and THANK YOU for getting in front of the issue. ANYTHING that you can do to assuage their concerns by using every means possible to communicate with them is appreciated.\nI’ve had very little problem with the Va. they have helped me get my health back. I have talked with many other veterans and they seem to appreciate the va’s help. I don’t know what I was doing without those doctors and nurses. I believe Trump will do a great job for all of us.\nTim I am with you 100% on that. I am a combat vet . 100% disabled and have had and having outstanding care through though the VA. A lot of the post here just sounds like Dem. talking points. I remember a President in the not to distant past, that said, let the injured Vet pay for his own care, after all he volunteered for it.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins has a clue. Anyone who praises Trump, says he’s doing a wonderful job, and DOGE is doing a great job, does not live in the real world. He is a Trump ass kisser. Laying off people who provide help and support to veterans is not a sign of waste, but is a way to discard veteran’s needs. Being on the job for one week and making the comments he did doesn’t instill my faith in him.\nThank You Doug! Please keep us informed. Looking for wonderful things for our Veterans , spouses, widows/widowers, families! We need to know that our President Donald Trump and you have got our backs.\nNo they don’t have our backs, they’re kicking our -ss.\nLOL . . . they “have your backs” alright because that is where they are going to stick the knife.\nI need very little care from the VA. I am very satisfied with the care I have received for 50 + years. I very happy with the changes which have occured over recent years. I know and it is a matter of common sense that people are proned to take advantage of any system. Vets and non Vets alike. I am glad this sort of thing is being vigorously addressed because the ones who do need it most suffer. Thank you, Mr. Collins\nI HAVE HEARING AIDS FROM THE VA I USED TO GET THEM SERVICED AFEW BLOCKED FROM MY HOME\nNOW THE VA WANTS ME TO DRIVE 75 MILES TO LEBNON TO GET SERVICE.

We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nTime will tell the tale.\nRead comments, lot of bitter vets. I am a disable vet. I will not jut anyone on 14 days on the job. When my check gets cut or I cannot visit the VA clinic the I will beleive the media. DOGE is trying to cut waste and abuse I don’t care how old they are just find it, $600 million for sushi . Every president since Regan has promised to cut the budget finally someone is doing it and we are bitching. Only Hon Discharged Vets, disabled or abled, should work in the VA!\nI beg you all to research the nonsense you see on Facebook and Fox news, which you then repeat as fact. I recommend politifact, which is non-partisan. Elon Musk never said that he found $600 mil spent on sushi (https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/06/facebook-posts/no-fishy-food-bill-elon-musk-didnt-say-pentagon-sp/). Don’t get me wrong. I am NOT a Trump fan. I do not believe that Secretary Collins is being truthful. DOGE is a train wreck being used to hurt hard-working Americans while lining the pockets of million/billionaires. I do NOT think Elon Musk, has any business in our government. But, you’ve GOT to stop gobbling up the nonsense from FB and Fox and regurgitating it.\nHe’s lying like the rest of the unqualified people Trump has infiltrated our country with.\nThe Congressional Budget Office recommended ending TDIU benefits for those 67 and older. This is a joke, as Social Security benefits are continually being reduced and it is meant to be a supplement to retirement, not a retirement. In addition, TDIU Veterans do not receive retirement plans like they would if they could hold a job, so they likely would not be able to live on Social Security alone. Someone needs to fight on these issues.\nAlso, I attempted to add my 18 year old daughter in August when she enrolled in college, so she could use her DEA benefits. It’s been six months, and despite having all the necessary paperwork, it hasn’t moved passed initial review. I contacted the White House Hotline and requested assistance. The response I received from the Regional Office was “wait your turn in line.” Six months to add one dependent is absurd.\nLet’s talk about the 2017 Mission Act\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAs a 90+ YO Korean Vet. I’m sick of the bitching and bellyaching from the cry babies who think Biden did the American Veterans a great service. How did he handle the withdrawal from Afghanistan? My take is that that after visiting a Naval Air Station that celebrates gay and lesbian behavior with signs that they should be proud of their degenerate behavior. What is this costing us veteran in lost funds and access to healthcare? Get educated and thank God we have a chance to turn this country around. Don’t give up and KEEP FIGHTING.\nLet’s talk about the failure of Healthnet 2017\nExcelente News Sir. I’ve trying to get and increase in my disability % over 20 years (imagine it) and nothing has happened. This time I had to hire a lawyers so he can help me with this issue he charges 33.3% of what ever I get… if i get it. My health issues have increased since then; i don’t what to do anymore.\nI have received excellent care at the Tucson VA for over 20 years, and would not like to see their ability to care for veterans in a professional, timely (yes, timely), and caring manner impeded. So far, what the “lying” press has published about the manner in which Trump and Musk have handled the so-called elimination of fraud and waste – without having a clue as to what has actually been taking place, or delving into the ramifications of knee jerk reactions to their “revelations,” seems spot-on. Good luck on seeing the ongoing chaos bringing and semblance of positive results and improving the operations of the government.\nWe still have low information voter’s. As you can see by their comments. They have TDS and there is no treatment or cure. They don’t remember when the lines were so long and TRUMP pushed thru the community care program.\nIt’s only a month. Take your meds and give it time. Make common sense suggestions and not bully / attack the ones trying to get their heads around this mess, it’s been going on for ages. Give it time.\nP.S. there are several people who just walk around the VA appearing not to have a purpose. Veteran, nurse or whatever : they need terminated.\nThere should be more cameras on records actions of veterans and the staff at the counters for appointments and greetings. People on both sides are unkind. There needs to be accountability.\nWe veterans have been pushed against thru the system and had such a hard time getting even our records. Be specific about issues!\nDon’t be pricks!\nClueless. Look around. Research. Even Google. Shame.\nWow, did you drink the orange kool-aid! Poor fool,\nThey fired and investigated the DEI consultants’ spending and found that they were spending 8 million dollars a year on DEI programs when some VA hospitals don’t have full staffing for medical teams. Talk about crossed priorities. When there are hospitals so undermanned that they can only provide limited service, that isn’t the time to be picky about the diversity of its potential hires.\nYou’re so clouded by their constant stream of bs that you can’t see the forest for the trees. Musk will cut whatever he wants because your guy Trump has no spine. He backed down to Putin just like we all knew he would, and he put unqualified, traitorous morons in positions they don’t even understand.\nYou really cannot choose a provider through community care. For primary care, I found myself in a waiting room with immigrants who are on the public dole. I don’t know if providers are chosen by bids submitted, but don’t be surprised over where you end up. The doctor, by the way, mumbled to herself never having seen such “clean” urine, as she was looking over the results.\nI would like to believe that he is being truthful and above board about VA benefits not being targeted for cuts, but the American people were told the same thing about Medicaid and now it’s on the chopping block. So I’m going to have to wait and see while reserving judgement because this administration has burned us before.\nWe need your protection as our current president call us suckers. We never forget. DOGE is political bullsh-t getting rid of the IG;s can only lead to corruption.\nPlease find a way in your heart to continue being a peacekeeper and not perpetuate propaganda. Let’s help this administration make America a better place. There is so much work to be done.\nPlease find a way in your heart to wake up Tamara. Have you not been paying attention to what’s going on in the government offices since Trump Took office? Mr. Trump has never had anything good to say about veterans and has called us idiots for serving our country. What branch of service did you serve in, Tamara? The truth is out there, take off your blinders, open your eyes, and get your fingers out of your ears, please.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When it’s his only self serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nYour newsletter is N- propaganda. U.S. veterans know how to treat N-s. Fck you.\nBS trump is screwing Veterans.\nI read most of the comments and was not surprised at what I saw. Some never addressed his video most were very bitter vets, understandable as I am a disable vet, but I can’t take it out on a man that has been on the job 14 days. This man was in HOR and before I start throwing stones at him I am going to give him a chance and see what he does. I will get it out of the way so no one has to guess, I voted for Trump and would do it again given the alternative. I find it interesting that people are worried about their personal info, your info is all over the place now. They know when you go to the bathroom! As for DOGE we will find out but they really don’t care who Richard is what they want to know is Richard ripping off and or scaming the american people. Reality is,read you own notes, Collins can do no worse than any of his predecessor. The only advice I would give Sec Collins is that he ONLY hire QUALIFIED VETERANS to work in the VA. There are plenty out there that are disable but want to work. Still plenty others that want to work. Some work in government right now that may be let go look to the VA if you are a Hon Disharged Vet. Think don’t cry!\nThank you Richard!\nDawn Nance\nArmy 1978-1981\nThank You Mr Collins I’ve been with the VA for about 50 yrs . VA has always treated me with the utmost respect and fairness . The hospitals I have been in gave excellent care . It makes me very proud to say I am a United States Veteran . Thank You Timothy Foley\nThe operative questions just who is to determine “What’s not needed”- some 19 year old kid who never served a day in the Military??\nwow there are a lot of negative comments on here , much like the old bots on twitter , I wonder if the same concerned people had any negative comments about the feckless D.E.I. hires from the last four years? My personal VA treatment is excellent, I hope this success reaches all vets that need it.\nSo true. Those that are in our right mind, appreciates common sense thinking.\nDOGE is conducting an illegal heist of our personal data, and by allowing these uncleared, unvetted, unqualified criminal vermin to access our personal data you are an accomplice to innumerable Federal felonies. Resign.\nSir,\nIf I recall, the young rascals working for Musk at DOGE came from Space Ex with much higher clearances and IQ’s than respondents in this column. WE HAD TO WAIT FOUR YEARS to find out what Biden had been up to, how about we give Trump and Musk four months?\nYou are so right and don’t think these kids aren’t going to sell your info to the highest bidder some where down the line when Musk is done with them. Follow the money……always sound advice!!!!\nComplaining about the President is not helpful. Mr. Collins needs your issues and your recommended solutions, not a diatribe of your feelings to make you feel better. The VA has lots of problems but if you are not going to help solve them them you’re the problem. – 34 year Marine vet.\nYour words are well spoken, Marine.\nWe’re not paid to solve them, but nice try passing blame to the disgusted vets that are commenting here. Take your trash to FB or X.\nI have a serious concern when the current Trump VA fired so many veterans whom were fired without notice and now become jobless. This is not respect. In my life I have never used any VA services and only I have asked for assistance to change mistakes make on my DD-214 and NOTHING has been done in the last three years. Nothing!! I am 77 years old and I served during the Vietnam war era. So as a Native American I am still strong, health and waiting for VA response and results on my DD-214. As old as I am I need the corrected document to apply for a bank loan. Thank you and may peace prevail and the saying goes “United we stand divided we fall.”\nHang in there Doug! Just ignore the comments from the ppl terminally infected with TDS. Their disease blinds them to the positive realities Trump is bring back to our country and repairing the damage done by 4 years of a dementia ridden DEMOCRAT being in office. Refreshing to see someone with testicles putting a stop to DEI, drag story hours, illegal immigration, weaponization of DOJ, etc, etc, and on and on. The LUNATIC LEFT is finally being put in check. Absolutely amazing how many ppl are blowing snot about DOGE saving BILLIONS of dollars of OUR tax money!\nWell said!\nHe is ignoring them. Have you seen any replies? Dougie boy is laughing all the way to the bank.\nChaplain Collins, please remember…God is watching you. Something you seem to have forgotten or chosen to selectively ignore thus far in your political career. A large number of your words, actions, attitudes, etc leading up to now don’t really peacefully coexist with His word and He will judge you. Simply a friendly reminder for you to maybe do some self-reflection and prayer. Which holds primacy for you…God or “politics”? Have a blessed day!\nI hope this is all true, as a VET who has just got qualified to be on the VA health system I am looking forward to using the VA health care system to help reduce my cost of health care and provide quality health care for me as a Vet. of the Viet Nam Era. As a new enrollee I will need to learn how to best use the VA system that will benefit my health care and cost there of.\nSecretary Collins: Thank you for your continued service in this important position. Our active duty military needs to be the most efficient , lethal fighting force on planet earth and space. And when their active duty time is complete as mine is , the men and woman need to transition into a well run VA and insure the injuries they have sustained are properly treated. God Bless you in this effort.\nJames Carter (USN 1974-1981)\nhear, here! Let us just thank god that time exists. This guy will go the way of all and we will recover. have faith that another day will come and we will prevail. It’ll only be two years until it all ends and we can make things right. Vote in mid-term elections in order to make this joker a lame duck president, as Milania already knows him to be: limp.\nI don’t believe a word any Trump appointee says. They are all liars and cheats, and only out for the bucks.\nThis tells me you believe everything that the media tells you and the Democrats tell you. Grow up and smell the coffee our government is no different than the corrupt governments in other countries and this current administration is pointing this out that some federal employees are corrupt some of our politicians are corrupt and taking the hard earned money that should be going to people that need it like disabled veterans. Instead of wasting it on people that have been dead for 150years. Just look at where Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security have been giving payments to people that have been dead in the millions of dollars that have been sent to whoever that should’ve been going to people that really need it and those of us that are getting close to retirement age. The system is going to be bankrupt because wasteful spending of money the people that are dead and the fact the new generation of Young adults are not having children to be brought into this mess of the medias that lies. My wife left the media in 2003 when Robert Murdoch walked into her office and told her to get rid of the accurate information of who, what, where, when, why and to credible sources willing to go on the record with their names in face to be published. It was all about getting the story out no matter how inaccurate it was to pay her salary she immediately quit. This anonymous source bull***** needs to go..\nIf you look at the people that are yelling the loudest they’re the ones with their hands in the cookie jar taking the money from the disabled veterans and people that need it truly in this country….\ntrump and musk are the loudest in the country\nPossibly of dental care ?\nI have 2 complaints One I called for meds and after waiting one week I called back was told they would order my meds, waited another week to finally receive my medication. I was with out my medication for 3 weeks, second I had an appointment at the Nashville VA. I put in for my travel and was only given a partial. The reason was stated I could have gone to a closer facility. I do not make this appointment the VA does and It was my cardiologist,??????\nThat is a prime example of what goes on everywhere. Thank you for commenting.\nHi, George, thanks for letting us know. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nI’m really surprised that a former military member would act in such a childish way in a forum that asked for comments, feedback, and opinions. What I’ve read is really embarrassing to even be in the same ranks as some of you people. Practice your writing skills and come across like a professional that hopefully you once were when serving. In order to balance the budget everybody needs to suck it up and expect cuts in every department of the federal government.\nApparently you think Trump is a honest person who respects women and people in general; and what did he say about soldiers and veterans ( we are dumb and stupid). So far the appointees to these cabinet positions are unqualified and uninformed in the organizations and departments they are now running. Of course he wants you to tell him what to do, he doesn’t have a clue. The current actions of this administration are not thoughtful, informed actions. Its the opposite and I quote, “we will drive them out of government service” that’s not the “will of the People”.\nActually it was suckers and losers.\nThis is your opinion, same as the rest of the posts.\nThe Vietnam war will of been over 50 years this coming May. My records have been scrubbed along with thousands of brothers with classified operations. I first started having “Agent Orange” in 1994. 6 bouts of cancer later, I still can’t get benefits. Is there going to be another delay of the Army releasing Vietnam classified service records. Please remember, Us of the classified operations. We are the “Sprayed and Betrayed” but each one of us would go back in if our nation needed us.\nI have great faith that Trump and his rookie Collins are planning BIG cuts to Veterans benefits and services!\nConcerns are being raised regarding the potential impact of new VA Secretary Collins on veterans’ benefits and services. The new secretary’s background and political affiliations are drawing scrutiny, particularly in light of potential budget constraints and policy changes within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, described as a staunch supporter of former President Trump, has previously expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about his approach to healthcare for veterans. Furthermore, his past involvement in contesting the 2020 election results has led some to question his commitment to upholding democratic principles and the interests of all veterans.\nIn this video, Collins said he had been there only a week and there was already a problem (rite!) and then said not to listen to the media just to trust him bro. Some find his statements uneducated and unprofessional. Collins also rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.\nIn December 2020, Collins was one of 126 Republicans who contested the results of the 2020 presidential election. This action has been criticized as a dishonor to the House and a failure to uphold their oath to support the Constitution.\nWhile Collins has stated his commitment to serving veterans, his initial remarks have been met with skepticism by some, who are concerned that potential cuts to benefits and services may be on the horizon. Veterans and advocates are closely monitoring the situation, seeking clarity on the future direction of the VA under his leadership. Collins is the author of The Clock and the Calendar: A Front-Row Look at the Democrats’ Obsession with Donald Trump, published November 2021.” Not a good or popular book….\nIt is important for veterans to stay informed and engage with their elected officials to ensure their voices are heard as these changes unfold.\nMJ, 2nd Ranger Bat\nI support president Trump 100% Keep up the good work rhat you and your team is doing!\nFrom a vietnam veteran ??\nPeople are focused on the wrong thing of course thanks to media. I trust Doge to cut waste like they are everywhere else. What I’m concerned about is the proposed budget cuts recommendations written before the Trump administration that came out of the Congressional Budget office for 2025 to 2034 as a budget defeceit recommendation that would affect veteran benefits.\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/60557-budget-options.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkR6dleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHRH3c9KA4ojmwI3goVoZoj1NJUw5bnKSWzbsJu_WYJvP5_M1kyQSmSWHlw_aem_AOyjVclZFk48KhugaNMtQQ\nWith regards to DOGE and the benefits situation. There is a report that both the 30% rate is getting cut from compensation and that Unemployability is being taken out as a program moniker for the 100 % IU. What’s the truth, just what is the truth about the cuts announced in MilitaryNews.com. You’re praising DOGE as a watchdog group of sorts who are sorting through the contracts. A group of 20-something engineer grads are able to do accounting? Please.\nSecretary Collins, thank you for your service.\nI suggest a examining the connections between exposures to jet fuels that contain neurotoxins and cesium additives in JP-7 to the increase rates of advanced prostrate cancer.\nMany of us were unknowingly exposed to these toxins since they were classified top secret in years past. Anyone working around these aircraft were exposed because the aircraft did not have sealed fuel tanks and without being provided protective equipment due to the fact the additives were top secret during a special access / need to know program. We were exposed directly to the fuels and aspirated the fumes and burning exhaust of these fuels and ionized additives.\nWithout knowing of the hazards, we had to bring our fuel soaked uniforms home to be washed which cross contaminated our homes and further exposed our family members.\nCan we get some of the Doge money found to pay for dental work for vets. Our teeth take the brunt of all issues. PTSD sufferers grind our teeth, when we are sleeping, angry or just plain trying to figure out something.\nI have great hopes for what you will be doing for the Vets\nRE ptsd and teeth grinding. My dentist had a really thin tooth guard made I wear every night. Its actually helped me to stop grinding as much somehow (and it protects my teeth). If I stop wearing it I clench and grind again. Its worth trying one.\n60 day waits for Primary Care appointments are Unacceptable. It was less than 10 days till Republican s started chopping funding needs. Staffing and morale are at all time lows under Trump, are YOU going to stand up to Trump for Veteran needs or just cow down like the rest?\nBut it is in the Heritage Foundations budget proposal for 2023 amount things that Trump is currently actin upon. https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html\nStop blaming the “media” for when you say you’re doing “this” and then you do “that”. And Strump doesn’t know what he is doing anyway.\nRite brother\nAbsolutely! Truth!\nPlease keep politics out of Veterans Affairs. All you needed to say was you’re not cutting benefits. And then keep your word.\nThe funding comes from the Federal Government. Which is political.\nI totally agree to keep politics out of this. It’s a travesty he even brought this up. Focus only what you’re doing, not on a political leader’s policy you do or don’t support\nYeah, I caught that too. Once he said, “under Trump’s leadership,” he gave himself away.\nDon’t trust a thing that this administration says or does. Hope I’m wrong but so far there is no evidence to that.\nVery pleased and relieved our benefits are not going to be cut !! I had 11 hours a week for home health, which was not enough. You cut my hours back to 9 hours per week, which is terrible. I am wheel chair bound and have only my 85 year wife to help me the rest of the time. We get nothing but run around from the VA about who to talk to about more hours. The VA sends us to the VA advocate who sends us back to the VA primary Dr. (which they can’t keep) We have a beautiful new VA clinic here ,but it is not fully staffed. Sure wished we had the right person to talk to.\nThis outcome is exactly what should occur. I have attempted to explain this to others, but fearmongers prevent them from listening.\nMr. Collins, do you serve the veterans of the United States military and their families first or do you serve recently self-appointed king first?\nStop the Co-pay requirements for Vets Medical, doctor visits, and drugs!\nSir, you may believe what you stated (at least when this was recorded by you). However, Musk and Trump’s words and actions (including cuts of crisis staff and access to veterans’ personal dada) do not jive with your statements.\nthe va does everything to hinder old vets.I used to get online with the VA clinic in Niagara Falls ny..now I`m so confused with the changes .I can`t just get to my local va clinic anymore..Good going VA you made it hard for old vets\nSince you’ve only been there a week, I’m assuming you are a trump appointee. All trump and musk do is lie lie lie. How do we know if you are telling the truth. Nothing they have done is even legal. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nI am assuming you are a Democrat….. all you/they do is lie, lie, lie. Go see a doctor for your chronic TDS!\nObviously, you thought Biden did a good job which means your opinion is moot.. The days of the Biden crime family is over with Their just auditing the government which is long overdue Relax and watch your country get saved.\nI agree. Dental Benefits would be so helpful. I need over 10K in dental care. The dental insurance offered is not economically or practically viable. It takes 6 months of pay in before benefits can be used, it has high deductible and co pays, it limits care per year such that it would cost at least as much if not more. It would delay and stretch out care beyond what is medically advisable. I now have problems with my jaw, TMJ. I think they call it (likely the result of arthritis in the jaw), but cannot get care without my teeth being fixed first. Like fellow veteran Tyrone Burns, I also need extractions and dentures. If expanding benefits is true, not just spin, please consider dental care for all veterans.\nI don’t have the same faith in Doge as Sec Collins has as it relates to cuts. So far they (Doge) are not attempting to gain procedural knowledge of any organization before making cuts. I agree waste should be eliminated, but done so intelligently.\nHow Many Nurses Have Been Fired At the VA?\nWhy Did Trump Say He Is The King?\nOkay. I’ll believe that the benefits won’t get chopped. However, I still don’t like, and don’t trust those tech guys at DOGE who have access to personal information, be it mine or other veterans like myself. And I especially don’t trust Musk. He and those tech guys that work for him know nothing about doing any kind of audit. He has another agenda which involves making him rich(er). He is also in league with AFD (Alternative for Deutchland). In other words, he is in league with white supremacists, or he is one himself, which to me, means ha cannot be trusted.\nHow many Doctors have Been Fired at the VA?\nGet rid of DOGE and Musk!!!!!\nHow Many Vietnam Veterans Died From Agent Orange?\nHow Many Veterans Have Been Fired?\nId like to know how many commissioners took the buy out, quit, or got fired. Im still waiting for my HLR to be seen, 3 duty to assist errors going back to 08.. lets git r done\nDental help would be nice for all vets.\nWhy Are Veterans being Fired?\nThank you for fighting for us! Keep up the good work and may God be with you in this struggle to take care of those of us who stepped up to serve this great nation!\nLet’s see, my physical therapist ran by MyMichigan Health care (a Community Care referral) after a year and a half of therapy, recommended an exercise bike to help with my service connected disability and from a failed surgery to my neck that left me extremely weak on my left side and wheelchair bound. My PCP also submitted a referral for the equipment. It was DENIED bymy VAMC Prostetics Department. I appealed and after 2 years, I gave up and bought my own. No reimbursement for the equipment. Next, I am wheelchair bound, I have tried to get a chairglide put into my entertainment area of my house, I was issued 2 in Colorado. They sit in my garage currently and all they need is to be installed. The VA here installed a new one going to my bedroom but says they can’t install the ones I have that were issued by the VA to the entertainment area of my house because they can only issue 1. So I have these two sitting in my garage now and can’t afford to pay myself to get one installed to the entertainment area (basement). A quote to install is roughly $1,600. Again, being wheelchair bound, I have carpet in my home, and I’ve been trying to get help (2 times DENIED SHA/SAH) with the removal of it so my wheelchair is easier to navigate in my house. I was offered the $6k HISSA (sp) grant, but when I got a quote to remove the Carpet and replace with hardwood or similar, the quotes were at the lowest $24K and that was just the hallways, living room and my bedroom. I keep getting letters and emails about all the wonderful benefits that await Veterans in my situation, but when you apply for the benefits, like with the exercise equipment, flooring and chairglide installlation, you either Beg the VA until you give up and buy yourself or do without because this just seems like the old “bait and switch” game. Yes, I am 100% (Actually combined 750%) disabled per the rating scale. I only get paid for 1-100%, I took a 50% cut in pay from what my job paid me annually to accept the VA’s 1-100% rating because I was declared unemployable due to PTSD, TBI, White Matter Disease, Meniere’s, Depressive Disorder and sedentary lifestyle brought along with it DMII, OSA and heart problems which have required 3-stents.. If you mean what you say, why are us Veterans being put through the vigerous hoops? I am glad you are cutting back on the unnecessary cost to run the VA. I just hope the differences are returned to the Veterans as you say because as I described above, it has been really challenging to get the benefits I need and in the begging process have had to reach out to my Patient Advocate (which is a joke), my Congressman on two occasions, OIG on two occasions and am about to reach out to them again because service connection hasn’t been awarded for 6-post-op secondary disabilities that weren’t present before the surgery and didn’t start with treatment/medication until after my condition begain deterriorating Post-op! I am only 1 example as I am sure many others have experienced my plight first hand. We just feel at the mercy of the VA when we are confined like I am and rely solely on the VA and I’ll tell you personally, it is a daily, stressful experience which no doubt will lead to further decline based solely on the stress and depression I stay in.\nLYING SACK OF SH-T!!! Fire our hospital staff,REMOVE benefit at 65 no MONEY F-CKED on Medicare!! F-CK YOU TRUMPF SUCKING TRAITOR!\nLOL, the VA can help with that anger management but your TDS is terminal.\nLeave Terry alone. This is not funny.\nT rump is a fraud and so are his programs. All you are doing is dismantling the government to give muskrat and his friends more freedom to rob us. The day when we get tired of this is coming and you need to think about where you stand (hint, long term vision is better than short term).\nI think the administration is doing exactly what we voted for.\nYou have my support. 100% service related, Vietnam\nThat’s a bunch of crap! He is in Trump and Musk’s pocket\nWhat about the1,000 VA support personnel that are being cut? How will that affect our medical benefits?\nJames H. Donahue\nCAPT, USCG (ret.)\nit would be nice to see full Dental Benefits for all veterans , not just retired!!! Dental health is probably more important than anything as far as sickness goes. not having to rely on anti-biotics and painkillers because of improper oral hygiene would be a great plus for our overall health. i could use dentures or implants and a few more extractions to get healthier and an improved digestive system because of being able to chew food properly!!\nSecretary Doug Collins keep protecting Veterans benefits. Even my family says President Trump is going to cut your disability benefits. I say no they aren’t going to be cut. Secretary Collins keep up the good work. Lets take the money for luxury hotels for illegal aliens and take care of homeless veterans. George Miller Vietnam Veteran.\nMy 76 year old Viet Nam veteran husband called the VA yesterday (02/19/2025) for an appointment with his primary care physician and the earliest appointment he can get is for 08/01/2025!! AND the VA Eye Clinic is closed and not taking appointments at this time…..if this guy is trying to tell you that things are fine at the VA and deserving veterans are getting efficient and quality care, he is dead wrong and many of these veterans will be also with this type of care provided to them!!\nMa’am, this exact reason you explained above, is why Community Care exists. I couldn’t get an eye exam either, so I received a referral to get one at a civilian clinic. Just ask for the referral, and if the VA tries to give you a hard time, stand your ground. Also, if your husband cannot get an appointment in a reasonable amount of time with his PCP, again, have his PCP get a referral for your husband to see a physician in the community. This is what community care is for.\nHi, Donna, we’re sorry to hear about your husband’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nIt is sad to see that a Christian Chaplin would align himself with the likes of trump. When you earned your master’s degree in divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary you must have missed the day they taught Matthew 4:8-9. Because when trump offered “All these things I will give you” You choose to fall down and worship him (trump).\n“Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”\nI would love to be there on your judgement day and see you explain that decision you made to God.\nYou really should keep your political thoughts/feelings to yourself. “We the People” elected President Trump and he is doing “EXACTLY” what we asked him to do, like putting Doug Collins in as Sec of the Veterans Administration.\nsuck, suck, suck….taste good??\nIf there was a rumor going around my units that we were going to deploy, we deployed. I don’t know about everyone else, I just know what I know. Why would Veterans, Retirees and VA workers be on pins and needles for no reason. What about the “Women Clinics” closing due to DEI? Just our imagination? I’m going to wait and watch.\nIn fact doge is just a front for a fraudulent scheme and have illegally entered the government IT systems.\nA whole lot of worrying over nothing IMHO. DOGE, Musk and Trump do NOT want your money. They are not there copying all your info down (sheesh), ANYTHING to do with the VA is safe…including spouse stuff, etc. CALM down folks. STOP believing the lies.\nAnd to Richard L. That free time you speak of is due to your king sir..\nEither you are the VA website is a Liar ! The web page for Veterans announced at least 1000 people have Now Lost their Jobs but You sir Claimed No CUT BACKS have occurred!\nThank you so much. I am very apprciative of the work that DOGE is doing. It’s also reassuring to know that our benefits will be secure. Thank you, sir.\nI appreciated the video because it introduced me to the new Secretary. I appreciated Secretary Collins communicating his enthusiasm to take charge of the VA and his desire to allay the concerns of some Veterans. These concerns have been created because they have been duped in to believing what they read in newsprint and see on TV. It’s a significant challenge to educate them and build a confidence in the VA so they can know that the VA is getting its stuff together and can effectively help them get the help they need. Maintain the attack! VR–Leland Klein\nDear Mr. Secretary, how about dumping some of the crazy policies put in place last year under the previous administration, like child-proof hearing aid batteries! Sounds smart, but they’re Veteran Proof too!? Once opened, the VA provides pouches to store them in (not child-proof for sure! So, it makes it easier for a child to ingest a bunch of batteries, instead of one at a time! Please fix this & take a look at other things we deal with daily. You are much appreciated & I so appreciate you reaching out with the truth!\nHow can we trust that benefits will not be cut when DOGE shut down entire agencies without any evaluation of programs and mass firing without any justification, explaination or accountability? Yes, eliminating personnel reduces cost but has nothing to do with fraud, waste or abuse.\nI’m glad to hear that at least one part of the government isn’t being destroyed.\nSorry sir but the lies that have come out from the Republican administration do not give me comfort that your statement is truthful.\nDear Secretary McDonough,\nI am writing to bring to your immediate attention the unacceptable conditions at the Little Rock VA Medical Center. As someone who deeply values the well-being of our veterans, I am disturbed by the state of this facility and the substandard level of care being provided to those who have served our country.\nDuring recent visits, I have witnessed and received reports of the following issues:\nUnsanitary conditions, including dirty patient rooms, inadequate cleaning, and persistent maintenance problems.\nLong wait times for medical appointments and procedures, resulting in delayed treatment and worsening health conditions.\nStaffing shortages, leading to overworked healthcare providers and inadequate attention to patients.\nPoor facility conditions, including outdated equipment, broken infrastructure, and a general lack of upkeep.\nOur veterans deserve the highest standard of care, yet the conditions at this VA hospital suggest a failure to meet even basic medical and sanitary standards. I urge your office to take immediate action to investigate these concerns and implement necessary improvements.\nI respectfully request a formal response outlining what steps the VA will take to address these issues and ensure our veterans receive the dignified care they have earned. I am also willing to discuss this matter further and provide additional details as needed.\nThank you for your time and commitment to our nation’s veterans. I look forward to your prompt attention to this urgent matter..\nHi, Charles. Sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThe truth and nothing but the truth with our Veterans, Thank you Doug Collins for being transparent with the lying media(Cnn,Msnbc,etc..)\nAmen to that\nTo see so many veterans, who are helping other veterans, be fired from the VA (especially those helping prevent suicide) is disgraceful. To see our country’s leaders spewing lies and abandoning our allies makes me sick. I joined the Cold War Army and served 32 years, and never thought to see us capitulate to despots and believe their lies and propaganda.\nIndividual ratings equal 120 % , yet my overall VA rating is 80%. Cannot work due to TBI, PTSD issues yet the VA cannot see unemployable as they themselves won’t hire me.\nDont give up… They (current administration) want you to, and are likely going to try to change the way the Disability Ratings are Calculated and Evaluated to reduce them and “Save Money”. 2016- 2020 was a awful period to try to get a fair disability review done.\nHave you gone through the VSO in your county or the VFW? Don’t go through the VA yourself when trying to get benefits. A VSO in your county is the best thing you can do to receive benefits owed.\nWhy are you allowing a non-appointed civilian into the VA at all and allowing the minions to look around at our personal information. President Elon Musk should not be allowed through the doors of the VA. He is an immigrant and does not have the authority to be in Federal Buildings without an escort of some kind and to think that you or anyone would allow a group of teenagers and 20 somethings with computers into the building and snoop through personal records is shameful. Resist the ELON.\nI sure need to get my widows benefits…my husband Wayne Mosby passed away 09/06/2023. I would appreciate your help. Thank You\nThe questions is: Are our benefits going to be taken away in accordance with the Project 2025 guidance related to VA?? recommend reading it…\nThank you Secretary Collins for the video.\nI appreciate you clearing up some of the liberal media lies.\nThank you for working so hard to protect our Veteran benefits.\nBTW, The President’s Executive orders have not trickled down to all VA facilities yet.\nI still see VA employees using gender pronouns and LGBTQ flags at VA clinics.\nAs a Veteran and VA employee, I truly appreciate all the hard work this administration is doing to protect and defend the rights of conservative Americans that solely seek to follow Biblical Beliefs, God’s beliefs.\nAgain, many thanks\nIt is a matter of trust. Doug you took the first step in gaining my trust. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.\nDear Honorable Sec, V. A., Doug Collins,\nAnother Combat Wounded Veteran (CWV), has died today. Some CWV’s will die, as a cause of caustic or failed V.A. Medical Services. Some CWV’s, will fall prey to SUICIDE, (due to the same reason cited in the previous sentence), “ADDED,”‘ by THE IMPACT of the voluminous FLAWS, FAILURES, DEVASTATIONS, DISRUPTIONS, HORRIBLE DISASTERS, INSULTS, and THREATS, to We the People, and especially to we military veterans, that was willfully created by the EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, & ADMINISTRATION OFFICES-circa 2021-2024. Most of which was to repeat, and employ the antagonistic mantra of the “EXECUTIVE OFFICE-circa 2009-2016, TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AMERICA, from being OUR REPUBLIC, to a DESTRUCTIVE form of NWO-SOCIALISM.”\nThis depressed and overly stressed 80 y/o CWV (Vietnam 01/31/1968-@0200- TET’SURVIVER.), understands the opening paragraph WAS QUITE a RUN-ON SENTENCE…. but just the effort to cite a TRUTH … has given me calm, at least for the present moment. Though it is beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this CWV, has been the recipient of several VERY EGREDIOUS V. A. MEDICAL Services over the years, since I retied, relating to my never ending depression, dental, headaches, vision, and urinary tract V. A Medical Services, compound errors, that I must endure, as I am privileged, to survive with each new day my Creator THANKFULLY provides. Also with Gods love, mercy, forgiveness, direction and Guidance, to overcome my falling prey to suicide, while enduring so many emotional and destressing hardships, that has befallen on me over the years of writing that check, in Service to my Country.\nDoug Collins, Thank You for your service to Our Country, and I pray GOD SPEED your LEADERSHIP, Counsel, and CONSERNED DIRECTIONS to improve the present, V. A. Medical Services, especially to the many younger Veterans and CWV’s, that they will receive the best , and better, V. A. Medical Services, than was provided to us older CWV’s.\nHang in there young man, we are still above ground and for that we should be thankful. I am also a Vietnam Vet 66-67 SGT USMC with health issues related to my time in Vietnam, specifically tied to Agent Orange and I fight my health issues daily but I am thankful to God for he has kept me going all this time. I only started using the VA two years ago but they have been very helpful since I started using them. Hopefully Sec Collins will make the VA even better. You stay strong young man, you haven’t lived this long just to give up now. Thank you for your service and God Bless You. I will pray for you.\nI think we are going to be hurt financially and you know you are lying to us. Please stop telling people to tell us they thank us for our service this also hurts when it’s spoken with out sincerity\nOur concern is that the VA speeds up the approval for disability applicants\nF-ck your so full of bullsh-t Collins\nSure wish the VA would honor us vets that must keep medicare and supplemental medical insurance coverage. I pay over $450.a month for this as my two agent orange illnesses don’t rank me high enough for any none service related coverage. VA not honoring medicare is just a way for them to get more veteran at very low cost. Link up, please—-!!!\nI would have felt some belief in what you said if you hadn’t mentioned the draft dodging “orange felon” throughout your remarks\nI would like to know how hard are you going to get the Pact Act to cover burn pits for us Vietnam Vets? I would also like to know how hard you are going to push your former Representatives and Senators to pass the language correction initiative to the Pact Act, Section 804 being introduced this week by Representative Murphy and Senator Tillis?\nGreat.Democrat Media lies .\nSecretary Collins,\nAs a 2001 retired navy veteran, I want to thank you for the reassurance regarding veteran benefits.\nI am compelled to express concern on another matter, that being Elon Musk heading up DOGE. I consider it a conflict of interest for him to determine what is efficient use of my tax dollars while according to every source I read states he has to date received $18 billion tax dollars for SpaceX and Tesla.\nCould you look in to this or forward it to the appropriate government department please? Based on the various media sources I have read, it seems 47 (forgive the fact I have so little respect or value for him I refuse to even type his name) and Elon are collaborating on an agenda that is leading our nation to an end for democracy and towards a fascist state.\nThank you for your time and attention.\nIt’s about time that fraud and waste and silly DEI policies are rectified. Clearly instigators have to create false narratives to panic people.\nYou should know veterans fall under DEI as well. Diversity, Equality, Inclusion. That is why places are able to give “points” in the hiring process for Veterans.\nNot convinced. I predict that within six months we’ll see movement toward privatizing veteran’s healthcare or limiting it to combat vets.\nSince this guy is a trump appointee, I don’t believe a word he is saying. You said the magic word privatizing.\nSince you suffer from terminal TDS, I don’t believe a word you are saying. Sit back and immerse yourself in more Rachael Madcow, MSDNC, CNN, etc. Pathetic. Must really suck to have absolutely zero deductive reasoning. Hope you are able to reconnect to reality.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins\nI have listened to what you had to say and if you are truly ready to help Veterans then please contact me via the following email address. This address is one that I rarely use but I do check for answers to questions I submitted to other organizations.\nI am a veteran that has extreme difficulty getting around and I do need Community Care but currently the Northern California Health Care System could care less and in most cases have denied Community Care even though it was approved before. I do have Tri-Care For Life as part of my retirement benefits from the military and I have begun a transition back to Tri-Care to make sure I receive the care I need.\nAugustus, we’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWe were lied to about Vietnam and have been lied to since about defoliants end results. Many of us have AO related problems that VA keeps denying after numerous claims we have put in…backed by DAV…I learned early on to never trust anything the govt. says…and I sure as heck don’t believe anything coming out of the White House, or Congress,anymore.\nWho are the DOGE people reviewing VA contracts and what expertise do they have in federal contract administration.\nWill the VA post the specific contracts being identified by DOGE for elimination or reduction.\nHow many VA personnel (federal employees) has DOGE identified that their positions are being eliminated and what services did these personnel provide.\nYour administration has promised transparency in these actions, and thus far I have seen none. Promises that VA benefits will not be impacted without evidence is poor assurance.\nYour effectiveness as an advocate for veterans is yet to be proven.\nNow let’s see if he means it or if he tells alternative facts/untruths.\nHe is full of sh-t.\nJust wait and see what Bone Spurs does to the VA. Already fired over 1000 workers in a time the VA is understaffed and trying to hire skilled workers. The closest thing that we see to a real Dr is a NP or a PA. And they don’t stay around for long . They are the real benefit we receive but if you can’t hire them or they are fired, we are f-cked. Which we are as of now.\nSo Doug, you just keep spewing the same sh-t that comes out of Bone Spurs and let’s just see how successful you really are.\nSay hello to Elon. That POS.\nPlease Please look into LOWERING COMMISSARY PRICES at Ft Bragg, NC…(other bases too) MANY of the grocery prices are higher than the civilians counterpart grocery stores. THEN on top of grocery prices…we pay an additional “6% building fee” which is a tax no matter what its called. The VA has so much buying power…seems the buying contracts need looking into.. Meat (beef)Prices are especially high.. At Ft Bragg/Camp Mackall we have so many Active duty soldier families & Veterans..there has to be a away to LOWER prices at commissaries across-the-board. Thanks for ALL that you are doing! :)\nJust curious then. If commissary prices are higher than grocery stores, why not go to the grocery stores? That’s what I’ve done whenever I lived near bases. Commissary prices are ALWAYS higher. Also, this man’s job is not in the scope of reducing grocery prices at the commissary. The commissary is under a different department. He’s in charge of the VA. Groceries have increased in all stores, commissary or not.\nI responded to my call of duty in 1967 spent 1 year carrying m60 machine gun in Viet Nam, paid my dues, just like thousands of veterans and a 100 % disabled, no draft dodger and or billionaire should have right to to attack military veterans who provided them the right and freedom they have enjoy today . keep veterans in your mind daily, not these idiots that that want to screw us and never served . Keep in mind veterans are going to stand up and for there right as this administration is mirror Russia more and more on a daily admiring Putin, pardon me if you voted for trump, but this is happing on your watch\nThis video is a shamefully political plug for Trump and DOGE. It begins typically by blaming the media for running with stories that they just aren’t commonly running that benefits will be cut. I read a wide range of mainstream media across the political spectrum on a daily basis and have not encountered a single story about veteran benefits being cut, but Secretary Collins probably found one somewhere. Collins doesn’t cite a single source or example and then builds a cringe-worthy political endorsement on a falsehood. Keep our military apolitical!\nWhat don’t our veterans need? They have sacrificed life and limb to fight our wars! What could possibly be cut back? How much is it going to cost for the cooperation of the VA. I am concerned to say the least.\nI am concerned that they may cut our DIC benefits. My husband did 2 tours in Vietnam, he wasn’t drafted and spent 20 yrs in the USMC and died of Agent Orange.\nTouching our DIC would impact so many families who sacrificed their loved ones.\nYou can cut the two employees that ask the Covid questions at the door of the clinic. There are more screeners than patients. That would save millions.\nNeed to look into the Biloxi/pensacola VA. they do not understand how Community care works! “8 months to get orthotics. Finally after sending an email I had a supervisor repsond and flat out tell me so many employee do not show up for work an when the do they don’t work. This awesome supervisor and transfering beause she can’t take the extra hours doing others work anymore\nHi, David, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank goodness as my health care needs improved.\nI feel that we have to give up our benefits just to keep Trump happy. That is a no no, we did not volunteer to go to Vietnam in 1966, we were ordered to go and came back not the same. As secretary of Veterans Affairs are you representing the veterans to help them keep their benefits. There is going to be a lot of Veterans in an uproar and Marching on Capitol Hill. Trump can give up part of his pay since he is a veteran. You have veterans that can not work to pay their bills and and other necessities. Veterans work hard and came back injured and now we have a billionaire in white house giving advice to our so called Cammander in Chief , sticking his nose in our benefits we earned, they belong to us the veterans.\nTrump is NOT a veteran. In fact he used connections to dodge Vietnam.\nJust like Clinton avoided military service, just like Bush avoided military service, just like Biden dodged military service, etc, etc. Oh and by the way, President does NOT accept one penny of his salary as President. He donates it. The only president to ever do that.\nWell said!\nHe is also the only president who openly takes bribes – totally corrupt – hence the 34 felony convictions; wastes millions of $$ golfing more days than not, steals from charities, is notorious for never paying his bills, believes he is a king, calls Veterans ‘suckers & losers’, has total disdain for the military, lies about pretty much everything….. but sure, stay in the cult until he throws you under the bus because he will.\nVeteran, well said, Trump is a charlatan idiot and so are all his MAGA followers.\nSOMEONE SHOULD EVALUATE THE HOSPITAL IN DECATUR , GEORGIAN…THE FACILITY IS OLD AND FILTHY…THE TROOPS DESERVE BETTER…..\nThank you, VA Secretary Doug Collins! It is great to hear directly from you about what is the truth. I wish other Secretary’s would do the same. I am a 23 year Navy veteran and was less than a month from being cleared as Program Analyst probationary for the Federal Aviation Administration (Aviation Safety) and was just terminated last Feb 14, 2025.\nI am one of three who review and process the medical exams for the Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) here in the Pacific Northwest (we take care of seven states). Program Analysts along with the Flight Surgeons ensure that our ATC’s are medically qualified and we issue their medical clearances before they can control air traffic. Our job is critical as we protect the “safety of our national airspace”. Our Regional Flight Surgeon along with the Federal Air Surgeon is trying to get me back but they are not making any promises. In my opinion, it is about time that someone look into all the fraud, waste, and abuse in our government.\nPresident Trump and DOGE should have done things differently as far as letting people go. It is a long process to get hired for a federal position and then in a blink of an eye just get terminated. A blank statement of, “DOT FAA finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the DOT FAA would be in the public interest” is totally inaccurate and contradictory to what was submitted to HR, “I certify that the performance, conduct, and general traits of character of this employee have been\nfound satisfactory and recommend that the employee be retained beyond the probationary period.”\nThere are a number of veterans who want to keep serving our government (single parent and those who moved to another state etc.) and at the end of the day, this is the thank you that we deserve? We the People…\nSir, I don’t believe that our VA is being served by the current occupant of Maralago and his henchmen scraping our data, destroying beloved institutions, leaving this once great land into some future serfdom.\nPlease reimplement customer service feedback for each VA encounter so veterans can address issues (good and bad) at the time of occurrence. An advocate should review these feedbacks and address, resolve, or elevate, any issues raised.\nAnd what of survivors benefits?\nSecretary Collins,\nWhile I understand that you are a political appointee, serving the men, women, and family’s of the US military veteran community and the Civil Servants who work for the VA must come first.\nThose members and families are from all walks of life. They come from every Political party. Every State. Every Religion. They may be Gay or straight. They may have voted for Trump. They may have voted for someone else.\nThe one and only thing that should concern you is taking care of them.\nYou talk as if the men and women of your Department are the enemy.\nYou pay homage to President Trump multiple times in this video.\nYou use propaganda and misdirection to avoid having to address and answer real and relevant questions.\nYou try to convince everyone that “The Washington media.” is at fault, that they are manipulating us, and that they are not to be trusted. You are spreading propaganda and stoking the fires of distrust.\n“They take a possibility, and then run with the story.”\nSo using your approach, if the media reported about the four 12 December, 2024 Proposals submitted to the CBO, about reducing, cutting, eliminating, means testing, and taxing our Disability Benefits, you would claim what?\nYou clearly make the claim that they should not report this information as a possibility.\nAnd yet they have been developed, written, and submitted for review to determine how much money could be eliminated from Disability Benefits, in order to fund “OTHER” budgetary priorities, such as pre planned tax cuts. These Tax cuts, as proposed, have been determined to disproportionately benefit the small percentage of U.S citizens in the upper echelons of income.\nBut you say that this “Possibility” should not be disclosed, or shared or reported.\nI find this greatly concerning.\nIn my humble opinion, you are coming across like a used Car Salesman, Yes Man, who lacks the courage and willpower to be anything but a placeholding marionette. Someone else controls the strings and the words that come out of your mouth.\nYou need to be a Leader worthy of the position you hold.\nI’ll believe this when I see it.\nI know for a fact that claims have not been moving faster. With the PACT Act there are more claims needing attention and VA was hiring but on a hiring freeze and looking to terminate those who were hired in the past two years. Stop lying to us..\nOverall my experience in scheduling an appointment has been from 1 to 10, I give it a 6.\nI have used the VA for the last 55 years and always had the same criticism. The telephone answering system where you are transferred from one extension to another showed a lack of caring:\nthe attitude is to transfer the call to someone else where you have to give the same personal information over and over again\nAlso, the specialty clinics are understaffed so the average wait time for an appointment is 3 weeks and up. meanwhile, the person is in pain.\nWell the people who work at the VA are on pins and needles day to day. Did you tell them what you just said in this video? They are waiting for the other shoe to drop. Musk and Trump both want to go after the VA. What about the one thousand people who were already let go?\nI see the hateful boomers are in full swing talking trash about our president. You can clearly see that they have way to much free time to watch cnn or any other main stream media like NPR. You folks need to get outside and pull the talking points that you regurgitate out of your behinds.\nGrow up, you are being spiteful and regurgitating lies.\nStop it.\nFocus on helping veterans and keep your gross political views to yourself.\nSF\nAre you a veteran? Are you concerned about your earned benefits? The current actions being taken by this administration are clearly evident as not in the best interests of the VA employees and the veterans. You better read the Project 2025 chapter on the VA and then wait and see what occurs. We have a right to be concerned about what is happening, Considering the Russian relationship and unqualified individuals being placed in the Cabinet positions. Currently serving Republican Congress are not doing their job, they need to go. The Constitution I swore to defend is under attack.\nyou are disrespectful….\nYou must be disillusioned and not able to think for yourself. Disrespectful is what is happening to our country right now. I am vewry concerned….Illegal access to the Treasury Dept. The firing of a person because they are in a 1 yr prob period. Calling himself “KING”. Individuals in Musks employment being placed in every Department to observe and report on activities. Ignoring the Constitution. Who knows how much of the peoples money DOGE employees will steal from the Treasure. The bottom line here is the VA is important to a lot of people and the benefits matter, so I have issue with ANYBODY trying to reduce them or take them away, You should to, IF you are a veteran.\nI am a Veteran, I am a employee of the Fed Gov, I am a retired Veteran. I am not foolish enough to hope that Trump is going to care about me or any benefits I have earned. I am not lazy, I am not stupid, I have put 40 years of Service into this country. Who are you??\nSecretary Collins,\nI appreciate you sharing this video. In the video, you mentioned there will be no cuts to benefits. So to clear it up for everyone reading the news, these comments, Project 2025, and Agenda 47, I have a few questions.\n1. Will Veterans who are or will be social security retirement age lose any of their service-connected benefits. There are different posts out there that reference portions of Project 2025 that calls for them to be reduced to 30% or lose 30% (go from like 100% to 70%)?\n2. Since DEI is being eliminated in the VA does this mean that women’s clinics and women specific doctors and procedures disappear from the VA Medical Center System?\n3. Will Veterans who receive military retirement and VA disability compensation be put back to a pre-2005 timeframe where you could not draw both at the same time?\n4. Will Veterans who can’t prove their injury was directly related to work while in the military not be afforded service-connected disability anymore?\nThe hypocrisy will kill you!\nSome Trump supporters are actually intelligent people. The problem is years of right wing propaganda have them brainwashed.\nPlease STOP with the political garbage on this site. That’s not what this site is for. I voted for President Trump and I am “NOT” brainwashed.\nMy disabilities total 130% but my benefit payment is 80% due to the VA convoluted combined ratings formula. Also my colon cancer is not an agent orange presumptive despite what the American Cancer Society says. Perhaps the new director could look into these anomalies.\nThe Bill above my comment is a different Bill than me.\nWHY does it take 25 years to get an answer about my claim and you say you are working quick\nI had no doubt that the Trump admin was going to take care of veterans and keep their promises. That phony media machine is incapable of telling the truth. It was under the first Trump admin that I finally got some of my benefits expedited. Everything has been on hold for the last four years and now the needle is moving again. Thank you Mr. Collins.\nShould we join the January 6 “patriots” and surround the DC pig pen and show our disappointment with the Trump musk man love team? Neither one wore fatigues for our great nation which is why they’re tearing it apart. Don’t drink the kool aid!\nNo, this time they wouldn’t label them “patriots.” You’d be thrown in jail as an “insurrectionist” or told to get a job.\nIt’s great that you are addressing concerns of many but don’t tell me that you are above trump/musk in making decisions that may affect many veterans. I wouldn’t believe anything these days because truth and integrity seems to have no place in government.\nWish the VA video was shareable!\nIs any of my personally identifiable information being shared with DOGE personnel? Will it ever be unsecured?\nThank you so much Secretary Collins for clarifying, although I’m not surprised. Thankful to have people in charge that care about us folk!\nwhy is the VA allowing a vender set up in the lobby of the Loma Linda California VA hospital and sell his wares of military hats, shirts license plates holders etc ALL MADE IN CHINA!!!!! as a Vietnam vet i find this very offensive. is this allowed in all VA hospitals??\nThank you, not knowing what the DOGE is or can do is confusing. Please continue to keep us informed.\nThank you for standing up for the veterans benefits and I wish you well as the Secretary of this department. We need a strong VA secretary.\nWe shall see. I have learned to not hold my breath, as it seems to be sucked out of me with every inspiration of a new president.\nyou have a very serious credibility problem\nIf you are cutting personnel you are cutting services. That’s all there is to it. The organization is already understaffed, just because it’s doing better doesn’t mean its up to snuff and removing human capital endangers the work already done. The people at DOGE know nothing about veterans, healthcare or our needs. Get them out and lead, don’t let them run some AI search and cut needed contracts because they trigger some 1984-esque word ban.\nYou’ve been there a week. Nothing you’ve done has impacted a veteran out here in the world. You may have a concept you think may work, but “clearing cases” absolutely is nothing you can take credit for. We don’t need that officer sunshine blown up our asses. We need results. Post another atta-boy-me when you’ve actually done something that shows you helped us. Cutting staff certainly isn’t going to get you there. Soon we’ll be back to 1 million backlogged compensation claims like it’s 2013 all over again. Freezing hiring won’t either, as the turn-over rate for the VA is high.\nI wanted to watch this video to see about potential cuts to my VA benefits, not to hear a speech about how wonderful donald Trump is. Stop the maga ra ra bullshit, you are suppose to represent ALL veterans, not just the ones who voted for trump, and Elon has no business looking at my imformation, period!\nJust entered VA Health Care system after retirement. VA care givers are pleasant to deal with but the VA system is not connected very well in my opinion. I only have Kaiser Health to compare it to. I have been chasing MRI/X-rays for both knees and legs for two months which was ordered by the surgeon in December and I have exhausted myself to the point of thinking about leaving the VA health and paying for part B Medicare. Anything outside of general care by primary doctor is a challenge with no follow up or phone calls on next steps. The only real help I have received to resolve my issues came from La Shawn at the Clinical contact center.\nis there any truth to the idea that for every 4 people leaving the VA ya’ll can only hire 1 replacement?? also , is the government trying to Privatize the VA???\nYou’re a rubber stamp for your one and true god TRUMP. You’re a disgrace to the humans you’ve served with and the ones who continue to serve in the US armed forces and the VA.\nYou cannot guarantee anything! We don’t believe you! You serve your god as a chaplain while simultaneously erasing humans careers, retirements, and the ability to live. Service to our country is a noble duty so many of us have all taken on, IT DOESN’T matter what you identify as. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE.\nI like Doug Collins! He’s on the same wavelength as President Trump! No nonsense, straight talk, an honest love for America…back to good old COMMON SENSE!\nLet me know how you feel about all that in a year.\nI have great hope and belief that President Trump and his administration, to care for all people.\nPlease explain why retired military (Veterans) lose their “Tricare 4 life” benefits if they do not pay into MEDICARE part B. If a veteran is 100% disabled, (service connected) why does he/she need MEDICARE?\nIf VA is the “primary provider” why do Veterans need Medicare B?\nI’ve performed a little research on Medicare Part B in comparison to Veterans healthcare, and Part B is required to be paid by a majority of others also obtaining other exquisite Government/Military benefits, with those individuals being pretty much ordered to pay.\nHowever, those separated are typically not ordered to pay into Medicare Part B. Reading in between the lines, if the boss of a company is not paying into it’s employees’ healthcare plan (eg. Medicare Part B), how can he/she legitimately supervise those below them for whom are (struggling/risking health and) paying into Medicare Part B. On the flip, maybe I’m just giving the system an excuse, but seems only logical as owners of companies can easily exploit the system, having the system paying for their everyday careless mistakes from subsequent employee health injuries.\nAlso noteworthy, keep an eye on something called guaranteed healthcare. VA healthcare is not guaranteed, to a certain extent, and can likely be cut at anytime, forcing the individuals back into the civilian Medicare healthcare whelm. I don’t like gambling, and guessing those at risk (eg. non-service connected) should probably sign-up with Medicare Part B.\nFunny thing, nobody preaches the above requisites. Obviously though, Medicare Part B is expensive for the vast majority, and it is sometimes a decision between food on the table and a roof over your head; with a hell of a lot of other people wanting and taking from you, whether time or money.\nWith Trump lying so much, I dont believe nothing. When you say resolve the VA claims, do you mean fairly or like with Ukraine?\nPlease dont touch the benefits I EARNED. They were NOT given to me.\nI have a case that has been at the board of of appeals since February 22 waiting to be heard by a Federal Judge with a case number that has not been heard yet. I am a 100% Veteran and I get the same ole story every time I call about it. My spouse is drawing aid and attendance for taking care of me now. What seems to be the problem just asking. It seems that to me that veterans are getting put on the back burner hoping we will die before anything is done and it is too late. Sir for so many years we gave everything for our country and now when we need help we can’t get it or those that work for VA think they are giving us something for free that have never served or sacrificed as we did.Sorry for the rant but that’s how mostly all of us Vets feel.\nI am a 23 year Vietnam Veteran, who has had his life shortened by doing the right thing for our country. I am 100% disabled due to Agent Orange, which was lied to us that it would not effect us in any way, thank you President Lyndon B. Johnson, a POS democrat. After reading some of the comments on this post, I am amazed at how out of touch so many of these vets are with reality. They say that their benefits have been cut, and they have under the Biden Administration. Trump in his first term extended benefits for us. He has been in office a whole 6 weeks, and has cut so much graf out of the tax payers budget, not the VA budget, and will cut more bulls##t out of the ash and trash that Biden introduced in his kickback schemes during his first four years. I am from a small Oklahoma town, and my small VA clinic has seen more improvements in the last two month than it has seen in the last four years. Calling Trump a lier and boggyman is so far from the truth, and as for GODE, Trump would have never introduced it if he didn’t think it would benefit the citizens of this United States. He sure as hell isn’t doing it for the money, he didn’t even accept one pay check the last time. I suggest that before you go around and bash the President, do your homework first. And yes I voted for him….. twice and I do not regret it. As for you nay sayers, get a grip, get a life.\nSPOT ON RUDY\nYOU ARE CORRECT! Thanks for your Service, Rudy!\nYou’re lying. Benefits might not get cut for now, but access to care will slow as workers are indiscriminately fired. Firing all probationary employees WILL leave a mark and since the Department of Gaslighting Everyone is rummaging around in data banks of sensitive information, it’s only a matter of time before some poorly supervised stooge steals it or leaves some back door to be exploited later when all the commotion is over. You’re not fooling anybody.\nStop watching MSNBC, Mr. Thorne.\nI was feeling pretty good until I saw the word “DOGE”. They do not do anything positive and are only out to destroy.\nWell, if you read Project 2025 and make it to page 646 there is a discussion of what to do about the budget. This section is heavily focused on cost-cutting and infrastructure reform and they call the existing VA Healthcare campuses unaffordable and inefficient. With that in mind they want to cut them and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).\nSo, close the big campuses (hospitals).\nProject 2025 is about cost savings, not about improving your experience with something you earned by risking life and limb for your country.\nThank you for calling this out so clearly Jay. Project 2025 is no joke and calls out the “cost savings” that all Trump’s cronies envision. They tried to outsource and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in the first term and are making a renewed effort to do it now.\nShifting our care to CBOCs means longer waits and receiving care from providers who often don’t understand the unique needs of Veterans. The time to write to your elected representatives is NOW, especially if you reside in a district that voted for Trump, to reach out to your Representative and Senators to let them know you do not want your benefits cut. You can find them here: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\nI’m glad you can fall into lockstep with your man fRump. Oh nevermind he has heel spurs so he can’t do anything anywhere near the military. I don’t think you have any idea what DOGE is doing especially in other locations. I hope you don’t F… up the veterans benefits but right now you can’t be trusted either.\nCollins is full of sh-t, like a typical MAGA f-cktard. He is part of the push to privatize the VA and sell it to Wall Street and Elon Musk. F-ck him, f-ck Musk, f-ck Trump. These scavengers are traitors.\nYou got that right Mr. Paul!\nReply-Russell It seems everyone on here is waiting.There is no need in being nasty, sounds like you are mad at the world. Mr Collins has only been in the job a week\nGold Star Wife\nIf you want to thank me for my service properly fund the VA Health Care System. Fill the medical staffing positions that have been cut. Take care of veterans. Meet your contractual obligations. Thank you.\nSec. Collins, I’m very excited to be working for the VA under your leadership. I should receive my start date this week. I’m a Master electrician in the state of Washington looking forward to applying my expertise at the Vancouver Washington campus. I’m also an Air Force veteran like yourself. Keep up the great work you’re achieving and thank you on behalf of all veterans.\nDon’t speak on my behalf. Stick your own head up his -ss if you want, but don’t drag me in there with you.\nDOGE is not part of our Congressional government. It was not officially authorized or funded by congress.\nVA has been short of people for a very long time, then we’re finally authorized to build their staff so more veterans could get help and quicker. Now these no nothings about VA health care come in and start down sizing.\nCollins is just another Trump minion doing what he’s told to do. Not a real LEADER for the VA. No substance to his video other than, just believe him.\nActuallly Tim, DOGE was started under Obama under a different name, the United States Digital Service. The more you know…\nHow do SES (Senior Executives) within the VA get their own flag? 90% of the work done at VA is by rank and file employees. I agreed w/ Trump when he said “drain the swamp.” Our Union (AFGE) agreed with him as well, however “the swamp” is at the top. I supported Trump up until Jan 6.\nSES employees at the top making $200,000.00 a year for doing nothing for Veterans at all. This was especially prevalent within the VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration) where managers (“coaches”) were sent to central office in DC just to screw the system up worse. I worked for VBA for 26 years. Here’s and idea for Elon/DOGE – put EVERY employee on production and have them account for their workday just like I had to for 20+ years.\nI trust this guy less than a second lieutenant with a map. Anyone believe this crap? Protect yourself and your family. Back up all your information and medical records. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is a wrecking ball that doesn’t have the benefit of knowing what he is wrecking, and he doesn’t care about you or anyone else but trump.\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI work for the VA and can tell you they gutted a lot of Compensation depts to give to Contractors instead, contractors were never supposed to be doing the bulk of these exams. Now they get to make decisions no appeal, they make appointments for Veterans but don’t tell them and then say they never showed to the appointment. The project 2025 already said they were going to “look” at Benefits, you know what that means I don’t trust any thing this puppet says!\nSounds good, but how can you believe what any person trump appoints says. They are only saying what trump tells them to say, when trump’s actions indicate differently. A reduction in funding and removing 1000 employees can only increase wait times for appointments and treatments, adding to the workload of the already over worked and stressed VA staff. Upto now, at the VA hospital in Louisville kentucky, I have had excellent care and treatment with respect as a Veteran. I would hate to see the quality of care regress to what it was several years ago, when Veterans were not recieving timely care and would die. If this would happen, it would not the fault of the VA staff and employees, but trump’s and his appointments.\nThis does not address any transparency issues. This continues to devalue the role of news press, which is their role to inform the people of what our government is doing. I don’t see improvement in VA benefits, nor facilities. Your job is to ensure Veterans are getting the care they deserve based on their sacrifices for this Republic. They swore an oath to defend the constitution, not a king, nor his servants.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nUnfortunately this was posted as a reply… this is to the VA Secretary.\nBiden’s administration passed the PACT act and my local VA hospital was running smoothly and efficiently. At the time, I said that any vet who voted for, in Tammy Duckworth’s memorable nickname for him, “Cadet Bonespurs,” had to be insane. It turned out that more than 60% of you voted the for peabrain. You reap what you sow.\nRich, you cannot believe everything you hear on MSNBC. Set back and watch, see what President Trump does and THEN you can comment with some authority. “We the People” voted for President Trump and he is doing exactly what he said he would do, what “We the People” asked him to do. Why are you so upset, young man ? President Trump has only been in office for a few weeks, lets give him a chance before you condemn him.\nThank you for your service\nSemper Fi\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67 100% disabled\nCommunity Care services is a absolute disaster , appointments on wrong g days and locations as well as no regard for patients available and made aware of at last minute !!!!\nDon’t believe them. President Musk & Trump are proven liars. Please remember the oath you took to protect our country’s vets.\nI was wounded twice in Vietnam, one sustained from a bouncing betty mine and one from an incoming mortar. Got neither purple heart, it’s been 58 years without benefits deserved, toughie shitski no?!!\nRespectfully, Secretary Doug Collins?! Do you really believe that anyone trust what you say in this video. You were appointed by a criminal, liar, cheater, stealer, and everything that goes against the core values on the US military. Your message is not very asurring and somewhat unprofessional when addressing the men, women and transgender community volunteers of our military forces. FAKE NEWS sir! You sound like a MAGA (not a republican) mouthpiece for a PODUS (the New King of the US) that should have been locked up and sentenced to jail, just like any other American in the US who has committed the same or like type crimes. Best wishes to you and a an empire that is getting ready to fall, just like the Romans did from greed, crimes against people, emperialist, and capitalism at the expense of tax payers dollars.\nRetired US Navy Officer, please take your Left wing political garbage somewhere else, it’s not wanted here. Not what this site is for.\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67\nI don’t trust anyone appointed by trump, and that’s the way it is.\nI know it’s all made up by the media. You’re trump’s nominee so I don’t expect anything else from you. They will be making adjustments to the VA for “efficiency” This will change some benefits that Veterans receive and some of changes will not be in the best interest of Veterans. I hope you will make another video when these changes are implemented and explain why these changes are for the benefit to veterans. And by the way the administration stated they are using the 2025 Plan that most likely make changes for Veterans.\nI’ve had a claim pending since Oct, 2024. This guys is politician he is only telling what he is told to do to keep his job.\nGiven the fact that nobody knows what Doggy is doing and the capricious nature of this admin’s actions, I have no faith in anything that was said here. The US has a long history of screwing over veterans and this will be just another chapter in that book dating back to Washington and the first Congress denying promised pensions.\nI served 6 years, part of which was during war. I used my private insurance for my health care until after I retired . It would be good to realize that all of us veterans were trained to look out for those around us first and ourselves last. When I needed my VA benefits was when the cost of my regular healthcare threatened to take all of my substantial savings. I applied and was granted VA healthcare in recognition of my service. My medication bills went from over $1,800 per quarter to less than $100 for the same period. Keep in mind that many vets have always done what I did. We put off using our benefits until after we retired. That means the population of veterans who are being seen by the VA are more likely to have chronic diseases and need care for problems that require far more attention than the average American.\nThank-you President Trump and Secretary Collins! Most Veterans appreciate everything you’re doing.\nIf you don’t like what President Trump and DOGE are doing, it’s probably because you’re a recipient of the FRAUD, WASTE & ABUSE they are finding.\nNot hard to believe, you love trumps delusions. Sad part is his dislike for vets, especially those, who have been wounded. Cannot be seen in a parade, where the president may be seen in a photo. And to think he could not serve, due to his little toe problems. Stop with the false bullsh-t of expecting them to clean up the abuse issues. Lest we forget, the 4 trillion tax breaks for the Rich. I guess you would not mind giving, your\nretirement benefits to the cause? Would you? AJ Duke.\nSincerely Mr Collin’s (VA Secretary) with all due Respect…Congratulations on your Appointment of the Greatest most powerful Nation of Veterans in the World, but with that being said, We will hold you accountable & responsible for protecting our Benefits & Healthcare for all of This United States Veterans…Our livelihood & Healthcare depends on your commitment & Decisions as our VA Secretary ( Again the Greatest Veterans & Fighting Force in the World) DOGE Is only a Word to us Veterans & it should be to you also..Congratulations Again (Actions Speak Louder Than Words) Thank You & God Bless\nplease check my va-hotline message which explains in detail what change i feel should be made to help vets like that don’t want to be buried in a national cemetary. in my case i am 91 and already paid 11000.00 to prepare my remains to be burried next to my mother and father at a cemetary [ not va burial cemetary} and presently provisions othe than a upright stone and military ceremony are available to me . it is not fair i am sure there are many vets doing the same with no financial help..legislation should chang e to help vets like me doing the same expenses before they die. thank you peter pace\nGet up off your knees and raise your head.

I don’t think so.\nWhile I believe Secretary Collins that there are no Vet benefits being cut, I don’t believe much the rest of the BS he spouts. There have already been cuts to VA staff, including some who are Vets. Allowing Musk and his band of tech geniuses access to anything to do with the VA is ludicrous. I was on active duty in the Army from 3 May 1967 to 23 December 1970, which included two tours in Vietnam. While I was doing that, Trump was nursing his heel spurs and avoiding the Draft. Collins appears to have much more loyalty to Trump than to me and my Brother and Sister Vets.\nThe company that I work for does a lot of work at New York VA facilities. The waste I see is unbelievable, mostly due to laziness and lack of knowledge and using the system. I heard firsthand that two overhead garage doors had to be replaced at the facility. The facility super was given the task of getting a price. Several local contractors were asked for prices the best price was $18,000. Since the contractor was on the VA’S list of approved contractors, they had to go thru an already approved Veteran Contractor. The price turned out to be $32,000 dollar to do the same job. The contractor that showed up to do the job was the same contractor whose original price was $18,000. Waste at the VA.\nSo wastefulness from contractors and not the federal employees. That is what federal employees always say. Their hands are tied as to what to buy from whom and entering into contracts. But, will they actually deal with contracting fraud and abuse, of course not! That would be auditing accounts of big companies like Boeing and Space X all the way down to small companies like the one you mentioned.\nI am a VA patient with the Seattle VA Medical Center. I do not believe a thing coming from the mouth of a Trump appointee. DOGE is a hit job on the entire government by a non-elected, power-hungry oligarch. I will not be holding my breath for the “improvements” to care that this man describes. What I look forward to is a return to sanity in the federal government, a government not headed by a complete incompetent. In the interim, I will wait for the knock on my door from the goon squad.\nSpent 56 minutes on hold Tuesday for a 1 minute conversation to schedule annual eye exam. Might want to look at your numbers, bud.\nDude, you have clearly been drinking the Kool-Aid. And a lot!! You have no idea what that job is about. Be a leader instead of a puppet for propaganda for the tear down of this country.\nFlightj\nTruth! 32 years with Uncle Sugar and I never had an issue with VA Medical in 4 states, SE Asia and Europe. And I am 90% compensated since 06. As a beneficiary, YOU DO YOUR PART and the VA will do theirs.\nBy retirement in 2014 I had had my fill of babysitting grown-ass male and female and a handful of other than” Soldiers who could not even tell you their contractional MSO nor their ETS! Bitching and whining about being told what to do. YOU tell the VA what YOU need, WHY you need it, PROVE it and it happens.\nDont step up and simply say, “my computer’s BROKE”, for example! It was NEVER Uncle Sugar’s job to hold yer and hand and coddle You!\n@Flightj – that is because he is a “There we are then” person, purposely appointed by MAGA, the future King Trump or Vance of the USA. Definitely NOT TRUE Republicans. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/twat?q=TWAT\nGet the phone system at the Malcom Randall Hospital FIXED!\nVA disability needs a overhaul In how they determine vets are service connected. Range of motion is not the “ONLY” way to determine one has lasting injuries just because it helps weed out claims so the government can turn their back on veterans. Thats one instance. Hearing loss – you put anyone in a soundproof box and then turn on sounds, of course you can hear them, but if your in the real world this doesn’t apply. In the real world so many other sounds are also going on that make hearing at a loss and not how we used to hear prior to military. Some age does apply and that could be taken into effect, but the current system is flawed. Only able to apply for one Mental issue? So if i have PTSd and also a mental aspect due to pain in another area, they cannot be applied together? sorry pick one. The whole program needs to be overhauled to help protect veterans. We waste a whole day for a simple dr visit if we go to the VA and the people working dont give 2 sh-ts about us. Then to get seen out in town by a truly qualified Dr not trying to just save a buck and push pills, well no way. Denied. or if on the choice program, We shouldn’t have to go get pre approval to see my choice if my out in town doctor determines i need treatment. How about if you get 12 visits to a chiro, but chiro says you need more. Denied. you should be fixed by now. Just ignore all future request that are sent in. Its a basic waste of resources and funds to keep the VA. Just give us the ability to go in town to our own choice of Doctor to be seen and get healed in our manner, Even if not the typical doctor pushing pills and its one that uses natural medicine or plant medicine to cure.\nThis man is a Trumper. I dont believe a word he says and I am very concerned about my veteran benifits\nThank you for putting that video out. I liked the “to the point” straightforwardness of your comments. It does make me feel more at ease hearing the truth.\nDurham VA dental clinic does not answer their phone nor do they return voicemail calls. I have left 7 messages in the last 3 weeks and no response! I am 100% permanent disability and am eligible for dental care but the clinic in Durham is incognito! Help!\nHi, John. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nI’m glad he is in office. I’m a Vietnam Vet. I have a disability case that as gone on for about 1 yr. I am now type 2 diabetes. This should be a slam dunk because of agent orange. The VA turned me down this first time. I appealed and they admitted their error and it’s still has not been resolved. This shows that cases are not getting done quickly.\nThey never have! They are understaffed and the Feds are not in the business to approve any case easily as the VA is the second highest spending in the government.\nWhen you allowed Musk (a fascist and Na–)-and his band of juvenile hackers, access to our VA data – you already betrayed the Veteran community. Your slick videos and worthless press releases will never gain you the credibility and respect that is essential to lead. Project 2025 targets Veterans benefits. We are not stupid -we can read. I suggest you reread your oath to the Constitution. As a Veteran, from a Family of Veterans – I cannot imagine why any sane person would support a convicted felon, rapist, draft dodger as our CIC. A person who has absolutely no respect or appreciation for service – and openly mocks disabled Veterans, will never, ever be worthy of respect. Do better.\nI felt like you were trying to sell me a car and slash the prices. And by the way DOGE is not an official department. All you idiots think that two billionaires care about low income and middle class workers. They are the reincarnation of capitalism and the abolishment of government. Guess what ?! The VA is government! Supported by federal money! You sir are completely unprofessional and your statement meant nothing. I hope for the Best Buy expect nothing but the worst from you and your dictators Elon and Trump.\nYou hit the nail on the head. Never buy a “car” or whatever else they are are sell. We are all doomed.\nI can tell that you are a Democrat and have very low IQ. It is your type of thinking that has almost destroyed this country. President Trump and Doug Collins are both working hard to save this country and the VA. Please move to Iran and talk bad about their leadership and see how long you will live.\nHere, Here. Agree whole heartedly. They are following project 2025 by the book, in case, well it seems that no-one has noticed. After, or once they finish, decimating the Pentagon and DOD. We are next. The DOGeS, have hip waiters on. And some teen hackers who know coding and computers real good will be barking down the doors of freedom and liberty, soon! We must unite, against this domestic enemy, and stand as one. Lets make noise and show what joke jr-6, was.\nFast talking used car salesman. Don’t buy into the lies. We’re screwed.\nWe had an oversite group in place with inspectors general for our government. I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nWaiting for 6,8,10 months for a benefits claim is not a good look for the VA. The backlog is not sustainable and very frustrate those in need. Let’s find solutions.\nFiring more people is definitely not the answer, when they are already understaffed.\nI’m thrilled and excited about President Trump and Doug Collins doing the right thing. I trust both and I know that they will Make America Great Again.\nThanks for your help.\nThank you Secretary Collins, for having our backs, for putting the truth out to the veteran community, for working hand-in-hand with the great work that DOGE is conducting, and for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our Great President (President Trump)!!!\nYou are very much appreciated Mr. Collins and we are so grateful that you are our Secretary of Veteran Affairs!\nSincerely,\nB.K. Gilbert (Retired EOD Chief, USN)\nThank you, Mr. Secretary. Looking forward to the administration’s success!\nThis message seems to skirt around possible data breaches regarding veterans personal information. DOGE has already broken numerous laws and it’s difficult to imagine that an unelected immigrant from South Africa cares about Veterans personal information being compromised.\nVietnam vets were screwed during the Obama years. In 2019 the Blue Water Naval Act of 2019 was passed by Trump and immediately the VA improved. Trump was given an overwhelming mandate to turn around the mess the Zombie president has left us.\nThis video is well-timed and provides good reassurance. But, can we trust it? The tone was overly partisan toward the Trump administration instead of being a nonpartisan head of the VA, which is NOT a partisan subject.\nFor the record, it was Biden who got the PACT act through and never talked poorly about veteran status (like DJT talking about John McCain’s status).\n???????????????\nThank you and thank God for Trump and Elon Musk. I hope DOGE will fix the Biden problems at VA.\nAll the hate directed at Elon and Trump is hilarious. Clearly bots. None of them address REAL veteran concerns. Like the fact that we can’t even watch the video without a YouTube account. We can submit anything about our problems with the webservice because the pages don’t load. We can’t ever get directly in touch with our teams anymore, it’s all online, and as previously mentioned, the pages don’t load. Not even to submit a bug!\nSince you are a Trump appointee, how can we be assured that when Elon Musk and his minions come calling, you will not capitulate to their demands?\nYou are lieing\nAny Vets that voted for Trump Jon Un now complaining about what he and his cronies and Musk are doing to our country with their ‘scorched earth’ project 2025 strategy (just like Putin or any other dictator), are just as complicit in this traitorous, authoritarian condescension, destruction of democracy and abandonment of American citizens. Don’t even try to argue that Trump/Musk/Project2025 and this congress is comparable to previous administrations. That s**t won’t fly. The average American voter is the dumbest (and most destructive) imbecile on the entire planet, bar none, with no idea what true patriotism is. It is they who are to blame, and it is they that must change their ways if our nation is to survive.\nWOW, right on the money. I could not have said it better. Thanks for speaking up. When do we march?\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI hope THEY are listening. Can’t believe grownups (MAGA GOP) are too scared to stand against tyranny, corruption, and now forsaking our allies for the war criminal Putin.\nOh my gosh, No Hope. Seek Help, SOON !\nHe talked but didn’t address concerns! The rumors are in Projection 2025! Firing Veterans from the Pentagon! I am sick of this.\nBenefits may not be getting cut but services are. The recent releasing of probationary positions as a RIF has very seriously impacted the Mental Services Department of the Danville IL VA. And now it will take months if not years to get positions filled again. Someone needs to rethink the hirring practices. It’s oudated and to slow. Veterans need better now, not in 6 months.\nI hope Director Collins is wise enough to reverse the firering in some areas and restore staffing before it’s too late.\nVeterans are depending on you.\nI, along with the rest of the veterans, will be holding you to this statement.\nIf this is a temporary distraction by you while they decide how they are going to dismantle our benefits, there will be a reckoning. You will have to explain why you did not protect and expand our benefits as you are now saying you will. Keep this in mind. We certainly will.\nYou don’t have to understand our lack of trust in this administration, you are tasked with building some level of trust in a country gone mad.\nBenefits should increase whenever they are supporting service connected health issues.\nI see all these negative comments about poor service and claims which have not been resolved for years, however, the criticism was never voiced during the past 4 years, during the Biden era. Did these cases suddenly occur now that President Trump is in office, or Mr. Collins coming onboard recently? My opinion is, those who are complaining are politically motivated and not a true measure of veterans nationwide. Regarding DOGE and Elon Musk, who was appointed by President Trump to oversee the waste and abuse of our tax dollars, why would anyone with common sense condemn such research? Should our billions in tax dollars be given away freely, with no accounting?\nBingo!! You hit the nail on the head…\nConsider the source – Just the “LEFT” being vocal with no substantial evidence of anything other than their own distorted view.\nBecause, like it or not, we got our benefits expanded under the last administration. You may hate Biden, but we weren’t being gutted like we were under the first Trump admin, and now they are accelerating the gutting process because they don’t care about veterans as much as they care about cutting costs for their Oligarch friends.\nBeing a Vietnam Veteran exposed to Agent Orange I’m experiencing medical problems for the pass 13 years. My private medical doctors say you can’t rule out that the cause wasn’t from agent orange, but of course the VA rejected my claim. But all the VA information says they don’t know the full scope of problems caused by Agent Orange.\nThe VA has been very good to me. I served my Country without any thought of a “payback “. However the GI bill helped with my advanced education, while the health care has helped me through serious issues.\nThank you President Trump and Director Collins. Remain vigilant and caring.\nYour video reminds me of a 1970s TV commercial by Ronco. “It slices! It dices!” Well it better not slice and dice my benefits. That includes the VA privatization scam from the Koch Brothers astroturfing “Concerned Veterans of America” and Heritage Foundation. And if I find out DOGE has been in my VA medical records, expect a HIPAA violation lawsuit.\nYou are not believable. Any one who has to disparage anything including the media to make your point holds no weight. I have been waiting ages for my disability rating to be increased and now I have to worry about the security of my VA data on top of all this. Praising DOGE and Trump is counter productive to all people with a brain. Results. We need results dumb videos.\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you ate leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity. The last four years under O’Biden and Harris has been demeaning and difficult foe us veterans. We have had to deal with transgender staff, what pronouns do you go by signs, rainbow flags and safe space signs on the entry doors to the VA clinics and hospitals and ridiculous videos on the screens at the hospital and emails related to DEI and wokeism. They took all of the military related signs and information in the halls and replaced them with stupid unrelated so called artwork throughout the hospital. I mentioned it to the maintenance workers when they pulled the military stuff down and they said, “We don’t want too, but we were told we had to do it or lose our jobs.” Please bring back an American and Patriotic VA that respects our military and it’s veterans. I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir,\nRespectfully,\nJohn Morris\nUSN American Patriot\nI read what you have experienced, not in my Community Based VA Clinic. In Arkansas. I was familiar with a Veteran Arts competition that was nation wide and regional. I think it was called creative arts something, I entered it and the Vets that submitted were given a show in Austin Tx, VA Hospital. The pictures, paintings and various art forms were from all Veterans-combat, Vietnam, Gulf War, Desert Storm (Mine). We got some certificates and a ribbon. So if you did not like the art work on the walls did you bother checking if was from some of your Patriot Brothers? Or do do you just like talking smack? And insulting us, Combat Vets, Retirees, Veterans and Brothers in Arms. Jerk-Off\nOh poor thing, how “difficult” it was for you to walk into a building and see a pride flag. How did you ever survive such horrible treatment? I sure hope you put a claim in for that.\nJust so you know, gay and transgender people exist, even in the military. And a real patriot serving in the military, a real leader, would fight for all and include all Americans who are willing to fight alongside you.\nGet over yourself.\nI believe nothing that comes out of these individuals mouths. You all are kowtowing to a psychopath. God help us all.\nDoug Collins is a slick talking trump appointee ie, a liar. If his mouth is moving, he is fibbing. I wouldn’t buy a used cat from the guy. DOGE is out to destroy the middle class. All the money taken from us, will be spent to continue tax cuts for Elon and the other ultra rich. If you believe otherwise, you are a gullible fool. This IS PROJECT 2025, and it’s only the beginning.\nWhy are we no longer being provided with eyeglasses? We are eligible for exams but not the actual pair of eyeglasses as we had received in the past.\nI have no benefits after my husbands Carlos death will this be changed at all he was 75 % disabled he went and fought in Korea ???Carlos Mann was an honorable man ??thank you Shirley Mann\nShirley you need to go to a local V.A. office and find out if you can get DIC payment for spouse.\nWelcome to the Veterans Team Sir, and as I know you all will continue to do great things to make the Veterans Services even greater. Me and my wife are retired Army Veterans and support the VA always.\nMr Secretary Collins, Welcome! I preface by reminding that my best VA experience was during Vet Friendly DJ Trump’s last term. After that came the purge, and change era. Veteran Benefit Cuts? That happened during the last 4 years (Biden), a purge of experienced doctors and nurses, replaced with inexperienced training less experienced. No one answers phones when you need, you leave a message and they call if, and when they want! The re vamped computer systems that are harder to use and deliver less Vet desired information? A joke! How much did that exercise cost? Who did that really benefit? Veterans clearing cases faster? Don’t be fooled CLEARING Claims is not a benefit to Vets Assisting to, and approving Claims is what benefits vets.\nThe media is part of the last administration, and will continue trying to misinform as always! DOGE? We should all WELCOME DOGE with open arms! President Trump has a track record of helping Military, and Vets at all levels, and it 110% transparent in his actions, which guarantees, All the money from waste found would be redirected to benefit the Veterans, not taken from them. DOGE will find if they HAVE BEEN stealing the money from you, as in the other departments of government.\nWelcome again Secretary Collins.\n4. End VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security: This option would take effect in January 2026.\nA) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older.\nB) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older who would begin receiving IU after December 2025.\nT he Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that were incurred or worsened during active-duty service. The amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. In addition, VA may increase certain veterans’ disability compensation to the 100 percent level even though the department has not rated their service-connected disabilities at that level. To receive the resulting supplemental compensation, termed Individual Unemployability (IU) payments, disabled veterans must apply for the benefit and meet two criteria. First, they generally must have a disability rating between 60 percent and 90 percent. Second, VA must determine that the veterans cannot maintain “substantial gainful employment” because of the severity of a service-connected disability. Receipt of IU is not based on age, voluntary withdrawal from work, or other factors.\nThis option consists of two alternatives. Under the first, VA would stop making IU payments to veterans age 67 or older (the full retirement age for Social Security benefits for those born after 1959).\nThat restriction would apply to both current and prospective recipients.\nWhen veterans reached age 67, all VA disability payments would revert to the amount associated with the rated disability level; veterans age 67 or older who were already receiving IU payments would no longer receive them after the effective date of the option.\nUnder the second alternative, veterans who began receiving the IU supplement after December 2025 would no longer receive those payments once they reached age 67, and no new applicants age 67 or older would be eligible for IU benefits after that date.\nVeterans currently receiving IU payments who would reach age 67 or older after the effective date of the option would continue to collect the IU supplement.\n3. Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Payments are structured differently than other disability programs. VA’s disability payments are intended to compensate for the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries, whether or not a particular veteran’s condition reduced his or her earnings. Unlike disability programs such as Social Security Disability Insurance, payments are unaffected by a veteran’s earnings or other types of income.\nUnder this option, VA would means-test (that is, restrict full compensation to those with income below a certain amount) all current and prospective recipients of VA’s disability compensation.\nBeginning in January 2026, veterans with service-related disabilities and total household income below $135,000, excluding disability income from the VA, would receive full benefits.\nThat threshold corresponds to the 70th percentile of total household income in the United States in 2022, adjusted for inflation to reach the threshold value applicable to 2026 benefits.\nCBO estimates that nearly 30 percent of veterans receiving disability payments from VA will have household income above that threshold in 2026. (After 2026, that income threshold would rise with the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.)\nAbove the threshold, benefits would be phased out at a constant rate: For every additional two dollars of gross household income, disability compensation would decrease by one dollar.\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 20342.\nNarrow Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation by Excluding Veterans With Low Disability Ratings – This option would take effect in\nJanuary 2026:\nA) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for all veterans.\nB) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for new applicants.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\nThe amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. By law,\nVA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable, on the average earnings that veterans would be expected\nto lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries.\nThose ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce his or her earnings.\nUnder this option’s first alternative, VA would narrow eligibility for disability compensation by REQUIRING A DISABILITY RATING OF 30 PERCENT OR\nHIGHER FOR ALL VETERANS. AS A RESULT, SOME CURRENT RECIPIENTS WOULD NO LONGER RECIEVE BENEFITS.\nThe second alternative would require a 30 percent or higher disability rating only for new disability compensation applicants.\n(Current recipients would not be affected.) CBO estimates that in 2026, about 20 percent of veterans will have a disability rating below 30 percent.\nSee like a bunch of liberal hacks are on this page. The funny thing is they’re blaming Trump for their sh-tty medical care and other benefits. Uhm, nice try. He has only been in office a few weeks. Your sh-tty care was under Biden.\nAnd the congregation said AMEN…\nI have received the BEST care possible, for the past years. Several MAJOR surgeries. Jaw Joint Replaced, Neck Fusion, lower back fusion. No wait times. Biden brought us the PACT ACT.\nAmen to that !\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 2034\n1. Include VA’s Disability Payments in Taxable Income:\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or\nworsened during active-duty service. By law, VA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable,\non the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or\ninjuries. Those ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce that person’s earnings.\nDisability compensation is not means-tested, (restricted to those with income below a certain amount), and payments are exempt from income taxes.\nPayments are in the form of monthly annuities and typically continue until the beneficiary’s death.\nNote: See Proposed “Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.”\nThis option would include VA’s disability benefit payments in taxable income.\nDoug Collins also says he isn’t a huge bundle of sticks, so can he be trusted?\nLet’s make this country the best it can be. Thanks for being on the front lines for us veterans. My comrades deserve it!\nA statement that wasn’t a statement. Anything to support your troll of a king.\nhow about giving dental care?\nWhy can’t we get an insurance card and a list of Doctors to go to when we are sick or need a specialist. If your sick you have to drive down to the hospital ER. I recently tried to get an appointment with a dermatologist finally got one 3month out. I went to an outside Dr. for my condition. Tried to get help with community care. No help. Filed a formal complaint never heard anything.\nIt has been reported that the VA Crisis Hotline has been hit with staff firings. Is this true?\nBlaming it on the “press” is not going to cut it. Thousands of VA employees have all been let go. Any veteran will have his or her own personal story of observation. Collectively, veterans are heroes, survivors and fighters NOT “suckers and losers”. To have two non-veteran lackeys taking away our veteran rights is a travesty. Vets have to keep their opens open and stay strong!\nSlower than ever I put in a dependent change August 1, 2024 and still in received status. 7 months? Really ?\nArticle seems like a one sided snow job. You should already be doing what you say DOGE is doing. The military playing politics is how PUTIN works.\nI’m also have a claim on process for then three years and waiting.\nYou said: DOGE representatives at VA are reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans.\n1st – DOGE do not know what the hell they doing. No experience at all.\n2nd – YOU don’t have not experience SO that make YOU don’t know what the hell you are doing.\n3rd – That so call President NOT a president, HE IS A BULLY, LAIR MAN getting PAID for the future.\n4th – How dare you make a Video saying what this so called President NOT going to do. I bet you want tell him that in Front of his face.\n5th – To say more, why don’t you send this Video to the SO CALL PRESIDENT and have him to address it LIVE on TV so millions of voters can watch it.\n6th – To do MORE, why don’t you HIRE Veterans (Wives) to do what DOGE does know how to review contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans. VETERANS ARE THE ONLY ONES KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE NOT DOING. We as Veterans deserve better services.\n7th – STOP THE BULLS??T, and COME CLEAN BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF IT.\n8th – And the last thing- go back and listen to YOUR Video and tell me ONE thing you DID NOT say WHAT THE AMERICANS and VETERANS WANTS TO HEAR. This tells me you ARE NOT the Secretary of Veterans Affairs we are looking for.\n#“ DROP THE ? “\nFrom a Vietnam Vet: You do not speak for me. God bless and protect Trump from all his enemies foreign and domestic like you.\nNicely put. We think alike.\nDid you finish grade school ? This is NOT a political site so please take your Leftwing garbage somewhere else. I disagree with you completely.\nAs a veteran, I am truly grateful for the care and support I have received from the VA. From the moment I reached out for assistance, the staff was professional, compassionate, and committed to ensuring I had access to the benefits and services I needed.\nThe healthcare services have been excellent, with knowledgeable doctors and nurses who genuinely care about veterans’ well-being. Scheduling appointments has been straightforward, and the quality of care has exceeded my expectations. The benefits office has also been incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process, making it easy to understand my entitlements and how to access them.\nBeyond medical care, the VA provides invaluable resources for employment, education, and financial assistance, which have been instrumental in helping me transition successfully into civilian life. Their dedication to veterans is evident in every interaction, and I appreciate their continued efforts to improve and expand their services.\nI highly recommend the VA to fellow veterans seeking reliable healthcare and support. Their commitment to serving those who have served is truly commendable!\nFirst i trust the media and always have as secretary of the VA do the job for the veterans who made our country safe and not for DODGE TRUMP OR MUSK\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you are leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity.

I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir\nFaster than what? For fifty years I have sought the simplest of services, nothing. Last Jully I filed again, got diagnosed with PTSD, Chemical poisoning, hearing loss, etc etc. Still nothing. In fact, trying to trace my claim, it was sent to another office in another state just to be lost again. I’m tired of this crap. I don’t have that much time left on this earth and I’m stressing anymore over it.\nDear Sir\nI am a 90 year-old Navy Veteran with 32 years of Naval Service. In 1971, I was ordered to Viet Nam, where I was exposed to the Agent Orange defoliant and subsequently developed Prostate Cancer.

Last September 2024, I filed a VA Form 21-8940 to apply for increased compensation based on unemployability. I have completed all the evidence , underwent a physical exam, but still awaiting to hear of any decision.

While he sat back and took his deferment for a painful bone spur. His support is non-existent except where it serves him.\nYes I agree. Claims are not being processed faster, slower by the day. I have a dependant claim for over a year now. Why? When all.it takes is to add my daughter back to my compensation claim.\nLIAR!LIAR!LIAR!\nComments being censored ?\nYes, they are.\nThanks, for the info, You have always done greatwork in Washington, welcome aboard,sir,\nVA Hospital needs central scheduling. Started to use the Durham VA medical and to make an appointment have to call the various clinics directly and leave a message and hope to get a return call in several weeks to schedule an appointment that could be months out. Crazy.\nWaiting moderation ? Is this sensorship ?\nIt’s censorship….but yes, that is what it is.\nCongratulation on your appointment,\nI just want to ask a quick question here. I recently broke off two front teeth right down to the gum line. I need implants that cost $10,000 .00 to repair this. My Dental insurance won’t cover it because they say that it is cosmetic. The VA only will cover up to $1000.00, and it has to be done by someone that excepts Veterans Choice coverage which will only be $1000.00. Is their anything I can do to get this fully covered by the VA? The VA tried to give me an implant on a molar a few years ago and they botched it. So I am going to Clear Choice Implant center to get this work done. I have only one shot at this and I need someone who does nothing but implants. I have a 100 % disability from the Vietnam War and I am struggling with Small B Cell Lymphoma from agent Orange exposure and medical bills are mounting up. Thank You for letting me contacting you.\nHi, Geno, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nI was recently at the VA center in Hot Springs Arkansas and felt terrible about the way the older VETS were treated . I am 77and am lucky to have younger people to help me get to places like Hot Springs. this is a beautiful complex, proud of it. I was there for my eyesite exam. Older crippled vets had wives or friends pushed them inside. Once ‘inside’ they were told to go back out the door, take a left and walk back up a walkway to the end of the other building and look for a tent with their number on it and go in. This was done on the outside. Some Vets asked what was going on and were told where everyone could hear, that the other place had poor air quality had, not been repaired. This was over a year old they were told. Very sad.\nI am so thankful for our VA Services.\nThings do however take a long time. I have had a claim in for @ 6 months and no word on the status. So maybe more transparency on claims would be helpful.\nGod bless you, President Trump and the USA\nHi, Dan, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nFaster than ever! Yeah right. Claim and reviews are taking longer than ever. Says 140 days. Some one is feeding mis information.\nAlso say you are improving taking care of vets. But what i see is a system designed to reject vets. For sure the vets that are getting older. You have vets that are young and only served two years being taken care of better than old vets that served 8 to 20 years.\nMaybe you can explain why staff at VA hospitals are being reduced! That’s a fact!\nThis happens quite often especially now that more veterans are opting for video or phone appointments. This also happens if the VA hired way more staff than what’s necessary.\nI would love VA’s dental plan to be expanded. I currently pay for the Met Life program offered by VA but am still unable to pay for dental treatments that are needed. The copays and out of pocket are still expensive.\nYou either lie or are naive. I no longer trust you or the government of the former United States.\nWe defended the United States yet you traded it for a red hat.\nYou’re not allowed to be surprised when programs and benefits are cut. This is what you wanted when YOU voted against democracy.\nI am not buying it. VA just fired my PCP that had only been on the job for a few months. Now I am without…again.\nI have been suffering from crippling asthma and constant shortness of breath since my deployments to the middle east where I sat on top of diesel generators, worked with asbestos, and inhaled gas and excrement fumes for months on end. The VA has been willing to prescribe me combivent respimat medication for COPD and Advair, but REFUSES to diagnose me with asthma and approve my 10% disability claim for 14 years. I have done everything I need to do after the passing of the PACT act. I am tired of suffering.\nSecretary Collins,\nI understand that outsourcing C&P exams takes in excess of 10 Billion dollars out of the Administrations’ budget. As a veteran subject to at least 15 of these outsourced exams I think it’s time to move these exams back into the VA medical facilities. While I understand that the exams were outsourced to provide timely care, they have turned into a money grab by the providers.\nMany of these exams are being administered by providers in small offices with questionable qualifications. They are more likely than not to deny a service connection lest they offend their cash cow.\nA lot of people don’t understand what is going on, the ruling wealthy class (top 1%) want to “Make America Great Again” by turning back the hands of time to the past, not the 1950’s as many believe (when the tax rate was 94% on the wealthy), but to the 1890’s, The Gilded Age (the time of the Robber Barons). For those that don’t know the real history of this time period: https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/plutocracy/\nSo how did things get this bad that the ruling class could turn back time to a period in our history that was far worse for the working class? Brainwashing. The ruling class took the teachings of Edward Bernays (author of the book Propaganda), the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and have been using that to control the masses ever since. Bernays took his uncle’s work in the subconscious mind and perverted it into a means of controlling the masses.

I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nAbsolutely!!! I am a liberal–not a Democrat nor Republican, but someone who believes in freedom and human rights (equality for all people at every stage, income, race, creed, or religion) and I am horrified by how many veterans, people of faith, and those who claim to support the veterans can believe that this president is or ever was, an honest or honorably devoted servant of the people of this country or, and especially, its veterans. I am sick with grief over how the veterans are going to be treated by this administration.\nThey go on camera and feed us a line of BS thinking we will stay calm and forget our concerns. They have an agenda to gut social programs across the board, including VA benefits, to offset their funding of tax cuts for the uber wealthy plutocrats.\nWe elected the wrong people and now we will suffer the consequences.\nMost of us was mislead what the president said\nWe? You did, speak for yourself.\nTrump & Musk Are Lying and are Dangerously Taking Apart the Government to enrich themselves. Our Privacy Rights Have Been Violated. Veterans Heath Care Has Been Cut by Firing VA workers when there is a Shortage of 50,000 plus Unfilled Jobs at the VA Today . PLEASE STOP LYING TO VETERANS WE DESERVE SOO MUCH BETTER. Wake Up Veterans We have been Duped\nAmen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nNo offense, but any man who said that Veterans were suckers to go to Vietnam, who avoided doing his patriate duty because of a “bone spur” , attempted to overthrow the election results by sending his mop to the Capital then giving pardons to those who convicted and sentenced for that attach and is a convicted felony himself and not be trusted to protect the very vets he belittled.\nOH, yeah that’s the spirit. It’s them pesky Maggots that are the main problem. We know it was a tough vote between a zombie and and then a woman by God. Pray for healing and knowledge to voters and constituents, to learn about not only his evil ways, but his followers and ministry of capitalism. Sometimes we just have vote against the evil regimes. Allah Akbar, er Praise God that is, Gulf War One flashback.\nThank you for informing that benefits will continue to stay sane for veterans that deserve them. It’s a great relief!\nIt would be nice to keep the same nurses and doctors for a while sir. The VA is a rotating door. It’s getting annoying to keep going through doctors etc.\nAlso you should have a public email for us to contact. Even if it’s through your staff.\nFill the 50,000 Unfilled jobs at the VA. Disabled Veterans Do Not Want the 2017 Mission Act To Privatize the Healthcare At The VA; It is Mistreating Veterans. Sitting In Waiting Rooms for Hours at Private Clinics and Hospitals is Painful and not what Veterans Want or Deserve. Last Time Trump Was In He Damaged The Health Care of Veterans. Trump Hates Veterans, Trump is A Vietnam War Draft Dodger who is only interested in his wealth And Riches.\nMajor Richards Star Act is a SHAM. Only officers who served in Vietnam were all declared 100% disable due to agent orange exposure. Even Navy officers on ships miles off shore. The VA transferred funds for the disability from the veterans retirement fund. These officers can now qualify for 100% free real estate taxes and other perks.\nThe rest of us who served in areas where the toxic chemical was sprayed get shunned or expelled by the VA hosp.\nI could go on and write a book. I’m OK with the VA treating us like dirt. I’m not OK with the 30-50 vets that commit suicide daily because of the VA.\nWe all know(veterans) that Doug Collins or any individual will not help any veteran or change any VA processes to better accommodate veterans at all. For decades, veterans have been s@&t upon with no changes. Everyone knows that federal workers are only there just to ride the taxpayer funded gravy train, do their time, retire and once again receive the taxpayer funded pension to live out their life very comfortably. All the while, veterans who fought for these people to have the lives that they do, get nothing much in return. It’s been that way forever and will not change, no matter who’s in charge of VA.\nIn 2016, I applied for VA healthcare and was denied based on my salary and the county (California)that I live in. Fast forward two years, I revisited that decision with a VA counselor. I was told by that counselor that I should have automatically been approved because of my time in Persian Gulf and Desert Storm. That’s a very simple example of how unorganized the VA is.\nI do have two claims that I’m waiting for a decision on, upon which I know VA will reject. Because that’s just what the VA does, deny, deny, deny.\nWhy isn’t Tinnitus considered an auto-grant for veterans with clear exposure to harmful noise. Tinnitus is a permanent condition, there is no cure, and severely impacts the lives of thousands of veterans that served this country faithfully. We don’t need more bombs, we don’t need doge, we don’t need controversy, what we need is better care for veterans.\nI agree, my disability claims have been resolved quickly, with the VA App I’ve watched them zoom through all 8 steps. My annual primary care visit was very pleasant, blessed to have a good doctor. I’m proud of the VA.\nI am a Vietnam veteran. I am addressing the facilities at Long Beach CA. This facility is huge. The first problem to address is parking!!! They need to build a large parking structure. The other problem is knowing where to go. It is just a large maze to wander around not only to find parking but also to find where to go and also to find your car.\nI go to Laguna Hills facility and it is in my opinion a great job done!\nThank You,\nCarl Jokinen US Coast Guard 1969-73\nPresident Elon just fired about 1,000 probationary employees just from the VA. That was a ‘media’ story. Are you saying that’s not true? And can’t all the stuff Elon is doing actually your job? Seems to me Elon is the republicans definition of a DEI hire. He’s an immigrant, on the autism spectrum, and 3 of his children have birthright citizenship.\nmr. collins.\nwhat about the 1000 workers that were recently let go that provided vets services? treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. that move certainly backs up your comment about insuring care for vets.\nand allowing the richest man in the world to have access to VA information and suggest possible (dubious) ways to save money?\nmr. collins is an election denier, climate denier, once said democrats love terrorists, and has completely followed and supported trump\non every other major position.\nhere are a few suggestions for cutting government expenses…\nA Government Accountability Office report from 2019 said that four Trump trips to Mar-a-Lago totaled $13.6 million for the travel and security costs. If you do the math, that means Trump’s three trips to Mar-a-Lago in the first month of his second term tallied up to at least $10.2 million. Trump’s Super Bowl trip cost taxpayers at least $1 million just for the air travel and regular Secret Service detail that travels with the president. The field trip to the Daytona 500 event—where he stayed for roughly 90 minutes—likely cost taxpayers at least $373,000.\nThat’s based on the fact that it costs $177,843 per hour to operate Air Force One, according to information the outlet the War Zone obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2022. White House pool reports said the flight times between Daytona and Mar-a-Lago were roughly an hour each, plus the daily cost of $17,520 for the Secret Service detail, per Snopes, and you land at the $373,000 figure.\nIn all, Trump’s travel during his first month in office cost taxpayers at least $11.4 million.\njust sayin’.\nit is apparent to me that mr. collins will do whatever president musk and vp trump tell him to do.\nplease, at least treat vets with some dignity and honesty and tell them what you plan to do so that we have some time to prepare and adjust.\nrichard isom\ndisabled veteran, usaf\nFAKE NEWS from another King Trump MAGA croney and not a trustworthy Republican! Seriously, Mr Doug Collins. You really expect us to believe this?\nThis is a lie! It took 7 years to finally get my disability benefits. Last August 2024 I finally was scheduled my exams which I completed and last month January 2025 I finally received my disability benefits! But three weeks later last Monday February 2025 I get a call to schedule all of the very same medical exams AGAIN only 6 months after I took them and three weeks AFTER I received my final disability adjudication!! Talk about a DOGE violation of waste of taxpayer money! Or the VA is trying to claw back my earned disability benefits as an EOD (bomb disposal) technician! So the VA IS trying to cut veterans benefits and my case, now on its 8th year is an example of Collins doing it! Next email is to my Congresswoman and news so they can monitor my case losing my benefits!\nCollins, you sound like a trump appointed political hack. I’ve already been affected. My medication refill was simply removed or disappeared. Appt scheduling is worse.\nSpeak the truth or don’t speak at all\nMy question is, why does the secretary need DOGE to show him how to be more efficient? Shouldn’t he already have measure’s in place for that?\nSo it’s the media’s fault. They are lying. I wish you would not have said that. That’s nothing but the same lame political propaganda this new administration peddles out there to the public. And right off the bat. I don’t expect problems to be resolved in 2 weeks, that ludicrous. Change must come from a thoughtful, meaningful process. Not politicized nor chaotic. Taking a sledge hammer to it will not work. Firing countless personnel who’ve worked diligently for years is plain stupidity. Now what? Start all over with who? The VA needs to hire more Doctors, period. It takes a long time to be seen and many facilities do not have the people required to care for our Veterans.\nMr. Collins I do agree with you, the media are panicking veterans that a cut in benefits is coming but is the opposite all is DOGE is doing cutting cost on contracts that are being overcharge at the VA, I myself work in the retail business for many years and profits was the number one, the federal government don’t worried about profits and their productivity is the lowest. I myself don’t see anything wrong for some one else outside the system to audit and see where the money is being expend so that more funds go back to veterans. Wish the best. Semper FI\nWhy can’t the VA do electronic billing?\nThere are many many vets that are computer savy and would gladly welcome e billing instead of getting a three page statement and an envelope. Each month. For a bill that they will pay through their bank.\nAll other businesses have e-billing.\nMr. Secretary, Thanks for the confidence that our administration is taking care of our veterans! Good to see such enthusiastic support!\nGood to hear.I worried that Musk would start taking benefits away.benefits we all fought for and our veterans need and deserve\nYou put out this comment after you already know that vets have lost their jobs at agencies all over the board. That includes vets at the suicide hotline. How dare you try to continue to lie directly in our faces.\nAttention VA Secretary Doug Collins\nCared for my nearly 103-year-old proud Navy Veteran Mother for many years and dealing with the VA constantly cutting her benefits was a nightmare! I along with my sister spent years and literally hundreds upon hundreds of hours on the phone with people who were so inept, uncaring and who were being paid to do nothing but refer you to office after office as your rode the VA UN-merry-go-round. At 80 the VA determined she needed 43 hours of care weekly and at 94 cut her to 20 hours-then 5 hours- and we had to fight to try and keep even that. Seven of those years were spent being hired as her caretaker which according to the VA rules had to be done through a VA recommended agency (what a nightmare they are). They came to our home once and never came again or did a single thing after that except force me to fill out reports they sent in to collect thousands and thousands of dollars which should have gone to the rooms my husband (also a Veteran) and I had to build on to our home for her care. Mom is gone now- It took well over a month for the agency who was supposed to be caring for her to realize this Veteran who served her country in Washington during WWII had passed away. My husband and I are still paying the price of neglect by the VA and so are thousands of other families. I think the company that the VA helped steal from my Mother and us should be held accountable to repay the money they stole into and account to care for Veterans. However, realizing the slim chance of that and still caring for our Veterans, as a long-time advocates, I would welcome the chance to talk with Doug Collins! Washington actually contacted us some years ago because we have developed programs, we were told by a government official under President Trump would save taxpayers BILLIONS of dollars annually – and we have had programs ready to be launched! We could have cut government expenditures years ago and turned billions being spent to care for all of our Veterans in excellence as well as providing them with permanent jobs but the swamp does need cleaning. Please encourage Elon Musk to DOGE the VA. I would welcome speaking with him as well. There is so much to be learned from those of us who have been through this first hand! We paid a high price and went through many years of valuable heartbreaking experiences to make life better for our Veterans and will continue to do so even though my husband is in his 80’s and I am in my 70’s. Please help our nation to avoid using inefficient programs and people and ask me how our heroic men and women in uniform (especially those who are now homeless) can be better served.\nSincerely, Naomi E. Rocheleau\nFunny thing to promise after 47 just made an executive order stating you’re not even in charge of your own agency.\nIf this is true why have DOGE and other representatives of the Administration already gone on record stating they have ran comparisons on Veterans who receive disability from VA to FAA licensed commercial Pilots? Shame on targeting those who protected us\nYour lips to Gods ear Mr Collin’s but with cuts for the sake of cut that seem to be the the intent of the new administration I am afraid for all Veterans and active service persons as this administrations first term there was no respect shown for military as we were considered suckers….I appreciate the work you do for us Mr Collins and your dedication to it, Thank you.\nHow about getting rid of DEI hires that are present in our Hospital admins. The care at the Des Moines VA Hospital has gotten worse since new admin people were appointed a few years ago. Why hasn’t the Hospital in Des Moines put up pictures of our new President and VP.\nDirector of Veterans Affairs Administration,\nI live in Houston, Texas. My husband comes to the VA for all his medical needs. I came to the VA with him and notice your photo was not on the walls anywhere in that government building. I notice President Donald Trump photo was not there either.\nThe person in charge needs to take charge and display your photo and the President of the United States on the wall. The workers here at the VA in the Micheal De Bakey building in Houston, Texas needs to step it up and stop being lazy and racist. Their service is terrible.\nI submitted a request to add a dependent (my wife) it’s been eight months. Your help in getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated.\nYour request to add or remove a dependent\nReceived on August 27, 2024\nAs if I believe one thing out of his mouth. His first point was not about veterans, it was about media. Pick on the media first. So, what agenda does that belie? Tell me how that helps veterans.\nI strongly suggest that anyone with problems get in touch with a veterans’ clinic in a law school. That was the route I took when no private lawyer would take the case of my husband. My husband’s case was taken by the clinic at the University of Baltimore School of Law.\nIn a time when we have no draft,the younger generation has no need to serve our country for the benefits that are being eroded away from this administration. We have a very limited force as it is .Those who chose to serve have seen their benefits being taken away one by one. I am a former Marine and a combat veteran of the Viet Nam war. The ones who served before me in the Korean War are also on the chopping block and for what reason? To satisfy the bottom line for some moron Senator who wants to study the rats mating skills? They have for a long time put foolish requests in the budget to satisfy some stupid agenda for their personal request.Taken away from the true needs of our country and the true honest Americans who have relied on their Senators to do the right thing for our country.We called them Ear marks and pork barrel request in the past. And each year they have continued to pop up at the tax payers expense.When are they going to come clean and truly get rid of them? Or get rid of the MORONS that request the stupid things that cost us taxpayers ??\nthanks to The Department of VA affairs and Doge and President Trump! the veterans need our support and the benefits we deserve!\nThanks for the info on what’s going on in the VA\nMr Collins,\nThank you for your video stating the facts. The VA has improved dramatically since I got back from Vietnam in 1970.\nPlease continue to help improve and retain the services we all need.\nSincerely, Don Foye USN\nHello Mr. Collins,\nI’m a Councilman in the City of Campbell, Ohio and I’m also Chair for Veterans Welfare Committee. Would it be possible for you or someone from your office call me at your convenience. Some of the constituents I represent are concerned about their benefits, with the recent changes going, the mix news, media and even this website. I too have questions. But mainly I want shut rumors that are going on, that I know are not true, but feel hearing it from you would make people feel better knowing you talked to me and I can get back to the people I represent and tell them everything is going to be OK. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from soon. My office contact is 351 Tenny avenue, Campbell, OH 44405. 330-755-1663. Or you can email me\nThank you for the update!\nMr. Collins, because you were appointed by trump I can’t believe a word you just said in this video. You claim to support American military vets and praise so-called president trump who sucks up to putin, the communist who wants to fulfill Nikita Khrushchev’s promise to burry our grand children. American vets are going to get screwed over by trump just like everybody else. It saddens and worries me that the head of the VA will help trump do it.\nGreat presentation and thank you for all that you are doing for Veterans. The Administration is living up to promises.\nDoug, I have followed your career as a Congressman and since. I truly appreciate your contributions to our country. I am an 82 year old veteran as well as a Social Security recipient and Medicare patient (parts A, B and D), and I have a request and suggestion.\nWhile there are many good people in the VA Medical Service, getting care can be a nightmare and truly exasperating. Community Care service is obtained only after negotiating a labyrinth of call trees and waiting a long time for a call back. Community Care works great for me, only after I get through the VA part of the process. In addition, I get an annual VA physical as well as an annual Medicare physical exam. This is waste!\nWhy not eliminate the VA and let us get these and all VA services through Community Care by giving me a VA card that could be used just like I use my Medicare Card and my Medicare Parts B and D insurance cards (no going through a grueling VA approval process). It would provide us with the convenience of using nearby providers and eliminate the waste of having two systems, all while saving the taxpayers a lot of funding. Those VA employees who work hard could easily find work in this private sector scenario.\nThanks for listening.\nFAKE NEWS! Don’t let any person (croney) appointed by King Trump and his MAGA presidential cabinet (not republicans) fill your head with false truths. How can I believe anything a MAGA slave to the King says. We all know the PODUS is a lier, cheater, stealer, and most of a CONVICTED FELONIST. I served 20 years in the US military, and these are not the Core Values I was taught to lead our troops. Where is your HONOR, COURAGE, and COMMITMENT to the US military Mr. Doug Collins? You sold your soul to the antichrist – Donald J Trump! And what a very lame non-reasurring video message to post to our Country’s AD and RET military personnel. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it is probably a DUCK!\nI wish they’d just let our president do his work and stop scaring people for no reason. The media is ridiculous! There’s no news reported any longer, just their opinion- and I didn’t ask for their opinion!\nWhy would we believe an appointee of Trump, the one who called veterans losers? Clearly in his revamping of our democracy, those losers don’t deserve any benefits any more than any other group he’s targeted. Although, he needs to keep the military alive and active for 1) ridding our country of all the criminal immigrants and, 2) defending against the coming coup to overthrow of his criminal administration (which cannot come soon enough).\nThis is the winter of our discontent. There is very little trust in the new administration. Defense is being cut and it appears Generals will be fired and replaced. Why would we expect the VA to be any different?\nVA Healthcare is under assault by those who wish to privatize it, i.e., to create another “public subsidy for private profit” system. The privatizers have one concern: maximize wealth and power, and have little to no concern for the health of veterans or the public. VA Healthcare works because the people involved are pursuing actions to help people while in the private sector the goal is to maximize profits.\nI should be able to contract the Secretary directly, I know he does not have time to read my email but he staff should, as a disabled Vet I should voice my concerns about the VA health care to him. The number one thing I have seen is VA employees that know matter how bad they are at their jobs cannot be fired, some of them are even promoted so someone else has to deal with them. thank you\nThank you Doug!! You are serving for all the right reasons!! SEMPER FI!!!\nWell as a daughter and wife of 100% disabled veterans I do hope we clean up the financial waste in this area so we can have more qualified doctors in our local areas so we don’t have to travel to baypines for certain illnesses. Hard to be driving around when you don’t feel well.\nMore concern to the veterans, doctors, and nurses.\nThank you Doug and good luck\nRemember these veterans did not say you have to wait when they were called why are they waiting now!!!\nPositive comment…I would like to volunteer to help Doug..I am a Vietnam Navy veteran, a retired Supply Chain Executive, father and grandfather…..I am serviced connected and in the system..\nThank you\nClean out the democRAT swamp scum. Faster, reliable, timely mail order prescription NO BROKE USPS! Fix website on myehealthyvet or get rid of it. Put Track prescriptions back on website. Re-Allow service from providers other than centrally located VA centers. Wider based, easier understood description and rationale for limits on certain disabilities. Cut the mountains of approval levels, Employ an easier self service application process for older Vet’s with lower computing skills.\nThank you . Your message was short and to the point. The main stream media is lying again. You getting the truth out to us is appreciated.\nPlease continue to share this message, as it may address concerns that some individuals have. Thanks for looking out for us vets. We need to stop the fear mongering-it will be all right, there is waste in any government organization, even in the VA-this disabled vet has had excellent service with the VA-again keep up the splendid work. Sorry for those that are having issues, I say that downsizing the VA will provide better service-it might be hard for some to believe, I have worked with organizations as a consultant in the private sector for 30 years which has proven to me that efficacy through streaming lining and UPGRADING TECHNOLGLY is the ticket-=the VA is no doubt using outdate technology.\nAnd to know those waiting on disability claims, it took six months for my disability claim to be approved, and I received my backpay for this two days sooner than was indicated on the letter so I can vouch that the VA is moving faster at this point in filling claims at least in my case\nWhy should any Veteran believe ANYTHING you SAY or PROMISE? You were appointed by a fairly elected sociopath who cannot be trusted by anyone in this world.\nAs a public servant you should not be criticizing our country’s free and open press whose diligent work has helped millions of Veterans. The press you criticize has always played a crucial role in raising awareness about the needs of veterans, particularly disabled veterans, by publishing stories about their struggles to reintegrate into civilian life, advocating for better government benefits, and highlighting the work of veterans organizations and pressuring policymakers to improve support systems for returning soldiers. Do a little history about the organization you claim to “lead”. This administration knows very little about true leadership, yourself included.\nVSO offices by appointment only with long wait times to get in still in Covid protocol. Administrative law judge hearings months to years waiting to hear cases. Veterans deserve better than this.\nLike a good puppet, you spew the same lies president Musk and his lapdog Donny vomit out of their mouths. When will anyone on the right in politics stand up to this poor excuse of an administration? The entire party is a disgrace with their lies and patronizing veterans.\nWhen Trump was president, the first time veterans had a paper which they could take to a pharmacy if they needed medication when their local clinic was closed and that was terminated under Biden as I tried to use it, and I was told it was no longer valid. It is extremely important to have that benefit because example I got out of the hospital on a Friday and let’s say the VA was closed and I couldn’t get the hospitals prescription written on a VA pad. I would have to wait all weekend until Monday to get antibiotics after coming out of the hospital for pneumonia. Please see what you can do to reinstate this benefit for veterans.\nYou can still use community care providers if your local VA is closed. I just used it this weekend. And the prescription service is still active too. I would call and speak with someone at the VA to receive clear guidance on this. There is a protocol for using the benefit. But that benefit is still available to Veterans. It was not discontinued under Biden.\nWhy comment? No one will pay attention or do a thing. I’m a disabled vet. Somewhere close to 90%. As I recall I was told I would have 100% coverage as a vet when I enlisted in the very early 70’s. I don’t have it and what I do have isn’t nothing to be excited about. Thanks to Republicans the promises made to me are just platitudes and we already went through the Republican version of efficiency once to get here. The VA is underfunded already and this DOGE bullsh-t is just another way of making cuts to the VA to help get tax cuts for the already wealthy. All we as vets are, are photo ops for the Fascist right wing and are expected to put our lives on the line for little to nothing in return because it might inconvenience the already wealthy if we’re treated like we were led to believe. I swore to protect the country against all enemies foreign and domestic and as far as I’m concerned Trump and the rest of the right wing are domestic enemies… Rest assured I’m not the only one to see that…\nDoug Collins already helped cut significant services and staff. I don’t see how we’re spinning it as a good thing. Dude is just another liar.\n60,000 square foot state of the art new facility in Zebulon, Ga. Only one primary care physician with months and months of waiting to get an appointment… help please. Thank-you.\nI should have been 100 % many years ago but have been denied over and over again. I was a combat engineer in an Atomic Demolition Munitions team 12E20 in Germany in 1966. I have had nightmares about setting off a device, killing people and team members ever since. I have PTSD Iand recognize it drove away my wife and daughter. The Army used agent purple in Germany and I have had. Many health issues. But the VA has said they didn’t have it. I have proof now I as a 79 year old reaching a point I may loose my house.\nCongratulations on your appointment. I am a supporter of DOGE. I have many thoughts on how to improve the VA and the Government, to many in fact to include here. So I guess my first recommendation would be to get rid of that ridiculous paper wasting survey and come up with well thought out questions and simplify. Last one I got I started and never finished because 1. the questions were ridiculously long and sometimes immaterial or the multiple choice answers were leading or misleading or didn’t reflect what I wanted to say. Anyway I trust you will do a good job and from what I remember about your background and time in congress you care about people and the county. There’s no doubt this department and the entire government can be better and efficient at the same time. Thank you and good luck.\nGo Secretary Collins\nThis VA leader is a boot licking Trump loyalist who has no business running this organization.\nTrumps only agenda is to sow as much chaos towards his perceived enemies as he can. That is not helpful for this country.\nTo point out the disinformation from Secretary Collins, any funds DOGE “saves” on contracts for veterans services will be used to partially offset the tax cut going mostly the very wealthy, like Musk. it’s not going to go to veterans.\nI agree VA staff has, when ever I needed to speak with them, has provided outstanding service. Although I do not use VA medical ( I have TRICARE for LIFE) I Saw the medical staff in action in Louiseville Ky. A friend needed emergency eye care. The staff stayed until we arrived and then made sure he received the treatment he needed.\nI am a Vietnam vet 1967-70 and I trust Doug and President Trump much more than those woke, inept progressive socialist democrats sucking our taxpayers money with fraud, waste and abuse. Dig in deep Collins and get rid of ineffective employees and bring back the competent and caring profesionals, di it Now.\nI’ve noticed that we have numerous comments by people with TDS or are simply the usual negative political hacks that simply enjoy complaining. Mr. Collins, I know you are a former USAF Colonel Chaplain and a man of God, and I wish you Godspeed as the Head of the VA. You will have a mighty task ahead of you to improve the socialized VA system. I certainly hope you can also streamline the Community Care system as well.\nTake care and God Bless!\nI would like to see my benefits reinstated I was dropped due to making too much income and i’m on SSA.\nI don’t trust Trump or any of the GOP members of Congress ! They have gone in a direction that takes all our fundamental ways of rights and freedoms away from the American people and put them in the hands of a egomaniac called Musk .\nSo the VA needs fewer nursing staff?\nhttps://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nI KNOW we need MORE hospital staff, not less.\n??HOW DID DOUG COLLINS GO FROM A VOICE IN THE RECENT PAST VOUING TO CLOSE ALL VA HOSPITALS??\nMy husband is a Coast Guard veteran. We thank you for this video. The media is into scare tactics. We appreciate the truth.\nMy husband of 26 years of military service was let-go. He only has 3 months to go to complete his non-probationary period. Other probationary folks are still in their jobs in the same agency. The dismissal letter said it has nothing to do with performance. Is this the response to veterans who were honorably discharged? Also, how is DOGE firing people? By draw lots? Kindly answer, Mr. Secretary.\nI’m not interested in “getting rid of things” at the VA, when we all know what you’re getting rid of is nurses. I’m not interested in your efforts to privatize the VA and its services, do not think we are fooled by your rhetoric around waiting times and service availability. Just fund the VA and give us staff for the clinics and hospitals. That’s the promise you made to your Veterans, and that’s the promise you’d better keep, because pissing off a population of Veterans is a bad idea.\nI respect the Secretary, and I believe him when he say’s our benefit’s will not be cut!!\nGood god why would we believe anything this administration says after yesterday when Trump spit on the graves of every service man who ever fought for the ideals that this country USED to represent!?! Trump just threw Ukraine under the bus and sided with a brutal dictator. All of you who support this traitor need to wake up.\nThis is how it starts….getting the vasoline ready…Jack booted thugs coming for you!\nWas the EO allowing VA health records to be sent to any requesting agency rescinded? I noticed this change when I was applying for homebound care benefits. I will not consent to my health records being sent to SS, IRS, and/or any agency that requests them, without notifying me or a having a warrant. Needless to say my application wasn’t accepted.\nThis is what they say right before they cut funding. Every. Single. Time.\nI doubt that . . .\nDisgusting mouthpiece of trump\nDOGE is a farce. Elon Musk and his youth tech hackers have no business in our veterans health care and benefits. That has been an ongoing process the past few years and it’s happening!\nThe VA has come a long way in taking care of us.\nDon’t let an unvetted, illegally appointee crush our vets.\nDOGE might not change our benefits much, but the staff won’t be available to carry out the mission to all of us veterans.\nSir,\nWhat is this I am hearing and reading about VA Disability Payments being reduced in 2026 based on the household income? Why cut what someone has earned?\nYea… They are processing claims Fast, Because they Just Deny Deny Deny !!!\nY’all think people who make decisions are even reading these comments.\nI called both of the Senators in my state and asked if the rumor were true that Veterans Preference was considered the same as DEI, they gave big big promises they would check and get back with me……crickets.\nI understand your fears and anxiety over our situation as veterans.\nBut I just don’t think Mr Collins has the slightest idea of what is written by us here and really doesn’t even care\nThis video is a joke. Let’s blame misinformation on the media not the source. This what we can expect from a secretary appointed by Trump.\nI have been turned down for service connecting disabilities since 2009. WHY BECAUSE VA HAS SAID MY PROBLEMS ARE FROM BEING OLD. I WAS A HAZARDOUS WASTE PERSON IN NAVY FOR YEARS WHILE IN\nI HANDLED SAME STUFF THAT BURN PIT PEOPLE DID. REXCEPT HUMAN WASTE. THIS IS BS. AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS GOVERNMENT AND PAST CAN BURN DOWN.\nWhy is it so hard to get VA benefits for those who served in the mid-60s through the end of the 70s’.\nWell said Mr. Secretary. And Congratulations on your appointment as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRegardless, I truly believe by eliminating positions and most importantly eliminating Vets who work for the VA is not the right approach. A sledge hammer does not replace a scalpel. With a king in office who does not, and will never, respect the Military, all veterans should be cautious and concerned about the cuts to come.\nWe served the country, NOW, the country can serve US!!!\nThen explain to me why my appeal that I opened in October of 2022 is still not heard.? The system is broken and those vetabwho are waiting do not see an end of the road. Just more aggravation\nI believe in improving benefits and other things at the VA for us veterans, we all sacrificed alot to defend our country, freedoms, and the American people, we were promised to be taken care of after our military service, and there have been times when veterans had to fight for their benefit rights, and that should never happen not only did we sacrifice, but also our family members also sacrificed watching there loved deploy when we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, so improve the VA for all us veterans and do not take away from us who sacrificed for our country, as I am still fighting about being exposed to burn pits while on deployment, as well as a Desert Shield/ Storm veteran who was exposed to all that oil well smoke up in Kuwait\nWith Musk and Trump in charge i will take a wait and see .\nMr. Collins I have been fighting a losing uphill battle for almost 35 years. I was OTH Separated from the Army in 1991 as a matter of fact I was Deserted by my command. I still to this day do not understand why not one person has taken an interest and called for an investigation. I have done everything possible and I will never give up on my Innocence. Now that I am service connected disabled what is the VA going to do to help me get this set aside, and exhonrate me fully and bring relief and Justice to me and my Family? The worst part is no Courts seem to have Jurisdiction but they did not mind having me falsely arrested and held without any probable cause or mandatory 48 hr review, and sure as hell never mentioned administrative credit for that time. Why would they right all my due process, substantial, and constitutional rights are still being held hostage as POW’s. I have never in my a adult life been able to have my rights even restored to me what a shame. Maybe yourself and Mr. Trump s should DOGE a after the truth to recover Justice for me. You have the power to grant me Equitable Relief, I requested a such relief from the prior Secretary and even got an email stating give them 7 days to respond that was in N November, I’m s still waiting on that email.\nThank You\ni dont trust a word from any Trump rep — Trump is the biggest liar in the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, don’t let that liar make up new facts\nI am a four-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving proudly its Security Service, from 1970 to 1974.\nI will speak frankly, sir. I don’t trust you. You are a Trumpist. You will follow whatever he says, for his good, not\nfor ours. You have, and will, bend the knee. I will not. I support democracy, liberty, our constitution, and our\ncommitment to our ideals and obligations. I support our allies. I am totally against oligarchs and dictators in the\nworld, and now, sadly, here at home. The oath I took is as meaningful to me today as it was when I took it 55 years ago.\nI SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHAT HE AIS DOING TO CUT WASTE AND TO SUPORT OUR VETERANS WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY SCREAMING FOUL AT THE TOP OF THERE VOICES HE HAS TO BE DOING IT RITE.\nI have lived here in South Carolina for almost 7 years and I can tell you this, the VA has really stepped up to the plate. It started with President Trump during his first term as President, he replaced the secretary because he wasn’t doing his job and it took veterans forever to get care. Ever since then the VA has gotten so much better. The VA is a different place because of President Trump and the people he has put in place. My only hope is that the VA moves forward to keep making health care for veterans even better, please don’t cut services to save money. I am a patriot and I love this country, I fought for this country as my father did before me. Please take care of us.\nGet rid of the DOGE bros. ONLy way to have any credibility. These guys are amateurs.\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThanks Doug, from a fellow Georgian and recipient of Vet benefits.\nI have been waiting 2yrs for an approval to my VA claim that the VA says is not service connected I was injured during field maneuvers in Germany and the injury is documented in my medical records, and I have been trying since 2017 to get the VA to see this injury in my medical records but they say it is not service connected.\nGreat hearing directly from the Secretary. No fake news from him!!\nSaying benefits won’t be cut is not nearly the same as saying disability payments won’t be cut or reduced. Please make another video that states disability payments won’t be cut or reduced.\nVeterans need to listen to the context of this message. It speaks volumes that no one’s comments have been addressed.\nPlease do not cut women’s services anymore than it has been in Florida. I can’t believe that my primary care physician has to be my gynecologist because that dept. was cut from the Jacksonville VA clinic.\nI already had to miss 5 months of mental healthcare because it was canceled for no reason other than I was seeing someone in the community instead of at the VA hospital. Now I have to start all over with someone new that I don’t trust who looks like she just graduated from college.\nIts good to hear from the top. The rumor mill can needlessly cause unnecessary anxiety. Thank you for the information.\nTom Bellows\nMy father was WWII veteran in Army Air Force. He pushed me to sign up with the VA after my enlistment was up and I had no idea the opportunities that became available to me. I served in the US Air Force to protect this nation and did it to the absolute best of my ability. No regrets. Proud now to be a veteran and I meet daily with veterans at the Montrose campus and we built a friendship that is beyond words. The VA is critical for veterans that gave their lives and I for one appreciate immensely all that it has given me personally. Please continue the work that the VA offers and always remember Freedom is not Free.\nAnother Leader in fairy tale land. They already cut 1000 employees. Yes, the ones that help veterans considering suicide. Why is so hard to find a real veteran to lead the Veterans Department? Got rid of judges. Reminds me of the veterans that died before they recognized agent orange did cause cancer. Old Bone Spurs is not our friend!\nthe proof is in the actions and not in his words that are unproven. I remember the former congressman from Georgia before he was placed in this position. He has made several mistruths in the public space in that later position and that was one of public trust as well. So I’m waiting to see if he is a man of his word or just an empty suit for the Doge stooges.\nOk I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who has had a claim for legitimate benefits that has passed the 3 year mark. Seems I got putting on the back burner. Would like to have a determination whether it be approved or denied. Just want to get it over with\nsocial security is not and should never be an item for discussion of cuts. its our money and congress should keep their grubby little hands off of it. Secondly, concerning a veterans disability compensation, should be provided a cost of living raise every year. In fact, we deserve more than what we are receiving now.\nWhat does Musk and his DOGE slash and burn team know or understand what Veterans have experienced or need to heal. Only Veterans understand what other veterans experience and need. You should hold the line and resist this attack on our government and support what we need. We have done what we were asked after volunteering to serve. Do not roll over to dictator in chief and his henchmen.\nConsidering the mount of damage DOGE has been doing to everything it touches, having mainly to do with the fact that Musk and his army of inexperienced interns have no idea what they’re doing, I have very little faith in ANYTHING being said here. Musk is an entitled rich doofus who has no idea the kinds of traumas and disabilities we veterans are dealing with, so he is a TERRIBLE arbitrator of what is and isn’t “fraud.” I’m tired of decisions about our care, and our benefits being made by entitled clowns who have never served a day in their pampered lives, or having some moronic DC talking head telling us that we are somehow leeches because we require assistance after our service. Like I said, I have no faith in DOGE, Musk, Trump, or Secretary Collins, and I do not believe that they will not slash our benefits.\nAre these individuals lawyers? Do they have significant legal experience? Have they been given backgrounds checks? Are they cleared by law enforcement to handle personal information and confidential documents? Is there accountability to those who are going over contracts? Or are we just expected to believe they are working in good faith? Lots of concerns.\nGood morning,\nI am a veteran (US Army)\nI filled out the form for my case since august 28th 2024 and still waiting. In today date february 20th 2025 I haven’t seen anything, more than 6 months.\nI hope they address the issue of the low pay for the VA workers and see that is why so many leave the VA. They need to Pay what the outside pays. I am not a VA Worker I am a Veteran who uses the VA\nHow about we cut-out putting Veterans into dangerous FDA/Pharma guinea-pig…I mean, clinical trials? I was a victim of said program that gave me a brief trip to the other side of the veil. That would the ceasing of Life functions by sketchy, dangerous untested drugs for all you naive types. While that was an experience, I never signed up for it.\nYou want to really help us veterans? Get rid of the WHOLE BODY RATING SYSTEM. Our percentage should be added up as a whole percentage and not reduced because of going over 100%. Make the 100% the maximum. I currently have 40,30,10,10,10= 70%. This is how the country I served for 21 years wants to short change me and every other veteran?\nEat s**t you Trump lackey scumbag. The only one lying here is y’all, not the media. Same old excuse.\nDo you really want us to believe that Trump — or any of his sycophants – have our concerns at heart? In 2018 / 2019 our town was taking up food contributions for the military personnel here because this guy executed the longest shutdown of the U.S. government in history because they wouldn’t fund his wall. This is the guy who dodged the draft by having Daddy get 2 doctors (who both rented apartments from him) to say he had a bone spur – which could have easily been corrected with an operation. this is the guy who had the nerve to call McCain a loser and denigrated the record of the late Republican senator on veterans affairs despite routinely appropriating one of McCain’s crowning achievements as his own. This is the guy who said when declining to go to a ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018: ““Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” This is the guy who called the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. This is the guy who asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades. Just think about how many vets are losing their jobs right now, unable to make monthly payments, because of his executive orders and Co-President Musk’s DOGE cuts. This is the guy who is now posting on social media referring to himself as a king. Do you think he cares about us? You need to wake up and smell the roses – and stop trying to BS us. Like the entire congress, it is time for you to grow a set and stop lying. No job is worth your honor or integrity. JBK\nLet’s Do the VA Math Hustle\nVA disability ratings are based on “remaining ability,” not straightforward arithmetic. Here’s how the system works:\nA veteran is rated 50% disabled for PTSD, meaning he has 50% remaining ability. He also has Tinnitus, caused by severe hearing loss (HL) from exposure to helicopter rotors or jet engines. The VA rates the Tinnitus at 10% disabling but assigns 0% to HL, meaning it is acknowledged but not compensated.\nNow, does 50% + 10% = 60%? No.\nThe VA applies the 10% Tinnitus rating to the 50% remaining ability:\n10% of 50% = 5%. The VA rounds up, so he gets 10%, bringing him to 60% total disability.\nNow his HL worsens, and after a new audiology exam, the VA raises his HL rating to 10%. However, 10% of his remaining 40% ability = 4%, which the VA rounds down to 0%. His total rating remains at 60%—no increase despite documented worsening.\nThe PACT Act expands benefits for veterans exposed to toxins, including asbestos. The veteran has service-related asbestos exposure and is rated 10% disabled for it. Does this raise his total rating? No. The same VA math applies:\n10% of his remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He stays at 60%.\nYears later, anemia surfaces in his records, linked to asbestos, jet fuel, or firefighting foam. The VA acknowledges the nexus and grants another 10%. Again, 10% of the remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He still remains at 60%, despite multiple service-connected conditions.\nThe Real Cost of VA Math\nIf the VA used basic addition, his disabilities (50% PTSD + 10% Tinnitus + 10% HL + 10% asbestos exposure + 10% anemia) would add up to 100%, qualifying him for **$3,831.30 per month** in 2025. Instead, due to VA math, he remains at **60%, receiving only $1,395.93 per month**—less than half of what he should receive.\nEven worse, because the VA only compensates from the **date of claim**, this veteran loses decades of retroactive benefits for service-connected conditions that trace back to Desert Storm or Vietnam.\nThis is not a minor technicality. It is an institutionalized method of **Denying, Delaying, and Defending** against rightful compensation.\nEnough talk and start showing by doing what word came out of your mouth. I supposed when the PACT Act came out nothing really happened considering we have been suffering after Post 911 conditions. And with all the conditions I reported I only got 80% when it is suppose to be 100%.\nAs for education and training, there is much more to improved with helping Veterans domestically and internationally to allow Veterans to get full access if their education benefits unconditionally. Having credentials from higher institutions are not enough to get jobs that Veterans desire to do as their calling to find their new purpose in life. Do more and do better!!!\nRight off the bat we have a highly politicized attack on the press? This augurs badly. The LAST thing VA should be is partisan and trying to create a narrative to control perceptions.\nI’m a VA patient. Twenty years ago VA health care was really second rate and, so I avoided it at my expense. Over the last few years there has been obvious and substantial improvement. VA brought in much more competent primary care, expanded the quality and availability of specialty care and improved facilities. The most important thing was VA’s effort to recruit people, to upgrade staff. These people can make more money in the private sector but they choose to serve us because VA employment was more secure, more compatible with their family life, LESS bureaucratic than private insurers and because they have a more grateful base of patients at VA. Immediately upon jackass Musk’s shock and awe campaign a big chill went through, pending offers didn’t go out, applicants had second thoughts. The immediate damage will take time and effort to repair because confidence is important and the new administration has shattered confidence and trust.\nAnd what are you doing? What’s your first contact with us veterans? You are sending out political messages to attack the Press? If that’s what you think then volunteer to go on TV or give interviews to the Times and confront the press directly and see what they say in return.\nEven more chilling you want my name and e-mail. Anyone who’s been following events recognizes a vindictive streak in the new administration, I’m frankly concerned for my benefits because you seem to be “making a list”, here. But, damn it I’ve already seen a terrible change in morale and recruitment so I’ll take my chances.\nCan you help my husband a 30 yr vet ? He is trying to contact the Navy retirement office the other day they had him on hold for 3 hours then disconnected the call we can not get any help any where thank you for your service\nI’ve had a claim in since 1970 so I hope he doesn’t wait until I’m dead so that it goes away. Since I don’t know the claim number I know I can put my service number because that is public knowledge so here it is. The public is able to access this number and only access the number they can’t go any further but he can so you don’t have to delete this number. Thank you and have a wonderful day and may God bless.\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your sensitive personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nApparently, Mr. Collins has not read Project 2025, nor is he aware that the VA OIG has been illegally fired. The VHPI”s take on the impact that the implementation of Project 2025 ‘policy’s’ is here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=project+2025\nWhat this adminIstration SAYS and what it DOES, will likely be different. DOGE may have already gained access to the VA computers. If their previous actions are an indication of their present actions, your privacy may have been compromised. DOGE was NOT supposed to gain access to CLASSIFIED data, yet managed to post it on its UNSECURED website.\nTRUST AND RESPECT IS EARNED, trust and respect can be burned with LIES. Veterans have a long history of DISTRUST of the VA for decades. The reason being – WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO, been disrespected, given the run around, delays, being treated as LESS THAN. Each new administration brings issues and policy changes. But WE ARE PEOPLE, not numbers, groups, things, actual living people who served our country with HONOR. When the time comes for our needs to be met, we cannot be assured of consistency of care. DOGE shows up and employees are told to go home, you’re fired. Did suicide hotline calls go unanswered?\nH.R. 5697 ACCESS ACT is described here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=ACCESS+ACT\nMr. Collins, your office sent me an email announcing your new position. I wrote back that I did not have faith in this administration to provide quality care/service. Nothing that you have said has changed my mind. I doubt that you will ever bother to read these comments posted by the very people that your department is meant TO SERVE. LIES HAVE CONSEQUENCES, FACTS STILL MATTER. Viet Nam Veterans said after they returned “NEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN” They made it a point to ensure that Veterans were NEVER treated with disrespect, they way they were treated when they returned home. My family has had US military service members in every generation as far back as the Civil War. Generations of Veterans have experience with the government . This administration does not respect the military, nor Veterans. The man has profound issues with his own interests outweighing those of the country. I am not alone in reserving a wait and see attitude, as we have seen this clownish sh*t show rodeo before. When our government asked us to step up, WE DID, we demand that our government STEP UP FOR US, as we fulfilled our obligations completely. ALL GAVE SOME, SOME GAVE ALL. Our dues are paid in full, we expect to receive what was promised to us, when we raised our hands and swore under oath, to protect and serve the constitution, from ALL ENEMIES – FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.\nTHE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION WAS NOT WRITTEN TO PROTECT CRIMINALS, IT WAS WRITTEN TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT FROM BECOMING CRIMINALS – Lenny Bruce, Veteran\nWell Doug you’ve got the easy part done now let’s see results.\nWhat about having to close all radiology at the Pueblo Colorado VA because everyone that could run the equipment were fired by Musk/Trump. Now thinking of sending people from other VA clinics for a few days a week to try to keep Pueblo open but cause shortages at other Colorado clinics/hospitals.\nI don’t believe a word he is saying. Muskrat and Project 2025 leader and head of OBM, have already said they want to cut disability payments once we enter retirement age.\nWhy can’t people see that this administration says what they think people want to hear. Then do what they want. All you have to do is watch and listen to them.\nCollins, from my home state, is as crooked as the day is long . He will do whatever Trump and muskrat tell him to do.\nI wish more folks would take a little time to just read Project 2025. It details Everything that this administration is doing. Even though Trump lied to voters by saying he knew nothing about it. Yea right. Tried to tell folks that he was lying.\nShameful.\nThey have sent Tens of Thousands of people to the unemployment line. Tariffs are causing prices to skyrocket. Every govt. agency is being led by appointees that have No Clue what they are doing. And they have already Fired Thousands of employees at the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and Healthcare. At a time the Dept. is vastly undermanned.\n” Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it”!! And MAGA is getting just what they should have seen we would\nget. And what sux is, the rest of us will suffer for their uneducated voting practices.\nHope to God out Nation survives this Blatant move to Hitlers Fascism\nFIX Community Care. It sucks. Takes too long to set up and approve provider request.\nPlease consider increases to the spouse’s survivor benefits. It is impossible to make ends meet on the current amount. I’m so worried how I will survive if my husband passes before me. He has been 100 percent disabled for over 10 years and has suffered from his disability since 1971.\nHope your article is correct I have been waiting for a higher level review for 4 months, that’s just ridiculous. Been waiting on my C file just as long.\nThanks for the information. Sadly the media has lost all credibility with me. The one thing I cannot tolerate is a liar. As a former Sailor, liars can get you killed or seriously injured. These past 4 years the democrats and media has proven to me that they are liars. Once that bridge has been crossed with me, I will never trust that person or entity again. Never! Once a liar, always a liar.\nTrump lies every time he opens his mouth. How can we trust his “gofers”? As a disabled Navy\nVietnam vet (86 years old) I am scared I will lose my care giver, my VA meds , VA DR and housing.\nSay, could you be any further up T-Rumps behind? Sorry, I wish I could believe you but you basically addressed nothing in this video. It might as well been Donald himself rambling on saying nothing.\nPardon my skepticism, but quite frankly I have heard that all before, and to be completely honest our current (sic) commander-in-chief does not have a sterling reputation when it comes to honesty so I take everything he says with a large grain of salt. Nor, for that matter, do I place any trust in his chief minion, Elon Musk, who also has a track record for flights of hyperbolic fantasy when it comes to stating facts or telling the truth. As the old saw goes “The proof is in the pudding” and the veterans of this country will be watching closely and holding accountable this administration for honoring “The unwritten contract” that was implicitly guaranteed when we raised our right hands and swore an Oath that stated “ I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” It’s been 55 years since I swore that Oath, and I believe in it as strongly today as I did then and I believe that the overwhelming majority of our military, past and present, feel exactly the same way.\nI amma full timem teacer with 70% V Disabiity. How will then Fairess Act effect my benefits?\n“Hey y’all…it’s me again” … Great, a week on the job and already a total lack of professional bearing. Please spare me the Jerry Falwell bumpkin buddy chat…you are leading a massively important agency. Don’t try to sell me on what’s great for the VA and our current political administration is better than what’s right for the Veteran. The American tax payer understands with the utmost respect that these benefits are the price paid in keeping our enemies out of their backyards, continuing to give their children and grandchildren the freedom of choice and expression, and the ability to sleep soundly each night knowing we have/had the watch. God help you if you are knowingly being deceitful.\nYou are attacking the media for reporting what may happen? Isn’t it their job to keep us informed. So far it seems that our government is following the Project 2025 playbook fairly closely, and that does not bode well for veterans, or anyone who relies on their government to provide services.\nDear Sec Collins,\nI live in Jakarta, Indonesia, and I fall under your VA’s Foreign Medical Program (FMP) and I am APPALLED with the poor service that office has been providing.\nFor over a year, FMP has been delaying payment of over $50,000 that they own me and have not disputed, but because they cannot or will not move from paying by checks to paying by Electronic Transfer they are delaying the money they owe me to PREPAY the next phase of treatment, approved and authorized under the PACT ACT.\nI have even sent FMP the forms being used by the IRS, Social Security, and even some VA offices to switch from payment by check to payment by ETF.\nI have been working with my state Senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan and state Representative from New Jersey, Ms. Mikie Sherril and they have made no discernible progress in addressing a major problem that should only take days to correct.\nThank you for looking into this and if you provide me with a name and email address, I will attach the documents I have been providing to the FMP and VA.gov for over a year now with no success.\nThank you!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nI am a 78 year-old Vietnam vet (1st Cav Div) in-country 1968 to 1969 at Khe San and Phuoc Vinh. Honorable discharge and returned home in Aug 1969. I immediately went to the Winston-Salem,NC VA office and filed for disability due to Agent Orange (peripheral nephropathy), PTSD, Sleep Apnea, hypertension and a knee injured at Ft Bragg the medical staff recommended medical operation for torn ligaments in March 1968. I was given orders to Viet Nam for reporting in August 1969. After discharge in August 1969, returned home, with peripheral nephropathy (Agent Orange), Sleep Apnea (nightly rocket attacks at roughly 1:00 AM EVERY NIGHT and unable to go to sleep until the all-clear siren blew about 3:00 AM and having to wake every morning at roughly 6:AM every morning; PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome); Hypertension (high blood pressure); being in I-Corps originally, roughly every other day for 6 months, you could count on a Agent Orange “shower” because we were in the tri-border area of Viet Nam, Laos and North Viet Nam.\nUpon my return to the States, I immediately went to the Winston-Salem, NC office to file for my education and disability benefits. I was given a paper claim card, which I still have, and given education benefits for school. My subsequent claim(s) was adjudicated that I did not have a claim because: (1) The lost my records because of a fire and the VA office; (2) there was no records that supported my claim regardless of the fact my DD-214 showed I was in Viet Nam and given a Bronze Star; (3) they had no record of my filing a claim and/or, I had not been stationed in Viet Nam; (4) All items claimed for disability were diagnosed by VA doctors on multiple occasions, yet the copies of records were in my records and the examiners told me that my DD-214 was invalid because it “appeared” to be invalid and I could not prove that I was ever in Viet Nam.\nI finally got approval for 30% disability, regardless of the fact that every visit to the VA hospital was met with the “stick test” that clearly showed that I had peripheral nephropathy; was given a sleep test for sleep apnea and given a machine for breathing help, and other medications for the items that are indicative of problems the VA found with those who were in-country and related to Agent Orange.\nI have been referred to outside consultants for Sleep Apnea, Peripheral Nephropathy, High Blood Pressure, given a cane for my knee. With these and other items found by VA doctors, I have been prescribed 17 different medications for the items diagnosed by the VA, yet, I was only given small compensation starting in 2011.\nI have more than 400 pages of medical records from the VA, which have been forwarded to the VA Records Collection in Janesville, WI. A recent inquiry concerning my records by the Dr working with my PTSD showed there were 2034 records in my file. The following week, I called Janesville and asked them about the disparity in the number of records, I was told they only have 434 VA medical records. The problem with the scenario is the record count is never consistent. I have only used the VA doctors for my military medical diagnosis, yet, there are occasions when their record count is zero.\nWhen asked about my claim, I was told they have made progress on my claim and the representative told me that I have a large amount of money due to their increasing my claim percentage with the implication being “I would need a large bank account” to hold the back pay I would get. To date, only my percentage has been increased effective December 1, 2024.\nIt is a constant fight to get this situation resolved, as in my case, 55 years with 4 conditions that is on the VA ‘s list of compensation is nothing more than an empty promise.\nI have tried the legislative approach, using my State and Federal House Members and Senators, to no avail.\nI haven’t seen anything in the media about benefit cuts, Sec Collins. Or is attacking the media part of your new job? What has been accurately reported is that 1,000 VA employees have been terminated – about which you say nothing.\nWhy do you trust DOGE to make wise decisions on VA contracts? They are led by a mad-man named Musk who is trying to reach reduction quotas for Trump’s tax cuts. I’m concerned – and you should be also. Or are you afraid to lose your job if you encourage caution?\nYour words are full of lies. I do not believe for one second you have veterans well being at stake. I’ve been lied to so many times by the VA and I’m supposed to take your word. Your word means nothing to me. Deceit and lies make up the VA and I have proof. You deny veterans benefits at a rate that is unacceptable. The VA denied my benefits for 11 years in hopes I would die. When I’m looking at my military health records stating I was injured while jumping outta planes for the 82nd Airborne and the VA was trying to convince me it never happened. When ask after 10 if I would like the VA to make the final determination or a judge I choose the judge. Exactly one month before seeing the judge the VA called me and said they would make an immediate decision within a day if I let them. My answer was no!!! I seen the judge one month later and it took the judge 13 minutes before deciding in my favor at 100% disabled. You act surprised when we have 23 veterans per day committing suicide. What do you think is happening? They lose all hope in providing their families with food and shelter. So I firmly believe half would not be committing suicide if given what was promised to them when signing the contract when entering the military. The VA administration is lying to all the veterans and denying them their benefits for as long as they can. You know this is true. Don’t sit behind your desk adding more lies.\nMr. Secretary,\nPres. Trump’s last term included an attempt to reduce social security benefits on a dollar per dollar basis for veterans IU. This is fact. DOGE is firing people with an hour notice of job loss. How can I be sure my Social Security and VA Disability will not be lost on less than an hour notice? Is there a public presidential promise? VA i s losing its employees by DOGE analysis, are VA employees going to face minimum employment loss notification or at least, a 2-week notice? I need to know the facts with proof, not possible hearsay by you or the ??? news. Please help us believe with proof, that our benefits for disability and social security will not be lost, like a public presidential promise on the news. I already illegally lost my military career on a on a Chap 61 by contractors, after serving 19 yrs, 4 mos, and 26 days and now I am not eligible for CRDP. CRDP requires 20 yrs of service. We need to know that our healthcare will not return to months long appointments like during the president’s last term. Please, we need the proof or what you say remains haunting. I cannot afford a loss of social security on a dollar for dollar basis. The President has demonstrated his disrespect for veterans the last term, publicly against Sen McCain for being an injured POW, from my state.\nPlease don’t permit retribution to our VA benefits for making a complaint.\nPlease read and reply to all the veteran statements sent to your office. Lack of responding will lead to a lack faith in you. Don’t let the news prove you wrong, present the verifiable facts.\nThank you for your service to OUR country.\nDLHJ\nSFC, USA (forced retired illegally)\nFeb 19, 2025\nThis is the “Thank you for you service” from Pearl Harbor Naval Base…..I booked and received confirmation at the Navy Lodge in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. My wife was with me on this trip of 4 days.\nMy flt arrived Honolulu at 7pm. We drove to the base so I can check-in at the lodge. The main gate sentry told me that my wife cannot enter without a pass and the pass office is already close. He told me I can access the base with my VHIC card due service connected imprinted on my card . I turned around and drove out to book a hotel downtown for one night. Next day I drove to the pass office and got a pass for my wife only to find out that it is only a one day pass for her and that I have\ngo back to the pass office every morning to renew her one day pass during our stay at the lodge. Talk with you counterpart Mr. Hegseth to see if wounded veterans/service connected veterans be treated with some kind of dignity and respect. Hell, Guam Naval Station excluded base access veterans from their Trusted Traveler Program.\nSecretary Collin’s, Thank you so much for clearing up the issue regarding benefits.. I am a 78 year old Vietnam Marine veteran who is suffering from prostate cancer due to my agent Orange exposure. I am hoping you can help me with a question I have. I submitted the information to the V A regarding some benefit issues.\nYou will always be in my prayers for the time I have left and I am hoping God will keep you safe and guide you in your decision making to help our country and our veterans. Thank you for reading this.\nThank you, Sir for prioritizing our Vets. It appears as though this page thread is being spammed by a lot of activists. God bless Trump and the U.S.A.\nHave you lost your ever-loving MINDS? They/We/Us put a EFFing TRAITOR in the White House as a MAKE-Shift POTUS. Once Trump and Elon figure out that the Military “WILL NOT” Shoot/Murder Brown Americans. Then you can KISS YOUR VA “BENEFITS” GOODBYE, via DOGE. World War II was never even close to the current THREAT that these Domestic Enemies BURNING this country down to the ground as WE WATCH. I spent over two decades serving the US Military and America. To watch a LIFE-LONG CON MAN destroy America before our own eyes. I am ASHAMED. Trump already “KILLED” three quarters of a million Americans by his INEPT INCOMPETENT COVID Response. That’s just a drop in the bucket for what will and is DESTROYING the CURRENT FECKLESS USA. – FOFO\nAnd DC, (something tells me ok to be up n friendly with you, Doug) I took a head Hit plate in skull etc. and helping at our VFW when able to AND just glad previous vets administration is Done (no comment – that was then, this is now)! Just many congratulations and anytime you are in SE Asia let’s have coffee together with ret.msgt Janet Cmndr. Luv it. Be safe my friend.\nDOGE is already cutting jobs at the VA. I feel I am being lied to by you. DOGE is cutting jobs and benefits to people all across the government. The GOP is going along with DOGE and is doing so in order to come up with money to give people like Elon Musk huge tax cuts. I do not like being lied to. I served my country in the war in Vietnam. I was an enlisted serviceman. Please do not give me a story about caring for the veteran when you are a part of Donald Trump’s ongoing effort to tear our government apart and run it like he is a mob boss. I am sick and tired of what is going on and will work with my Congressman and Senator to put a stop to this. How dare you put out a message like this and lie to the veterans.\nThank you so much for the update Sir.\nNice. Collins is a good man\nFirst – CONGRATULATIONS Truly. And thank YOU for sharing the Truth of Our Veterans Administration svc. as this cabal or d.s.enemy, “Fake News” as Pres Trump politely calls it… Trump’s America calls it ” The LIARs’ Media Lies-Guys who spread gossips harming Our soldiers AND their families… Just thank YOU very VERY much. Luv your initials: D. C., I forward “Our New Veterans Administration Boss, D. C. Doug Collins is guiding D. C. Washington to MAGA & HE Will. Just wait n see! “\nsickening – a south African born inherent racist proudly throwing N- salutes is digging though our VA system. My great Uncle, and WWII combat veteran, rest in peace, fought the fascist and N-s in Italy. He was captured and held prisoner til the end of the war. And here we are and republicans aren’t concerned about a ‘sieg heiling’ billionaire trying to defund our government agencies so he can loot a tax break for himself. I will NOT forget what my great uncle fought for and against –\nI don’t trust anything that the President says and I now don’t have any confidence in Collins. Let’s see some action, not words/\nCollins has a track record of being a Trump yes man. So it was disappointing, but not surprising, that he gets slotted to head the VA. Sadly, as we all know, Trump is a fake military man that steals valor from real Americans in order to project power. He would never put his life at risk for the betterment of the rest. The concept of service bewilders him, but not in a respectable way. Oh, no. Service and its accompanying risks are the plight of suckers. The military is nothing more than a bag of idiot toys to to do his bidding. This is what he had to say about fellow Republican John McCain and his military service that included 5.5 years in the Hanoi Hilton “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, okay? I hate to tell you.”\nBack to Collins, lack of qualifications aside, I was and could still be willing to give a fellow veteran a chance. He has been talking a big game about sticking up for us. But this video appears disingenuous and contrived. We are not stupid. That Collins is welcoming Big Balls and his band of tech kiddies to access our private information because it is all part of Trump’s puppet master’s plan to harvest every piece of data the administration is stupid enough to give them, tells me Collins is trending more toward lap dog than VA guard dog. Once the VA has been dismantled, funding won’t matter.\nAlso, DEI? Are you kidding? Our military and the VA are built on the backs of minorities. And the military is very good at producing disabled people, so it would seem fitting that the VA would be open to employing some vocational rehab or rehabbed folks. And give us a break on the LGBQ nonsense. I’m still waiting to hear of a legitimate instance where a service member’s or VA employee’s LGBQ status, on its own, impacted their ability to serve. Let’s try to focus on the real issues the VA faces that are obviously hindering its mission to provide veterans with the care and services they deserve and please stop wasting time fighting some made up war on wokism.\nAnother Trump shill making excuses for the cuts that have already happened. Notice the gaslighting in the phrase “media concerns”. No, they are our concerns. Trump is on record being anti-vet and anti social safety net. Musk is gutting everything to enrich himself. None of the 20 year old kids in DOGE are auditors. It’s only a matter of time.\nTime will tell if this actually means all veterans or just the straight white male types.\nHow can we be 100% sure? There is so many lies coming out of the current administration from an aircraft accident was caused by DEI to the the president of Ukraine started the war with Russia when the entire world saw the Russianv build up at the boarder and heard Russia say there were there just for an exercise, to the amount of deaths in the war and the amount of money that they have supposedly found that was fraud, to the administration cutting budget money that has been allocated any by law has to be sent for that allocation. I hope you are corrent in what you are saying, but please excuse me if I have a hard time believing anything this administration says.\nI find it extremely difficult to believe that anyone downstream of Trump is actually competent to do the job they are tasked with. Why, Trump has made it quite CLEAR he demands loyalty to himself above all others and their tasks. He has made it clear vets have little value to him through his many actions and quotes. Let’s see: demeaning Gold Star families, calling war dead “suckers and losers”, being a draft dodger himself etc. No one in his entire family has ever served either. Now we see first hand that VA systems are LOSING staff when most of the facilities are already understaffed. So how does this work to improve the VA serviced to the veteran community, of which I am a member? Sec Collin’s, I have No trust or confidence when it comes to Trumps action or word. He has proven his word means little. So, from that alone, i do not see good things in store for the current VA system. Not improvements, better budget perhaps, no I see the goal of privatization in the future. For the benefit of his wealthy handlers.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, Spineless Sycophant\nI am so so pleased that Doug Collins is in charge of the VA now. I am hopeful that things will be run more efficiently to the benefit of the veterans it cares for. Is there a way to get a letter to Secretary Collins through regular mail?\nPlease add a Bluesky link for ‘Share this story.’ Thank you.\nThis guy doesn’t realize what a fool he looks like, waving his arms, flapping his gums and using the pathetic fall-back “media’s doing it” BS. Please talk to Veterans like a human, not a tool. Do you think we’re children? “Don’t worry, nobody’s taking away your benefits!” You moron! When you make it so there’s not enough workers to handle the workload of helping Veterans get their promised health care, that’s denying Veterans their benefits. When a Veteran spends the better part of their days trying to make contact with the VA health system for an appointment that’s a denial of benefits. If enough of us Veterans simply give up trying to access benefits, that’s fewer Veterans to have to spend money on. I know I’m not expressing it well, but I won’t be around too much longer so the trillionaires can keep whatever extra pennies they would have had to pay out for whatever medical care I’d be needing.\nU lying for musk and his VP trump\nSecretary Collins, I want to draw your attention to the incredible VAMC, Boston, MA staff. I have never experienced such professional excellence, administrative genius, and remarkable decency as I have at this location. Best regards, J.L. Ross, MD [retired, US Navy]\nWAS HOPING FOR GOOD CHANGES FOR THE FUTURE OF THE VA FROM HEARING ABOUT YOUR CONFIMATION. I VISIT THE VA HERE IN OKLAHOMA. WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED PHONE SYSTEM FOR THEM HERE AND IT TAKES US TO AN OPERATOR AND THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR, THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. FINALLY GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY SENT YOU TO THE WRONG DEPARTMENT. BEFORE 2024, I COULD CALL THE CLINIC AND TALK TO A HUMAN. IF YOU HAD TO RUN YOUR OFFICE WITH A PHONE SYSTEM LIKE THIS, THAT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IN A HEARTBEAT! TAKE ABOUT 6 WEEKS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. THEN XRAYS , THEN MRI ANOTHER 6 WEEKS, THEN YOUR PRIMARY IS GONE AND REPLACED WITH A PA. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU FIXING SIR. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR MISSION STATEMENT FOR THE VA, BECAUSE NONE OF THE POSTED ARE ADHERED TO. THANK YOU\nSorry I don’t find this all that believable. We shall see I suppose who is telling the truth and what is hypothetical. I don’t see the President having much respect for veterans or for military service but that is only my opinion based on his past comments and actions. DOGE is a new government bureuocracy already given too much power and too little oversight. I think as veterans receiving VA benefits we have a right to be concerned about the intentions of this new administration.\nI am losing faith in the country that I served proudly. Actually, not faith in the country, but any faith or respect for it’s current leadership. I cannot understand how our Senators and Representatives, who in theory work for us, can stand by and watch this country become smaller and less of a source for powerful good on this planet. They now stand by and watch an administration rape and pillage the good will we had in the world. They watch as the adminstration disrespects the countries that have had our back, and show favor to those who mean us harm. At the same time these “lawmakers” allow disrespectful (dare I say illegal) access to the institutions of government and those that serve there. Should there be changes, and is there problems, you bet. But using a sledge hammer is sure as hell not the proper way for sensible people to address these issues. Way to indescrimate. It will be interesting when the sledge hammer hits the VA. I pray we as veterans survive this senseless and brainless rampage. Think “Kristallnacht”.\nI don’t believe this is true DOGE is gutting every agency why not VA and there is no evidence that what they are saying is true. I believe we Vets are about to get screwed again.\nThis sounds like a political propaganda video. There are cuts being made and many veterans that work for the VA have lost their jobs. How does this help ALL of our veterans. I am thankful for being a veteran and for everything the VA has done for me but when someone has to create a video praising our first felon President and a new program (DOGE) that was created by this corrupt President gives me pause.\nThank you, Secretary Collins.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) improperly awarded $10.8 million in bonuses to senior executives using funds from the PACT Act. The money was intended to retain employees in understaffed positions.\nExplanation\nThe PACT Act expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to environmental toxins.\nThe VA Secretary could award up to 25% of an employee’s basic pay as a Critical Skills Incentive (CSI).\nThe VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the money was given to senior executives in the VA Central Office in Washington, DC.\nThe OIG report found that seven executives in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) received bonuses of more than $100,000.\nI will have my lawyer contact you since I still have cases pending.\nI am not a firm believer in the lies the politicians, news media, and just anybody speaking is saying. I depend on this money to survive, and I am concerned about what a nonelected official does with my income and the nation’s money.\nMy lawyer info:\nTravis Neidig\nI actually copied this from a previous comment to save me time, as I am a 100% disabled veteran who served in Desert Storm, Desert Shield, and left the military at the end of Operation Enduring Freedom. I retired from the Government job I had about 2.5 years ago, because I just could not function anymore due to the amount of pain and discomfort, plus my double vision in one eye/eye sight loss from a head trauma while on active duty. I need to know as like it is stated below, as I have sent messages to my Senators, and I get back a typical Republican statement that does not answer my question. I need to make sure my disability payments will not be in jeopardy, period. My wife is disabled from a stoke and I need to care for her. If my disability pay gets cut I will have to sell everything I own, as I have a house payment, bills, and her medical as well. I have been following what this administration is doing and I for one am worried as my pension from the government is small. You said there will no cuts the Veterans Benefits? I need some reassurance on this.\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nHey, Doug, what a bunch of bullsh-t. You work for President Musk and vice-president Donald Trump. They are nothing but bullsh-tters. How can you guys fire thousands of VA professional workers and expect things to improve for us veterans? Trump is a five-time draft dodger. He never served in the military. Neither did President Musk. They don’t give a sh-t about veterans; they only care about themselves and their billionaire friends. You have to do what the -ssholes tell you to do. How do you expect veterans to believe or trust you? Two of my VA medical appointments were recently canceled and rescheduled farther out. My primary care doctor is booked up close to the end of 2025; actually, I can’t even get an appointment with him. My doctor appointments are now being scheduled with nurses. I don’t care to hear your bullsh-t, which is just parroting what your bosses tell you to say. I’ll believe you when you can stand up to Musk and Trump, bring back the fired professionals, and make actual improvements at the VA for veterans and VA employees. Oh, and tell Musk and Trump to take their DOGe bullsh-t and stick it up their -sses.\nIf you feel like it is time to do something about your disability rating send me a message. Don’t put it off any longer.\nUS Army Retired PA and former compensation and pension examiner\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed. It has come to my attention that these employees, who have undergone a rigorous and lengthy vetting process, are at risk of being reduced due to financial decisions influenced by external factors, such as the actions taken by Elon Musk and his involvement with DOGE.\nWhile it has been assured that monetary benefits for veterans will not be affected, the quality of care we receive is undeniably compromised when there are insufficient staff to meet our needs. The dedicated federal employees at our VA facilities are crucial to maintaining the standard of care that veterans rightfully deserve. Reducing their numbers would significantly strain the remaining staff, ultimately affecting the well-being of the veterans they serve.\nI urge you to reconsider any actions that would lead to further staff reductions and to prioritize the needs of veterans by ensuring that our VA facilities are adequately staffed and resourced.\nYou lie. You are posting a pro Trump video. Doge doesn’t need my info. My disability is minimal. I deserve more.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed.

Tell me Veterans, do you feel supported?\nHe supported the decision to FIRE 1,000 VA employees\nMr Sectary\nI filled out the form and the computer says I already made the comment and things still haven’t changed in the last eight years.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non-citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. You can’t even go in to drop off paperwork without an appointment. The guard at the doors won’t even allow you in to talk to someong to make an appointment. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007. Was put on these lifetime drugs. When I moved to my new location because of marriage I was told by the VA station I couldn’t get my heart medicines because they weren’t service related. There is tons of missing benefits here and we are treated like animals.\nArthur Christopher Tanny\nSecretary Collins,\nFirst and foremost, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT.\nSecondly, I started reading through the previous comments and personally I was shocked at the vitriol and downright hate (SCREAMED) at you and you just walked in the door. I am sure you will have everything straight by next week.\nAs some of the posters noted, their distrust of the VA and all of the red tape is warranted, taken sometimes years to get anywhere. Personally, I am a proud Vietnam Vet 68-69 and I didn’t approach the VA because I felt there were many more Vets that needed the services more than I did so I stayed silent. However, fast forward to 2021- I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer and CLL-Leukemia at the same time. I reached out to the VA to see if I could get added to Community Care with my outside Oncologist to be able to get my medication through the VA Pharmacy. On the outside this medication is $3,000 a month but through the VA it was $11.00 so you can see why I worked through the process and was successful. Fast Forward once again to 2023 my VA Oncologist asked me why I wasn’t submitting paperwork for the Pact Act benefit which listed CLL Leukemia as being associated with Agent Orange. I applied and after back and forth paperwork over months and months I received my 100% disability, for which I am eternally grateful.\nThank you for what you are doing and good luck as you dig through reams and reams of backdated paperwork. I’m sure you will be finished by next week.\nFrom a fellow Georgian\nI agree with our secretary in TOTAL. DOGE will make the necessary cuts anywhere possible and most needed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of our tax dollars.\nSo how does his speech line up with Elmo firing a thousand probationary employees of the VA?\nYou Trumpers really know how to lie with a straight face, don’t you?\nThe VA budget is being cut and VP Trump via Project 2025 seeks to minimize veterans benefits. That covers healthcare, disability, staff, hell, you’ll probably go after pensions next. Your sick Prez Musk is in your computers right now removing people and projects and cases and accessing our personal and financial information illegally. You’re Trump’s sycophant. You and the rest of the criminal gang want to kick us to the curve and let us fend for ourselves.\nBecause this is an oligarchical coup, not a government, and the only thing you care about is your tee time. Not us. End the gaslighting. Just tell us when you’re going to remove certain services.\nTo anyone reading this: if you abstained or voted for Trump, YOU are the problem. We who voted rationally don’t want to hear your whining. You refused to listen to your libtard neighbor and your snowflake kid who insisted you were voting against your interests. He’s in there now. Think he’ll leave after four years? Ha! Fascism and oligarchy rule now. We’ll be lucky to see another election until he’s out.\nThis message is not WCAG2.1 ADA ]accessibility compliant. The text is too small to read and there is no button to click up or down to change the font size.\nHey knucklehead, they have already been reduced with the lack of hiring nurses and in other ways. Stop the gaslighting!\nLots of complaining about what hasn’t even happened and “you support an authoritarian” blah blah blah. Shut up. I’m not sure all of these responses are from Veterans, way to self interested.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007.

The system is pretty broken and has been for decades as you know. DOGE will find tons of fraud I’m sure. Hopefully with the common sense decisions you will be able to help the VA get some efficiency!\nWhy is the government telling the VA they can’t prescribe pain medicine ? Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin doesn’t always do the trick. I’ll bet when someone in government needs pain meds, he can get them without any hassles.\nI personally believe we veterans deserve the continued assistance we require. The VA health system has been my lifeline. It has provided me with numerous treatments and medications that have sustained my life. I could not have experienced any better care even on the outside as much as I have at my VA facilities. Please do not take this very needed assistance from us. Thank you.\nThank you for VA services, veteran’s care, efficiency, and all services and funds provided!\nI communicate with the entire staff on my VA visits and I hear the same thing all the time. All staff feal they have no say in what their department needs. In the military we had the same problem! The officers have to communicate with the grunts to know what their needs are. I hope the new administration can make this happen !\nSo, reading between the lines here… our benefits are in danger, the administration is looking to cut services to us, and this is Mr. Collins trying to hide that fact so we think that we’re safe so when Musk and his goon squad do come in, we won’t be ready for it.\nI remember that NY Times Op-Ed about how our benefits package is too generous. I remember the limp-fisted attempts to manufacture consent for this. Musk and Trump think we’re stupid, and either Mr. Collins does, too, or is desperate to save his job.\nI doubt if anyone appointed by felon T can be trusted.\nRight. Way to toe the line. Cuts will come. The republicans are after Medicare, veterans benefits, Medicaid, and social security benefits. If you are working to improve the VA, then why did you allow President Elon to fire 1,000 VA workers? I assist veterans with obtaining benefits and I am seeing simple things like keeping a college attending child on the veteran’s benefits taking upwards of 10 months (and counting). Don’t say you’re improving when they are reducing efficiency and the ability to get benefits.\nWay to toe the party line.\nI have a vet friend. Who is 100% because he has a rare terminal blood cancer caused by Agent Orange. He just got a letter from the VA. It stated he was being DROPPED to 10%. His cancer is service connected and will eventually KILL HIM. Why is he being downgraded?\nThank you for your work\nWe must fill the jobs a our VA’s Hospitals across the country so we get the best care after fighting for our country as we were promised.\nOh, our data a safer alright. Problem is us vets can’t get into our accounts anymore. Read the comments on the how to sign in section!!!\nWatch for censorship here, as is common in Yahoo.\nI THINK THE ISSUE IS THE RUMORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ANGRY RELATED TO THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nI THINK IF YOU PROVIDED AN OUTLINE OF WHAT AND HOW YOU WILL MANAGE THE VA WILL CLARIFY ALL ISSUES.\nPLACE ALL ISSUES IN THE SUNSHINE; OPEN TO PUBLIC REVIEW.\nIF FRAUD; SHOW THE FRAUD ETC.. WHO, WHAT, WHERE , WHEN AND HOW MUCH?\nPROVIDE RATIONAL FOR ANY FIRINGS OR REMOVAL OF VA STAFF.\nI AM 82. VIETNAM ARMY MEDIC IN 1966-67 IN CU CHI, TAY NINH, IRON TRIANGLE, HOBO WOODS TDY WITH 196TH. LIGHT INFANTRY.\nALL I REMEMBER ARE DEAD; IN VIETNAM OR IN THE STATES.\nIN 1966-67 15,000 KIA’S. I STACKED A LOT OF KIA’S, DID A LOT OF DUST-OFF AND MORGUE WORK.\nHOW MANY KIA’S WERE ONLY 18?? I TREATED BLIND INJURIES, HEAD INJURIES, AMPUTATIONS, BURNS.\nI DO NOT KNOW HOW COMPENSATION CAN REPLACE LOST BODY PARTS.. I TASTE IT, SMELL IT AND FEEL IT EVERY DAY. WE DID OUR DUTY.\nNOW YOU MUST DO YOUR DUTY. GOD BLESS.\nAnd you all are going to believe this guy? Wait (not too long) and watch. Be ready to act (if you haven’t started already).\nThat guy is pushing the party line and that’s to be expected. But I only see our nation crumbling around us if we don’t protect ourselves.\nFelon and draft dodger Trump, ignorant and uninformed, continues his vengeance against the federal government, hurting veterans and their families. Congress and the Supreme court must stop the lunatic, and send him to prison where he belongs.\nSecretary Collins,\nNeed we remind you that going on video for all the public to see with a bald face lie will mark you a liar and just another sycophant to the king wannabe. The administration is leaning HARD on every single organisation to make 50% cuts in personnel! VA has always been under staffed and sorely underfunded….exactly how are you planning on improving care and services….your math doesn’t add up and your dog doesn’t hunt.\nThank you for you gracious address to all Veteran’s. The VA has assisted me in obtaining a college degree in education. I taught U.S. History, U.S. Government and taught other subjects including Coaching High School sports.\nI was a Hospital Corpsman in the Vietnam War and in maneuvers I damaged my left shoulder severely and needed basically a rebuilt shoulder. Unfortunately, the shoulder never healed properly and have had seven other shoulder surgeries, plus a replacement shoulder on both the left and right shoulder. The VA has been cordial and I have had a disability since 1975. I am now at 90%. I have suffered many years with mental and emotional stress and a divorce because of being drafted the same month I was to get married. The many days away and missing loved ones home caused great animosity. The ridicules, the spitefulness, the blatant acts employers displayed with their discriminatory acts of hiring then later firing because of so called necessary lay offs particularly to Vietnam Veterans. It took me thirteen years to finally feel caught up with those who didn’t have to go in the service for many unexcuseable means that dealt with the rich and what congressman did you happen to be acquainted with. All wars are always fought by the pons on a chess board, or families are just to poor to get their son in to the reserves, national guard and of course college. I have never come to grips with all of the anxiety and the deceitfulness that I constantly received. I still can’t decide what branch of the military I belonged with. I did appreciate the respect the Marine Corp gave to the Hospital Corpsman. One of the greatest titles I have ever received is “DOC!” I am still attempting to finalize my disability to 100%. It may bring a conclusion of the four years, difficulties after the military years, and anxiety and emotional setbacks. Sorry about allowing me to sound off. I feel I have but a couple of years left and I would feel compensated for those many years of unsureity. Sincerely, Daniel R. Polad\nMr. Secretary,\nWhile you raised important points, it is noteworthy that you did not reference the current budget proposal that aims to implement these exact cuts. While I understand that media coverage may not always align with the perspectives of officials, it is essential to recognize that the media plays a crucial role in informing the public and promoting awareness. If there are claims being made that you deem inaccurate, I urge you to counter these reports with relevant information rather than relying on political talking points. regardless of our political affiliation, Veterans deserve transparency and honesty regarding our benefits and the policies affecting them. Therefore, it is imperative that you and your team provide us with accurate and comprehensive information. We understand that you are the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. As such, we expect full transparency and request that you address the current budget proposal that aligns with Project 2025’s goal to implement several radical changes to VA benefits.\nSince DOGE is currently conducting finical awareness, will VA Disability have an increase. Like when Congress voted on a 40% increase to their annual pay. Also will there be a look into revising the appeal process for disability, some vets have been dealing with this for over 5 years. Lastly , will they be reviewing TAPS? Didn’t get much out of it to be honest.\nYeah you really shouldn’t be carrying Trump’s water.\nPeople are gonna be pissed, and your reputation will be in tatters. We aren’t stupid.\nMR. COLLINS,\nAS A COMBAT VETERAN, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE VA AUTHORIZE GLP1 FOR WEIGHT LOSS PURPOSES. CURRENTLY THE VA WILL AUTHORIZE GLP1 IF YOU ARE OBESE OR DIABETIC. THERE ARE LOTS OF US WITH WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT FALL INTO THE TWO PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CONDITIONS, WE ARE NOT ELGIBLE FOR GLP1 OR SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS. MANY HAVE WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BECAUSE OUR AGED BODIES NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO METABOLIZE SUGAR. IT’S VERY SIMILAR TO HYPO THYROID CONDITIONS, THE BODY QUITS MAKING THYROID HORMONES AND WITH PRESCRIBED MEDICATION WE CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. I’M EATING 1000 CALORIES PER DAY AND CONTINUE TO GAIN WEIGHT. SO PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS TO THE VETERANS FOR WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION. I CURRENTLY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THESE MEDICATIONS.\nTHANK YOU,\nAL LEHMAN (ALSLEHM@GMAIL.COM)\ni want to remind the President and Trump that this countrry’s veterans are highly trained and do not take it well feeliing that our government is going to try to take away any part of our earned benefits. Screwing around with veterans is a fast way to be removed from office one way or another. Also, get the Camp Lejeune Pact Act done!\nYou’d better hope so\nYou Sir, sound like you are completely full of sh*t. Just another T**** stooge. “Hit the ground running”?? Yeah, sure did—abolishing basic rights enshrined in our dear Constitution and claiming to be the arbiter of ‘what is law’ or not. Literally calls himself a ‘king’. What the actual f.\nWe certainly can’t trust the new potus, so why in the hell would we trust you when you say he’s doing a ‘good job’?? Pound sand you smarmy politician.\nI am a Georgian and Disabled Combat veteran from my service in combat in Vietnam and Gulf ! (Desert Storm).\nI offer my congratulations to my fellow Georgian Secretary Collins on his appointment. AND to my fellow vets i know this man from his campaign rallies for political office in Georgia, and he is a fine, honest man who will offer HOPE to vets for equitable and FAIR treatment by the VA. He has already addressed his intent to greatly improve the VA and I hope we as Vets can aid him in helping us.\nLike all of YOU, I await better things.\nIf you say the VA will not be affected then why have VA employees been fired by DOGE ??\nI do not believe you. I do not believe you have our best interest at heart and I do not support our President Musk and his lackey Trump. I did not vote for those derelict felons and so don’t appreciate our personal informative being given to them. My family going back to my grandfather has served in every war since the Civil War. The way this government is going, we will not be the United States of America anymore. We will be the United States of Russia or whoever has the most money.\nDo not touch our benefits or you will see war.\nPlease get the Community Centers in Colorado to approve care outside of the VA. I’ve having to pay for my care while they sit on the paperwork. Then to be told that their doctor that reviews case said no over rides the PCP (who’s in North Carolina. Haven’t seen a physical doctor since 2020 ) from the VA. Been fighting this for 3 years for care and can’t get reimbursed for treatment that I’ve had to pay waiting. They have 45 days to processes refusals, then send a notice denied for continued care on acupuncture. When they do approve it’s for 11 visits. If they allowed 30 visits for a year it would save money in all this process. Folks that have test for cancer and other serious conditions are having the same problem here in Colorado. I have been to the VA in DC and they have the Community Care call me which doesn’t solve the problem. I’ve been told by them the “Corporations” policies state they have to deny at least once a year. I have a long list of excuses they’ve given me for delays and denying or approval. Please help.\nOur benefits may not be getting cut but it is a shame that the job cuts and hiring freeze has stopped the expansion of a new CBOC branch in Las Cruces New Mexico.\nI don’t believe a word of it. Anyone appointed by the current regime is suspect at a minimum, a co-conspirator and kleptocrat in reality.\nHe’s a trumper. I cannot trust him.\nThey cut the Veteran Crisis Hotline this week. This is so necessary for veterans who are suffering from PTSD and suicidal ideation.\nOn average, around 17 U.S. veterans die by suicide each day. In 2023, according to the most recent VA data, Its around 17 to 22 people daily.\nAs for the Veterans Crisis Line, the VA reported that in 2023, the hotline received about 1,000 to 1,500 calls per day on average. The number of texts and chat messages has also increased, showing the desperate and growing demand for mental health support among veterans.\nCutting these services means more people who are desperate don’t get the help they need. It means more people will die. I’d much rather have my tax dollars go towards helping kids be able to each school lunches and veterans in great need than padding the pockets of people destroying the last fabrics of community and care we have for our most vulnerable. Tax cuts for the rich don’t benefit the great good. No one voted for this.\nDOGE is a scam designed by south African musk and felon don to screw veterans out of their benefits.\nThey’ve already fired suicide prevention counselors and other vital VA workers.\nDo not trust them. These fascist are dangerous.\nThe secretary of the VA, Doug Collins, speaks with forked tongue!! Check the Ann Arbor, MI VA. People are being fired. One lady with 38 years there and only 2 years from retirement, gone! Take his words with a grain of salt. That VA medical facility is one of the busiest in Michigan.\nthere are approx 19,000,000 living Veterans.\nless than half, about 9,000,000, are served by VA.\n(far less have P&T ratings)\nimagine if VA had them all or even 75% — they’d need 6x budget increase, as they already need a 3x.\nREMEMBER THE VA’S MOTTO\nLIE, DENY, THEN YOU DIE!\nSO YOU ARE GOING TO HELP THE VET. I AM A VET US M C 66 70 IN NAM. I GET TREADED LAIK A DOG OR WORSE AT THE V A. HOWABOUT 38 MONTH TO GET HEARING AID. HOW ABOUT THE V A LEFT A TUMER IN MY HEAD FOR 4 TO 6 YEARS. I COULD GO ON AND ON. IF THE VET CONG DONT KILL YOU THE V A WILL.\nDoge needs to be eliminated like all enemies of the American People\nThanks, good to hear\nIt’s a cinch you’ve NOT been keeping up with nor understanding EXACTLY what is happening within and to our VA! You “claim” to be partnering with DOGE … however, these teenagers have NEVER been vetted nor given “clearances” as any other government worker HAS to do. They are also NOT experts in contract development nor do they have the necessary background/expertise in budget forensics. They are ONLY programmers who know LITTLE about the Cobalt (one of the main program languages used by our government) language or HOW to use it. WE have no guarantees that they are NOT just scamming the data as there are NO apparent guardrails to ensure WHAT is done with that data both during and following their “rummaging around” those databases. You are NEW to this Department and job. You have NO ONE with any historical background to understand WHATEVER they might tell you. We know, for a fact, that they’ve delved into the SS database and have NO expertise for dealing with that data. Their claim that some 150+ year olds are still being paid PROVES they have little expertise to parse out the data in a meaningful way! I’ve no confidence in your ability to “cover” the VA’s needs given how you’ve addressed this attack on the VA data.\n100% SC veterans at the Louis A Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg , WV. (VISN 5) are waiting over one year to get dental services needed in the community, that they cannot offer in house ! Only approximately 6 veterans per month are approved on the waiting list of over 100 names ! Why ?\nVerty nice shill for Trump. I don’t believe a single word out of your mouth.\nWilliam Bushey\nEx-Navy, retired Military Sealift Command Boatswain.\nyet. not happening yet.\nmaybe it won’t — you did not say that explicitly. but, if you are backing that with some kind if trust with those two. whew. but you sound like and are a politician.\nWhat branch of the service did you serve in ?\nClearing claims faster than ever seems to be by denying them. I Was at step 5 for the past 10 weeks, then suddenly I went backwards to step four and got emails that I’m going to be redoing my C and P Exams, I’m guessing to do their best to make me look like an idiot and a liar. I try very hard to get by day to day, I raised 2 kids with my disabilities and how I still don’t know. I constantly feel on the brink of losing my sense of reality and breaking down beyond the ability to pick myself back up. I don’t know how to try harder,, I’ve given it all I’ve got. I know longer know what to do. I know there are others in what seems like a desperate place and now this, now another failure. You say you’re here to help, but I now feel that is a cruel untruth . I’m going to pray for me and all of the other veterans that are counting on you.\nBrenda Grimm\nI DO NOT BELIEVE YOU. Prove it that you are going to keep and expand the VA work force that is in dire need of MORE health professionals, not less. When I can not get an eye appointment for six months at the VA in Lakewood Washington and have to go to community care, THAT IS WRONG. We need more VA professionals, not less. Tell DOGE, go to Russia to find savings!!\nut oh. now we know our benefits are up for the chop.\nThese people are straight up liars.\nI was recently drooped from80%to seventy because they said they made a mistake and keep saying bone on bone gets better what kind of doctor or human being is that stupid afer 43 yers\nNobody believes you. Of course why should we be surprised.\nHow does DOGE define “efficiency”? That’s such a broad term.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/\nClose and sell all VA Hospitals and clinics, property, medical machines, etc. All of those employees laid off (DR, NP, RN, MA, etc) will hire into the medical field where they want, filling staffing needs at local hospitals and clinics. It will either grow hospitals and clinics, or empower those workers to start their own businesses and locations. You could even give them preferential service agreements/contracts. That allows us to go wherever we want/need to go for services needed. The VA ID and SSN is our insurance card. VA gets billed & bargains with the providers, and settles to pay them. That way we find and keep our PCP, specialists, etc. No need for travel claims and reimbursements. Selling the buildings and properties will also allow new businesses to develop and put money back into the VA. Only a few employees would be needed for staffing admin (negotiations, verifiers, approvers, and logistics). Run the numbers and tell me I’m wrong.\nY’all just cut 1000 workers and you’re trying to feed us this line? Trump calls us all suckers and losers, and you’re one of his sycophants who defends him relentlessly despite that. You need to do your ACTUAL job and defend veterans with more than just false reassurances and platitudes, what are you actually going to do to help us? Hire those thousand people back and then further expand the VA’s workforce because a consistent problem with services is everyone who works for the VA and does real work is overworked due to how poorly staffed it was before your lousy boss decided to cut that many people for no good reason. Do better. Don’t let some illegal immigrant heading an illegal “department” destroy the VA.\nhttps://youtu.be/9RMzs0EplZw?si=RBEJ–KbuMUvZnmT\nIn the words of Carol Kane from the Princess Bride, “Liar! Liar! Liiaaaaaarrr!” Of the 1,000 VA employees who were cut, hundreds of those were direct service providers including those who man the Veterans Crisis Line. Many others were claims processors and related positions, who are responsible for making sure veterans claims for benefits are processed in a timely and quality manner. Therefore when you say we are putting the money to use for veterans, you are liar.\nOnly two defining forces have ever offered to sacrifice their lives for us, Jesus Christ and the American Veteran. I’m a 100% disabled veteran and any reduction or cuts to our benefits would create a hardship for me and my brothers! BM3 USCG Cold War veteran.\nDear Sir,\nI have faith in you looking after the veteran.\nThank you\nDon A.\nI’m sorry to see the VA secretary become a mouthpiece for the lies that the POTUS is spewing. I’m sorry, but he’s not worth listening to.\nALL of these firings within government institutions is “their” effort to have only those loyalists (fellow republicans) staffing them. Voter rolls were the first to be examined before the chopping began! Trump hates anything to do with the military (having stolen the one million he raised for vets during his 2015 campaign). Remember how he refused to honor WWI vets while in France during the 100th year anniversary of the war because his hair would get wet! He’ll disrespect and will take everything away from you, too!\nHow could we believe ANYTHING that this guy says, based on who he represents?? It’s so sad. Unfortunately people will find out after the fact.\nWhen will the Secretary address the issue of benefits which have already been cut? Namely, the reduced hirings of doctors, nurses and technicians throughout the 170 hospital and clinic system. The shortage is acute. The only way a vet can see a real doctor these days is to protest the medical attention of “nurse practitioners,” who obviously are not doctors.\nVeterans are not dummies. We see, as Secretary Gen. Shinseki warned before Trump fired him, that a certain faction of politicians and avaricious businessmen is doing all it can to make the VA appear to be dysfunctional and failing, so that the way will be paved for giving the VA to Wall Street. And the ultimate reasoning behind this nefarious plan is that our free hospital system for veterans is “socialism.” Capitalists hate giving away “free stuff,” even if it is vital medical services and drugs to care for the men and women who sacrificed their precious time and sometimes their health and their very lives to defend the United States of America, whatever role, great or small, that they played.\nBetter helping us? Clinics and centers are already understaffed, in what reality is firing 1000+ staff helpful? How is downsizing the Crisis Hotline helpful? How is getting rid of SSRIs and telling receiptents to go to ‘wellness farms’ helping veterans?!\nIn what reality is taxing benefits and even thinking of limiting benefits and making them even harder to get helpful? This administration is turning into a dumpster fire and regret ever having voted for him and his unelected lackey. I have more trust in the real people getting notices and emails within the VA, on ground dealing with all of this and sounding the alarm then I do a bought yes-man.\nCan you get the VA clinics to hire more doctors? There seems to be a shortage and have to wait months to get into to see one! Also, can you get the VA clinics to start answering their phones? I live in Texas .\nSad situation!\nSecretary, you say at the end “…come to see me.” I need to see you and give you the first-hand look at what this highly rural service-connected disabled veteran needs in the form of efficiency. And I can fill you in on exactly where it is so inefficient in the VISN 20 system of VHA. I don’t need to apply for a claim, I don’t need to ask for more money, I don’t need to hope that the Office of Rural Health will be there for addressing the rural veteran’s delima of the benefit of basic medical care because this division of the VHA is only apparent to the veteran in this corner of the country to be a research gathering institution and no longer accessible to the veterans that depend on that voice that separates us from the urban veteran that has much more efficient/available/more choices of receiving medical care whether it be basic medicine or even more critical, the unique medical needs of that mostly alone to the veteran and not that of the general human race. Please let me know how I can speak with you, I’ll even be glad to make a trip to the big building in DC where you keep your desk, that is if I’m even as a veteran allowed to enter that building (past administrations made it off limits in the simplest of terms where as it was easier and more productive to be invited in to the White House complex just down the street). So please reach out to me and I’ll be glad to provide some efficiency from the most western spot in the lower 48 that one can live…and loving it.\nPersonal note: I always knew the chaplain had my back in the many years I served, and it’s the chaplain once again that has had my back in recent years at the VHA, and I understand and have confidence the chaplain on the flight deck is going to have my back also. Instills confidence there is hope.\nI don’t believe anything this man says. He is nothing more than a Trump toadie.\nI would like to come see you.But ,i probably wont be the only one.\nI find it hard to believe the words coming out of the mouths of imbecilic lickspittle…\nThank you very much! Unlike many people commenting on here im doing great! I appreciate my benefits, it seems like everyone is a victim these days. If you need any help let me know. Make America Great Again!! ?\nLeave my VA and my disability benefits alone. Stop firing staff! Allow me to continue to receive the excellent health care offered me since 1975. And I don’t believe you Collin’s.\nThis could not be more wrong. VA employees have been fired en masse without cause. I fail to see how that could possibly make anything faster. Where is your integrity? Shame on you, Mr. Secretary.\nWe have been waiting many years and were told by the end of June this year. (first it was January. Hope they get more people to help sort this out.\nHe’s lying. Like a snake. This administration and all their toadies don’t give a damn about veterans. They’ve fired the staff manning the suicide crisis phone line. They DON’T CARE about us. Period. This is all bullshit and mirrors, and we vets need to stand up against those who would reneg on the promise we made – our lives for the safety of America, and they will take care of us afterwards.\nWhy are my comments not being posted as I wrote them? I thought we had free speech in this country.\nThat’s what Hegseth told the DoD…And now guess what President Elon has announced?\nIn the Philippine, they do not pay travel pay because a few file a false travel claim. Instead of punish them, they are punishing all veterans. I think if someone file a false Travel claim, they should lose all their VA benefits.\nLook into veterans getting private doctor prescriptions filled at the V.A. pharmacy.\nWe can’t see our providers because we have NO providers. Tell me what’s efficient about that. The programs mean nothing if they are not accessible and efficient. How do I know this? I’m a Physician Assistant and have practiced medicine for 18yrs in the Army and now in the civilian sector. THE VETERANS NEED HEALTHCARE and other services NOW.\nIf they aren’t going to attack VA benefits, why has musk and his clowns fired people hired to saves veterans lives from committing suicide!? From what I’ve read musk and his idiots have started firing sucide hotline personnel!\nYou are serving a criminal who is dismantling my beloved Republic in a EO coup and handing over unconstitutional power, to an unelected, unvetted, Unconfirmed by Congress civilian billionaire that has him by the short and curlies. You and the rest of his fascist oligarchs and lapdogs should be ashamed of yourself, and you’re not. You have spit on my constitution, my oath(and your own) and my service as well as all those who have served before me and continue to do so. If you voted for Fat Nixon, you are either complicit in his crimes, or you allowed yourself to be duped because he hates the same people you do. You are NOT patriots. You’re nothing but low-level co-conspirators and I wished you would feel the pain that’s coming the most. But that’s not how this works. You’ve hurt all of us equally. Way to go.\n“find things we need to get rid of…”? That’s oddly not reassuring. What do you mean? What things? Be more transparent!\nYOU SOUND LIKE ONE OF TRUMP’S HENCHMEN IN WHICH WE SHOULD QUESTION ANY STATEMENT MADE. IT’S A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS, BUT THAT IS WHAT MYSELF AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE FACING. WORK ON GETTING TRUMP OUT AS PRESIDENT AND INTO A JAIL CELL (WHERE HE BELONGS AS A CONVICTED FELON), AND THEN YOU MAY BE MORE CREDIBLE.\nThanks for making it clear to all Veterans.\nAny veteran that voted for the current occupant of the White House betrayed the oath they took and disgraced the uniform. Our fathers and granfathers fought a war against fascism…. and you voted for it.\nI agree hole heartedly\nyour good i support trump and believe you\nYou don’t hire a bunch hackers (including a teenager) to do audits and forensic accounting work.\nI give this guy as much credibility as I do Trump and VP Musk- zero.\nNo veteran wants to — nor deserves to — be held in suspended animation while you attempt to digest the words of a lactose intolerant Commander-In-Chief with a documented history of bone spurs.\nThe rest of us have REAL issues.\nSecVA Doug Collins is either cutting veterans benefits or he isn’t. Don’t play the game, twinkle toes.\nRestore the SIPU’s Combat Vets need them\nWho removed Paragraph G in VFR 1108.08 and why?\nBill Montanari\nInteresting. Tell me, why would there be a need to “find things we need to get rid of”?\nWhere did that money go that you will have to “put the money where it belongs …. back with our veterans”?\nCan you give a guarantee that it won’t get “lost” again? I know, there is no guarantee.\nThank you for clearing up the rumors. Additionally thank you for taking on the role of VA Secretary, this job will certainly change you.\nI am very familiar with the Charles George Medical center in Asheville, NC. My husband had a hemorrhagic stroke in August 2020. Agent Orange left my Viet Nam vet with, among other things, chronic high blood pressure that, although he lived an incredibly healthy lifestyle, caused a small blood vessel to burst in his brain. My guy, who was a very successful small business owner, a great father, a builder of all things, including a family, a business, a cabin cruiser sailboat and our current home, has spent the last 4.5 years in a bed, having been robbed of all his gumption and motivation, not to mention the use of the left side of his body. He’s a shell of the man he used to be.\nIf it wasn’t for the Asheville VA and the amazing and dedicated employees and support staff, helping to guide us through the complicated morass of the system we would not still be in our home, I’d probably be in the hospital and my husband would probably be in a substandard hell hole of a “nursing home”.\nHow dare you and your commander and his ilk be so damned cavalier with the futures of the men and women who kept you and all the rest of us safe by offering up their own lives in service. How dare you fire the very people who make so many veterans’ and their families’ lives more liveable!\nEvery damn single employee (or volunteer) we have encountered at the VA medical center is there because they CARE and appreciate the men and women who serve/served this country. We do not need less of them, we need more! I feel very fortunate that my husband received his disability rating (a year after initial application), I am being compensated for being a full time caregiver (a year after initial application) and that we just got major funding for a converted van (a year after initial application) that my husband can drive his wheelchair into and we can actually TRAVEL to the VA again. We hope to go visit our daughter and other family members now!\nIt was the dedicated workers through the VA who made this happen for us. We are grateful every day for them. They, like the Capitol Police officers, should be held up in praise for the sacrifices and dedication they have made for us. WE NEED MORE OF THEM.\nIf you want to eliminate WASTE, start at the top, with the commander in chief and the unelected Elon Musk lording over the DOGE.\nHow long will you continue to lie to our faces!\nStart answering the 100s of questions posted here instead of continuing Trumps big lie!\nIt’s about time I am a combat wounded from the operation desert stormn/shield seen combat and got danger pay and over seas pay and got the combat action war ribbon but not a combat action badge why not thank you joseph\nDon’t believe a word this man says. He is Trump selected.\nWhy does the VA play with my percentage? every time I have had an evaluatuion they may give me an increase in the area of concern at the time, but decrease the percentage on a prior evaluation percentage.\nSo….. I call B.S. Sending Vets out in the community isn’t “improving Veterans care…” In the 21 yrs I’ve gone to the V.A., I’ve never had a bad provider. If you think waiting to be seen would be better, try calling a civilian provider for an appointment and see how far out they are booked. The V.A. is well versed in matters specific to Vets, like Agent Orange exposure, etc; that civilian providers (especially those with no military service background) are not experienced with. The contract with those who defend this country is based in part by the country providing care…it’s one of the reasons we take so much less compensation then our civilian peers. Pushing us out to the civilian community is just a ‘passing the buck’ play of shucking that responsibility.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD (even though I provided a buddy statement from my commanding officer who also served as VA Secretary), TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nLooking forward to the improvements and increased focus on Veterans!\nThank you for the update !\nWe are supposed to trust your word? I didn’t cripple myself in order for fascists could take over our government.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD, TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nHow can we be sure that you are truthful? Certainly, the president isn’t as well and is not being transparent. How can we trust you when you believe in him?\nI am a 90% unemployable disabled Army Veteran. I am also 63 years old. I fought tooth and nail and struggled for years to receive my rating. To cut my compensation would truly put my wife and I in jeopardy. The VA has been helping me and my wife now that my rating has been increased. I have VAHC and she has CHAMPVA that helps us with our medical care.\nI have faith in Pres. Trump and Elon Musk to cut government fat. I was shocked to see what USAID was spending on other countries under the title of CHARITY. That money could go to homeless vets or programs for Americans.\nMr. Secretary I have confidence in you and your office. I trust you are fighting for the Veteran along with Sec. Hegseth and Pres. Trumps team.\nHorse excrement. I was at my VA clinic today – there is a nurse shortage AND A HIRING FREEZE thanks to your buddy the S. African fraudster and his little band of DOGEbags. Congress already woefully underfunds the VA to serve veterans and now the hiring freeze..?\nYou’re a liar, sir.\nNEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF BOYS! AND HE WORKS HARDER THAN THE LAST 5 ADMINISTRATIONS PUT TOGETHER. NO MORE FUNDS FOR DUDS.??\nOne week on the job and Collins is already attacking the media who is trying to report all the cuts this administration is making. Collins is lying, they have already fired all the provisional VA hotline workers.\nBS. I was at my VA today – there is a nurse shortage and now a hiring freeze. So even if you were telling the truth the VA is woefully understaffed to serve veterans properly. And that is on the Congress. Call your buddies and call OFF the foreigner and his DOGEbags\nYour comments are all in present tense. You do NOT affirm that benefits will not be cut in the future.\n1000 VA employees were cut. The VA was already understaffed. Where are we when VA staff retires?\nOur new VA secretary is an obsequious Trump toady . I watched the video. No explanation about the 1,000 employees who were fired last week. Plus a half truth about DOGE. We don’t know if they’ve taken VA patients information – yet. But they already have every US citizen’s personal info following their raid on the US Treasury. Yes, Project 2025 plans to cut your benefits. The way I see it, the plan is to annoy you into giving up by having you constantly re-verify your disability rating, plus some services will be made unavailable to you. I’m sure the new Secretary is going to be OK with that. A lie by omission is still a lie, Chaplain Collins. Proverbs 19:9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish. Oh, and remember Mr Secretary, If you “hit the ground running”… You’re more than likely going to trip and fall on your face.\nI don’t believe anything that Trump, Musk, or any Trump appointed person says right now. Trump said one minute that Medicaid wouldn’t be cut. An hour later, it was announced that Medicaid would be cut. Firing employees at the VA doesn’t say to me that the cuts are meant to provide better services. It’s the exact opposite.\nA tax on is a cut. A reduction in COLA is a cut\nI am in the same boat with others for my Pact Act retroactive claim.\nDoug Collins on the job one week and he’s already attacking the media. This guy is getting ready to cut benefits, all the while lying through his teeth about it.\nAnd when will something be done about Fort MacClellan. All the chemicals we WACs endured. No one has helped. Sad sad sad yes we are getting old and death has knocked at many doors. Are you waiting till only two are still alive?\nYikes, the wording in this is so concerning. Another pandering to the corrupted leadership. Sure, they won’t do this or that….then proceed to do exactly those things. I’m not holding my breath.\nDEI removal from various VAs already making the staff take down anything dealing with Black History, LGBTQ+, and Woman Veterans says it all. The illegal “promises” of paid leave so you won’t just get fired later is all a joke. Then, not stopping the hate given from old, hateful, brainwashed salts to various minority groups that are also Veterans like themselves is just sad. What happened to this supposed comradery?\nAll of us Veterans served to preserve the freedom we ALL enjoy in the U.S.A., or is it just for the straight white males? This whole video makes me disappointed in the appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\nThere are a lot of individuals below that worded it just so excellently. I will be submitting complaint after complaint to all the various offices until shit stops going backward in time. Even before all of this, it was and still is a full-time job to babysit the VA into doing what it is supposed to do. Several VHA Directives were broken, and lies were spouted. If the military had not messed me up, I wouldn’t be dealing with this organization but here we are.\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nI was told VA is cutting benefits for tinnitus patients. This was alarming. I do suffer from tinnitus but when I had my hearing tested at the VA in Houston I wasn’t tested for tinnitus, I was tested for hearing damage starting from my separation date. After 6 years working on fighter aircraft I have to ask twice, turn the volume up too high for others and other issues not associated with tinnitus and in conjunction with tinnitus. If my disability benefit is cut, so be it. But reading this article seems to conflict with what I was told. So thanks.\nSo why are VA staff members being fired for no reason? That’s not lawful, what about the families of those employees?\n“Trust me, I’m the president”\n“I’m not a crook”\nThings to remember.\nI don’t trust you Collins. I hear that anyone who obtains a position like yours has to state that the 2000 election was stolen in your interview. I don’t trust that sociopath Musk and I damn sure don’t trust that draft dodger Trump. Trump is an amoral unethical dishonorable liar, convicted felon, corrupt businessman and politician who sexually assaults women.\nI hope that what you’re saying is true and that they won’t be taking away veteran’s benefits, for your sake and mine. Because if they do, Oh boy. I can’t even imagine what 5 million veterans, their families, active service members, and the people who support us would be willing to do to wrench that back from a despotic regime. The second you do that, the second a coup starts. Good luck getting the military at large to support you.\nSo much waste. Like paying to ship insulin overnite and it takes FedEx 3-4 days to get it to the veteran. Most time ice pack is warm. Putting the Dexcom transmitters with prosthetics . And then trying to call and ask for refill. No body at VA answers phones. Or returns a call.\nHopefully you’ll go back to letting vets go to outside resources when the waiting list is to long for care.\nThis is how it was done during President Trumps first term and veterans loved it.\nPlease go back to this exceptional resource.\nThank you Secretary Collins\nVetnam vet my records were cleaned came home 1968 they keep denying me veterns affairs needs to get fixed\nHow about helping Veterans who served Honorably instead of Denying better percentage rates. Trillions if dollars go over seas, and billions went to illegals, but Veterans get denied.\nThe secretary can’t guarantee that. How can we trust what the Secretary says, in any case?? 8% cut at the Pentagon and veterans are getting fired so who’s to say that benefits won’t be next in the spring?? You can’t guarantee that Secretary, now can you? Chaos is all that we’re seeing and no promise lasts 5 minutes around here…\nRhank you to all of those trying to make things better !@\nPlease make the VA Insurance considered “ credible” under Medicare guidelines so we can quit paying $180/ month to stay qualified for Medicare without penalty if the VA ever drops veterans currently under VA insurance\nWhy did they cut the Hotline for veterans that had veterans who were thinking of suicides calling in?\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nI hadn’t heard the rumor that benefits were being cut. I DID hear that most of the layoffs at the VA were veterans. Is that true?\nStaffing at my assigned VA Medical Center was already short staffed and personnel cuts will be devastating. I saw my primary doctor at the Baltimore Medical Center in December, when two lumps were found on my throat. She recommended that I be seen by an ENT specialist. However, the earliest appointment I could get is March 4th. Three months to address something that could be very serious in unacceptable. The first week in January, I was referred to physical therapy for lower back pain but the earliest available date is February 25th. I also asked if I could go through Community Care to have my therapy done locally because I live an hour and fifteen minutes from the medical center. Previously, it was quickly approved for another problem. However, this time it was quickly denied. So, at this point, it surely doesn’t seem like money and staffing is being directed to better Veterans health care.\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nAs a mouthpiece for the man who is carving up our civil services and selling them to his toadies, things already weren’t looking great for you. Then you put out this video lying to our faces when we can read exactly what the executive orders say and we know VA staffing, budget, and benefits are being attacked. They’re even floating taxing VA benefits as income as if that were a sane idea. You ought to apologize to us and wash your mouth out with soap. You ought to resign. I’ll thank you to at least stop lying to my face.\nI’m in Spokane where they have been trying to “fix” the new computer system for the past 5 years. If you need a place to flush more money…I’ll take it. The system should have been scrapped years ago. It was to work the day it was paid for and still has problems. Veterans are tired of reporting them as it seems no one cares.\nI Do not trust a draft dodger or a legal alien musk digging into our personal business like soc va and our personal bank accounts veterans deserves better than this.\nI have been fighting the VA since 1969 to have my disability upped to 100%. The most they will grant me is 90%. I have a bullet in my back, and scar tissue from the base of my skull down my back to just above my butt. I also have a scar just behind my left ear and numbness on my hands and both feet un into my calves. Most a bullet logged in my back that somewhere in the paperwork went from be recognized as a bullet to shrapnel fragment. It clearly shows a bullet on my x rays. The VA refuses to understand that I have serious health conditions and continue to ignore my doctor’s letters and medical records. DEALING WITH THE VA especially NOW is horrible and because of the strain it puts on my health I have to step back and keep quiet. There isn’t any hope of help from the VA especially with tRUM P AND musK IN OFFICE.\nAnother Trump shill following his marching orders in fealty to draft-dodging lying Trump. Nothing but bold-faced lies from another radical right christian nationalist on a mission to implement Project 2025, which was the intent all along. I think we’ll soon see Veterans medical services handed off to a private corporation that will only give veterans less service for more money.\nI hope you do I was treated for cancer I did not have 6 months of 3 kind’s of chemo and my primary care doctor told me to shut up about it also severed my lyranex throat has a hole in it\nWhy should we trust anything anyone from this administration says about anything? Going by previous history, none of you cab be trusted.\nThere is no way the VA will operate as efficiently as it should when you fire thousands of employees without doing due diligence and without having invested the time to understand the processes.\nThis is reassuring. However, at Charles George in some clinics long awaited doctors in the employment process ready to join a clinic are having their commitments cancelled. Doctors needed to provide long needed care where the need has for a long time out weighs what can be provided.\nI wish I could believe this guy.\nVietnam vet here. I volunteered to serve, unlike your draft-dodging blustering bully of a President. VA workers are ALREADY being fired and you have the utter gall to gaslight about “improving services.”\nYou are a disgrace and should resign. With all due respect, f-ck off.\nI try to utilize myhealthyvet but cannot figure out why I can’t make progress with any issue that arrises. I got a n assistance with try to find records within the new sign-in processes, and with the assistance was able to get some things to work but during the 5 month process, have lost the myhealthyvet account Username and password to the account itself. The system says my account has no username or password on it.\nHow can it determine the file is there if when requested it says neither item exists??\nI do not want Trump’s goons hacking my email for their filthy N- political messages. Now they want to politicize VA. None of the cowards served, but they’ll suck on the blood of those of us who did. I don’t want Collins hacking my email for his N- agenda, Now I hate Trump and his goons worse. Get out of VA.\nConsidering the manner in which all this CHANGE is taking place and the commotion it is causing, there better be something really noteworthy on the horizon.\nChange for the better is good but the manner in which it is being undertaken is questionable.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins. When the VA has been understaffed and underfunded for at least 50 years, with reports of “probationary staff” at the VA are being fired, and with current difficulties in getting timely appointments, I have serious trouble believing that things are improving. I can imagine VA staff is having a hard time wondering who will be fired.\nWith p47’s past comments about veterans being losers and suckers, I don’t believe he or anyone in his cabinet will make the veterans’ situation better.\nGerald K. Ambroson\nThank you Mr.Secretary and Congressman for your video and straight to the point, no bs regarding the rumors that gets amplified by those using scare tactics. I served 30 years in our Armed Forces, served 1 year with the VA and soon realized to many didn’t live by the creed of President Lincoln’s promise during his famous Gettysburg address. I have also served 11 years as a DOD government employee. Yes those rumors travel fast and many retired military and active duty personnel hear these rumors and I appreciate your video and your words addressing the rumors!!\nYou lost any chance of getting respect from veterans when you allowed Elon’s baby N-s into the VA and gave them access to the computer systems. Congrats on being on the job for only a couple of weeks and already losing the trust of the people you claim you are here to serve. If you are doing anything under the “leadership” of a certain hitler wanna be, then you will never get an ounce of that respect back. YOU ALLOWED THEM TO FIRE 1,000 employees right off the bat, and you think we trust you?\nWhat a crock of trump.\nI don’t believe this sh-t in the slightest.\nThere is nobody associated with the fat orange felon that can be trusted.\nI’m rich, I’m a 0.43 percenter, so I really don’t care if I get my 100% disability each month. Maybe all of you out there should have been a little more financially responsible while you were wasting your money on nonsense.\nThank you for your commitment.\nThank you Secretary Collins for reassuring Veterans that our hard earned benefits are safe under the leadership of President Trump. However, like a football game we are only in the 1st quarter. I continue to be concerned until the 4th quarter. I have heard about 1,000 VA employees (many Veterans) being fired with little or no notice because they were recent hires. The VA must take care of its workers who in turn take care of its Veterans. Please continue to place our Veterans, some [other than me] who have given so much, first. (2/327th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam)\nSir, yes you are clearing cases, but not in the favor of the veterans at all, just the VA. Please don’t try to tell us different! Apparently your office doesn’t answer any questions, as I’m seeing from others. 2 weeks, Sir we’ve been dealing with the bullsh-t longer than that. Ugh!\nAs a veteran,as well as someone who worked at the county level of the VA helping vets with claims and benefits, why would I believe anything he had to say. He is appointed by trumpthefelon, obviously from his statement on DOGE he is giving access and is cooperating ! They are gearing up to privatize the VA health care which IS NOT in the best interest of veterans! How in a week on the job he can say they are “clearing cases faster than ever” is s beyond me! That statement alone sounds exactly like trumpthefelon’s boasting words! It’s a sh-t show that will just continue to get worse .\nCould you clarify for me how many civil service employees received letters that they might no longer be employed by the VA and what this mix of personnel looks like. You may be processing claims more quickly but are service members getting the care they need or are they being farmed out to civilian providers with 6-8 week wait periods? I am a veteran of 28 years service with a disability. I receive my care through Medicare and Tricare for life due to issues w the VA availability of care. It isn’t much better w Tricare for life as the majority of referrals go to outside agencies. The service members and their families are then on their own to find a provider. We called that turfing patients when I worked in health care. Seems there is still a lot of it going on.\nYou did not address peoples concerns about loss of benefits-you shoved it off to an irresponsible media. That is not what I, as a veteran, want to hear.\nV/R\nDoug If the V.A is working faster than ever I would like to know why my higher appeal for care givers has been sitting on someone desk since Nov 2023. And im still waiting for it to be asign to someone . My Husband is a Vietnam Veteran . And was wounded in vietnam shot by is own lieutenant is 90% he has went down hill. For any verteran are family to wait a year is ridculous.\nYou Sir are, full of horse sh-t.\nFirst day in office Trump fired bunch of VA primary care physicians. My primary was one of them.\nIt has been 4 weeks and guess what, that number has surpassed 1000+ fired VA employees. Most of them are Veterans. Veterans taking care of other Veterans. And you’re here making a short video promising what? That our hard earned benefits aren’t going to be cut? Are you all there? Do you have any clue what’s going on in the government?\nThere is combat Veterans being deported because ICE doesn’t care about documentation. Trump just want numbers. And you sit here and right out lie that our benefits aren’t going to be touched? They are already touched. From fired primary care physicians to veterans working at VA hospitals. The VA has already been affected massively even if it was a huge ordeal to Veterans just dealing with VA to begin with.\nYou’re a schmuck and a bootlicker.\nWhy should I believe you….\nSo that it’s clear, Project 2025, which Donald Trump has followed to the letter thusfar, has plans in place to fully privatize the VA and strip us of our benefits. The method they’re using is identical to how they systematically destroyed the Postal Service last time they were in office. If you are reliant on your veteran’s benefits for your medical care, housing, income, or otherwise, you NEED to have an alternative in place for when they do to veterans what they’ve already done to farmers. I could frankly care less about what Mr. Collins says. Also, you need to be resetting your credentials in all of your VA-related websites; Vice President Musk’s kindergarten class had no business being anywhere near our personal data, and you should expect to have that information leaked or spilled, so have resets on standby.\nStep 1, Cut 1,000 employees from the VA. Where did I get that info, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nVA Secretary is a full blown MAGAT.\nThis message from the boss seems to be contradicted by the notice I got yesterday that our Radiology location was closed down. I am not calling Mr. Collins a liar but don’t like the smell of this.\nI have a SDVOSB that service my fellow veterans!\nSecretary Collins,\nIf the VA is expanding benefits for Veterans, why did the personnel working on the Burn Pit Registry get terminated from their jobs? Why are no hiring actions for new healthcare workers moving forward? I see lip service, but no substance behind your words. Actions speak.\nWill a rating that is based on “presumptive findings” be across the board? I have a condition that gave me a rating due to harmful/toxic chemical exposure, but that same exposure didn’t cover other conditions like it should have. Will these conditions be re-considered? I have an appointment with my local VSO on 2/28/25. Will they know of the improvements that you speak of Mr. Collins? Is there a direct line/email to contact you? That would be great!\nI do not appreciate the new VA Secretary blaming the media for his inability to control the narrative on his agency. The media’s role is to report what it’s told frkm credible sources and journalistic standards require two verifiable sources. I only listen to and read media that follows these journalistic standards. I and my father are both retired military officers with high disability ratings; he was 100% and I’m 70%. He and I both served to allow free expression and a robust media to openly report important issues that inform the American public. This demonizing of the media is dangerous and un-American. I deeply resent the VA Secretary, who is suppose to represent and care for military Veterans who have been disabled in the the service of American ideals, to actively tear down one of foundations of our Democracy. I have personally read about the recent disgraceful suggestions of lowering some disabled Vets ratings assuming that only those disabilities received directly as a result of combat are worth compensating. This ignorant and disrespectful idea was obviously made by someone who has probably never served as it shows a complete lack of understanding of what it means to serve and the sacrifices all military members, and their families, make. Considering how little respect the new Secretary has for the fundamentals of a free and open Democracy, regardless of how difficult it might make his job, makes me believe he would support these suggestions as he seems just another puppet of an administration who also has very little respect for military members and the job they do. I an very disappointed, but not entirely surprised, that a man with these credentials and opinions has been named VA Secretary. After listening to video, that was somehiw meant to reassure Vets, I convinced that he cannot be trusted.\nYou Are A Lying Simp — 1000 VA Workers Just Got Cut, from DOGE — Many of these workers are Veterans, but you choose to spit in all our faces.\nNow if we can just get medical care sooner then 3 months from making an appointment. I don’t know how anybody thinks the VA had gotten better cause it hasn’t\nUnfortunately, any complaint or comment that is attempting to elicit a response will more than likely fall on deaf ears:\n“The comments section is for opinions and feedback on this particular article; this is not a customer support channel. If you are looking for assistance, please visit Ask VA or call 1-800-698-2411. Please, never put personally identifiable information (SSAN, address, phone number, etc.) or protected health information into the form — it will be deleted for your protection.”\n[Editor: I’ve removed eight SSNs from comments just this morning alone.]\nThis is who you all voted for so shut up and deal with it! He told you all exactly what he was going to do but I guess because you’re white you thought you were exempt lol! We could’ve had Kamala!!!!\nI am the 92%!\nWhy are VA employees, including health care workers, being told they should find other employment? I have been getting great care at the VA, but am disturbed that DOGE/OMB/Trump/Musk sent every employee an e-mail telling them they should terminate their employment with the VA. Note, my niece is a VA pharmacist and got the e-mail encouraging her to leave. Healthcare workers are hard enough to recruit as it is, why encourage them to leave? Note, my general impression from my VA hospital is that the workers are paid less, but the work atmosphere is better: less pressure to bring in revenue.\nSo glad you’re in charge of the VA, the quality and customer service and response time has suffered over the last 4 years.\nMake this website more useable. This thing flies you all over the place except where you want to go!!!\nWith all due respect, Mr. Secretary, you are gravely mistaken about DOGE and their actions. I urge you not to mislead our nation’s veterans with false information. Take a closer look at the insidious activities DOGE and the mastermind behind it are orchestrating within the federal government. Our veterans deserve the truth, and something ominous is on the horizon for them.\nThe VA could save a lot of money by allowing veterans to opt out of appointment reminder notifications sent by mail. Personally rarely ever arrive prior to the appointment.\nDr. Hunter R Novak, AD2\nThank you Mr. Secretary. Those of us that use the system, know all too well the deficiencies that exist, and I suggest to you, please visit with veterans and hear us out. I also support the elimination of dei. It is rampant within the VA. Good luck to you sir, and visit Houston sometime soon.\nI don’t believe a word of it\nSecretary, you’ve been there a week and already the VA is doing better, processing claims faster. Do you think we’re stupid! You have a credibility issue! Are you firing staff, or is the unelected DOGE bypassing your authority? Operating so much better while DOGE does its work? Come on!\nRun the VA appropriately, leave your political bull out of it.\nI guess he thinks he can bull sh-t us. My disability rating claim is stuck at step 3 since August. But Doug can fire 1,000 hard working, tax paying VA employees and delivering faster than ever? Who does he think he’s kidding. This guy doesn’t have two functioning brain cells to rub together. He’s as clueless as the rest of this administration’s picks. If\nI’m lucky I’ll get to keep my current rating but I think these guys are going to try to screw us over. Remember his boss thinks soldiers are “Suckers” and “Losers”…\nNo, the “media” is not the problem. I’ll take good investigative journalism over the nonsense you just spewed any day. Your video message was so unprofessional it was like if you think your audience are a bunch of brainless knuckleheads who can’t think for themselves. We deserve much more respect than that. Try again.\nI claim has been on APPEAL FOR FIVE YEARS. I am still waiting, Can you please help me!!!!!\nTypical leadership-speak that happens before budgets are cut. The VA Secretary doesn’t control how much the VA receives, others do. Usually it’s Congress, but it seems to be DOGE now. In either case it’s 20-25 year old staffers, who lack meaningful experience, that do the detailed work. So, (all too many) cuts will be made in the wrong areas.\nBeing a “company man”, the VA Secretary ultimately will proclaim success, stating: waste was cut; money was saved; efficiencies were achieved; and service was improved. As evidenced by his video address, Secretary Collins knows this is how it will play out. But only the part about money being saved will be true. But don’t blame Doug Collins – he isn’t the one swinging the budget axe.\nMore bull sh-t from one of Trump’s inexperienced hired goons!\nI do not BELIEVE ANYTHING this administration says at all, musk and his vice president do nothing but lie and these spineless republicans do not even push back, when are they going to realize that they need to stand up to him ,he is not God or a god musk and his co-president are going to ruin this country we fought for our country that more than these 2 clowns can say!!!\nHow do I get a meeting with him. And can we get a X weekly town hall meeting\nSince we are accommodating everyone nowadays let’s award Desert Storm Veterans with a Purple Heart for combat. I mean the VA did acknowledge toxic exposures from this war by creating the PACT ACT. Let’s get the Purple Heart approved for those respiratory conditions caused by the Khamisiyah bunker explosion and release of sarin gases. Not to mention the chemical attacks by Saddam Hussein’s army or were those M8 alarms imaginary?\nWe need more wheel chairs at the VA hospital in Miami,that we can roll ourselves when we have several appointments the same day, because mobility transportation is too slow picking you up from your appointment and taking you to the next.\n2. All Veterans need full dental treatment. It’s a Shame, that because you are not 100% you can’t get it. You should help all Veterans regarding of your persentage.\nAre we supposed to believe this Trumper? The Trump administration is running on nothing but lies! Trumper said he would not touch Medicaid, now Congress is going to do cut it, and he approves it. Lies, Lies, Lies!\nHi,\nI recently requested a review of my 10% Disability, for. GI condition that has plagued me for over 50 years and I have been waiting for a determination. I was not aware that a reevaluation was even possible until recently, and it would be an enormous benefit to me, both mentally and financially as I am no longer able to work. Thank you for your time.\nHenry Thompson\nLets talk about what a scam the PACT Act is, I was denied despite having evidence and I know friends who are getting denied too.\nIraq 07 – waking up every morning to the smell of burning plastic and jet fuel.\nThey put you in charge because they know you have no courage or backbone – just another opportunist and yes man\nSecond attempt to post. I’m very suspicious of the video pronouncement. Anything coming from the current crop of “leaders” must be viewed with deep skepticism. There is clearly an attempt underway to further privatize VA Healthcare, and that is no surprise. The current administration is run by anti-human tyrants driven by one value: maximize wealth and concentrate power.\nI’ve only had excellent experiences with VA Health Care and the people are always extremely supportive and knowledgeable. When I ask VA Healthcare reps why VA healthcare is so much better than the (un)healthcare in the private sector, the answer is almost always the same: “At the VA, we care about people; in the private sector they care about making money.” Well, that obsession with making money, at the expense of the health of veterans is what they will try to bring more and more into VA Healthcare. Vets will be treated increasingly as disposable. Moves toward privatization started under Trump 1, and now under Trump 2, and the DOGE steamroller, they will roll over VA Health care. Vets better stand up soon to protect it, or it will be gone….\nThere is nothing efficient about this administration. Tired of hearing such MAGA nonsense. Give us a break, there is a rapist and wife abuser as the SECDEF who has nowhere near enough experience to run our military-he’s a Fox news host! That is beyond reprehensible-and that is who is leading our brothers and sisters still in service? What a slap in the face. That being said, I have no faith in any of you to take care of our veterans who are no longer serving, especially from a draft dodger Commander in Chief who was too cowardly to serve his country. Like everything the DOGE claims that is false and with zero proof, I doubt VA claims are being processed any quicker. You just fired 1,000 VA employees, most of them are veterans. Drop the lies….tired of an incompetent administration who cares nothing about the average American or Veteran.\namen brother!\nOh look, another status quo shill for our benevolent dictator.\nMr. Collins, I am a 74 year old Vietnam Marine Corps vet. I am 90 plus % with unemployability to 100% PT. I have a family of 5. They are all from the Philippines and are all legal with blue passports. I have a lot of friends who would love you to look at the matrix and our pay. My son from my first marriage is also as I am. 2003 to 2007 Marine and 100% by unemployability. He is 44 this year and cannot work.\nFor myself, I am under, I believe, poverty level. He is just above it. We will not be getting a raise with our President! Our raises aren’t even figured by what inflation truly is to US. Maybe you can figure out a way to at least increase the base pay for us.\nFor my son… He is moving to Thailand because social security says he can work!!!!! The government says he can’t. Maybe someone can fix the wording for Social Security or someone besides a DEI can look at his claim.\nSemper Fi\nSecretary Collins, thanks for posting this video. I hope Veterans will come to this site for VA news rather than be alarmed by the Lamestream Media. And thanks for serving our country, and Veterans well.\nDOGE, is not doing anything but wasting tax payers money. Stop falling for these lies. VA Secretary is not fighting for us he is going alone with them. They just laid off 1000 VA employees when the VA need more staff. This is BS.\nMany thanks for the quick clarification on our benefits. Hate to see guys and gals getting upset because of what has been said or inferred. We all know Trump’s way of thinking and he would not touch the benefits unless they were being taken advantaged or stolen.\nThis did not instill the trust and confidence I was hoping for from you, Mr. Secretary. You simply sounded like a Trump talking head pointing fingers and defending non-government employees. You have made it clear that if at any point the current administration says to drop veterans benefits you will bow the knee and roll over to their every whim. Very disappointing. You are absolutely not committed to us, the veterans. Grow a pair and stand for the veterans you serve, and not some childish billionaires.\nMy experience is first-hand and arises from my following up on the very unusual non-receipt of a reply to a message which I recently sent to one of my VA providers via the myhealth.va.gov messaging platform. I phoned and reached the doc’s RN, who apologized and explained that the doctor, who is additionally burdened as the department chair, was under intense stress and an unexpected extra workload because the arranged hiring of another physician for the department had been frozen. That turned the intended staffing plan, which had been inclusive of the new hire physician, on its ear and required major on-the-fly personnel assignment adjustments. Then a large group of nurses who had been working from home via their computers, since their jobs were done by phone and emailing with patients, were ordered to return to the hospital for no apparent reason, where there is no space for them! These kinds of created problems have no corollary benefits and are the opposite of improving patient care!\nWell done information, I was a recent inpatient for 8 days at the MKE VA, I found it interesting that 2 CNA staff talked while I was watching Fox news that the VA was going to have cuts ? Actually I knew better being a Retired Army member and not a Democrat voter !\nI didn’t watch the video, you lost me with your cowardly support of DOGE and its illegal activities. I don’t believe you for a second. Who doubts that your fearless leaders, cowards, liars and thieves all do not intend to cripple the VA and “drown it in a bathtub” with the rest of the Federal Government? I am offended that you think we are so blind and stupid as to believe these criminals are not going to hack away at the VA. Astonishing.\nAppreciate the information\nr/Al\nUSA/MSG(ret)\nlo que sea, donde sea, cuando sea\nWhat will people think once they find out how untruthful the current administration is with respect to what they’re actually doing; which is to undermine confidence in all government functions so the argument can then be made that privatization is the remedy to all of the made up problems that we’re currently hearing about. If that were to happen, how long do any of you reading this think it will take for those privatized and previously government functions to be raided, pillaged, and desecrated leaving all of us with nothing to show for our years of service and commitment? Better wake up.\nYeah, sure Jan. Benefits back to the veterans. Not likely, back to the wealthiest 1% and corporations. Shame on Musk and his adolescent henchmen as well as 47 for the illegal dismissal of the dedicated employees of the VA who were also likely veterans. I stand with you.\nPresident Trump made a great pick for Secretary for the VA in Doug Collins! I am very confident that Secretary Collins will fight for every Veteran in this great country of ours and Make The VA Great Again!!!!\nWhat I’m getting from between the lines is we’re gonna hear a lot more “that’s not service related” and more claim denials. Words are trash, we need to see results. We got enough lip service while serving. Show us actions and results or sit down and save the oxygen thieving.\nneither trump nor musk had the balls or the dedication to serve. if they mess with veterans that will start a very deadly civil war with men and women who are very good at combat. you do not want to f*** with these many millions of veterans most of whom believe in the 1st and 2nd amendments as highly important in protecting freedom. we the people will take our country back from felon trump–the worst embarrassment in our nation’s entire history.\nDoug, knock off the political bullsh-t; you are not a member of Congress anymore. I don’t expect to hear a partisan line of attack against the media. I will hold you accountable for ensuring there are no drastic cuts to the VA, aside from actual fraud and abuse. Not the cascade of misinformation coming from Doge. Do your f**g job and manage the VA to improve the range and quality of veteran services. I get sick to my stomach reading about the plights of some verterans in these comment.\nDoug Collins is a very honorable man. I feel very confident in his ability, integrity and work ethic. We all know you are dedicated and will give your best effort.\nMr. Collins,\nI have been fighting the VA disability benefits for 14 years. They do not recognize the Leukemia that I have and say it does not meet the qualifications that someone has set for Agent Orange. I have appealed the decision made by clerks not a doctor of oncology. I am on the Agent Orange registry two times but can’t get the full 100% disability check.I had to retire early from the Dallas Police department because of the Leukemia. It would be nice to have a doctor of oncology look at my records to make a professional opinion. I also have submitted a case of record that went to court and the Veteran was awarded the pension. We both have the same kind of Leukemia and he was given the benefit of having a compelling case.\nI’m a disabled veteran as the government knew the water that we were drinking,bathing and food that was contaminated with chemicals that the government knew. That water killed many and made veterans and families sick.. I for one spent 2 years at Camp Lejeune and have HEART issues and CANCER..I rely on my Veterans disability and medical insurance..I hope and pray the new administration that I voted in does not do anything stupid to our very loyal and dedicated veterans.. This seems like this administration cares about no one but themselves!!!\nPresident puts a freeze on federal hiring which includes the VA. – Then president removes the freeze on VA medical hires. +\nThen Musk fires all probationary hires-\nExplain to me Mr Secretary, how is firing all the new hires you just gave the green light to, plus all the probationary ( hires with less than a year already on the job) is improving veteran’s healthcare\nMy claim was received 2years and 6 months ago with no word or activity on my claim..I can’t believe that there are only 4 judges for over 400,000 claims..\nI Am over 75 years old..\nThe truth will surface about a year from now one way or the other. I live in Idaho and have to say the VA is much more responsive and efficient than the private sector health care. Please don’t mess with that.\nI find it hard to believe after over 50 years of the Vietnam War ended the Veterans are not being compensated financially for their services I attended a combat veterans counseling session I am Desert Storm/Shield combat veterans there were Vietnam Veterans attending also the reasons that I heard for these Veterans not being compusated properly is appalling you have to prove the chemical Agent Orange was sprayed in the area you served in that is unbelievable the military assigned you to fight in Vietnam and now over 50 years later I have to proved where I was in the jungle of a foreign country we need some Vietnam Veterans combat veterans working in the department for compensation to help assist in taking care of all Veterans all the opiates and the other mind altering drugs they are prescribing is not enough to help care for disabled veterans mental or physical disabilities we need help taking care of our own people here at home the good ole USA.\n2 of my va dr called me a lair. Saif I was faking my disability to gain money and benefits\nHelp me please. I have no one to help.me.\nPlus after 3 wifes 2 passed away Please help me President Trump our Commander in Chief\nThe minute king Donald say cut the VA cost and befits this guy will drop to his knees and say yes sir.\nCongratulations Mr. Secretary!\nThank you for your service.\nMay God watch over you in your new role with the VA.\nStrength and Honor!\nThank you sincerely,\nSRA Alan R. Boisvert\nWhy do we not get paid travel expense for driving to medical appointments? I had dozens of appointments over the past 3 years and have not got paid.\nPlease do not be intimidated by the draft-dodging Trump and his agenda that consists of revenge and retaliation. He is single-handedly jeopardizing our country’s democracy more than anyone else in our history. Dissing John McCain was the lowest of the low.\nSenators and Congressmen of the Republican Party are being forced to bow to his wishes simply because he has threatened them by having them be primaried. The VA has been very good to me and countless other vets, please continue to stand by us.\nPeter Haviland Army 11Bravo. C.I.B. MoPH\nHelp\nI am a Marine Corps veteran disabled discharged. Now 100% 7 years now.\nYet I need HELP. Please, until this gets to our President Trump.\n250 years OUR CORPS has protected the Commander in Chief.\nNow this (JOSHUA REMMERT) Marine needs the support of President Trump\nShare pls\nI have evidence that Strong Hold Health Care LLC has violations. I have recorded and actual conversation bribery. I have recorded of stealing veteran disability time and cash from these veterans\nI was almost killed in Beruit Lebanon peace keeping 200 plus Marines die and you deny my claims\nI filed for dependent benefit for my wife on August 24 , 2024 to date I have not received the benefit . I have checked with the appropriate office and have been advised that nothing was wrong with the app and that it was going through the system\nand the benefit would be paid retroactive to the application date. No one seems to know how long this process will take. How can I learn when this benefit will begin?\nI feel this is untrue in a sense. I have been waiting almost 3 years and my remanded claim is still sitting in the same place it was assigned to in December so I’d imagine another year.\nTypical Trump/Fascist propaganda\nI am concerned about co-pay on my percriptions I am disabled (10%) and on fixed income\nThanks for the reassurance.\nThe VA is one of our nations most caring and compassionate organizations and your leadership sounds like it will stay that way.\nGod bless you\nGod bless our president\nGod bless our nation\nNot true, you fear monger. President Trump said he is looking to expand veterans benefits. However, the fat needs trimmed almost everywhere, and if you’re going to spew lies, you might need to worry.\nI am a VA driver from Butler county.\nI take veterans to amd from VA hospitals.\nI was told because of the VA hiring freeze we could not add any more drivers. We are really short on drivers, being as of right now their are only three of us. Is this so?\nLet’s get our Vets off the streets & into some housing that’s been occupied by the Biden Admin illegal aliens, get them fed properly and training and job opportunities that were wasted on these illegals.\nAnswer me this, WHY IS THE VA SLASHING OVER $800 FROM MY TDIU PAYMENT PER MONTH?\nThe VA loves to see Veterans Homeless EH?\nI’m going to save this video so I can make a stitch of you responding to project 2025 and president Trump removing all of the benefits you’re lying about not being cut. I bet destroying the lives of 1000 probationary employees was right up there with “improving veteran care.” Less care givers = more care giving. Got it. Make it make sense.\nFirst let me apologize for many of the comments I have read below by misguided Vets. Next, thank you for answering the call to cooperate with the President and DOGE. I think our President had done a magnificent job correcting the horrid damage done by the prior administration.\nSteve Hall, SGT, 9th Inf. Division\nVietnam Vet 1968-69\nhow come VA employees were terminated by DOGE without a proper evaluation or notice.? DOGE terminated them without any idea how it would affect VA services. We vets are not stupid so quit feeding us incorrect information\ni like and trust i watch him for year he seem far and a GOD loveing man he will bb good for vet\nMr. Secretary,\nAs an Army veteran in NC, there is a big problem with community care program. You cannot get a phone call into the office. I have had to use my Congressman twice to get any help. I am looking forward to you getting the VA back to the Trump 1st term standards like Wilkie.\nHire more people so that our claims can get processed a little faster\nNo no DOGE is illegal dont trust them. It’s beyond unconstitutional we can do better\nATTN: US Troops in Kosovo on KFOR missions since 1999, much under OEF funding. The entire place burns everything 24/7 (there is no modern trash/sanitation system) and US troops serve on NATO FOBs downwind from KEK (Soviet Era dirty coal-fired Power Plant) – it looks and smells like Blade Runner 2049. I have the pics, DD-214 and lung nodules to prove it. YET, Kosovo is NOT on the PACT Act for Environmental Exposure List. Whisky Tango Foxtrot – VA? PS- I’m also one of the rare Vets who earned BOTH the MGIB and Ch33 Post 9/11. I got the letter saying “Congrats….you earned both, please wait for our next letter in ~ 22 month”. I’d like to re-start Edu ASAP …..please.\nThis video is nonsense! VA cannot possibly care for Veterans faster ,when you have allowed DOGE to cut the workforce so drastically, and so willy-nilly, with ZERO thought to the impact of those thoughtless cuts. Long term, expertly trained employees, many of them Veterans themselves, have been fired for alleged poor performance. RUBBISH!\nDoge never took the time to look at performance. They never took the time to look at responsibilities. They never took the time to look at the fact that VA employees are truly dedicated to Veterans, who have unique issues and concerns that require skilled and knowledgeable employees to address efficiently.\nDOGE representatives at VA cannot possibly be reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans, because DOGE is not qualified to do so. The folks who ARE qualified to do that for Veterans have been terminated, lied to, denigrated, and insulted. Doge is grabbing as much data as they can get their hands on, and nobody really knows what data they are grabbing, or what they will do with it now. And, that includes you!\nYour comment that you look forward to partnering with DOGE would indicate that you have been asked to do so. You haven’t!\nServices are not going to be better or faster with less employees present to doing what they know how to do best, while an unelected, un-vetted DOGE is determined to cut as much as they can, from wherever they can. DOGE makes these cuts, not to help taxpayers, but to funnel money into Elon Musk’s companies, assuring that taxpayer’s needs are not being addressed at all,. Nor are the needs of Veterans.\nIt comes down to this…you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. You also swore to support and defend our Nation’s Veterans. You can now either live up to your oaths, or fail entirely! Pick a spot!\nIf choosing the latter, you would not be alone. The vast majority of elected or appointed Republicans will be hanging their photos on the wall of shame, right next to yours, as Doge continues to be permitted to continue this chaos with no oversight, as our Veterans are abandoned, and Democracy is altered entirely.\nWhat you likely should not continue to do is to address us all with assurances that everything is A-Okay. You are honestly not in a position to provide those assurances. Nobody is.\nIn what state at they clearing cases, I have a case in DC, and file supplemental appeal that they broke into three case. There is no justice, nor when they claim an error in the case but the case remains or no change in decision dispite call center giving said information that there was an error. But I’m also sure no one cares or will fallow for more information.\nI’ve read that there will be a “means test” in 2026 using 2025 tax info. Any clarification on this would be great.\nI agree with Mike from 18 February 2025.\nLMAO like anyone is going to listen much less respond.\nThis is a propaganda piece/video. Anything coming from this Administration must be viewed with great suspicion. There is a goal of increasingly privatizing VA Health Care (already underway and pushed under the previous Trump Admin). I’ve had, up to now, only very positive experiences with the VA Healthcare and when I ask people at the VA healthcare facility why VA Healthcare is so much better than in the private sector the standard answer is: “We are here to help people; in private health care they are out to make money.” Those moneymakers are looking to loot VA Healthcare too. We must stand up and stop the privatization of VA Healthcare. The people in charge have anti-human values. They only value increases in their wealth and their power, and we veterans will suffer.\nHello Doug, my name is Sanders Cupac and I am a 72 year old Vietnam era veteran living in Thailand. I live off of my 994$ monthly social security payment and it was stopped in February for no reason. PLEASE help me. I LOVE TRUMP and the new transparency and stopping WASTE.\nPLEASE HELP ME, I am really hurting here.\nSecretary Collins, Make sure you direct them to PR. As a USVI resident and an old contractor for the Army, I see where efficiency can be easily had by using more LOCAL USVI Community Care providers (we have three Islands) and DME services. The Acting Director has stated he is addressing the discrimination he see between the PR VA and USVI Veterans and vendors. ex. The PR VA will fly a contractor to USVI to install a wheelchair tire or deliver a bedside hospital table.\nOr, they will fly the Veterans to PR to have a tooth cleaning instead of using the local Dentist that has been registered w/ OPTUM and every other similar contractor we’ve had in the past. I literally, had to fight tooth and nail to get VA community care employee to use a local dentist, pt or mental health provider for the Veteran I’m a Caregiver for instead of flying her back and forth to PR.\nYes, in the USVI we are lacking in Medical options, but the options we have are top notch, and maybe the VA should look at & take into consideration our high cost of living and give USVI community care providers an additional percentage over medicare allowance (out of the cost saving from airfare) to entice more local community care providers.\nOh hell since I’m asking for the moon, just build the USVI our own small VA hospital similar to the one we had in Alaska in the early 2000’s (just put it on St. Croix). Let me know when you’re going to do a site visit.\ndon peters II\nUSVI Veteran\n“Always out Front”\nI am an AF Vet. I utilize va community health care because I live far from any va health facility. Collins talks a good game. He’s allowing that idiot in the white house – I should BOTH idiots – Trump and Musk to get rid of va personnel that are needed to make sure va services are carried out correctly. I have to reapply yearly for my community care and EVERY year I have to jump through hoops to get it done. God help you if you don’t – I would have to pay the bills. This year is no exception. My end date is Feb 25 – I applied again in January and I still do not have confirmation on my renewal. This is just one example. These are not medical personnel but people that manage the ‘behind the healthcare’ paperwork and various other things that make the va work. BUT TRUMP HAS FIRED VETS – EVEN DISABLED VETS – FROM THE VA. You tell me how THAT helps veterans. What a load of horse hockey. You think the voters are buying this? Think again. D. Taylor\nMr Secretary: I forgot to mention the most important points.\nAs you know there is talk among members of Congress (your party) to change the requirements for\nservice-connected disability especially when it comes to PTSD. What is your personal position on\nthese proposed changes and your position as Secretary of the Veteran’s Administration?? Do you agree\nwith the congressmen’s comments that too many veterans are filing false claims and receiving benefits??\nMy position is that when ‘too many people’ are getting a benefit from the government in a particular program\nyou raise the requirements. Got an opinion??\nI am so happy Trump won. I am overjoyed that every DEI programs was cut. I hope DOGE takes a wrecking ball to every wasteful program that is ripping off the tax payer.\nThank you for the reassuring platitudes. Now, am I supposed to believe them? I suppose we’ll have to see but VAs history looks bleak. We, the veterans, have no real say and certainly no control over the services we are provided nor the quality of those services. As a medical professional, I can report they range from excellent – thanks to a dedicated, professional staff – to non-existent – thanks to a lack of funds that would make Mr. Musk proud.\nI have to say, in all honesty, that I do not trust you sir. I hope I’m mistaken. But, as the saying goes, “Money talks, BS walks.”\nAs an aside: The folks suffering the effects of the poisonous environment at Camp Lejeune will, I’m sure, receive the same timely assistance that those receiving assistance for Agent Orange poisoning: After they’re dead.\nWe’ve all been used and discarded.\nDear Secretary Collins, here in Rhode Island, we have concerns of cutbacks. Alost of rumors, to include a 91 year old Korean War Disabled Veteran being told he no longer will be assigned a primary provider, which has been responsible to prescribe his medications. As a veteran contributor for RINEWSTODAY.com I sent an email to Director Lawrence Connell, Providence VA Medical to address Rhode Island veterans concerns who have contacted me on benefit cuts due to termination of employees. More than 48 hours, and a response which only included attaching a VA press release, no response to how many employees terminated at providence VA Medical Center.\nIn addition, I also sent an inquiries to Senator Jack Reed (d) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (d), only to receive a response without answering the simple questions sent to Director Connell.\nIm asking for answers to the following:\nHow many VA Providence Medical Center employee were terminated and their positions( I review your list of exemptions, I see NO medical or benefits that would be impacted.\nHere is the mail sent to Connell, Reed, and Whitehouse ( only to be stonewalled on answers:\nGood Day Director,\nI hope all is well.\nFew question, about an article I am working on for publishing on Thursday for RINEWSTODAY\nQ1 Did any employees working at or for VA Providence Medical receive termination letters as part of recent 17,000 employees terminated?\nQ2 If yes, were you able to receive waivers for those employees; as you may be aware, VA Secretary Doug Collins statements waivers are allowed, and not one of the firings impact Veteran medical or benefits, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nQ3 Last week, according to a wife of a veteran at a private long tern care facility ( which the veteran is paying for), says last week she was told her 92 year husband primary care provider is no longer employed. She request a new one, to include an appointment. She was DENIED, VA advised he no longer was eligible for primary provider since the facility he is in has one. He still will be eligible to receive audio, prescriptions, etc…But will not be assigned a primary.\nWhat is the policy for a combat disable veteran living in a RI long term care facility—-are they still eligible for a VA provider, since they remain registered in VA Health care?\nHoping to have information no later than 5:00PM on Wednesday, for an article to be published as a feature in my weekly veteran column on RINEWSTODAY, which is published every Thursday.\nJohn A Cianci\nRINEWSTODAY\nVeteran contributor\nHow stupid do you think we are? 1,000 crisis hotline workers just got let go. This is all BS lip service. You’re a straight up liar.\nI am a Gulf War veteran and lost my hearing and I am considered clinically deaf but the VA pension program has determined that I am only 10 percent disabled. I receive a paltry $351 a month pension. I fear that The orange man and his sidekick, who have no problem lying to the public, would gladly take that from me at a moments notice. Anybody who associates themselves with those two men are liars by default. You can’t support someone who tells lies more than the truth, and not become complicit in those lies.\nIt is sad when “clergy” lie! Stop being partisan! Our media is doing what they are supposed to do. Report on the news. The REPUBLICAN controlled congress is saying that VA Benefits are on the chopping block! When you have to come back and “eat crow” by telling us that you were “wrong,” but probably not in another video, because you will not have the courage to do so, WHAT THEN?!? Trump said that he would not mess with medicare… oh wait, medicare cuts are being “doged” out too. Oh wait, wasn’t it said by some Republican Senators that no VA worker would lose their job? Yeah, tell that to the 1000 workers who were fired last week. Our social security is “safe” too, right?!!! Just stop lying! We veterans deserve more than “clergy” lying!!! All Veterans deserve a non-partisan VA Secretary looking out for all of our needs!!! #STOPTHELIES\nAnother liar from the Party of Trump. VA Health is already understaffed, and now, many staffers have been fired to satisfy Trump and Musk’s lust for chaos, injustice, cruelty, and to cut spending so that they can lower the corporate tax rate to 15% for themselves and other billionaires. Does that seem compatible with the lies Collins just spouted? Refer back to this video after they drop veterans in lower priority groups from VA healthcare, in line with Project 2025, you know, the plan that Trump denied any knowledge of. Russ Voight, who is helping to oversee the destruction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was the major architect of Project 2025 at the Heritage Foundation.\nThanks… And I’d like you to know that my local VA center here provides excellent care. I’m aware of Vought’s and Project 2025’s recommendations and I’m thankful for veteran’s organizations supporting the continuation of the services and benefits we currently have. I am still concerned at any attempts to split or divide veterans into new claimants versus old claimants or veterans receiving social security versus those not receiving social security. We all took oaths to serve our country knowing that we had no control over when or where we might be in harms way. We all deserve the same levels of care.\nPretty good video\nWe don’t believe you DOUG!\nI just went to the VA yesterday in Des Moines. They need staffing help and equipment. Please establish a hotline for us to call or chat with to keep things improving at our clinics. I have been miss diagnosed twice because of these things.\nIt would have been nice to be able to watch the video. Youtube won’t let me today unless I sign in so they can track me. I refuse to let them. So, anything you post using youtube will not reach people like me for a while at least. Youtube decides I need to sign in during time frames of their choosing for random lengths of time.\nSenator Collins, we have a huge problem with the VA in the Myrtle Beach area, myself and another veteran would love to sit down and discuss the issues with you\nsay what you want to say. ‘giving and improving services’ in your world means privatization.\nYour job is to continue this privatization program. Look at your background and your prior\nwork experience.\nThere are presently 40k unfilled positions at VA facilities. This is the hammer to use to\nsend to private doctors. Private doctors who have limited or no experience with veterans\nor veteran’s issues.\nDon’t play vets as fools, don’t bs us, tell us what you are really going to do.\nIt is disgraceful that they align yourself with DOGE and Project 2025 (which this administration is definitely following). DOGE has gained illegitimate access to everyone’s personal, professional, and financial data and we’re just supposed to accept that Elon Musk is going to police himself on conflicts of interest. Yeah right. What I would give to be a security personnel armed to the teeth at one of these locations. Musk and his fratboys would never make it to a single computer without going through an insanely extensive background check. I have veteran friends who have been waiting 2+ years on a background check and Musk just gets a green flag immediately? I call bull!.\nAs for the VA. I don’t have an issue with the healthcare I receive. Last year they extracted a tumor, and the wait time was almost nonexistent. Just had to do a number of tests beforehand that took some time. I tell my friends and family about the good care I receive, at what would essentially be socialized healthcare. Super scary, isn’t it? That healthcare would be funded by taxpayer dollars. That’s why republicans for many many years have tried to privatize the VA, which would turn it into a for-profit organization. You should be blocking every attempt to interfere with the VA unless it has to do with expanding resources or increasing funding. My local VA hospital is severely understaffed, and I live in a larger city. I can’t imagine how it must be to live in the countryside.\nMake no mistake, republicans are eager to defund the VA and turn it into profit for big pharma. Nothing scares them more than a citizen that has power over their own lives, and they want to take that power for themselves. Resist with all your might if you want the support of veterans!!\nDon’t look like a lot of NAM VETS here. Must be that we’re mostly gone and ones left are giving up.\nThat’s good to know I hope it’s true. Who is a supervisor to reach for Voc rehab. My husband school was not paid so now he’s not in school. Know one is answering emails. A phone number would be nice for Maryland\nlet us keep using ds login to access va.gov no need to make another login for va way to much work and 1 more thing to worry about as i go through during my cancer treatment\nPlease explain how loss of a thousand staffers will improve VA operations. Thanks.\nSir,you should do an investigation at the Austin VA clinic in texas.ive been going there for 32 years and it has gone to sh-t.they have mostly foreign doctors that are there for a check and don’t give a damn about your health.if I had the money I would go to a civilian doctor. thanks for your time.\nAny veteran who has ever had to deal with your entire inadequate and antiquated system for health, benefits, etc. will tell you just how BROKEN the VA has been for a very long time.\nNo intelligent veteran is going to believe the lip service you’re giving out. We’ve been buried in so much bureaucracy and red tape for so long that unless you actually back up your claims of positive change with some real action and results, you are just another politician who cares nothing about the brave men and women who have served this country.\nWe are human beings first and foremost, so start treating us as such. Look at the systems that you have in place and figure out how to run more efficiently. Ask yourself if the months and years it takes to process benefits, administrative changes, health requests, etc. would be acceptable to one of your loved ones. Would this be acceptable to you if you had no other options for healthcare? Would you take your wife or children to a VA facility? I won’t even take myself to VA healthcare, so I already know what your answer is.\nThe VA is like a sad, sad joke to veterans. It a shame that anyone who has served their country should be treated the way they are. You should be ashamed of what you’ve walked into and if you don’t do anything to clean up the mess, none of us will have any respect for you. We know when we’re being BS’d.\nAll you idiots in the comments want to blame this on Trump or Elon. You know damn well that the VA has been broken much much longer than that. So, Secretary Collins—in the event that you ever look at these comments, how about you earn your paycheck and show us Veterans some real results. Faster claims, faster appointments, update your systems… HELL, overhaul the whole damn system because it’s BROKEN. You wouldn’t run a normal business like this because it would have gone under a long time ago. FIX THIS BROKEN SYSTEM.\nSomeone mentioned contacting our congressmen. I highly suggest that we all do. It’s time for real change.\nRatings examiners are leaning on Contract C & P Examiners to give negative exams that will disqualify Veterans from establishing nexus for their conditions. C & P Examiners are conforming to the VBA’s desire to deny claims, which is trying to find fault and deny veterans’ claims. The Pact Act is not benefiting Vietnam Veterans.\nMy wife was in Balad Iraq and exposed to burn pits. She was denied on her initial claim so she asked for a higher review. The higher review said the VA made a mistake but it’s been over a year with no progress. It is not true that the VA is clearing claims quicker. She is incapacitated 15 days a month from migraine headaches a presumptive condition from burn pits. She was labeled as having tension headaches in the initial claim.\nThe voters elected draft dodging felon to be POTUS. The day after the election I asked my coworkers, “Do we have a new Commander in Chief or a new Dictator in Chief?” Not 1 person answered but the look in their eyes… PRICELESS! I cannot believe anything anyone says that works for this dude. Mr. Collins, please prove me wrong BUT, I have already had 2 appointments with my VA PMC cancelled. The first was scheduled for Feb 2025 and the follow in March 2025. I have not heard when they will be rescheduled. Do U have that problem?\nThank you for your comments and for clearing up the “RUMORS”! HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS OUR SECRETARY, thank you for serving.\nYou sir are a liar.\nIf there is anyone in government that I feel I can trust implicitly it’s Doug Collins… I believe he will put all of his efforts into improving services and working to ensure that Veterans get everything they have earned…As a 100% disabled Marine Vietnam Vet I am at the age where a lot of things need attention and being in the Central FL area I have had the best care anyone could want and I’m confident that the future will only get better…\nI believe President Trump and Sec Doug Collin’s. President Trump has always been put veterans first unlike Biden and Obama. And Sec Collin’s was\na straight shooter as a congressman. He is a good man.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!\nAll talk…How can he say they are clearing cases faster than ever in just a week. Another Trump Simpleton.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!!\nAnd thank you for all the VA does!!!\nYour mouth is moving so you’re obviously lying. No one in the administration should be trusted al all. In fact, expect the opposite from what’s said.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nI don’t have a comment, but I do have a question. Will Veterans have to choose which monthly check they want to keep receiving and their other compensation we receive be cut out completely?\nIf that is true, then you as sos and others are NOT doing what is best for Veterans. Firing employees at the Veterans Crisis Line is just plain evil, too. If you are not a Veteran then y’all don’t know and definitely don’t care what is important and needed for Veterans.\nThere cuttin . Just denied your claim\n“Doing what DOGE is supposed to be doing.” What exactly is that? Nobody in the Administration has publicly laid out who they are (personnel), what they are doing, who is in charge, and whether they are actually employees of the U.S. government.\nYou say that the VA is doing things quicker and better now than it was doing only 3 weeks ago. Pretty hard to believe that.\nFinally you close with an offer to “come to see me.” And just how is that supposed to work?\nWhat has been addressed by my Representatives in Congress is that VA Joint Compensation needs to be “looked at as a way to cut back on unnecessary spending.” This is not media fluff but from my Congressman.\n“Doug” are you going to fight for VA Joint Compensation or immediately do what you are told by the higher ups?\nYes you can contact me with follow-up comments.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nI am a 100% Disabled, United States Marine Corps, Desert Storm Veteran.\nYou speak so lovingly about DOGE, but who are DOGE, and what authority do they have to look at government (including VA) contracts?\nDOGE is not an official Department of the US government, as creation of Departments in the Federal Government can only be created by Congress, by law, according to the Constitution.\nDOGE is not a government contracted corporation, so how is it that they have Legal approval to enter government facilities, look at government contracts, look at private American Citizens information, stop actual government contracts and fire government employees? How is it that they can do all of this and more without Security Clearance or any other type of government background checks, or government contracts bidding?\nWhat gives you the right to forego the security requirements put in place to protect Veterans, and to just allow them to run through Veteran Administration data?\nYou say that DOGE is looking through VA contracts to find inefficiencies and that the VA is not getting it’s budget cut. First, isn’t that your job? Second, if that is true, then why are VA employees being fired?\nI request timely and truthful answers to these questions.\nI intend to gather fellow Veterans and sue you, DOGE, and the government and other heads of Departments of the Federal government, to get everything that DOGE is breaking, fixed, and to hold department heads accountable for allowing this to happen. I also intend to sue to have DOGE and it’s members, and it’s supposed leader, Elon Musk, brought up on criminal charges for likely violating a variety of laws involving:\n1) entering secured government facilities without the requisite approvals and security checks.\n2) illegally withholding funds provided by Congress.\n3) illegally accessing the private information of American Citizens, including those of Veterans.\n4) many other violations.\nThe American People, especially Veterans and Seniors, are Angry Mr. Secretary.\nInspite of your empty words, I know personally that cuts have already begun, and in all likelihood will continue to expand. Numerous employees and new hires at the Dept of VA have been removed or furloughed, including many veterans, as the government is one of the higgest employeers of vets.\nSupporting this regime causing needless unfounded destruction to our country based on lies and unsubstantiated claims needa to stop before we truly dont have a country anymore.\nAs a 100 percent service connected veteran. I’m concerned with the difficulties of seeing Dr’s in a timely manner. In Tennessee all i get are excuses. I can’t seem to get my medicine as I did in Alaska. I wish someone would contact myself so I can get honest positive results. I want to live. I did my part.\nSimple question: will he stand up and fight Trump and Musk if they try to cut Veterans benefits or be just another sycophant?\nHahahaha!!! No. No one believes you and it’s not as funny as my haha’s might suggest.\nYou’re a liar! Loyal only to your dear leader the president elon, I mean donny t.\nYou are and will continue to sell us out along with the rest of the United States.\nJust tell us the truth. I mean, why stop lying now? You have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.\nI’m sure you know and understand that our level of trust and confidence in our federal government is at an all-time low. I can only hope that your words in this message are true and that myself and other vets who have fought to preserve the Constitutional values of our country will not lose the benefits we have through the VA.\nWell one thing that needs improvement is benefits admin. They don’t seem to take the word of VA doctors regarding disabilities and instead contract out to outsiders who, no matter what VA doctors say, decide the disabilities don’t exist.\nThis would reduce outside contractors cost and better serve the veterans.\nMr. Collins, we are all for you and wish you a happy and productive tour.\nThis was a message from VA Secretary Collin’s to veterans addressing rumors about benefits cuts.\nHe succinctly stated there will be no cuts.\nYet some (obviously liberal) vets questioned his statement and went off on unrelated rants.\nIt embarrassing to witness such a lack of decorum from alleged vets who allegedly live this country.\nThank you DOGE for uncovering massive fraud—some likely at the VA—and thank you Secretary Collin’s for dispelling the rumors.\nHow about making the VA follow the law and allow us community care if we can’t get an appointment. Right now they are spitting in our face basically and not allowing it with like flat out NO if you request it. @!%^#@$#%\nYou’re cutting veterans out of the workforce? How does that help??????? Most vets are on a fixed income. I am glad II still have a job and extra insurance at age 64. This is a bunch of bull for our veterans!\nThis is all well and good. However, I will believe it when I see things change. I got out of the Air Force in November 1976 believing the VA was my Advocate. Being a Vietnam Era Veteran I know that is not the case. I am still fighting them. I fell and landed on my KNEES, they have called me a liar since the beginning because the doctor stated he was treating my right knee. I have had many surgeries since I got out. Almost all have been due to falls because of that Knee buckling. I have been honest and truthful the whole way. I cannot say that for the VA. I am at it again and see that I am at step 3 or 8. I figure that are going to delay until I am dead. They want us Vietnam ERA Vets to die and go away, and yet all we did was serve our Country while our Country spit in our faces. I will not be giving up until I am dead. Sadly The VA doesn’t really care. Mr Collins, let us see what you are doing, my Congressman never responded when I wrote him years ago.\nWe see what’s happening. Tread lightly.\nDoug, you sound like a used car salesman.\nI am a Veteran and a VA employee, and I am not buying what you seem to be trying to sell.\nWhen you start out your tenure by acting as if we at VA haven’t actually been working full speed ahead in order to serve Veterans, their survivors, and their caregivers, it shows that you do not understand how seriously we take our mission in performing the most noble job in the United States government.\nGet to know us. Get to know what we have been doing. Listen to us when we tell you what is or is not working, and what can work better. We know because we are the subject matter experts in what we do. We swore an oath because that is how much this job means to us. DOGE knows nothing about anything, and has loyalty to nobody, much less the American people.\nWe see you, Doug. I hope you’ll make the effort to see us, too.\nI have about 10+ remains in my file that’s been sitting there for years, I should be 100% but I’m not I’ve done everything in my power to get to 100% but for some reason or another and I don’t have an answer for this maybe you can answer my question why am I not not , at 100 percent::: Cancer survivor::: type two diabetes::: chronic kidney disease::: hypertension::: neuropathy::: exposure to ionizing radiation::: age range:::: And yet my file just sets there toxic water, Marine Corps base, Camp, Lejeune, kidney cancer::: kidney stones:::\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nMr. Secretary, Are you going to expand the act act to in clyde all exposures of toxic substances to include all of the the USA? Also anywhere in the European and Asia theater?\nMy claim was filed in 2020 and I am still waiting. All my evidence was submitted, I have already spoken with a judge and they are now just sitting on it and waiting. Years of waiting is not efficient and yet they are all still getting paid more than the average American to not help us vets. Do not even get me started on the horror show is supposed care at my local VA hospital. Those people would rather vets die than actually treat anyone.\nOn the campaign trail it was said that Project 25 was not in the plans for the government. And now we are seeing it coming into fruition.\nAnd the plans youre trying to ease our concerns about are in the CBO’s report.\nFrankly, I cannot trust that you will not push forward the agenda by the President’s Assistant to gut our government. You are lieing to us.\nUnfortunately this hold no weight. DOGE and President Trump have already fired hundreds in the VA including doctors and nurses. Appointments are getting canceled, services are not improving and can’t when you’re cutting staff. Trump said he wasn’t going to mess with Medicaid too, but now he’s all for gutting it as part of the latest bill put forth by the House. Project 2025 calls for privatization of services and reduction of disability and education benefits for veterans and that is the blueprint this administration is following.\nHow can I send you an email or contact you directly? My son who is an Army vet, is getting good service, but the VA Hospital in WPB, FL, 2 miles from the Presidents home in Mar a Lago is terrible. They treat staff like dirt and good doctors and staff leave. My son is suffering from PTSD and has been fighting the VA for 100% disability.\nYou don’t actually believe that load of horse manure do you? You can’t guarantee that VA services or benefits won’t be cut. Remember he hates the military and we are all suckers and losers. First time in my life that I’ve been embarrassed to be a disabled veteran.\nI am so happy that Doug Collins is the new VA Secretary. I am also so thankful that President Trump won the election. And most of all I am hoping that DOGE takes a wrecking ball to all the wasteful programs at the VA that take away from the mission to help Veterans. I think the DEI programs at VA were destructive and un American. I suspect that there are many more programs that are unnecessary. I also find it incredibly difficult to trust any therapist in a group setting or one on one that supports the delusion of a Veteran that thinks they are transgender. I think it is a crime to support the decision of a Veteran to “change” their gender. It was very hard for me to sit in a therapy session and be told to believe that a man is really a woman. How did that happen at the VA? I hope it ends.\nCan you address the gaining movement that President Trump is aware of to afford disabled veterans of a certain or higher disability percentage an exemption to federal income tax?\nI need immediate help with my va home loan. I’m being railroaded by the mortgage company even though I was under fema protection. I have called my senator and congressman in FL. I received letter stating they can only ask VA they can not influence even though we have been wronged. Please I tried to find your email address after you were confirmed but it just had your name no picture yet. Please help us. 22 years 3 wars 70 years old. Disabled veteran who filed for disability in 2019 and still waiting on it to get.off the administration desk. I’m totally deaf . My hearing loss was from working on aircraft and high frequency radiation same reason I could never have children but that’s only worth 10%.\nThank You Secretary Collins, Great to hear the truth as I truly believe with President Trump in Charge we will get that .Plus giving the VA What they need. Good luck GOD BLESS You and Yours ???Rev.Joe\nDear Sir, as a disabled combat veteran and a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America I do not believe you or the current administration when you say write this drivel. The Trump administration has made it clear that the VA will be targeted for reductions, and having many appointments every month for my disabilities I have heard from people within the VA of what is going on, that good people are being let go, and that more is to come. We had a saying in Army Special Operations, “don’t piss down my back and tell me it’s raining”. We know better, deserve better, and don’t believe words, only actions. We’ll see, I’ll check back in next year and we can really see what is going to happen.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECK A RASE IN OUR RETIRED PAYMENTS IT HAS BEEN SEVERL YEARS SINCE THEMILATERY HAS RECEIVE A PAY RASEL, EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP EXCEPT OUR PAY,\n. RESPECFULY\nRET. MSGT C, A.OLESKI L\nCONTACT E MAIL [redacted]\nDouglas Allen Collins is a lawyer, politician, and reserve chaplain. In the late 1980s, Collins served two years in the US Navy as a chaplain. After the September 11 attacks, Collins joined the USAF Reserve Command, where he presently serves as a chaplain (Colonel). As a member of the 94th Airlift Wing at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, he was deployed to Balad Air Base for five months in 2008 during the Iraq War. He is a member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the U.S. representative for Georgia’s 9th congressional district from 2013 to 2021 and in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He lost his bid for the senate. He finished third.\nHe is a “shoe clerk”, FOBBIT & RE-F.\nTrump & Musk didn’t serve. And I can’t believe any vet supported or supports them.\nHello Mr. Collins,\nWell, you said come see you if I have issues. So here I am. I have a few and no I’m not going to Ask VA on your website. I’ve been there and done that. It’s no help because it limits you to issues it’s willing to help with. Never the issues we Vets really want help with. I won’t get into them here, but if you’re serious about helping. I’d like to mail you a letter or send you an email detailing them.\nThank you,\nDan\nSounds like you’re trying to keep YOUR job! Are you willing to bet nothing is going to be cut at the VA? Please contact me on how much you are willing to wager.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nWhat is taking so long to get back pay. It was submitted Nov ‘23 and authorized Oct ‘24 and till today still waiting on the VA to audit my back pay.\nMr. “I been here for about a week,” this statement of assurance is hard to believe. Media spin is one of the most infectious hallmarks of our current Executive admisistration. It appears you’ve also caught the sick.\nI hear no cuts then I hear find things to get rid of! That means cuts of some kind, $, programs, Doctors, privileges. There has already been cuts! Can’t trust my own Gov SMH. I served to honor my country with excellent work that keeps America free. In a month this duely paid for Government has separated the U.S. not uniting the U.S.\nGreat, I thank you for shar5ing this video\nKeep up the good work!\nWhat about the fact that ALL hiring is suspended for the next four months? What about critical VA positions that need to be filled to support Veterans in getting their benefits? What about the fact that all new hires who were on probationary status – yes, even those new hires in the VA – have been fired? What about the critical positions that they filled? The equation is clear – cutting positions equals fewer services. It’s been a slash and burn with no strategic thinking or management since January 21, 2025.\nI’m glad to see that the VA will still be able to meet our needs. Hearing aids are critical for a lot of us, we can hear our children talking, laughing and our spouses no longer have to raise their voice. It may seem trivial to others but it means the world to us to hear clearly.\nWords are cheap — let’s see what actions are taken. How secure is our personal and medical information once it’s shared with the kids from DOGE (probably none of whom ever served the people of the US or are veterans) whose loyalty seem to be to one man, who never served, and not to veterans or our country!\nYou’re a liar! Right now the cuts that have been proposed are going to take away the call centers for VA prescriptions. You’re going to set us back 20 years. Stop lying it’s so easy to fact check you.\nI’m sure there’s nothing to worry about here. It’s not like trump just replaced the VA secretary with a talking head who claims that there’s nothing insidious about a billionaire and his team making tax cuts within the US government. Don’t worry guys, everything’s ok because trumps talking heads say so, nothing to worry about!\nGiven that the current director is a Trump appointee, I have little fairh that the benefits I was promised will not be cut further. I am sure I speak for a large percentage of veterans when I say that I will believe it when I see it. Pres Musk and his sidekick, Trump have made their opinions on the military and veterans crystal clear; that they view us all as “suckers and losers”. Secretary, I want to believe you. However, the history speaks much louder than the “thoughts and prayers” speech.\nI have had 2 cases initial file 2017 – NOD Sept 2020 on docket Hearing July 2024 – still waiting to be sent to a Judge. Almost 8 yrs so far going through the system. Cannot find out how many cases are in front of me cannot see any indication how long it may take. All I hear is it will be awhile just be patient. Not sure about rest of veterans waiting to get their cases resolved but I am beyond “not” impressed .\nJust tired of the lip service.\nI would like to talk to someone about the\ncurrent problems in getting agent orange\nBenefits. It takes 2 years to get paperwork processed. To do this I had to hire an attorney who got 20 percent off top. Not all my paperwork was submitted at the same time I have been told I have to wait\nanother 2 years for the balance. I thought I paid all of this in 1968-69 in Vietnam.\nWhy don’t I believe you, Doug? What records are the DOGEies looking at? Are they looking at my service and medical records? Are they looking at my disability compensation?\nIf Trump/Musk plan DoD cuts why wouldn’t they cut veterans benefits? I just don’t trust them at all.\nI’m not worried about our benefits being cut or revamped. But I do have a problem, back in 2016 I was separated from Service because of Budget cuts. So when I was processing out, I received a check for my services of 26 yrs. I thought okay this is good since it stated that on my DD-214 that I was to receive it and nothing else was said or mentioned. Well when I went in to start the process of my disabilities from service, so when things were all graded and I was told what I would receive. Only after that I pay back the separation pay first. I was told that I never should have taken the separation pay. I was never told that in the beginning. So with that being said is that I should be able to receive that separation pay back.\nThank you sir ?? would it be possible to further assist with dental care for veterans that need dental help but can’t get it ? Living with dental pain is hard.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nWow. That was not biased AT ALL. I do not trust anything he said. Neither should you.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nYou’re going to do more, yet 1000 staffers were cut…I can do the math.\nDont send me this trump propaganda again!\nBullsh-t. Bullsh-t with a ” folksy drawl” is still bullshi-.\nSounds like a whole lotta my Republican fellow disabled vet friends are having some justifiable Buyer’s Remorse>\nWhy am I getting communication about Camp Lejeune when I’ve never been there. I just deleted them but they kept coming back.\n~7 years from start to finish to have 4 teeth implanted by the VA!! Pain clinic intern/student bends and lodges a computer controlled needle in my spine. VA sends me for an experimental surgery, effectively shortening my life span by no less than a decade. That is just a few examples of an endless list of how poor our care is. I have never had a good experience at the VA ! I’m no economic analyst but I fully believe our medical ” benefits” should become medical INSURANCE! The DOGE thing very well could save the country trillions by doing that. No buildings to buy, lease, upkeep etc. Reduced employees wages, and utility costs. Tons of savings from my point of view. I’m beyond disgusted with the fact we veterans sacrifice up to our lives for this country and we receive the worst healthcare this country has to offer. Rarely do we have a doctor for more than 1 1/2 years before a new one appears. no family doctor, no history, just a new face and start over at ground zero. Yes now all these colleges would lose the guinea pig practicing on the veterans to earn their degrees yet I thought this was for veterans not for colleges to train students on us. We veterans deserve insurance not medical “benefits” that don’t benefit us and guarantees us the worst healthcare we can get. Am I wrong or do we not deserve to have our own doctors that we and our family members build history and rapport with? Give us insurance instead of the word benefit, which truly means if we want professional healthcare, it will be paid for out of our pockets.\nWell, the VA is as full of bureaucracy and process that weigh down the VA from getting his/her benefits. They also have process that don’t make sense to get a referral that even the referral doctors at both ends don’t understand. They also have a system that doesn’t keep the Veterans involved and aware of the process of approving referrals aka request for services, that the vet has to keep calling and trying to find out where their request is and what is the issue, instead of an automated system that helps keep all involved in every step of the process. This avoids wasted time on both the Vet and customer service rep that doesn’t usually have the info, they are just a middleman/woman. Approving procedures, test, labs and consult in the community care process is very cumbersome on all involved (Community provider, the ancillary services, the specialist, and the Vet.\nMaking these processes more efficient would save money, time and headache for the VA, Vet and taxpayer.\nI’d like to know where the data is that Elon Musk and his team of unauthorized individuals took. Elon Musk has not been authorized by Congress nor the Senate but somehow has access to our records either directly through the VA or through the treasury which ties into the VA documents. I’d like to know what happened to my personal documents and I’ve a right to ask under The 1974 privacy act.\nWhat are you doing to protect veterans?\nWhat is the current status of my personal data and records?\nWhat is being done so that an individual who is not a naturalized citizen nor authorized by Congress or Senate will not have access to them in the future?\nWhy has the VA not put out messaging that says our data is safe and not in the hands of a third-party? Is it because it actually is in the hands of Elon Musk where they should not be.\nWhat has the VA done to make sure that there was proper vetting?\nAs you can see, I have lots of questions\nSince trump made the comment when visiting the allied cemetery in Normandy, about the soldiers buried there, I have been mad every time I think about HIS comment, ” THEY WERE FOOLS AND SUCKERS”. He BOUGHT his way out of Viet Nam. I did not and neither did the 53, 281 men and women who died there.\nGreat to hear. Maybe we can get a raise on out travel reimbursement.\nThen Why is my VA primary doctor after I lost my job my car my private health care telling me I am not paralyzed and the VA is not doing anything for me and to loose weight and good luck after I just lost everything!!! Good riddance in my book ????????????✊\nHallelujah! Information we can trust!\nPlease fix TriCare\nI trust flying on an airplane right now more than I trust your word. You’re a political appointee working for a serial liar who changes his mind daily and has no problem throwing you under the bus. Thank you for the reassurance, though, bud.\nAnyone who has to defend Trump and Musk is not an honest person. Mr. Collins is a politician who will say anything to stay in good grace with our first elected felon CINC. Disgraceful time for Americans.\n“DOGE” representatives at VA are neither qualified for forensic auditing, nor are their actions acceptable on any normal basis. As for the threat to veterans’ benefits, I don’t take the word of any Trump appointee any more than I would the word of Trump itself. Nor can you improve services by firing people wholesale. 1st thing I saw at the local facility Tuesday morning was a filthy bathroom, which probably used to be cleaned by a probationary janitor that was fired. I asked staff, and yes, probationary employees have been fired. I don’t know how many. “Improving services” is a LIE. “VA employees are reporting effects that include closures of operating rooms, reductions in the number of available intensive care unit beds, and cuts to inpatient mental health facilities. You’ve gutted the SUICIDE CRISIS LINE! If you have any self-respect you’ll resign.\nhttps://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/19/va-crisis-line-employees-among-those-fired-amid-federal-workforce-purge.html\nA GREAT choice for this position!!!\nOh wow, the new VA secretary is totally looking out for veterans—by gutting the workforce that actually processes their claims. Nothing says ‘supporting veterans’ like firing thousands of them and pretending that somehow speeds up their benefits. But don’t worry, folks! It’s all about ‘rooting out waste and abuse’—which, judging by the layoffs, apparently means veterans themselves. What a pathetic, bootlicking stoolie. You’re not streamlining anything, you’re just setting the stage for even longer wait times and more bureaucratic nightmares. Absolute disgrace.\nVets need a resource for issues and damages caused by VA providers, where the managers and chiefs cant protect them. That includes a way to get falsified medical records changed.\nMaybe, just maybe, the VA will finally approve benefits for my husband. He served in Vietnam and many years later was diagnosed with Cancer in his sinuses that grew and pushed up to his brain. He suffered severe nose bleeds and headaches so horrible he couldn’t even sleep. When we applied for benefits to help my husband, he was denied because the VA said we couldn’t prove it was due to Agent Orange and his type of Cancer was not on the “list” of covered Cancers associated with Agent Orange! Even though the doctor (ENT) stated it was most likely the cause of his Cancer, but how the hell does one prove that? The VA did tell him though, that if he was ever diagnosed with Type II diabetes, he would qualify for full benefits! The ONLY thing they approved him for was a cheap set of hearing aids. He lost his hearing and his teeth due to the Cancer treatments, but the VA still wouldn’t cover the costs of any of his treatments. Thank goodness we both had jobs that helped cover most of his treatments, but the VA definitely turned their backs on my husband.\nI don’t believe one word from a Trump appointee. I know damn well, that Trump/Musk want to cut everything possible to fund more tax cuts for the poor billionaires. I absolutely believe General Kelley and General Milley, that Trump thinks Veterans are suckers and losers. I remember everything Trump said about John McCain. So, how long before our medical care gets privatized? It’s a GOP dream come true. I get great care from the VA, as it is now, and I can tell you story after story about when the VA outsourced scheduling after the Phoenix VA scandal; I couldn’t get tests done, because the private company didn’t do their job.\nIt took 2 whole years after the awful private insurance company bowed out, for the VA to catch up on unscheduled appointments. My 2 ratings equal 100%, so of course I receive 80% disability. How long until these DOGE people come after it? I don’t believe that they don’t have access to our private information. How would you know? Musk has locked everyone out. There is zero oversight of DOGE.\nIf you believe anything they say, then I’ve got land in FL for you.\nAnd if you voted for that you are getting exactly what you deserve so stop whining.\nA couple of comments:\n1. I saw a report on CNN two days ago about a 10 year Marine Corps veteran who was working in a key administrative position in a VA clinic, cutting through red tape for patients, scheduling appointments, and ordering supplies, but was just fired. How is this suppossed to help veterans seeking or receiving care at this hospital. Who is taking over his duties? According to the Marine Corps vet, there was no time for a transition plan. If one expects the nurses and doctors to assume these duties, there is no doubt that access, availability, acceptability, continuity, cost-effectiveness, and quality of care will likely be adversely impacted.\n2. I am a 60 percent disabled vet and receive care in the community. I’m going on a month now waiting for VA Martinsburg to extend my community of care provider in endocrinology. Until this is accomplished, I can’t see the endocrinologist, nor order my insulin from the VA pharmacy. How many people were cut from the community of care offices?\nit’s too soon to tell, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, But I am incredibly skeptical with anything DOGE touches. I haven’t seen anything but wildly outlandish claims not backed by any substance and reflex actions taken without any understanding of the consequences. To be openly accepting of what they are doing before they’ve really done anything strikes me as disingenuous and dangerous.\nThank you for the informative message. The wait me and other veterans have endured is too long. Currently I have an appeal that I had a hearing in late October that was filed in 2019. Another Appeal was just awarded in November of last year. Waiting and going through the various hoops is frustrating to say the least! Thank you and please improve this process\nWhy in the world should we trust Doug Collins, noted Trump sycophant since 2016, to tell the truth? Trump thinks we are losers and suckers, he absolutely does not care about us.\nFellow Vets, do not listen to these mercenaries. CYA and guard your assets. They will absolutely cut our benefits if it benefits them.\nThank you so much for the video! This is why the “bad” extreme left media just needs to be shut down. They don’t know what to do with their narcissistic minds, so they keep putting out bad information. There is something seriously psychologically wrong with them. They are not listening to the millions of people to do what is right with common sense. Just a complete shame!!!\nAlso, for the Camp LeJeun cases. If you have an attorney, they wait until they have 500 cases or more and then go to court for the day. The attorney’s are taking 30, 40 and I have talked with some that are taking 50%. There should be some law on that one a senator should put a bill forth.\nAnyway, thank you Mr Collins\nThen why did I just get told by my primary care doctor that all of a sudden I’m not paralyzed and there is nothing the VA will do good luck and lose weight????\n???????\nAnd we’re supposed to believe maga? Yea, right. Magatards are famous for telling the truth and not for baiting and switching at all. Man, thank you so much for your assurance and for your unabashed integrity. We’ll see how the future goes but I have no faith in bad faith.\nFor all legal purposes, DOGE is not a legal Department and should not any business reviewing anything related to the American people.\nAs I recall, that’s what the Inspector General’s are for. Because no one wants to stand up to the person who occupies the WH, everyone has to suffer. The President continually lies to the American public and frankly, it’s embarrassing.\nThe American people deserve better and especially our military and veterans.\nWhy should we believe that our benefits are off the table? He would do and say anything to save himself.\nThank you Secretary Collins. As an Army veteran and supporter of President Trump, I know that President Trump is the best friend of we veterans and that you and him will do the right thing.\nI don’t care about the cuts maybe they should and maybe we’ll better service too many veterans died because of the va not helping them\nThe new VA Secretary is obviously an arse-kissing TRUMPTARD. Elon is not finding waste, he is simply cutting things he wants to cut in order to get himself (and his fellow billionaires) big tax cuts by screwing real Americans. Over 1000 VA workers have already been fired. So the idea that we are going to increase benefits and improve services is a complete lie. Our so-called president is a wartime Draft Dodger who calls veterans Losers and Suckers – and this is how he “honors” real heroes.\nAs a disabled veteran, it took a year and a half to get approved. I didn’t know the system and realized I left out hearing loss tinnitus and sleep apnea so I finally applied for these things and got approved for everything except for sleep apnea which makes no sense it’s all about money. And that took another year so now if I appeal, it’ll take another 200 days to get an answer from my appeal. I think they’re just hoping that we die so they don’t have to pay out. I hope you change my mind. Thank you.\nYou are saying this to keep your job knowing that any negativity about the President will put you on the chopping block. I do not have faith that this administration will protect our benefits as they are already following everything else in the Project 2025 manual. You cannot trust anything this administration says or does.\nAnd what is being done to protect veterans’ jobs in government service?\nAlthough the VA might be maintaining benefits for veterans, my wife was employed through the VR&E program with the VA, and fought hard through her probationary period with the VA. She only had a little over a month left to go and was cut despite outstanding performance reviews. Although I believe that there are individuals taking advantage of the federal employment system, a massive cut of just blanketing probationary employees was not the way to go.\nI don’t belive a single word that you said. You were appointed by Trump because you are loyal to him. You cannot be loyal to him and the country, including all of the Veterans you claim to represent. You represent an authoritarian regime that is trying to destroy our country and turn it over to Russia. My father and uncles fought facism in WWII but you are embracing it by being loyal to Trump. Trump and Musk have already fired over 1,000 VA employees, including doctors and nurses, but you don’t seem to care that our healthcare will suffer as a result. How is taking medical services away from us while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” How do we know that an unvetted billionaire or his unvetted teenagers haven’t already been at our medical records? After all, he’s aready received access to our Social Security numbers and tax information, so what’s to keep him from accessing our medical information and benefits? I know that you won’t, because you are loyal to Trump, which is why you were appointed. The plain and simple truth is that you cannot be trusted.\nYou are not telling the truth. Cuts will be made and the money will go to give tax cuts to the rich. You should be ashamed.\nI apologize, but, “Faster then ever?” I have had 2 claims in for almost 2 years… And another one in for 7 months, just to add my 18 yr old high school senior back on my dependent list, since he was taken off as soon as he turned 18…\nNot to mention, now my employer of 19 years, has recently made me fill out multiple questionnaires about my PTSD. Now I have been required to switch jobs and schedules within the Department !!! Hopefully whoever is in charge of the EEOC can make some appointments available within the time limits to file a charge for discrimination, but that doesn’t seem to be happening very quickly either. Although I WOULD NEVER, I’m really starting to understand why there are 22 a day that give up…\nThank you for the information,for the past four years the VA has been SILENT!!\nThank you, sir.\nI know the va has treated me great and will continue to do so my only concern is that it takes what seems to take forever to get paper work changed when you get a rating change just in my case I have been waiting for the va to add a dependent added sense July of 2024\nI hope its true you (Mr Collins) are here to help the Vet. Please, be honest with us the vets of the wonderful country\nThis bogus, of course doge is looking for CUTS going . All one needs to do is look at all the CUTS to varios federal agencies creating more danger for Country and devasting affect for families. Ask yourself why havrn’t programs paying the various contracts that Musk have with ANERICAN funding??\nI dunno man, the 1000+ layoffs at the VA that everyone is hearing about doesn’t give us a lot of confidence in what you’re saying. Frankly, no one, other than Trump and Musk can even say if VA benefits will be cut, because they are the ones in charge.\nThank you Secretary Collins for your reassurance that veterans benefits won’t be cut. It’s very difficult to understand why that would even be considered by our leadership. I am hopeful you will be successful ìn your thoughts for all veterans.\nI am a retired female Veteran. After reading most of these comments it saddens me that so many of us are waiting YEARS to get a reply concerning our disability claims. I ask you, why would anyone in their right mind ever consider joining any branch of service? We gave to our country and then the government just disregards us when we need help because of what we have experienced while serving our country.\nPresident Musk and his minion trump care NOTHING about the Veterans. He made that known when he called us, and I\nquote, “losers and suckers”\nI can tell you this, if anyone attempts to screw with our disability ratings you will have a war on your hands.\nThanks for tackling this mess at the VA. Ad a 100% disabled veteran I am willing to help out any way possible to get the VA back to a Premier agency. Sgt. Joseph Vary\nCollins is not being honest. They fired 1,000 employees. Just heard that they are rehiring 12 that were fired because they work on the Veteran crisis center.\nYou lost me at embedded subtitles. Back in the 80’s, TVs started including a button to turn on subtitles IF you want them. Online video sites like the one this is hosted on (YouTube) ran with that OPTIONAL subtitle button. And yet, so many places now force embed subtitles, completely eliminating people’s choice in favor of pandering to a subset of people who require or insist upon their ever presence. And yes I understand they help those with hearing issues or are in a loud workplace. That’s the target audience for the ON option of the subtitle button, give their freedom of choice back, and mine too. So no thanks, I will not watch your words dance in my peripheral vision while you speak. Write it in an article and save the bandwidth.\nAll you 2-4 year slackers can just relax. Stop bad mouthing our President and the efforts he is making to fix the damage the democrats have done. The cuts were long overdue to get rid of the lazy people at the VA that don’t want to do their fair share of the work. Once they get workers in those positions the care will improve. As a combat vet, I am embarrassed by some of the comments from the low life bad mouthing of the administration. Maybe that’s why you aren’t getting the care you think you deserve. Straighten up.\nThanks for giving the fact straight up. That’s how we like it\nAs a suggestion, I am a disabled veteran in Crawford county Pennsylvania, we got a new CBOC last year, just ten years after receiving a new one. When I asked about this I was told we will get another new one in ten more years, why? If upgrades are necessary, which I don’t really see any in this facility, but if they are, why not spend a quarter of the money improving the existing facility? How much could the VA save by doing this rather than constantly building new facilities? Use some of those savings to help improve the lives of vets decreasing medical costs, and thus creating even more savings? Just a thought\nANYBODY! that condones Trumps action is a LOSER! According to Trump, we, as Vets, are losers. This idiot, has to go.\nMr. Secretary, Trump and his minions have shown repeated disrespect to Veterans, both living and dead. For you to tell us that you envision no cuts to the VA programs, you are either a polyanna or you must be living in a cave. I look for them to cut some of the allowable meds, terminate the Community Care Program, to institute co-pays, and to make it more difficult for Vets to be granted disability. If I’m wrong, Mr. Secretary, I will apologize.\nThanks for that. I appreciate the “real” news straight from the source.\nUSA\nPlease respond to Sen. Warner’s and Sen. Kaine’s comments that veterans are the major work force in the federal government and will be the majority of those fired. Thank you.\nAs a retired Air Force vet with multiple VA claim denials, I’m so saddened and yet happy to see all the Vets on here posting their anger towards a department that is supposed to protect us and provide support.\nKnowing that my fellow veterans are angry and fed up with the current “administration” is a great first step and a group that can lead the way in clearing house. Please don’t lose momentum in this fight.\nYou don’t fire doctors, nurses, and hospital staff, thus causing appointments to be cancelled and ORs shutdown and then tell us it’s gonna be good. You are hurting us.\nI did not hear a denial that the CBO proposals are not going to be implemented. Paying for tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of veterans is just wrong! A folksy video that seemed devoid of facts is not convincing.\nSo thankful to have veterans in our family, that use the VA services. We go to Hines in IL….grate for good care there.\nI wouldn’t trust Doug Collins with the health car of a snail! He is an unqualified tRump appointee and his only loyalty is to tRump, not veterans!\nDisgusting. You’re a disgrace to the uniform, spreading these lies on behalf of a man who just today declared himself king. The veterans posting about DOGE illegally firing them aren’t fake, but you are. Again, you’re a disgrace and so is every other enabler of this budding dictatorship. Sic semper tyrannis.\nDid they cut the VR&E benefits during Biden Admin. I got declined twice, been out of work, asked for assistance a 3rd time, was put in VR&E Independent Living Services and they sent me all these little medical contraptions that don’t really help with big issues. Asked about ILS grants to modify bathroom and widen doorways and my VRC said they don’t have a contract with any Contractor to do that so I could not get help with that.\nI applied for VR&E employment education & training, but was put in ILS? I even asked if I could get help with starting my own small Veteran owned business since VRC opined to not send me to school, and got denied on that too. Just got letter from VRC that says 6 months into ILS now they closing VR&E ILS case. Will the new VA Secretary review recent VR&E program denials?\nI’ll just be sitting here for a couple years before anyone gives a response? Very used to that, months and years. This is why private health insurance is a better option, when someone can afford it, V.A. wait times are absolutely ridiculously too long. It’s a broken system, and a good reason to never let Congress promote nationwide government Healthcare, cause that means civilians would see how Vets die from service-connected issues while waiting to be seen by a V.A. doctor\nThe VA should not be giving credibility to DOGE. Transparency? Who’s in charge of Doge? Who are the employees of Doge? Where is their government contact and security clearance? Why don’t we have the names and faces of these people?\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors. Good Luck\nThanks to Sec. Collins for his support of all us Veterans\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors that are reviewing my claim. Good Luck\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say about not cutting veterans benefits. We already have a hard time getting appointments and they firing employees so how can we trust in this administration.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins ;\nThank you, Secretary Collins, for your message assuring us that our VA benefits are safe. While I did not believe the Democrat’s or the media’s claims to the contrary, your message confirms my belief in President Trump, the Republican party, and your support in America’s veterans.\nLouis W McClure\nVietnam Veteran\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say.\nIf DOGE is working on saving money, where are the forensic auditors, and why did they hire hackers?\nI want a REAL explanation of what’s going on without NONSENSE commentary about “media” or “mainstream media” bullcrap. Say it straight or I don’t care what you have to say.\nPlease look into VES, contract service, It is for the contractor to make a profit and have no way helping vets… They can make a appointment 30 days out, the vet has to live by a contractor’s schedule. Let’s make the VA about the Vet and not about a contractor making a profit.\nI’ve never seen a secretary veterans affairs sound like a snake oil salesman until now. WOW\nPlease allow dental care through the Care in the Community program. Dental insurance has limited coverage, minimal (50%) reimbursement and is very expensive (over $50 per month for Delta Dental). Allow veterans dignity and oral health via fillings, crowns, bridges and implants that can be provided by a local dentist. May God bless.\nThank you for the update Secretary Collins! I new you would do an excellent job! Can you cancel the new Gov ID program? It’s the same one the IRS uses and I don’t feel safe giving them that info. Besides the VA should take its own ID for me to log into my healthy vet to message my doc or order my meds.\nThe best way to stop this madness is to tell the men and women of the armed forces who volunteered and served honorably that they will not receive the VA benefits checks at the end of each month.\nAny way the docket can be moved along more readily for disability appeals? Retired in 2020 and still waiting.\nI have found VA Workers to be professional, kind. and hard working. Sometimes I am ashamed at the treatment they are given by other Veterans. While I did my duty to our country, It is you and the people serving under you we Vets need to thank “for your services” to us.\nIf you tie your performance and that of the agency to Trump and DOGE then you are immediately suspect\nWhat’s being done about appointments? I’ve been trying to get an appointment since September 2024 for my back pain and only get the run around when I call.\nThis guy is a bootlicking Trump syncophant. If you think for one second they’re not coming for your benefits you’re crazy.\nWhat about the VA employees that were fired? Most of them were veterans, I would appreciate it if you were hones and just stated the facts that Trump does not respect us. He has yet to apologize for stating that the CMH, id the same as the Presidential Medal Of Freedom\nWhen are you going to support the Service Dog Insurance Benefit? It’s time has come. Research proves the value of these special animals to veterans.\nWe all hope and pray that you are a man of your word. We have been wronged before.\nI want the real truth my husband has been gone going on 2 years I am trying to get his disability he was at 70% when he passed I guess they are wanting to wait and see if I pass away so they don’t have to deal with me I need help !\nWhat about my Health-E-Vet?\nHistorically, this President and his hand packed, unqualified stoogies, have a history of lying. Time will tell…same crap of blaming the media. The media so far has been correct on what they said a 2nd term of Trump would look like.\nAbsolutely thank you for clearing that up I’m a veteran receiving veteran benefits and it’s all I have think the good Lord and the government but this news is a bunch of bull crap so thank you for clearing that up and I appreciate everything you guys are doing thank you\nApparently, the VA is already cutting it’s own expenditures. I’ve had my classification and cut-off figure changed and for the second consecutive year, the VA is attempting to downgrade me to having to pay co-pays on my medications. With the meds I’m on, this would come to $400/month that would have to come out of my food budget, because that’s the only ‘budget’ we have. It seems that we manage to be just a few dollars over the adjusted cutoff every year. For over 20 years this has not been the case but now, with the budget shortfall, we’re suddenly being squeezed.\nIt has been two half years since the Camp Lejeune Pact Act was signed.I found\nout today my claim(lawsuit) will more than likely be the first of next year.I can not believe there are only four judges for 450,000 claims something needs to be done.All of these Veterans are waiting is the govt just waiting for them to die off?\nThe 10.8 million dollars of the Pact Act funds the higher up V.A. used for a raise 136 people I was told they did re coup 97% of the funds. Is there a new IG to contact?\nThey have no business being in any government computers. Is this the largest beach of data in US history.\nYou need to contact your congressional representatives and senators like I did. The problem with the PACT Act IRT Campaign LeJeune H2O contamination is it did little to set out the parameters for compensation. Whereas the VA established clear cut criteria for benefits and eligibility, the Dept of the Navy has not, and they are letting the courts establish those criteria. As you probably already know, this is going to take a long time, and frankly the evidence trail for people like my parents and myself who were exposed from the 50s to the 80s is ridiculously hard to come by. My dad already passed away. My mom’s in her 90s. Many like them, will pass on before these issues get resolved without additional legislation. Don’t wait on the VA.\nThe IGs have been fired\nNo! President Bone Spurs fired all the IGs. He wants free reign to disassemble democracy and not be accountable.\nThey being doing that for years. Why do you think Agent Orange took forever to be in lists for claimable things?\nThe money available is in the Billions, not millions. Payouts are anywhere from $25,000 to one million per veteran. I don’t know what determines the amount the veteran gets.\nI dont believe a damn word. Your wannabe orange king doesn’t give a damn about dead vets, hurt vets, captured vets… he said it himself.\nThe fact you even have to say anything about benefits is indication of bs.\nI agree 100% on them waiting on us to die. I’ve had my claim in since 1970 and can’t get anyone to do anything. Are they going to check on past claims? I certainly hope so!\nHate to burst your bubble but you need to know the truth. When Collins says they are clearing cases quickly, that means they are denying them. And then the appeals process begins. It’s been 10 years now for me with an 1151 case. (malpractice) You know what your case file looks like after several appeals (for bad info) looks like after a dozen of people have looked through your case and commented? You probably do if you’ve ever looked at the notes in your medical records after a visit. The amount of incorrect info is staggering. I haven’t given up but I’m assuming now this admin will deny it permanently. I doubt I live to see it. I pray all of you will eventually see positive results but it might be decades down the road, if ever under this administration. It absolutely is deny until death.\nI know it takes a great deal of time due to the fact that only 4 Judges hearing cases. I was finally approved after waiting more than a year. benefits were back dated and paid on when I filed. Once you are in the system it works great. I now have 100% of my health care taken care of at a VA facility and got a large lump sum settlement and my monthly tax free check is on my bank account on the 1 st of every month.\nIs there a way to contact your office directly with correspondence or is this the only 2 way communication?\nSir, will you ask Pres. Trump to please sign an Executive Order authorizing and directing the VA to finally recognize the harmful health effects from K2-Uzbekistan radiation as presumptive service-connected conditions? As you know, the serious issue of K2 radiation has remained unresolved now for over 23 years. Further, the 2022 PACT Act failed to adequately address K2 radiation. We, the disabled Veterans of K2 appreciate your and Pres Trump’s support in this critical healthcare matter Sir. We believe at this juncture that an Executive Order is the most appropriate and expedient means to finally address the K2 radiation issue. Thank you very much Sir for your time and consideration.\nI’m the spouse of a 100% service connected disable veteran that served 12 years and in the Persian Gulf War and they VA still has not added me as his dependant nor can I get my ChampVA until I’m recognized as his dependant. Who can I contact to help get this completed? I need medical insurance. It’s been almost 5 months!\nWhat I find disturbing is the constant praising of Trump and the dig at main stream media. That pretty much sums everything up. If it quacks like a duck… Say goodbye to your bennies, my fellow combat vets. This administration doesn’t care about us.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they guess the previous one..when they force good doctors to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they fired the previous one..when they force good doctors and nurses that brought the gap, to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nsomeone opened a can of worms. good luck\nCome on Mr Hochstetler, you know how this works. ONE way communication. You can try the Secretary’s hotline phone number, which goes right into an automated service and good luck to getting the right operator to connect you to the Secretary’s administrative assistant. Lots of SMOKE SCREEN and GASLIGHTING!\nWhen will the Camp LeJeune Case be funded? Many families have cases filed for years without any answers. Please make this a priority!\nThe Camp LeJeune funds are there. It is only four Judges hearing all of these cases.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nMany people support efforts to prevent fraud, but veterans with hiring preference working for the VA or other federal agencies—many with over 15 years of service—have been fired. These terminations were not due to poor performance, as claimed, but because they accepted promotions that placed them on a one-year probationary period. As a result, veterans who have sacrificed for their country are losing their jobs, despite the protections meant to support them. These actions are being taken without consideration of the long-term consequences.\nWhat? That’s stupid. I would almost bet that TRUMP don’t know that.\nI’m also concerned about the Camp Lejeune litigation. Delayed justice is denied justice. We deserve justice.\nI am so glad that we finally have a person with our best interest in mind. I’m looking forward new and improved VA and I know all my fellow veterans are too . Thank you Mr Collins .\nDo you know if Trump is committed to assisting more Veterans that have been convicted of felonies since he is also a convicted felon? Can federal employees now also be convicted felons?\nYeah, how about the transparency of firing veterans with double digit years of federal service just because Musk said do it. Is that helping your veterans who happen to be employees too? Stand up for your workforce Sec Collins. I fought for my country and a South African billionaire is making these decisions. So much for my exemplary 18 plus years of federal service with the VA.\nSincerely,\nDisappointed, unemployed disabled vet.\nNuts, as a famous general once said.\nNuts. How many VA staff have been cut?\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nI agreee with you one million percent!!! Thank you!\nEnough with the LGBTQ. Get out of here with that nonsense!\nOur Vet money and efficiency has nothing to do with displaying who you have sex with! we just need to focus on real issues not displaying our sexual preferences to all to see.\nHell yes.\n10/10\nWould protect above commenter in prison.\nTruth’s are better said than lies. With the transgender operations, constant medical attention, Mrs Cross are you going to pay for that medical expenses bill? In the military, at many commands, never cared who was gay, bi, lesbian, during the late 80’s. Don’t ask don’t tell, was a good idea. I do understand about marriage, same rights as a heterosexual would. Why, maybe you can answer this question. Why does the LGBT+ community have to advertise what is done behind their bedroom doors?\nThank you!\nRetired Navy Submariner. Heterosexual. I have a cousin who is gay n married, whom Since being my cousin with a tight knit family( aunts, uncles, cousins from both sides of my parents families.\nThey’re not going to fly my flag, why should they yours?\nWe don’t need to single out people for what goes on in their personal life.\nThe American Ensign and POW flags are the only flags that needs to be flown.\nThose two flags represent everybody.\nWhat about the firing of VA employees during their probationary period. Is this happening as we cut the government? How will this affect our care and services?\nAmen…I’m with you on this. All Veterans means all Veterans.\nLGBQTXYZ, get their recognition on Veterans Day just like the rest of us\nNobody cares about your sexual orientation (or anyone’s). Thank God President Trump (& Secretary Hegseth) has focused our military on doing the job of being a leathal fighting force – not some social engineering experiment on queers.\nLol mental illness\nExactly this. Thank you for saying it so clearly.\nCry me a river ! If you full inclusion why the Hell do you feel that you need a “SPECIAL” LGBTG PREVENTION NUMBER ???Use what all the rest of us use !\nThis is about veterans. Not your lifestyle preferences. You get as much respect as anyone else. Deal with it.\nNo person of sound, rational mind truthfully gives a s*it about the LGBTQ “family.” Have those persons nothing greater to celebrate in their lives than their sexual preferences? If that be the case, what a meaningless, unproductive life they live. Have they accomplished NOTHING greater than deciding who they decide to share orgasm’s with? The entire LGBTQ scene is a disgrace to humanity for celebrating a personal preference that absolutely NO ONE cares about. GMAFB, ms. cross. Bravo Zulu for getting rid of that disgraceful pride flag.\nThank you Mr. Collins for fighting for our right as veterans. We, the one that serve are very grateful to know that the benefits for the veterans are not going to be affected by this new presidential changes. A lots of us depend on the veteran’s benefits.\nThat sounds like fake news. Trump won’t cut veterans benefits unless one of those entities is skimming money off the top. I hope he finds it if it’s there!\nMichelle, #1 Mr Vought and OMB are Cutting waste not Funding where it is needed. #2, I am a Gay man my self.\nI am for What the Standard Norm Was before DEI, the LBGTQAI+++ alphabet that all but ruined the Military with its Demands.

Thank you for having the COURAGE to post your comment. Retired US Navy CDR.\nThe only flags that should be displayed are the U.S. flag, Military branch flags and the P.O.W. flag. No need for anything else.\nThe American flag represents them just like the rest of us veterans. Did these veterans fight for our country under the gay pride flag or the American flag? When I was in Vietnam I fought under the American flag.\nYou are a liar, there are no cuts.\nDear Mr. Secratary\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nMichael S Jordahl\nUSA, SFC Ret\nOver one thousand VA probationary employees were fired in the last week as part of DOGE ruining everything we have.\nDon’t sit there any say nothing is being cut. Cutting the workforce is harming veterans.\nAgree..many veterans concerned about means test & 30% getting eliminated. We all followed orders and have the scars visible or not. Contrary to popular opinion, VA disability is NOT an entitlement program.\nI’ve been trying to find more info about the means test. From what I understand capital gains could be counted as income. So if a vet bought stock and wanted to sell it to pay off a house or buy a fancy new car it could actually cancel their benefits! If the means test comes true they could use 2025 tax info.\nMilitary.com is owned and operated by Gannett. The same people who operate USAToday. They may have military in the name but they are no more reliable than USAToday. I would take anything there with a grain of salt. And if someone is appealing to my sense of fear? They are probably trying to con me.\nHard pass.\nDon’t believe you.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nInspectors General are how you root out fraud, waste, and abuse, not by having people with no concept of how the government works take a hammer to things they don’t understand. Audits are done with forensic accountants and subject matter experts. Elon has a bunch of JR tech bros, one of which was fired from a previous job for giving away company secrets. Btw, Trump fired all the IGs.\nI wish I could shake your hand. That was the best way to say what all us vets are thinking as I sit in a hospital bed right now due to my injuries.\nI think they should cut it all including the Vet benefits THIS IS WHAT WAS VOTED FOR! so let’s see it through.\nDo let us know how that goes. I expect him to swoop in at any time since he really will need your vote again.\nYou haven’t been paying attention: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nYou’re getting exactly what you voted for, and we tried to warn all of you this would happen. Congrats. You voted against yourselves.\nFine words – but why all the layoffs? Don’t be too surprised when they try to privatize the VA.\nSo, it’s ok for others’ income to be affected. Just not yours. Maybe they served their country honorably as well.\nIf you think DOGE is doing an excellent job then you shouldn’t be surprised when DOGE finds a lot of fraud at the VA that results in reduced or suspended payments, or worse, for veterans like yourself. DOGE has successfully eliminated programs and employees we once thought were indispensable. They’ve already fired 1000+ VA employees. They will be heading to the VBA with the same intent.\nThey need to revamp the disability requirements. Too much glorified welfare. It should be LOD only.\nYou need to send your letter (comment) to your senators and house rep. The head of the VA doesn’t vote on bills. That’s congress’s job.\nYou deserve to be cut off if you think they’re doing a “wonderful job.”\nSo veterans being fired in huge numbers from federal employment is fine because it doesn’t directly affect you?\nThese firings includes nurses and people at the veteran’s crisis hotline, which will affect vets using VA Health Care facilities and those suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues. We either care about vets or we don’t – it shouldn’t matter how it affects us individually.\nCollins is just another suck-up, yes man for Trump.\nYou support Trump and DOGE yet fear having your benefits cut. Get real man. It is your support of these guys that will enable the cuts.\nWow! Our personal information is at risk of being exposed to hostile actors, DOGE is, was, and continues to be a front used to create mistrust in our government agencies, and hard working ‘Mericans are losing their jobs as part of a failed attempt to balance a budget consistently and historically ruined by the GOP…and still there are those that support this type of nonsense. Except when it applies to them. Let’s see who continues to support what, as access to all of our traditional social services are slashed or elimated so those pesky tax cuts don’t expire.\nI’m with you my brother!\nAmen! My husband is a 100% Disabled USMC Vietnam Veteran. He’s been on the poisoned water national list since about 2007. He was told back then if there ever would be money, he would be entitled. When the lawsuit started, we contacted our present attorney. They know how long he’s been on this list.\nWow. Then you just care about your benefits and nothing else Trump and Musk are doing to destroy this country from within?\nElections have consequences, I’ll have to accept what comes with it.\nYes you want the cuts…but not to anything that will affect you. As a disabled vet I also do not, but you somehow think that as long as it does not affect you, its okay to cut them. Im sorry that you lack compassion and empathy for others….which is what the men in charge suffer from as well. You do not think that others losing their jobs are facing catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Shame on you. The man in charge will not be reading your comment….he has better things to do than care for veterans.\nHow is DOGE doing a good job? It’s not even an official federal agency. They are terminating essential workers on false pretenses and claims, causing chaos, destruction, anxiety, and hardship on regular working class people. This entire administration is a coup and whoever they elect to oversee programs, including the VA, they are only minions who follow every unconstitutional law given to them and disregard ethical policies that were put in place only to overturn them and eventually cut standard benefits to veterans and civilians alike. It’s only a matter of time when they start looking at va disability benefits and the recipients who are receiving those benefits. They definitely have access to our personal data and healthcare records. They don’t care about veterans. And why would they, especially Musk!\nThe Sec Def. Has no vote on anything. When Trump and muskrat come for our disability, there is nothing Clins can or will do about it.\nConsider than less than 1% of payments were erroneous in the last 7 years according to the IG, DOGE isn’t doing a good job: it’s a farce to distract from their egregious behavior\nYes, I’m STILL fighting this battle. It is absurd the amount of crap we have to navigate through, wait over a year just to be told no, didn’t happen in the military. Then, it is up to us to hire a lawyer to help fight it. This whole process works against the veterans.\nthere is a concerted attempt to privatize VA Healthcare; the vipers want to convert it into private and for-profit un-healthcare of the sort that exists in the private sector. VA Healthcare in my expereince is far superior to the private system and for a simple reason: inside the VA Healthcare system people are there to help people and not to make profits. I’ve heard that comment from many physicians and nurses who have worked in both.\nMr. Collins doesn’t give a tinkers damn about veterans. He works for Musk and Fat Donnie the Fascist King. I expect that by 2027 the new American King aided by the NAFP, New American Fascist Party will have so decimated our system of government that even our military and those who have suffered and died will become meaningless. In my opinion Trump and Musk plan on dividing the world up three ways. China, Russia, and the U.S. will each control 1/3 of the globe. My question to Collins is WHAT THE HELL are you going to do about it?? Do you even care? Are you simply overseeing the dismantling of the Agency designated to provide care and assistance for those of us who served our Nation? I believe that you’re the chosen sucker. After your mission is complete you WILL be tossed aside like a box of garbage. You Sir are a fool. May God save your soul…..if you have one.\nGood Man ! ?\nHis lips are moving, he’s a republican, he lying while some unelected billionaire technocrat robs us all blind. Faster case fliw? That means they are denying us.\nDear Secretary Collins, I am amazed that veterans are being let go from the VA. I see many of those veteran types working at the VA hospital in Decatur Georgia and I would hate to see them lose their jobs because of some fanatical, cutting efforts by this administration. I hope you will take action to preserve, the opportunities that veterans have to serve other veterans in our VA facilities.\nI agree Captain. When I worked at a VAMC, I saw more non-vets who were a waste of a position. Their attitude was, “after my years probation I cant be fired”. Many non-vet employees live by that code at VAs.\nBeen bothering me also.\nIt is too late. They have fired all probationary employees with no reason with a note in their termination letter saying they were fired due to underperformance, and that is just the beginning unfortunately. They are also making cuts to Medicare which all tricare for life recipients ultimately transfer over to. Anyone who thinks this will not hurt veterans are not thinking clearly and assuming this guy is being honest will be severely disappointed.\nLiars, all of you. Letting are constitution fail while you watch.\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback. The same thing is going on in Florida, VA regional in West Palm Beach. Right in the PODUS’s Winter White House backyard. You would think King Trump and the Secretary would preserve these low paying jobs since it is already extremely difficult to recruit qualified personnel that understands the unique administrative, physical, mental, spiritual, and financial needs required by our military personnel. Just try to explain your situation to a civilian network provider. They just want their money for services!\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback.

What about our Democracy, and all those Vets, including my grandfather, who fought and died for it, against Fascism in WWII. Now you embrace it. After all of the lies that Republicans have told to me in my lifetime, I would not believe anything more that you ever have to say. I became a United States Marine and I am still a Patriot but You support Billionaires over someone like me. Money is your God. So far there has been zero benefit for my service but then I chose honor\nand principle over money. A love of my Nation. Unlike you. I don’t count on you helping any of us. There has been no Justice for the loss of my child at Camp Lejuene. No Justice for anything. I hope that you believe in a Just God, I do. Men like you are going to answer for all of it at Judgement. You still believe in your lies and have zero repentance, no change from your sins. Cuddle with a dictator for worldly wealth and status out of fear. Refuse to help the least of your brothers. Play God in your decisions. No better than those who murderered the Jews. No better than those who condemned Christ to death. No forgiveness from the Lord God. Unforgiven.\nYou are a clown ?. Crawl back to your Circus\nUnlike the ungrateful comments that support the previous missing in chief, i feel its wonderful that we are rooting out fraud and waste. Even if that means laying off VA employees. In fact, it would be cheaper to issus us a card accepted by outside doctors and hospitals for community care.\nWhat did the last 4 years of Biden get you? Go ahead I’ll wait.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nI served in the US Army and am a 100% disabled Veteran. This is the most heartfelt, brutally honest, beautiful way I have heard someone describe what the unabashed sledgehammering of our Constition, our Democracy, our lack of ethics and compassion is doing to the very fabric of our existence. I beg of you to share this beyond here. It needs to be read by the people. And if you don’t want to do it or remain anonymous, I would be honored, as one battle buddy to another, to share this with others.\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nYour left wing liberalism hate is showing. President Trump and Mr. Musk, no matter how much money they have, are trying to save America. Do you live in a cave? Have you not seen all the wast that they have found? If they don’t fix it. You want have to worry about the VA, America will be broke and there won’t be a VA. The U.S. Government now employees over 50% or the working population. We can’t have that. The government was NEVER suppose to be that large. The government should never employ more than 38% MAX. I suggest you crack a book and learn the truth and get off of CNN and MSNBC.\nHear, hear! I’m surprised that the censor allowed your comment. They’re blocking mine. They’re afraid of “dangerous” ideas being seen by other, like Orwell’s 1984. Thanks, Big Brother!\nWow, this country was founded as a constitutional republic and the democracy you speak of was formed within the republic to turn the country into a corporation. So I will ask you take the blinders off and do little more research. Both parties have failed this country and some of the rotten leadership have been in office for decades. But don’t take a word I say to heart I just ask you to do you due diligence and research. Not everyone is bad or has bad intentions, and if these people don’t do good for us then I will join you in the tinfoil hats brigade and vote in some new that will more then like replace and repeal all that being done this time around. But there is moving to another country. I even have researched if this country fails US like I have experienced in the last 3 years cause I when from 70% in late 2020 to be to 90% in early 2021 to 60% in summer of 2022. So tell me how Mr. Collins is the problem\nPerfectly said!!! So very sorry for the loss of your child.\nThis is the same guy that said the VA “will not be cutting any employees.” So I agree with you 100%, I can’t trust this dude either.\nOh, really.\nWell Said. I couldn’t of said it better myself!\nFirst of all, thank you for your service. Secondly, your comments are so out of touch with reality. President Trump very much respects our servicemen and women, and if it weren’t for him and serving as our President 4 years ago, our VA health system would still be in dire straights. He fixed a broken system, and now our Veterans are receiving better care. Please do your research.\nDidn’t the Jews kill Jesus? You must be a troll op on the Internet, but cool story though, Bot.\nYes! I agree with everything you stated! Lip service as vets lose their jobs! Pathetic they will answer for all their stuff!\nHi J Medley. First I am so sorry for the loss of your child at Camp Lejuene. There have been a lot of injustices in our country, and long wait times to get claims finalized etc. but in all seriousness you can’t blame that on any one party. Your remarks about Trump and our new Secretary are so wrong on many levels. You are simply spewing what the liberal media have been dishing out for so many years trying to eliminate Trump from becoming President. Look back – two assassination attempts, two impeachments, endless lawsuits, special hearings etc. – All failed. Millions and maybe billions of taxpayer dollars spent on trying to derail the man. I’ve been in politics so I know the game. I have to close that you are in no place to think God is on your side and against Trump and the Republican party. Despite what you think Trump really wants to make this country great again. I get the fact his personality may rub you the wrong way but give the man a chance. Since you seem to be a Godly man, put him in your prayers that he does a great job for everyone. Have faith and hope he does the right thing!!!! Best to you and yours, a Vietnam Vet\nYou’ve bought into the propaganda, “Trump Bad” is the mantra. If there is any “fascism” it’s in the Democrat Party, the self proclaimed Socialist. I feel for you brother, please open your eyes to the truth –> “Trump GOOD.”\nAlthough you have a right to express your opinion, this rant does not possess one ounce of facts to support the accusations. This extremist approach does absolutely nothing but cause unfounded division. Stick to the facts, keep an open mind, and read a variety of news sources to create a more balanced viewpoint.\nBy the way, there are worse tyrants throughout history than the recent dictator in which was referred. At least try to spice it up a little with some ancient Roman, Chinese, Russian, or Mongolian oppressors. Continually comparing others with the same old name is unimaginative. ;)\nYou are blaming this administration, how about the previous administrations?\nYou are very misled, but I can tell you for certain that under the Biden administration my benefits went to hell. My prescription drug copay almost doubled, and I couldn’t/can’t even make an appointment with my primary care doctor without going through some stupid person that doesn’t even work in that office. I don’t know where you get your information, but you have no idea what you are talking about. You sound like an idiot with the crap you are spewing.\nYou’re just an America Hating Sheep that believes Everything the Lying Fake News Tells you !!\nAmen! My ancestors fought in the American Revolution and most wars since. This administration has no idea what they have done but they will soon. I don’t think there will be a civil war because this isn’t between civilians ( except the “cult”) but the oppressed will rise up and show the billionaires the error of their ways. History is on our side. 1776.\n“I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut,” Collins said. … “I’m happy to partner with DOGE [an un-elected organization that was not created by the US Congress as the VA or USAid was, just an arm of Elon Musk’s business empire] to find things we need to get rid of…” he said.”\nWhat BS, first Collins says he’s not cutting VA benefits…then he says, oh yes, by the way I am cutting benefits, we’re just calling it “efficiency”…literally on the same page!\nSecretary Collins is just a stooge for Musk, our N- co-president from South Africa. He is appointed ‘secretary’ to take an axe to the VA benefits we EARNED by our sacrifice. Trump, a Vietnam draft dodger, has never respected veterans and does not honor our service. To Trump and Musk, we are just “suckers” (Trump actually said this!). Wake up people, this is all in the project 2025 playbook. Musk-Trump wants to kill the VA dead so that we have to deal with their golfing buddies/ vultures who own the private health insurance industry. All while betraying our allies in NATO and selling Ukraine to the Soviets. RIP America 2025.\nJ Meadly Sir, Seems you’re looking to blame certain individuals for the loss of your child. Many lost loved ones concerning the Lejeune issues and or continue to suffer. There is never true Justice after suffering a loss as yours. We do need to heal and as in the Marines, continue to move forward.. I do strongly suggest you seek counseling. The VA has the means and am certain would like to speak with you. Good Luck.\nWell put my friend!\nI agree with you 100%. I was at LeJeune as well. I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Good lord above. ?\nAll of this feels like a full on tail spin. It takes cptsd to a whole entirely different level! And the Veteran’s suicide hotline has already had some operators cut! As if their jobs aren’t absolutely necessary. And they wonder why vets isolate. What a joke-what a slap in the face!! I WILL pray for you and your family.\nWell said My Brother, well said!\nI created the Desert Storm Battle Registry as a survey in 1997 to\nfind my fellow GWI veterans. More than 5,000 filled this out. Then\nI progressed to full advocacy by 1998. By then DOD knew me quite\nwell as I inventoried there servers and threw it back at them. I was tired\nof not knowing anything or why I was so damn sick.\nDSBR name tags, and name plates began to fill boxes from events that\nI was recognized at. Media was easy back then. No one turned me away.\nTill global media coverage in 2003 opposing troops going to Iraq. Even\nhad a DC PO Box for mail.\n2008, got my own VA federal advisory committee. VA went out of its way\nto shorten our tenure and muzzle us. Even threaten me, then pretty\nmuch hide our committee and its final report.\n2012 VA cut us all off. Played dirty with gulf war advocates. Ran off our\nadvocates in favor of ringers. All the while making things worse for Gulf\nwar vets and playing up Deployment Health. Who have been hiding 4\nsignificant disease trends from the veterans and the public.\nHere it is 2025 and Im still here. Out lived hundreds of advocates and\nfellow supporters. Still, DSBR hung on for 28 long years. Of which VA\nhas gotten very braisen. Not posting my letters to the RAC year after\nyear likes its a choice. Taking down all evidence I exist the last 3 years.\nI find it highly offensive 14 Secretaries of VA have ignored everything Gulf\nwar from a veterans stand point. That we have no real say in our care,\nbenefits, and healthcare. You will choose for us. None of you have done\nright by me, or the 697,289 other fellow GWI vets. Going all the way back to\nPL 105-368 that you twisted and abused.\nMust be very comforting to look down your nose, and act like DSBR does not\ndeserve professional courtesy. 28 years of work means nothing. What could I\npossibly offer versus you? Try 28 years of experience and dealing with 13 other\nSec of VA that like you felt veterans input is a joke. Every damn one of them was\na public servant and forgot that when it office. Your supposed to be available.\nTechnically, Im your boss. Not the other way.\nSo I will say to you what Ive been saying back in the Army to officers. How could\nyou loose what you never earned, my respect. You demand it, then you treat me\nlike a feral dog in back ally. You want my respect now, earn it by doing your job.\nWhich means answering phones and emails. So far, zip there. DSBR came along\nway before you, and Ive helped far more gulf war vets than you ever will.\nWe started out nice 2 weeks ago, and now I know 2025 is you cutting throats,\nhiding behind staff, pretending to care while you pretty much spit in my face.\nBlocking my browser access to VA.gov is also blocking me from MyHealthevet\nwebsite. Your denying me access to medical care. Real brave, real smart. So I\nthink Im justified to be grumpy with you. I only get this way reacting to others,\nI didnt start this. Just reached out to you and you blew me off..\nChange is coming either way.\nKirt P. Love\nDirector, DSBR\nFormer Member VA ACGWV\nDidn’t you hear? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nEat [redacted], fascist.\nThank you, what they don’t want us to know is the fact most Vets of Desert Storm are like myself. We were some how connected to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle or M1 ABRAMS, or some other mechanized source. The US Army conducted a study in 1981 on the two tanks mentioned. This study revealed that just firing of the weapons alone Carbon Monoxide was lethal at every position within those tanks. The DOD, and Army refused to do anything about it other than ignore it. Myself I have suffered from Rumathoid Arthritis every since Desert Storm I was 11M. I enlisted at 17 fresh out of High School healthy as an OX. Thru my own studies and research there is a known link to CO poisoning and Rumathoid Arthritis. I have a TERA MEMO attached to my file and conceded to by the VA, but none of that matters, it’s just a piece of paper. Come sit with me some times when it takes all I got to get out of bed because of the pain I am in. I have accepted the fact that RA is chronic and it will take my life someday if a cure is not f going. What I can’t accept is the very Government I defended and would do it again in a heart beat as most of us would, now I’m having to defend myself because nobody with Authority has the balls to stand up and do the right thing for us Vets. It’s always some other law it more red tape, I didn’t recall any of that when I was called to fight a War we really had no business fighting in the first place! Mad as hell at Army,DOD, and now the VA is falling right in step with those two. Grow a pair do right by the very people who gave you a job to begin with or resign and put me in that seat!\nThey may turn a blind eye, but we are still watching. Thank you for the advocacy over the years, Kirt. GWI (or whatever they want to call it) has been a nightmare for so many.\nYou have my undying respect and admiration Kirt. I also had to voice my displeasure to superiors while serving which didn’t serve me well. You seem to have the ability to voice your opinion and stop. My mind demands my adrenaline push me beyond that and display a much firmer view for my point of view.\nU.S. Army Vietnam Vet\nWell over 80% disabled and find the VA extremely lacking to the point I’m convinced I’m just a photo op.\nPlease focus on the Caring for Survivors Act as so many of us lost not only our loved one but also a substantial amount of our income\nYou want the VA to focus on the survivers moreso than the actual veterans? Many veterans are single and single with families and cannot work but yet you feel that its more importants for the non-veterans to get the disabilty that the actual veterans need? Im sorry you lost a substantial amount of your income but I lost the ability to have children because of military issues among other issues so Im not losing an additional income..Im losing most of my income, my home, and may be facing living on the streets if they cut the benefits. I WAS in the military, not just married to someone in it. PS…when I could not have kids my military husband left me to find someone that could.\nCurrently VA has over a quarter of a million pending rating cases, which is taking an average of 140 days to complete. Is that faster than ever? Historically, VA has staffed up during wartime periods but when those employees retire service suffers. Veterans’ needs for VA services do not go away after they are discharged. Many times as veterans age, their needs for disability benefits and health care increases. It angers me that Elon Musk and his wunderkind, none of whom served one day in the military, are attacking the VA. Shame!\nThis empire was built off of the blood of those who served in units like mine, and you better f***king know that we are not oblivious to you trying to f**k with our disability ratings and services. Keep that in mind. You can lie to the masses with the current administration’s lies, but you won’t pull that s**t with us vets. Remember that.\nLess w 0ke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with w 0ke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nA lot of vets voted for this admin. So the wool has been pulled over their eyes and quite easily, unfortunately.\nI second that!\nSadly, some of these Vets are delusional and have fallen into the cult.\n!!! You speak the truth, unfortunately\nIf one comment from here could get the attention of anyone in a position of authority at the VA, let it be Mr. Hirth’s.\nStick your hand in our cage and pull back a stump.\nHow is freezing hiring for the WARTAC program, and taking medical services away while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” You can’t BS us. We are what sustains this empire. Active or reserved… You’d do well to remember that.\nI don’t believe a word the Sec. is saying. He’s just another puppet of this administration & the so called “DOGE”. I’m very worried about the outcome of all this stupity and the future of our USA. Take care & carry on.\nSecretary Collins ,\nI don’t believe your going to read any of these emails. I’ve reached out to Congress the VA representative, and my Congressman in Texas with no results. I’ve had 3 botched surgery’s from incompetent surgeon’s. Now I have to suffer the rest of my life and I don’t trust the VA at all thank god for community care. As far as I’m concerned the Government has given up on us and has given everything to illegals and Fu$k us.\nI will continue to fight for my country and what I believe in\nDear Sir,\nThere are 182 comments on here.Are you going to answer any of them?\nLOL… Don’t hold your breath.\nHe’s not reading them-they don’t care, I promise they don’t. Tomorrow, thousands more will lose their jobs in America while the Felon in charge whines about when he’ll get his new Air Force One delivered—because that is government efficiency:)\nmy brother, he is not even going to read any of them.\nDo you actually think he is going to read them? Sorry your comment was pretty funny. Let me answer you as a disabled veteran. NO, he is not going to answer you. He is probably having his very expensive coffee with his amazing breakfast chatting about how hard his job is and cant decide what kind of furniture he needs for his new office.\nNo, no he is not. But you kinda knew that, didn’t you\nYou wanted this job, now do it\nPlease Exend the Blue Water Line to the original Vietnam Service Medal Line that was took away from Blue Water Navy off Vietnam in 2002. This was the agent orange 1991 Bill for all Vietnam Veterans. I been trying for almost 20 years to get my Benefits. I got a lot of Health Problems from Agent Orange and Toxins on my Ship. I am almost 78 years old.\nMy husband is like you. VA doctors told him to file because certain illnesses, like prostate cancer, he had would be automatic because of Agent Orange. When documentation was filed, weirdly, VA kept saying they didn’t get them. They seemed to get records that were not needed. they also close the case if they don’t get what they want by a certain date. We filed through Texas Vet who took the paperwork and handed it to the VA office and still they wouldn’t acknowledge they received them.\nHow can we possibly believe anything this fascist government says. The president just declared himself king! DOGE was given unrestricted access to records. We have a HHS that wants to put those with mental illness in camps. How can anyone believe this!?\nGreat. Just another bootlicker kissing POTUS butt.\nOne of the slowest entities on this planet is the VA . It takes an average of 6 months to 3 years to get an answer from the VA in disability claims. Molasses going uphill in the winter time on Mount Everest is faster than the VA. Such a disgusting way to treat veterans that literally give their lives for the defense of this great country. And you wonder suicide rates are so high. Veterans have no choice but to give up. It would be nice if one of the largest health care systems in this country could ACTUALLY take care of its veterans. Please pass this on to the VA boss and maybe for ONCE he will ACTUALLY listen to our concerns.\nPeople commenting like he gonna read it lmfao.\nAs I read I wa liked lol. Some are writing a yrs of what they did.\nWe know he’s not going to read them. We know no one on his staff will read them. We know he doesn’t care. The comments are for each other to hear the voices of their compatriots.\nThis is why I would never vote Republican. The sheer stupidity and depravity is an insult to those who served their country. I understand that you rich white scumbags feel that I as a black man can serve and die for my country but I do not deserve to be treated equally. We as black people have fought for this country since its founding and still are treated as second class citizens. Your recent cuts to the VA are yet another example of your disregard for our service. It is my hope that Karma shows how much of a bitch she is. You are led by a 5 time draft dodger who called us suckers and losers, however it is my belief that you are the suckers and losers and I will stand on that until I die…\nAbsolutely. They’re not gonna read any of this stuff, but I’m really enjoying reading what my fellow veterans are saying.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting\nAmen brother!\nAs a white veteran I have to tell you that they don’t care about any veterans no matter what color. I do understand that you may have faced prejudiced issues in the past…so have women, and its not right. About the rest of your comment…I agree totally. Im also nog a fan of old rich scumbags who are robbing us blind to their advantage. That’s why I am up all hours of the night filled with anxiety, depression and questioning if tomorrow they will be coming after us.\nlol shut up, all this garbage has been given to us from all the previous generations Dem and Rep combined working for their globalist overlords have crushed us veterans and made the VA one of the most corrupt institutions on earth, and now all of a sudden 30 days into Trump you’re gonna cry about Republicans and “waaah white people” when the VA has been an institution of death and depravity for the past several decades? Get lost, you’re nothing more than an anti white ideological hack.\nNow you know how my Irish ancestors felt when they were forced off their lands and taken into slavery to serve in the New World. My Celtic brethren were called and treated as sub-Human till 1830s. So been there, done that.\nUp to 20,000 Irish were worked to death to hand dig the New Basin Canal in New Orleans in the 1830s because African slaves were deemed too valuable to risk. In 1862, the US Army project to build a canal on the Mississippi River during the War to bypass Confederate Army batteries on the bluffs of Vicksburg. It was dubbed Grant’s Canal, but after the first failed attempt, that quickly changed to Grant’s Folly. Undeterred, General Grant secured President Lincoln’s approval to force recently “freed” African slaves to hand dig and dredge the adjacent wetlands. It is recorded that 200+ of these men lost their lives for this useless project that was always doomed to failure.\nIn the end, we are all cattle to the powers that be. Race and nationality have little to do with it. Democrats aren’t much different from Republicans. They both belong to the same Progressive Party.\nsounds like this one needs to be audited. Bet your claims are fraudulent\nYou can’t fire (without cause) over 1000 dedicated VA caregivers then pretend you actually give a dam about our health care or convince us that you won’t also come after our disability benefits so greedy never-served billionaires (like Musk) can shove even more billions into their pockets. Trump may hate us “suckers and losers” veterans because (being a pathetic coward) he ain’t us. But WE will outlast him!!\nMr. Secretary,\nSince there gas been a staffing shortage of doctors, nurses, and support staff. Why did you layoff 1000 workers? For transparency “Why are you afraid of Donald Trump? As for Elon and his SpaceX techs. No I highly disapprove of non- or improperly vetted civilians that has no clue whatsoever they are doing to have access to my records or any VA records. To be honest you, Trump, Elon, and Republicans in general are an embarrassment to this country. Elon is from South Africa and not from the US. Having access to all these records and making decisions hurting America’s workers.\nI hope they do away with this glorified welfare system. Unless your disability is LOD you shouldn’t get any. This could save the govt billions. I hope they take a hard look at this.\nwe HAVE to Make America Great Again. There will be pain for sime but I totally support the cuts. there us so much waste and fraud and faking. billions and billions\nHello, my name is Alfonso Perez. A Disabled Combat Veteran in South Texas. Since 2010 I have submitted documents in support of a claim. I was in combat as an Infantryman during the Gulf War. When I was discharged, a clerical error did not show my medals that I deserve and served for. Mainly, my Combat Infantry Badge. This is important to me. I can pass this on to my kids and grandchildren. Showing that I served my Country. For years, I have been fighting the US Army Vital Records Department and Board of Appeals. I have emailed and talked to several offices and departments, hoping to get help in this matter. Mr Collins is the only person that can help me at this point. I also been fighting the VA over my failing and declining health. I have pictures and my statement where I was exposed to the burning oil wells and burning material that we were tasked to do. I have been complaining of shortness of breath, bone and muscle pain from day one. When I filed a disability claim in 2007. Although I am 100% disabled due to combat, I suffer from several illnesses. The VA has helped me in getting an electric wheelchair and a lift for my home. I am bed ridden 90% of the time. My wife has been caring for me the past 3 years. This is when my health has worsened. I applied for the caregiver program, and have been denied several times. There’s been time I want to give up. But my wife motivates me to keep going. PS I also believe my injuries and illnesses should be awarded a Purple Heart. As it was a tactic used by the enemy. God Bless and Thank you!! Alfonso Perez (Mission,Texas) 18th Airborne Division/24th Infantry Division Aco 3rd/7th Ft Stewart Georgia\nBrother, your wife sounds like a saint. I had luck getting my dd214 updated through military awards section of manpower.\nI feel you brother! I did ask about the Purple Heart as well. NBC warfare was used against us on multiple occasions, M8 alarms, Khamisiyah bunker filled with sarin gas. I too, believe we deserve a Purple Heart. Your CIB should be easy to prove with your DD-214 showing your time in Desert Storm and your MOS. Send a copy to HRC to get it fixed. Oh yeah, file for Aid and Attendance instead of the caregiver program.\nGood Luck.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin’s , I was so happy to hear that you are now the New Secretary of the Va. Cherry Point Base had referred me to the VA in New Bern, NC. after seeing 5 Jag Attorneys at Cherry Point Base with President Trump placing my case Under Major Domestic Violence April 2018. Congressman Murphy office in Greenville stated they would be glad to help when I had a claim . Sir I do have a claim that Honorable Senator Dole, Craven county DSS had assisted with in 2008 with Winston Salem VA. I understand that you are a chaplain. Sir this situation is not God, it’s evil. Thirty years of the quality of my life and family is completely destroyed. The course of our lives have been changed unnaturally. Since President Trump had taken office I have had to notify the President. The only assurance that I have received is from Craven Community College, very little assistance from DSS , and one of the families from the college assisting with one of their familiy members temporarily, with staying with a elderly. I have also contacted Randy Forbes law office in Washington DC Greenberg Traugrig as they taken my consideration rights, civil rights, liberty rights, fundamental rights, with them not honoring the rule of law. I would definitely appreciate any assistance that would be given as they have me trapped financially. Thank you\nWe have no proof whatsoever that an unvetted non-federal employee working under the fake federal entity DOGE that was not even Congressionally created (as lawfully required)…has not illegally accessed our super sensitive military Veteran medical records, disability records and personal information contacting our SSN #s, birth dates, address, phone numbers, etc. I do not believe anyone hired by the current president, a convicted felon.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting . My feelings exactly! Where is the accountability?\nhave you ever been to the DMV????\nPlease – you are assuming that any other federal employee is honest and good. What we do know if our country is in deep financial trouble and DOGE has the smartest people on it to comb through waste, fraud and abuse to save our taxpayer money. So quit whining and realize how licky we are to have these 2 great men working feverishly to save America. They are plenty rich enough – they do not have to do it but they must for our kids. By the way, 58% of Americans approve of Trump and Elon’s DOGE. DOGE employees are employed by the federal government as hired by Trump/Elon.\nThis…right here. Absolutely.\nWe need to have our Vr@e. Benefits expedited.\nVeterans have to wait for 5-7 months for any sort of vocational rehabilitation. The offices of Greenville SC are completely closed and when I went in person to the physical office, there is a schedule sign and a government vehicle. The department of the Veterans affairs educational benefits needs and our health care benefits are slow and veterans are dying waiting for the proper care!\nPlease work with Doug Collins together so we can fix Greenville SC. CBOC and build another hospital for veteran in the Upstate south Carolina!!\nChatGPT said:\nCertainly! Here’s a revised version of your message with a clear and professional tone:\nSubject: Urgent Request for Expedited VR&E Benefits and Improved Veteran Services in Greenville, SC\nDear [Recipient’s Name],\nI am writing to bring urgent attention to the current state of Veterans’ services in Greenville, SC. Veterans in our community are facing excessive delays in accessing Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) benefits, with wait times of 5-7 months. This situation is unacceptable, as it severely impacts veterans’ ability to transition to civilian life and gain meaningful employment.\nIn addition, the Greenville SC offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are completely closed, leaving many veterans without support. During a recent visit to the physical office, I noticed a schedule sign and a government vehicle, but no available staff to assist. This lack of accessibility is only furthering the frustration of our local veterans.\nOur veterans are also facing delays in receiving educational and healthcare benefits, leading to serious concerns about their well-being. Tragically, some veterans are dying while waiting for the care they rightfully deserve. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.\nI urge you to collaborate with Congressman Doug Collins to address these issues and expedite the process for VR&E benefits. Additionally, I implore you to work towards establishing a new VA hospital in the Upstate of South Carolina to better serve the needs of our veteran population, particularly those in Greenville.\nThe time to act is now, and I trust you will prioritize the health and well-being of those who have served our country. Our veterans deserve better.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter. I look forward to your prompt response and action.\nYou Have 2 Senators And A Rep. Collectively they Will Be More Than Happy To Expedite All Concerns. Lindsey Graham/Tim Scott/Nancy Mace. They Are Dedicated In Helping Veterans Of All Military Campaigns. The Above Individuals Are Dedicated to Transparency. Good Luck!\ni think it wonderful that the military has decided to consider to right some of the wrong judgments unfair decisions handed down,most vetrans didnt join the military to fail or qut to get thrown out, , we sighn up in all honesty to succeed , for life careers , to lead productive lives , some unfortunate veterans may have fell short in some of there endeavors and encounters during there service , or for various other reasons , weather you couldnt get along with your higher ups, because of biases ,racism , mentel illnesses ignored ,harrassment/ mst ,ptsd, fraternizing , seen and judged by one person veterans not being given the chance to redeem or get medical help in some instances counseling, instead of just being thrown out most veterans dont want to leave fail go home failures ,the process were flawed mental health wasnt recognized., ptsd wasnt recognized untill 1980 , many veterans suffered mentaly it was ignored or went unnoticed there were no proccessin place ,this is not a hand out,, it is a hand up, to our fallen misfortunate stigmatize hidden wounded soliders ,there were discrepancies ,prejudices inconsistencies in the discharge process, so i think it was over do. good luck to those veterans who suffered for years carrying this hidden wound, being look down on frown upon, rejected, not able to get jobs, ,because of differences between two people from different backgrounds cultures etc , because of mentel conditions at the time of said events or a behavior sustained from trama ptsd mst ,harrassment, fraternization,\nAs a wife of a Veteran and I feel to just vent my feelings here. I wished that if my husband’s PSA level was thoroughly examined and monitored closely like yearly mandatory check up for males I believe that He would not start His Chemotherapy tomorrow, 2/18/25.\nIt was 7-1/2 years laps His VA doctor didn’t check his prostate until His PSA level became very high and cancer cells was present that ended him getting Prostatectomy surgery. My husband had several infusions, injections and oral meds but the cancer had metastasized to his bones. Now Chemotherapy is needed to hopefully stop the spread to his organs. I hope that this comment helps improve the dignity of patient care in our Virginia Veterans. I believed that negligence of care is present in my husband’s care. I’m very sad to see Him undergo many treatments.\nI thank You for allowing me to share. God Bless.\nFile a TORT CLAIM against the VA for negligence. It is not hard to do. Gather your evidence and submit your form.\nGood Luck\nI’m very sorry to read of your plight. For any veteran men here, just do what I did – doesnt cost a ton of money – go to Quest labs and pay for your own “PSA blood test” and if the result is oitnof range get that to your doctor and that will start the action going for diagnosis. Too many wait around or trust in the gloved finger test. Just pay for your own psa blood test. I did and thank God we caught my husband’s PSA was very high. That triggered a prostate biopsy which was a gleason score showing aggressive type, so then a staging nuclear medicine bine scan and visit to surgeon at City of Hope for robotic removal. And get this – the doctor at that initial medical annual physical was not going to give him anything because he looked so good and healthy and strong. But I was the one who pushed to write to get the blood test (more accurate than digital rectum exam). My hunch was because he was not having good solid urine streams – yes I heard a change in his urine stream “habits”.\nMay God bless your husband and you. I wish him the best. I too got Prostate cancer, possibly from Agent Orange exposure but who knows. I’m lucky it was caught early, treated with radiation/hormone therapy and is in remission. Even though I have a primary care doctor at my local VA Clinic, my civilian Urologist called out the cancer diagnosis early with my sudden high PSA level. Take care brother.\nI’m sad to say I really no longer trust the VA Administrations. No issues with the doctors, nurse at the facilities but the senior leadership.\nOnce again the senior leadership within the VA will need to earn my trust. Zero trust in DOGE\nDOGE found hundreds ( if not more by now) of upper level case managers working from home, using personal computers ( not DOD secure) to access VA account information and sensitive information… Along with the lack of security measures by these admins they were only working a few hours a week while still taking a full salary….\nCriminals running VAMC Caregiver authorization . If you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a. Problem..\nDOGE it out of Existance. Criminals that never approve a single Veteran for caregiver help. Absolutely anti-american, against Veterans that need caregivers that are blind, and have all the problems with activities of daily living..\nCall me\n1SG Combat Vet, Caregiver\nThe VAMC Caregiver program is criminal lengthy weights, obscenely long interviews just to say no.\nThey need the doge now and eradicate its staff completely. I help take care of Veterans. It is a salmon and swim upstream and you know what happens..\nThe rule is if you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a problem\nVA should loan on tiny Homes for Veterans on wheels. There are too many veterans that are homeless, and never could afford a five or $600,000 mortgage, but they may be able to afford $125,000 government sponsored Tiny home on wheels with their service connection.\nI was rated at 100% disabled (service connected) back in 2012 before I was discharged from the military. I had a major depressive episode due to bipolar disorder and TBI with mood disorder. Not to mention that my career was done due to my 2 lower back surgeries and 1 cervical surgery that led to a prosthetic disc and fusion in my neck. Dealing with the constant pain and the plethora of consistent changing medications, I had a suicide attempt that led to me smoking some pot. The Army violated Army Regulations and Command Policy as well as some other nefarious acts that led to me being taken to a special court martial to adjudicate a BCD as well as threatening me with 4 years in a military prison. Having a wife and two children, a home that we had bought, and watch many other soldiers get wrongfully disciplined by command and getting unfavorable discharges, I opted to take a chapter 10 in lieu of the court-martial. I found out later on after having the chance to actually look at my records, I found many mistakes and other discrepancies in my discharge that I can say with the utmost conviction, my discharge was wrongful. My DD214 is so messed up it will take forever just to fix that one document alone. After my exiting service with two terms of service, the first term of 3 years 4 and a half months under honorable conditions and a second term that was 3 years 2 months of service cut short and getting a characterization of OTH, I went to the VA 3 days after my discharge. I wanted to find out if I had any entitlement to benefits at all. I was told by the VA that I was entitled to no benefits at all. Not even unemployment. I went back to the VA in 2015 in another state, which was my home of record and found out that I could get medical benefits for any injuries or conditions being treated for while in service. In 2018 I entered the DOM to stop drinking and tried to apply for my GIBill. The college I was wanting to attend told me that I didn’t have any GIBill benefits because of my OTH discharge. In 2021 I found out that I did have my GIBill benefits through another education institution. However the VA wants to short me 10% of my GIBill benefit. I did a patient inquiry into my VA records in 2022 and could not believe what I found. The VA has me showing that I have no service connected disabilities and that I have had no surgeries what so ever. I started going through my medical records from my disability claim while in the service and am appalled by what I am finding. The incorrect information, the false statements by physicians, the refusal to use my tri-care paid off post mental health providers diagnosis that the VA at the time was treating me for, the policy violations from Army Regulations and Command Policy on soldiers that are in the MEB/PEB process and the VA IDES process, finding out that MEB/PEB and VA disability determinations were purposefully withheld from the General Court Martial Convening Authority when the disability processes were completed and before my court martial was even read to me. These disability finding are supposed to be taken into consideration when a soldier is taken to a court-martial not to mention that I had a daughter that was enrolled in the exceptional family member program for autism. The program I was in was a Joint DoD and VA program while going through the evaluation process. I have contacted the VA and DoD and they both wanna play “pass the buck” and not take responsibility for the indiscretions they have both committed. Let’s also add that during the time of my evaluations the Unit I was assigned to “a pilot program” was being investigated for multiple issues. I have ran into more issues for trying to do the right thing and point out these issues through my own personal experience as well as documentation that proves what indiscretions had been done against these soldiers. I have solid evidence of it and I can’t get a soul to look at it. I have been played so many times by my health care providers when they tell me to bring in any documents that I want put into my health records. I bring them in and no one looks at them. They had me believing that they didn’t have any record of my medical history from the Army. Then I find out that they can pull them up at any time. Why would they stress me out like that? I called the main VA in DC to get transfered 4 times, the person I spoke with told me they have no record of my claim filed back in 2011 or my ratings in 2012. I find that odd when I have all of my records to include the original claim filed in 2011 that is date stamped received by the VA in Winston – Salem plus the entire packet filed with the MEB/PEB and VA DES including my NARSUM, QTC exam reports, and MEB/PEB and VA Findings and Ratings, a signed DA199 that shows my paperwork was withheld by the signature date alone. Can we say, “denied due process” and “railroading”?\nDaniel are you living my life. I was Deserted by my command in March 1991 as other unit members witnessed this. Then it all got turned on me and mysteriously all the unit records vanish. Then comes the ol Chapter 10 OTH I would have been better off at Court Martial. I was straight out denied records by the DOD until I got my Congress rep involved in 2006, but they even have him the ol bait n switch move cause the records he got were nothing more than fire starter. Imagine my surprise in 2023 when yet again I request my Congress rep to get records and I think somebody made a boo boo for the first time in 33 years I learned the name of my accuser. Your not alone brother Chapter 10 OTH is no where remotely close to the bulls eye of Justice and that practice needs to cease immediately. any one that is facing these issues we are stronger together than apart hit my email so we can ban together and demand answers and change in this new Golden Age!\nAre more judges going to be appointed for the Camp Lejeune Claims and lawsuits which are at 450,000 and it has been two half years?\nThe 35 year time frame is it a law ?

He is the best doctor I’ve ever had. I don’t know what I would do without him.\nThank you standing up for us vet\nNaw, only a few of them. Don’t forget there are also minority Vets who won’t get anything and will have to fight for the same rights as their fellow Vets.\nI have a concern for housing right now I’m pre-planning for move out and I urrentlg reside in the south bay area and would like to move to treasure Island I hear there are housing opportunities slved there and I wanna make sure I get placed where I wish to live. Any help answerijg this question would be greatly appreciated\nSir\nNobody notified to me to get tested ever after Desert Storm and now all these years later I find out I am sick from it. My driver has been 100% disabled for YEARS but now I am filing and have to fight tooth and nail for my family. I don’t have a positive outlook so I am filing more for\ntheir future. I have been sick for years and you need to do better notifying us before it’s to late like now. My health is in shambles and now I have to battle on my claim!!! I can’t believe this really was done to vets who would do it again for their country.\nCollins, you’re a liar like the rest of them. We don’t trust you. And all the overreach of DOGE that you’re allowing to happen? You’re a freaking disgrace. You must really think we’re stupid. You record a video with your cheery southern twang thinking you will win us over? You won’t. We aren’t sheep.\nOnce you were sick you should’ve started seeking treatment and follow up care. You waited until the PACT ACT was available for the bells to go off in your head. Like most GW Veterans we were sick almost immediately upon return. We noticed the changes and sought care only for Dr’s to tell us we were crazy and it was in our heads. It’s not too late for you as every condition is presumptive by providing your DD-214 showing your service in theater. It’s helpful to have those diagnoses’ but not required. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, IBS are all presumptive.\nSo why are you cutting doctors and nurse who are on probation? It is hard enough to get this group to apply for jobs in the VA. I am very concerned about the state of the VA for our veterans. I am a retired VA nurse who loved caring for Veterans. My late husband USMC/VN died in 2004 due to Agent Orange exposure: non Hoskins lymphoma. It seems that the current administration in DC is not listening to the “boots on the ground “ employees, those nurses and doctors and health techs who care daily for our veterans. The VA is not a business: it involves real people : who put their lives on the line for our country.\nI hope veterans will wake up to see how the VA has been privatized for decades. —with decreasing benefits. And that Congress for the 7th year will NOT cosponsor and pass a Dental bill (HR 210) for all veterans in the VA healthcare system. I am told “too expensive”. Check out who has signed onto this bill.\nDealing with a doctor that lost job because of the morphine he was writing, he left me no choice but to quit myself. I ordered CBD off Amazon & failed urinalysis from taking supplements. That was 2013 roughly? VA will not pay for pain medication because I’ve since got my Medical Cannabis Card & get in prescription. The VA hasn’t paid for my medication since I quit the morphine the doctor prescribed (180mg 4times a day) . If I hadn’t thrown away I would not be here. Was up to 370lbs. Please look into why Veterans get punished for pain medication because of the THC? The first thing I did joining the Navy was I had to get a waiver for using in high school for the government. My mother said always be honest & here’s a good reason why? I like a pain patch but it costs 90$ a month. Paying for my own medication has hurt me, also recovering from Storm. Being punished for CBD is outdated & another reason for the VA to say no? Would like to help other Vets as well. Very Respectfully Sir thank you\nPlease check on why the higher V.A higher up Admin used the Pact Act funds for a raise 10.9 million? Marsha Blackburn V.A.Admin website. Why are there only four judges overseeing the Pact Act claims lawsuit 450,000? Who made the ruling 35 year time frame when it was 1953-1980.Thank you so much for your time\nMusk would love to know about the 10.9 million..\nHow can we trust anyone appointed by Trump and his co-president Musk. There is no truth anymore. I doubt any of our data is safe.\nMany veterans who have injuries caused by their military service should be taken care of. From slipped discs to the most severe in which they lost limbs. Its the honorable thing to do. I don’t understand how non-veterans who dont risk their lives can even ask to take away any benefits from veterans. The way I see it…send those kinds of people into combat or have them unload heavy equipment all day year round which eventually breaks down their body. Once they have their injuries..I bet they dont want to be abandoned. Its not even just physical pain… as the years go by… veterans get so freaking angry their pain is non-stop and they can’t do what others can do. Get jealous of injury free people older then them jumping around. Can’t even stand without freaking muscle spasms/cramps or annoying headaches. And it gets worse as you get older. Filled with nothing but regret.\nSecretary Collins, first and foremost, congratulations on your appointment. I was hoping to send you an email, but that seems impossible. Not sure if this will reach you, but hopefully it is relay to the leadership team associated with the VA facility. I am a retired veteran, USMC. Looking through these posts, there definitely is some bellyaching, I am sure some is warranted. I just want you to know on how employees at the White River Junction VA in VT, go above and beyond. I had an appointment on Wednesday at occupational therapy, I also was scheduled the following day to get my hearing aids. There was a pretty good snowstorm rolling in the following day, and I knew if it was going to get as bad as predicted, I would not make my appointment. I took a chance and went to audiology and explained my concerns, the staff up front were professional and got an IM to my audiologist. She cut her lunch break short and saw me. Hearing aids issued.

Please say no.She says her friends are being fired as she texts me. And her job will be eliminated by 2027.?\nGut VHA and give us insurance, community care is trash and the approval process is a nightmare for veterans and the providers who get paid $.27 on the dollar for services. As a provider I wouldn’t want to deal with that crap for a fraction of the pay. Just saying. ?♂️\nDear Mr. Collins,\nMy husband, Clifford Oliver Mealy, is undergoing treatment for service related bladder cancer. He served in the Navy during Vietnam. And applied for his benefits in 2023 after he was diagnosed.\nHe has not been able to work. His business as a photographer has faltered because he is unable to work.\nHe was told that his benefits would come in a year. Now it’s two years and he has yet to receive his promised benefits.\nThen, he received a letter that his benefits have been “deferred.”\nWe cannot get anyone in the VA to tells us what this means.\nNeedless to say, this is very upsetting as his diagnosis has destroyed his business. And we have no idea when this will be resolved.\nThis needs to stop we need all employees who work at VA with these cuts now we are going to wait longer for all dr. appointment, compensation reviews VA was already short hand now it’s even more if you want to make cuts look at the contract that the goverment has with vendors, look at Elon Musk and how many contract he has with the goverment and how much he made off the goverment.\nMental health “professionals” are just treating Veterans with legitimate issues with very little concern. They rush Veterans through these unhelpful programs rather than addressing the actual problems to fill their books. I would like to see a change where they take quality over quantity.\nTaking anything away from veterans is shameful especially when the military budget is so large. Cut that in half and give it to the veterans! We are being told that people working on the veterans crises line were laid off! You are lying to us Collins! During Trump’s last presidency he was found to have lied more than 35,000 times! Each lie has been documented. Stop believing what he says! There are people working the crises lines at the VA and they are saying that they were fired. I think I will believe them before I believe you or Trump. You don’ care about the veterans. Neither does Trump. I wonder how much he is paying you to misrepresent the truth.\n“The Trump administration is right now firing researchers at VA who do lifesaving work for our veterans—research to prevent veteran suicide, build lifechanging prosthetics, address opioid addiction, and more.\nLoved this! Straight forward right on target!\n… and have enough respect for the dignity of the office to put on a blazer!\nJane, get a life!!!\nPlease focus on Fraud Waste and Abuse. I guarantee there is tons of money spent on veterans who have passed away who are still being sent disability compensation.\nI’m a huge supporter of Pres. Trump, and I’ve been generally pleased with his agency/dept picks. However, in response to a veteran friend’s concerns about “cuts to veterans’ services and benefits,” I pulled up Sec. Collins’ video above, and I was wholly unimpressed and underwhelmed by the Secretary’s drive-by remarks and his folksy, gee whiz attitude. It struck me as arrogant (“I’m so smart I don’t need preparation”) and lazy, too lazy not to have developed SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIVE rebuttals to the left’s SPECIFIC allegations.\nMore directly: Mr. Secretary, Pres. Trump has given you this incredible honor and entrusted you with this grave responsibility to lead this august Department in serving our treasured veterans, women and men to whom we owe the highest debt to provide them and their families/caregivers the very highest quality healthcare and service. Lack of preparation and lack of seriousness is disrespectful and is not going to cut it! It might be fine to “wing it” or “phone it in” as a commentator on a news show, but it’s not appropriate for this position! Going forward, if you don’t actually KNOW the specific allegations leveled against the Department, then be smart enough to have your deputies brief you first. Then PREPARE your remarks WITH SPECIFICITY, before you go on camera. Your response was not only vapid, it was embarrassing. I was therefore forced to go elsewhere to address my veteran friend’s very real concerns, to which she was entitled to receive a responsive, quality, SUBSTANTIVE answer. Until your staff can bring you up to speed, here’s a simple response you could have given (though we should be able to expect far more from you, since you head the Department – you should be the resident EXPERT on all things V.A.!):\nhttps://youtu.be/1K9X4lHIFgE?si=z1Q-yC-7ctgUCaJx\nPlease relay all of my remarks to the Secretary.\n“At VA, we are focused on saving money so it can be better spent on Veteran care. We thank these employees for their service to VA. This was a tough decision, but ultimately it’s the right call to better support the Veterans, families, caregivers, and survivors the department exists to serve,” Doug Collins.\nAn Oxymoron statement to say the least…you’re a used car salesman (no offense meant to used car salesman) you will say anything to accomplish your ultimate objective just like your Commander and Chief ( Project 2025 ) Zero hope for a fair and impartial government and VA. And by the way cutting Veterans from their jobs is truly heartless. Dick move Doug! Why not start with the 10 million in bonuses for the upper echelon in the VA. I wonder!\nThe buck stops at Trump, he chose this guy. He should be held accountable for his poor choice. He also chose the OMB head, who is the real threat to Veteran’s benefits.\nI have one word. BULLSH-T\ngulf war veterans need a reform act in 2025/2026.\nis there feed back ?\nWe are in need of help from the top\nThere is a “Scam” on the disability claims on the veterans. I have been fighting it for over a year and a half with minimal outcome. My local VA veteran advocate is a Star, but the data input center in Janesville Wisconson is a constant “let down”. The failure is the VA hand-off to private 3rd parties for the “confirmation appointments.\nI’d be glad to share the details with a real Military Veteran in Secretary Collins office if someone can contact me …\nCollins is full of it and services will fall significantly. Our government leaders are liars, who maintain control by continual misrepresentation. Too bad the many believe others because of their own inability to control themselves. Do not expect anything from our government because it has become self evident that those leaders can only enrich themselves by screwing those they supposedly represent\nLies lies lies. People have never waited longer for their benefits to be approved, you won’t give them the services they need or medications, and make disabled people drive for hours to see a doctor that can’t do their job because of your policies. You should be ashamed to stand there and lie like that you monster\nSounds like someone with a Bad Chicken Dinner, eh?\nDishonorable discharges get nothing from American taxpayers.\nTrump administration begins mass firings across government\nFri, February 14, 2025 at 9:28 PM CST\n“more than 1,000 at the Department of Veterans Affairs,”\nHow does firing 1,000’s of people at the VA help improve services to us?\nConcerned with taxing VA disability that was proposed in Dec 2024 – this would greatly impact many disabled vets and their families. Spouses who get CHAMPVA due to their vet spouse having P&T 100% disability should be able to use the VA facilities. Meds by Mail under CHAMPVA take close to 3 weeks to fill prescriptions.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collins, Thank you for your service. I personally have had a hard time receiving assistance after going through major domestic violence with one of your Marines. Honorable President Trump with his administration April 2018 placed my case under Major Domestic Violence. Cherry Point Base referred me to the VA in New Bern a few years ago. Congressman Murphy office stated they would be glad to help when I have a VA claim. I do Sir that Honorable Senator Elizabeth Dole and the Department of Social Services assisted me with in 2008. They have a copy of my claim, yet nothing. I have lost my dad as a United States World War Two veteran, my mom, two Aunts and I was told I would never see my brother a live. They took many years of special occasions and holidays away from me. They changed the course of my life and family unnaturally. One of the biggest problems is they have my domestic violence money and compounding it and spending it their project with making thousands off myself and family every day. They continue to give my husband federal money and benefits after the Trump administration placed my case under major domestic violence. NC is a 50/50 state with out domestic violence issues. Major discrimination. I have been in and out of homelessness while owning property which there was a mistake on. They have taken away my constitutional rights, liberty rights, civil rights, fundamental rights and denied me attorney. I have contacted Randy Forbes with Green Traurig in Washington DC with notifying President Trump, With the United States Supreme Court as they continue to take my life and family for money. The only assistance that I have been receiving is from Craven Community College, while attending, DSS, and a family from the college to assist in care giving to one of their families. I have been staying with a elder for the last few months. Sir I have requested mercy and grace from President Trump as this has cost a total of 30 years of the quality of my life and family. A few years ago I had spoken to Diane from Winston Salem VA as they do know that this was major domestic violence with one of their marines. Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin I am requesting mercy and grace from the VA to have closure on my case. Thank you.\nI deal with the VA in Hampton I get my medication‘s by Mail from Hampton my doctor is in Hampton Dr. Chip route and I don’t have no issues with the VA I get 100% disability from the VA for ancient Orange Vietnam and now I got chronic bronchitis That I filed another claim for but when I get my medication I got all this paperwork with the medication‘s which I don’t think they need I always throw it in the garbage I think they should go paperless when they’re sending your medication’s to you just about every veteran knows what their Vedic medications are for I think they should cut back on the paperwork that goes in the mail that ends up in the garbage it’s costing the money to print it cost the money to buy the paper for packaging all the paperwork is in the package when you get it with your pills good luck to all veterans and the va .vetnam vet\nAbsolutely true! The reams of paper sent to me (with my name and address on every page) is completely unnecessary. Maybe only when the medication is first prescribed and perhaps once a year at renewal would suffice? As it is now, the bill for paper alone in the Pharmacy must be a big hit on the overall budget.\nYa’ll believe this if you want. Musk is running it all and is making millions a day on government contracts. They don’t care about vets or anyone that’s not elite. It’s all part of Project 2025 and put it out there. Ya’ll done F around And Found Out. People want to blame Trump, but he’s so far deep in, clueless and he’s lost control and only doing what’s he being told.\nThankyou for taking care of the Veterans.I am Vietnam Veteran.I was over there from earley 1968 to 1970.I had two tours with the 39th cav.The VA has been very good to me and still are.Thankyou very much for all the help they have given me.\nI don’t believe a word from you or the Traitor and his clowns.\nSo…you were pleased with the dementia patient in the Oval Office the past 4 years?\nDonald J. Trump and JD Vance are patriots.\nSo many on disability that musk or Trump don’t care about am afraid\nNeither served\nTru\nO called the dead losers and suckers\nBought his deferment from the draft. Bone spurs. Don’t let them hurt the veterans that suffer.\nToo bad the VA doesn’t treat TDS. Because you got it bad! Get help before you stroke out.\nWe need a New Greenville Clinic here in South Carolina in. There no Staff, No warm AC, NO cafeteria, not enough services. and Our Veteran cannot find any VR@E services available! the Negligence is above and beyond! The chief of staff and Medical Director of Columbia need to be replaced as of yesterday!!\nThank you for the update. We need to do something about the rating system for service connection. I’m currently rated at 70% for PTSD, 50% for my feet, 30% for my lung (gulf war veteran), 10% for hearing, and 10% for my back that I have had 3 surgeries on and will need another one within the year. This is crazy!!! I’m rated at 90% rather then 100% and only 10% for my back!!! I can barely walked and stand not able to work anymore but I’m 90% that has taken since 2011 to get this rating!!! We need to fix this!!! ASAP\nFile for your presumptive condition. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue and IBS. ASAP!\nWe the Veterans love to have a 9/11 post Veteran running this Gigantic Trojan Horse and making sure, he can Taim it well. the Horse has been acting while for many years and is time that our sheriff in town. keeps it well behaved!!\nThis is not true. Collins isn’t be honest. I have several friends that are Veteran Service Officer’s have been FIRED.\nMr. Collins,\nCan you please get rid of the mandate to take the COVID-19 (so called vaccine) and the flu shots as a VA healthcare worker. My family was mandated to take it and now have permanent side effects. This should be a personal decision not mandated by employers, or government agencies.\nNoone is required to take C19 anymore.\nYou are being a lying drama queen. It was never mandated in the first place.\nGood to see a real leader that has been where many of us have been,\nthanks for taking the rein’s Sir\nClearing cases quicker? I had a claim in since 6/2024 to add a dependent and it has been in step 1 of the process for 8 months. I checked the status today and the VA website says I now have no claims. I called the VA and they told me the VA closed the claim. No action taken! The VA rep had no clue as to why they would close it. This is adding a dependent back on. This should not be a difficult request and it certainly shouldn’t take 8 months then have your claim closed with no action taken.\nSame here since July 25, 2024. The claim is stuck in the “claim received “ stage. I’ve emailed AskVA several times and keep getting the same response about they identified a problem in their program and they are working on it as quickly as possible, blah, blah, blah.\nThe VA claims process is a joke at best! As far as firings go, I only have issues with the half illiterate DEI employees behind the office counters. They need to go and be replaced with competent employees who stay off of their personal phones and stop their personal conversations when someone is trying to check in/out, ask a question, etc. There was an incident at the VAMC that I go to where they were behind the sliding glass having story time. A Vet walked up, the girl at the counter turned around, saw him standing there, and then turned back around and continued story time. The Vet slid the glass window open and the girl went off on him in front of everyone. It did not end well for either. She got snatched through the window opening and he was detained by the VA rent-a-cops. I don’t know how much trouble he got into, but hopefully she learned that some Vets are easily triggered and you don’t talk to us like we’re off the streets.\nI’m just happy I can put names to faces.\nWe need a roundtable discussion about national issues related to our service connected disability’s. The VA staff and Doctors are not listening and we need a special exemption for presumption rules that are lacking from the Gulf War 1990/1991 War Zone. We should be treated the same way the OiF /OEF are getting. 1991 War Veterans are not getting the treatments they deserve. We need National Attention on this matter. The law needs to change post 1990 Veterans.\nAs the parent of a veteran who was wounded in battle, not given medical attention and then operated on because he had a growth coming out of the side of his head where he had been impacted and they “couldn’t send him back with that” and then had to wait until 2017 to receive full benefits, I don’t understand. I have within the last 8 months applied for his medical records again from NARA. They referred me to the Army and the Army has not responded to my request to have my son put on a Casualty list and be given the Purple Heart which he bled for. Please let me know who I can contact to get this processed and also get a car which a paraplegic can drive (applied on 3/2024). Also have the home modified, and his benefits listed as 100% service-connected instead of 90% 10% unemployability. This happened in 1/1991. Please help to resolve.\nContact Wounded Warrior Project.\nGood morning Doctor Bonafoux Rivera, I want to express my gratitude and respect for your courage and commitment to help your son. This forum here will not be able to resolve this issue. You may need to contact your local VBA or VHA and work with a patient advocate or a veteran organization like the legion or DVA. If you must you can also reach out to the congressman or senators from your state as they may be able to put assistance on this issue. I wish your son and the family health and strength, please stay focused and do not give up. The nation and all other veterans are with you.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nMr. Secretary, Pres.Trump & etc..Its hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThey were used eveyday in all base camps. Stiring everything they could burn in these pits, by our hands\nusing wooden poles and no mask or breathing , no eye protection, no hearing protection, no protective clothing you name it.\nAll done by the lowest ranking personnel.\nSo the VN vets file claims for Asthma, skin cancers and etc… all denied !\nSo what else can they do to us?\nThis is where the military got its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it! Correct the failures of last aministrations who have failed us.\nSecretary Collins and Presdient Trump administration\nThank you\nThe DOD has long maintained that there never was any Agent Orange on Okinawa. This is a lie. It was used to clear foliage along the Kadena AFB perimeter fence. In 1971 the DOD (under pressure from the Japanese Government) conducted “Operation Red Hat” where all poisonous gases and defoliants were transferred to Johnston Atoll aboard naval ships. Those sailors involved are eligible for Agent Orange treatment and compensation. Those Okinawan Marines who loaded these chemicals onto deuce and halvess and delivered them to the dock are not! I developed high level and profuse prostate cancer (classic result of Agent Orange exposure). It had to be removed. The VA wouldn’t cover it because “there was never any Agent Orange on Okinawa. I can deliver proof that there was. In fact, years later there were many barrels of AO found buried at Camp Foster where l was assugned.\nUnder Biden the pact act was passed to help veterans that was impacted from burn pits get your story right\nNot Vietnam burn pits sparky\nThe VA claims that the benefits are improving and the care is improving. When I needed a x-ray on my neck it took 3 months to get a order and by then I already had a ct scan at the hospital which the care wasn’t any better. I ended up going to Vanderbilt emergency surgery to remove a tumor off my spine. VA or any civilian care around where I live is hopeless.\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\n————————————————————-\nThere isnt enough room and they only allow 5,000 words here. So you will find the bulk of my remarks on the VA Facebook post of this article. Im a 28 year advocate, Disabled combat veteran, and served of a VA federal advisory committee – ACGWV in 2009. In 2003 I was world famous for opposing the deployment of troops to Iraq. Last 3 years Ive pummeled this public comments portion of New.va.gov over VA RAC meetings, and found VA ignores these public comment portions.\nIm a subject matter expert with a lot to offer. Im also a historian having participated in our plight since 1997. So Ive learned one thing about VA, unless your part of the wealthy in the executive branch – then they dont care. Ive looked out the Sec of VAs window long ago, and this is my 14th Sec of VA to deal with. As long as Im a poor disabled veteran, Im not worthy of there time. It didnt use to be this way.\nClearing cases faster? Over a year ago, l filed a 511 claim. It took a year to clear when the average clearance time was 14 months. My claim was rejected due to “not service connected”! 511 claims are for injuries sustained in VA hospitals. There is never a service connection in 511 claims!\nI’m fighting an 1151 claim going on 10 years. They are always denied. Then you go into the never ending appeals process. Get help from DAV or another VSO or organization. And keep an eye on them because some of them aren’t competent either.\nVA’s answer to my questions is to block my cell phone internet access to va.gov\nwhich says volumes. Sec of VA Doug Collins signed off on that for it to happen.\nHe has no intentions of helping anyone in my income bracket.\nPretty sure we have another coward Sec of VA that doesnt face veterans unless\nhe benefits from it some how. As Ive only written 4 emails and asked simple\nquestions. I think the biggest reason they are dodging me is I found there maybe\na 1 in 5 rate of ALS in those that served the last 34 years. At minimum 1 in 10.\nWell, Ive got my answer then. Snob Sec of VA. Religious zealot with a superiority\ncomplex. He is one of the chosen, and I am not. Seen enough of these. Its gods will\nmy life has been like this, and some of us are just unlucky. He only has time for\nhis fellow followers, believers, and the rest of us are wrong.\nGoing to be a very bad year for us veterans. Till folks catch on.\nI have been assigned a new VA clinic that recently opened. I have a new Doctor. How is the order to fire all new federal employees going to affect my new clinic and my Doctor? I have been exposed to Agent Orange and currently have a mass in my lung and also in my throat. I am scheduled for surgery in May, is that still going to happen? I put in a claim for my agent orange exposure, is that still going to be processed? When you say your clearing cases faster than ever, is that because your just saying NO quickly? What percentage of claims are you denying? The scuttlebutt is that all new claims will be denied. This stuff is giving me a lot of anxiety.\nThank you Mr. Collins. Not to shabby for your first week!\nAs a Government employee for 40 years (NAVY-VA combined), I see there is nothing easy or quick about applying for benefits. I have given up on reopening claims. I can relate to some of these comments.\nKeep the faith!\nMadam Collins,\nThank you for denying these allegations and simply telling us lies. The truth would be unbearable and make the administration look bad. Please refrain from telling the truth if it makes you look bad. Continue to lie to us and we will believe you as long as your lies are what we want to hear.\nMadam Collins? What are you, 10 yrs old. Grow up and act like a Veteran who served Honorably, but my guess is that you probably didn’t.\nHe’s probably from ME and has been writing to Susan Collins. Cut and paste. Your reply indicates more about your own values than his. You should be ashamed not him or her.\nYou know darn well he meant Secretary of VA Collins. You should be ashamed that your momma gave birth to you.\nHello Mr. Collins. If you want to see what is really going on in the VA that are supposed to be knowledgeable veteran raters, please sir contact me and I will give you the details to look at my case. I have called my congressman, called my senator, call the complaint line twice and my claim is a hardship claim, Going on eleven months and been to 16 C&P exams. I have done everything that I can think of. I know this comment won’t reach your eyes but you have staff that hates veterans. The more they can give you the run around and not rate your claim, the better the must feel about themselves. The VA is violating their own regulations and I will be happy to provide rules they set about medical evidence and exams. Everytime I complain too loud, they has VES set me up more appointments. Then they lie to you when you can see your file and have screen shots to prove they are not being honest. USMC 3/1972 – 11/1974\nDOGE has absolutely NO authority to access veteran’s personal information. It is NOT a legitimate organization and therefore needs to be blocked.\nI personally trust a multi Billionaire, more than the past dozen supposed leaders, we all need to face it our info is already out there , as many time as we have had medical record swappers, the streamlining of our services, out info has been jeopardized decades ago, let them find and let us all know what our tax dollars have been blown away on, when we had people in charge who didn’t even know which gender they are you were seriously comprised,\nHave faith in the powers that now be.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nspoken like am intelligent person. Good on you. too many here speak without knowing truth.\nWhy on earth would you trust a billionaire that fired the people who were investigating his companies within the first month of being placed in a position? Musk is literally only here for the money that he will earn. He does not care for us nor for any Democracy, hence why he was supporting the far-right parties of European countries.\nWhy would you trust a billionaire who is firing thousands of people so he can save more money on his taxes? Why would you trust a man who is destroying NASA so he can get his personal company more contracts from the government? Think about it for a moment, please. You don’t become a multi-billionaire without deciding money is the most important thing in your entire life, and he is going to sell us all down the river so he can become the world’s first trillionaire.\nI pray that you are not serious. People do not become billionaires because they are honest or trustworthy. If you are willing to toss away your constitutional rights to privacy, that is your choice. Real Americans are not built that way.\nFaith is believing what you know ain’t true. – Mark Twain\nI am posting to question your comment that no benefits are being cut back. I am an 80 year old 100% service connected total and permanent disabled Viet Nam veteran. I am homebound and unable to effectively perform most of the normal activities of daily life. For most of 2024 the VA Community Care Team in Dallas Texas awarded me 58 hours a week of Home Healthcare Aid. This allowed me to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and my quality of life was very good. In August of 2024 my weekly hours were reduced to 11 hours a week and after an appeal this was increased to 13 hours a week. When the time for review and renewal for this benefit arrived in 2025 I was again awarded 13 hours. Any reasonable person can do the math and see thar 13 hours for a 7 day week equals 1.8 hours/day. As most providers require a minimum of 4 hours/day this leaves me with help for three days out of a seven day week. On many occasions when I contacted the VA about this benefit I was told that all of the veterans in this area were being cut back. No reason was given.\nThe VA needs more people, not less. It took me 1 year to get a specialist approval in the Community Care system. They don’t have enough nurses to approve cases. It’s good my issue wasn’t life threatening. Also, cuts to benefits, including disability compensation have been proposed in Project 2025, the conservative playbook that the administration appears to be following.\nDear President Trump,\nI am writing to make you aware of an injustice that has been done to veterans across the country, I left active duty in 1994 after serving 11 years as an active-duty Army officer. I was offered a bonus of $61,201.91 based on time served and my rank. Congress authorized DoD to offer these bonuses so the military could reach Congressionally-mandated force levels without involuntarily dismissals.\nThat bonus, $61,201.91, was taxed by the Internal Revenue Service by 28% ($17,136.53.), leaving my net bonus $44,065.38 which I received May 31, 1994 and my family and I used to put money down on a home and to bridge the gap between the security of a military career and the insecurity of beginning another career, which was the purpose of the bonus.\nWithin a month of leaving the Army, I received a letter from the VA stating that I was authorized 10 percent disability payments of VA Disability Compensation, $87.00 monthly at the time. The same letter told me that I would not receive that amount because I had received a separation bonus and that they would recoup my VADC until they had recouped my bonus amount. 21 years later, in 2015, the VA let me know that they had recouped the net amount of my bonus, $44,065.38 and I started receiving VADC.\nI also continued my military career in the Army Reserve – ultimately qualifying for reserve component retirement which began for me at age 60 (February 15, 2021). The Defense Finance and Accounting Service told me that they were also required to also recoup my 1994 separation bonus, less what the VA recouped.\nDFAS, however made it clear that the law allowed them to recoup the “pre-tax amount,” less what the VA recouped. So DFAS told me that the balance I owed to them was $17,136.53; that’s precisely the amount the IRS withheld in 1994.\nThe first problem is that the law doesn’t really say what DFAS says it says. DFAS interprets the law to benefit the bureaucracy. The language in the law is NOT clear, but instead of giving the benefit of the doubt to the Soldier, they give the benefit of the doubt to the government. The second problem is that DFAS cites laws, rules and policy and they claim that they have no choice but to follow the “rules” but they do not follow the same rules and policies when it requires them to do certain things.\nEssentially, Congress, DoD, DFAS, and the VA played a massive decades-long shell game to move and shift money. Congress gave DoD the money to complete that post-Cold War, 1990s drawdown with the minimum amount of financial pain to the service-person. DoD and the VA then figured out ways to get that money back and use it for other purposes.\nMy bonus has been taxed three times – once in 1994 by 28% ($17,136.53.) a second time by the VA by $44,065.38 and again in 2021 by 28% ($17,136.53) by DFAS. I’ve had to pay back to the government $78,338.44 for a bonus of $61,201.91.\nThat’s a tax rate of 125 percent. DOGE needs to look into this\nI am seeking help on this, not so much for myself, but for other veterans who are in difficult financial situations and who could truly benefit.\nHere is an online petition with more comments\nhttps://www.ipetitions.com/petition/va-recoupment-of-disable-veterans-ssbvsi-payments\nA military retirement represents much more than the dollar figure involved; it represents an acknowledgement of the sacrifice made by the Serviceperson, their family and loved ones. It represents the covenant that Soldiers, Airmen, Marines, and Sailors underwrite, endorse and embrace as free citizens of a great nation. We sign that covenant with our own blood and with the blood of our families who sacrifice in ways that are inexplicable to those unfamiliar with military service. Bureaucratic rules and processes such as the ones I described diminish in tangible and palpable ways the reciprocal feelings of goodwill, devotion, and affection that servicepeople should feel toward their Nation\nIt seems that programs like the Veterans Transportation Network would be prime targets of Musk and the Muskrats.\nVeterans with 100per cent disability get free dental care at VA. Why can’t veterans with 90 per cent disability disability be given the same preference? Can one of our representatives in Washington proposes putting forward a bill before Congress to make this a law.? Many veterans cannot afford private insurance.\nMy husband died because it took a month or longer to set him up with doctors and approve them! After he died VA denied an ambulance bill of $5,000 just because of a 72 hour rule I had never heard of! When my husband was dying and needed an ambulance do you think I would think to contact you? I informed the ambulance service that he was a veteran they should have done something! Another Joe Biden/Kamala Harris F up! That last hospital visit I was finally told after a few trips there and they claimed flu and pneumonia; was actually the last stages of cancer in his lungs and mastesized through his esophagus and other areas and had gone to his liver and kidneys! VA NEEDS a complete overhaul of doctors, administrators and all! It has gone to crap!!!!\nThis crap is Biden Harris doing’s!!!!\nFile a TORT CLAIM. You are right the hospital is supposed to contact the VA. If I’m dying how can I call the VA? I can’t!\nI’m so sorry about your husband! The VA IS totally screwed up but it always has been. I’ve had my own issues with ambulance payments, incorrect diagnoses- repeatedly for different issues and was never as happy as when I aged into Medicare and could avoid the VA most of the time! That said, this has nothing to do with who is President. The VA does it’s own thing under the VA Sec and we have had a whole lot of losers over the last 20 years and before that. And the VA Sec is restrained by the amount of money allocated by Congress. Don’t blame Biden/Harris. They inherited the VA from the past 100+years and they only had a Democratic Congress for 2 years to try and make changes. They did allocate a lot of new money for a lot of programs including the VA. The last 2 years the GOP got nothing done. And now Trump is rolling back all that money, those programs, and making deep cuts of funds and personnel. This post by Sec Collins is a bunch of BS. You wait and see.\nI too, have a Biden/Harris story. I am now a widow. The VA’s failings began long before Trump and Musk. The VA and the DOJ (grant programs)both waste serious money.\nTrump and his administration is pro service member. I have every confidence they will honor the commitment to our veterans. I am a veteran and I am a former VA employee. There are thousands like me who will stand up to anyone who tries to undo the sacred services for our fellow veterans.\nWe know there is stuff that needs to be cut and procurement regulations improved. Perhaps even high paid upper management could need trimming but I hope they retain all the dedicated staff that is high performing and needed and cut only those who aren’t.\nI welcome this opportunity to reevaluate government that so many administrations have failed to do in the past. Let this process play out.\nIt amazes me that you, as a veteran who pledged allegiance to the Constitution, pledge fealty to an unelected billionaire sociopath and sitting, draft-dodging, puppet “president”. All this, despite the literal acts of treason on Jan 6th. The ability to be so committed and vested in sociopaths who do NOT have your best interest in mind and are solely motivated to make themselves richer and more powerful at the American people’s expense is baffling to me.\nMaking the government more efficient and eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse is a fantastic goal.\nWhat this administration is doing is NOT that and if you choose to actually evaluate their actions and consequences, maybe you will understand what is happening to our country.\nNo facts. That is what you offered. You would rather have Biden? Obama? Maybe Clinton. Fraud, waste and abuse must stop. You and I paid for others to defraud the United States and to fund terrorists. So, “and if you choose to actually evaluate their” (Dems) actions and consequences, maybe ytou will understand what is happening to our country”. Surely you do not believe that our country was better with 4 years of previous administration?\nJan of 2024 Biden signed an executive order that authorized the 24/7 surveillance of all American Citizens. That is actually called the most treasonous act of any American president in history. Just saying.\nYou are not a Patriot, this is an untruth at best and more likely a lie. It wasn’t an executive order, it was an extension of the previous bill after it was re-authorized by Congress. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It does NOT surveil ALL US citizens 24/7. I assume you have a reason to be concerned? I don’t.\nPlease do your research before posting incorrect information. In April 2024 President Biden signed a BILL that had bipartisan support (60-34 vote in Senate) EXTENDING a key US surveillance program (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) that was first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since. It targets non-Americans in other countries and communications of Americans in contact with those targeted foreigners. Google it for more truthfuland educational information.\nYes, would prefer any of them over a draft dodging convicted felon.\nAnybody spouting opposition to what Trump and DOGE are doing is simply uninformed. We could not have a better, more supportive leader for this nation and our military and veterans.\nMazel Tov Secretary Doug Collins! Is there a way that us senior Veterans receiving their medications (Not narcotics) can be automatically sent without having to remember to reorder them every month or every other month? Online, mail, phone call to pharmacy, message to the primary physician is sometimes diffucult to remember and sometimes confusing?\nAsk if you can get 90 day supply and If you have an online account, when you receive your medicine go online and check the box to order a refill. According to a technician in the in hospital pharmacy, when the refill is due, it will be mailed out automatically.\nSecVA Anthony J. Principi addressed waste in a 2005 op-ed for WaPo.\nHe outlined changes that could save the government 125 billion dollars without harming veteran quality of care.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/va-isnt-broken-but-its-in-desperate-need-of-change/2018/04/10/54cb1c0c-3c0a-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html\nSo the news media is making all of this story up out of whole cloth?\n“This executive order seeks to impose severe hiring restrictions and would disproportionately harm veterans, who make up one-third of the federal workforce. Requiring agencies to hire only one new employee for every four who leave will drastically reduce VA staffing levels. At a time when the veteran population is aging and the VA’s mission has expanded under Biden, this policy will lead to massive delays and outright denials in health care, benefits processing, and disability claims – the essential services veterans depend on to survive.”\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-and-musk-are-going-to-war-against-military-veterans/ar-AA1yZkRm\nYou obviously have not read the actual order. You must be listening to MSN’s version of the facts, which are very tainted (to Left Wing propaganda). Do not be a sheep. President Trump is doing the right things, and I see nothing that DOGE is doing that will impact veterans negatively. Quite the opposite. Waste and abuse are being eliminated, money will be going where it should be now.\nDear Honorable Secretary Collins,\nCongratulations on your new assignment as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am elated that you have encouraged veterans to come and see you for the truth of what is going on. In addition your promise to ensure and protect the VA from cuts with your heart and the God that you serve. According to the weekly report there are 953,078 pending VA disability claims as of February 8, 2025, and a Back Log of 254,679 claims. What is the plan to insure that there will be enough employees to continue adjuicating these claims, if many of the government employees opt out and leave Veterans Affairs or are fired? Hiring is not just a come to work, it is a long process to learn how to adjuicate claims.\nRespectfully,\nRochelle Crump,\nFormer VA Regional Office Employee, 23 years Government Service\nUnited States Womens Army Corps (WAC) Vietnam Era\nLet’s make sure that these said employees doing claims are even qualified to do so. I did a claim back in 2022 and then shortly after my claim came back with more red tape to slash, a newsletter came out from the VA stating that the personnel they had doing claims were not qualified to do them. You can find a lot of information about VA subject matter at the GAO website. Government Accountability Office.\nThank you for your service and this letter! 10 years and waiting.\nWhat’s Doug Collins’ email address?\nGreat to hear from you so candidly Honorable Collins! As a VA Nurse and a surviving Navy and Army Veteran spouse, I have some concerns and an initiative to share regarding a service members eligibility for state VA nursing home care. I would like to share some thoughts with you and or your staff. Please advise. Thank you for your service then and now!\nThank God and my Savior Jesus Christ for President Trump and Secretary Collins for their love and dedication to America and those who have and continue to serve Her and protect Her!\nCongratulations secretary Collins. You are a patriot and I know the VA will be in very capable hands under your leadership.\nI read yesterday that they may target veterans with service connected disability who also draw social security. That sounds about right for this crime family.\nCan you post the source you read this from?\nThank you Secretary Collins I hope to see you in person when you visit the Phoenix VA. Be safe and God Bless!\nMr. Collins,\nI would like to speak to you about the years of horrible healthcare I have received from the VA. This has included waiting three years and writing three different Georgia Senators to try to get help. Furthermore, I have lost coverage for six months numerous times and no one can tell me why. Please contact me at the email below to hear more. I also have an easy way to make VA Healthcare a lot better for Veterans.\nThank You Secretary Collins !!! I feel better every day now. God Bless you.\nhttps://veteranspolicy.org/post/project-2025s-war-on-veterans/\nProject 2025 plans to dismantle the VA. Read the article wake up. They are coming for veterans as well.\nMr Collins,\nI myself will hold your feet to the fire about our personal information, health records, treatments not being invaded by a non approved group(DOGE). Further, any cuts or changes to the VA benefits by the Project 2025 will fall on you! Any services that are taken away from Veterans is a complete insult by your boss! Keep your word as you would in deed!\nI don’t believe a word any of them say. There is no reason an illegal immigrate tech billionaire with no military service and multiple failed enterprises should be poking around the VA much less any part of the government.\nyou have never done anything and it Didn’t go the way you wanted?,\nDon’t believe it. He is shaking hands with the devil while telling his living in hell is the better than heaven.\nMy dependents request has been sitting there untouched since August. It would be nice if someone would at least open the file and respond with in process or something.\nI had the same problem with CHAMPVA- I opened a congressional inquiry\nCan’t believe what they say, my husband passed a decorated Nam vet. 6yuears ago, they said he had cancer spots, we ask can you do a biopsy? Doc said ahh, don’t worry it’s not growing it’s very small. An aggressive cancer seven months later he passed. There’s the supposed compensation for this type of cancer, and for the burning of pits in Nam,, to late now, I can’t claim nothing, So they say. They were negligent\nSorry for your loss.\nIts hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThis is where the military gone its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it! Correct the failures of last aministrations who have failed us.\nSecretary Collins and Presdient Trump administration\nFile a TORT claim for negligence.\nSecretary Mr Collins.\nMy Issue is Burn Pits!\nIn Vietnam Burn pits were almaost a everyday issue in all base camps using wooden poles.\nWe using gasoline and diesel and keep stiring it by hand, burning it down as much as possible.\nWhat went in them was everything you can amagine, for 10years.\nThis was always done by low ranking personnel.\nNo breathing appliance, no earing protection, no body protection except your clothes you have on.\nSo If you think about it, that’s where the Middle East wars got the idea.\nSo, please help stop some of this dissreguard for the Vietnam Veterans.\nIn 1991 we were all told the VN war was started on a Lie, we were not attacked by North Vietnam.\nWOW how did we all feel after that? How did we feel coming home where we were hated in a lot\nof places.\nJust look into an See.\nFrom the looks of some of the comments, they need to file a claim for TDS from Service connected injuries sustained by watching Fake News. Seek some help and get your 100% for Psychosis.\nYou’re acting like a child. Grow up\nAmen!! Very refreshing Sir.\nAmen brother. What a bunch of sea lawyers on here.\nThanks for the update Doug! We know you have our back and of course prepare for all the left’s Fear-Mongering. That’s all they have left and yes the gravy train is over.\nHay just went to VA at Hines in ILLINOIS I need surgery on left knee, I am 100% disabled Vietnam Veteran Marine, they said I will have to wait four months for a appointment, that is bad I need help,\nFrank Lasick Jr\nIf you don’t have Medicare or Medicaid from your State I’d highly recommend looking into it. I have always received much better health care from Medicare than the VA.\nIt’s been 16 months waiting for a dependent, my wife to. be put on my va benefits. We call the local va office in our location and they tell us it is still open\nWhy is it taking so long?\nCongrats VA Secretary Collin’s, this I will say ..say what you mean & mean what you say…personally don’t have any faith in DOGE…but now seeing is believing…Pentagon is next in line\nWOW! Congratulations Doug Collins & Thank You President Trump for realizing the Competence & Quality of this Patriotic Man from Georgia! Doug ~ I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran having served in Camp Lejeune North Carolina wherein I endured, proudly I might add, “Advanced Combat Infantry Training” > The Camp Lejeune Justice Act is intended to help Marines like myself having had to drink contaminated water ~ every hour~ every day ~ that I was stationed there in 1963 AD. I am a survivor of Colon Cancer ~ Prostate Cancer ~ Kidney Disease ~ COPD and many more illnesses. GOD has been Watching Over Me as I recently turned 90 years of age. I have participated in Monthly Zoom Webinars conducted by my Attorneys’ Wallace & Graham,Salisbury NC since I became their Client representing me in 2021AD. As of this writing very few settlements { 8%} have OCCURRED UNDER the PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. Call Me Doug when you get a chance Bob Higgins Semper Fi\nSo happy that you are the Veteran’s Secretary! Our Veterans are in good hands! Thank you Doug Collin’s and by the way, my cousin, Jim Miller, is your doppelgänger. He is a retired Texas Ranger and he not only looks just like you, he talks just like you! It is uncanny! Hope all goes well with your new position and I know you will help our Veterans fairly and improve on Veteran’s care. Charlotte Naizer. Belton, Texas\nI don’t believe anything this administration Elon, Trump or VA director say. If their lips are moving their lying.\n100 percent agree. Project 2025 talks about dismantling the VA as well. This man is just giving us lip service.\nAmen to that!\nVa and the so called benefits is bs. First I was turned down for not serving 2 years when I was just short. And now vso supposedly put in claim for me but va never received it. Lies and corruption is all it is. Vets don’t get anything. You put your life on the line so ungrateful -ss people can deny you. Then you now see why vets kill them self or blow sh-t up or just run ungrateful -ss people down. Maybe you people should give vets the positions to help vet\nNot crooked -ss politicians who just pad their pockets and screw vets\nMaybe do some research. Don’t speak for those who actually served and actually defended this country by risking our lives. You said “maybe you people should give vets the positions and help vets”.. Glad you said that because Doug Collins is in the Air Force. haha.\nNo way these comments are coming from vets. The only whiny vets I’ve heard from was from the air force\nHey buddie, I’m not whining and I am AIR FORCE\nI’m a vet and nothing but hopeful and positive feeling of the way I hope things will be, think about another 4 years of what we just had.\nCongratulations your Honorable Doug Collins I have been an admirer of you for years and know the VA is going to be enhanced with your expertise. Your Honor I do not know the staff member to send my letter to so I am sending it to you. Thank you for your past service and from here on there is no past just a future of service. We look forward to the future success you will have in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nthis man sounds sincere.i am hoping he will do a good job..\nI am employee at a VA Hosp in California and my democrat colleagues can be disruptive to my workflow, making efficiency even worse. They cannot move on from the election result. I just want going to work and do my job. Leadership seems to tolerate since they probably have the same politics. Also, our local workers union is fear-mongering and misaligning your messages.\nI have Coumity Care and when my doctor request blood work i have to go to a private provider where the VA has a facility very close to my doctor and has a lab but will not accept me but they pay the private company $800 to do blood work\nTY Dec Collins! As a VA Hosp employee, I can say we really use some efficiency, restructuring and less woke culture.\nI agree! VA Nurse too.\nGood morning,\nIt would be nice if there was a way for us VA employees to make suggestions on ways to cut down on unnecessary procedures and wastefulness and see it followed through.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nAh, so just go get screwed to the women, black, LGBTQ, and other minority Vets that served then? If you are truly a VA Nurse, you need to get fired for not taking care of ALL of your Veterans. Woke means positive change and moving forward. Do you really want to go back into the past? Silly questions…of course, you and others like you want to. Leaning into hate is just…well, hateful and disgusting.\nCan we please get dental care for veterans using VA health care any medical problems can occur due to bad dental issues would be nice if we could use community care in my veterans get dental care as well as medical care!\nIf you go to your PCP and ask for a referral to dental due to health issues, the VA has to honor it and then dental becomes a health issue. Also check your DD214 and see if block 17 is checked yes or no. This has to do with a final dental exam upon discharge. If it is checked NO then the VA has to pick up any dental that was done in the service.\nI Coumity Care and TriWest should issue an insurance card to provider the medical staff on contact billing info\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult. He’s one of the ones trying to tax our disability compensation.\nATTN: Dept of Veterans Affairs\n5 yrs ago I wrote to you\nNothing new here, getting fuked again by the VA I will be filing a Federal Lawsuit Against the VA for FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FAILURE TO PAY LEGAL LAWFUL BILLS DUE AND OWING TO CIVILIAN HOSPITALS, Doctors, Nurses, Technicians, Rescue Squads, ie. The Choice Program and For Ruining my FICO SCORES and CREDIT REPUTATION due to Collection Agencies and their Harrassment. ALONG WITH THE VA, I will also name Congressman Tom O’Halleran CD 1 AZ and his Veteran Representative in Casa Grande, AZ , for not acting for over 2 years on this issue as well as individuals in the Miami VA Hospital System, Lake City Florida VA Hospital System and Tucson VA Medical Center. Lawyer up folks ’cause the paperwork is being filed.\nI want to thank the Dept of Veterans Affairs for making me HOMELESS AGAIN…After deducting more than $800 USD from my unemployable Benefit, Due to Severe Hypertension and Heart attack/Stroke risk, of which I had a STROKE this past year, they do not give a sh-t that a Veteran is HOMELESS…\nI will probably be dead before the Dept of Veterans Affairs answers any questions that I have had regarding taking over $800 from my VA Benefits…\n<<<<< Do you see the avatar of me, I am 72 years old, plagued with severe HYPERTENSION, Covid, Bacterial Pneumonia, STROKE, and Dengue this past year, I was eligible for Unemployable benefits from the Veterans Administration, this month The VA slashed over $800USD from my benefit because of Social Security that I receive…Can someone explain to me how the VA can do this? Can anyone help me?\nContact me, Thanx…\nCarlo Mathiesen\nDecember 12, 2024\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nSt Petersburg, FL\nSubject: NEXUS Letter to Support Continued Disability Benefit Amount\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing this letter to support my request to maintain my previously approved unemployable disability benefit amount. I am a veteran and I have been experiencing multiple service-connected conditions that have significantly impaired my overall quality of life and ability to function.\nI currently suffer from the following which were not included in previous medical examinations, conditions:\n1. Tinnitus\n2. Anxiety and Depression\n3. Migraine Headaches, which cause severe symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously\n4. Shortness of Breath, a side effect of the medications prescribed by VA healthcare providers\nEach of these medical conditions has been well-documented by VA medical personnel and various specialists over the years. I have been under continuous treatment and care at the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, and I am currently prescribed multiple medications to manage these symptoms. Unfortunately, these medications have introduced new complications, such as shortness of breath, which I attribute directly to the prescribed treatments.\nMy migraine headaches, which result in intense vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, have significantly reduced my ability to engage in day-to-day activities and have made it difficult for me to maintain a stable routine. Additionally, my anxiety and depression continue to exacerbate these challenges, compounding my overall mental and physical health struggles.\nDue to these service-connected conditions, my ability to maintain consistent employment or perform routine tasks has been substantially impaired. I kindly request that the Department of Veterans Affairs reconsider and approve my continued disability benefit amount, as I rely on these benefits to manage ongoing healthcare costs, treatment, and support services.\nMy situation highlights the direct correlation between my connected disabilities and the challenges I face. Continued support will allow me access to critical medical care and ongoing treatment from VA healthcare providers who are familiar with my health history and specific needs.\nI am available to provide any additional medical documentation, treatment records, or statements from healthcare professionals who have treated me through the VA system. Please do not hesitate to contact me\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I sincerely appreciate your support in ensuring that I continue to receive the benefits that are crucial to my ongoing treatment and well-being.\nSincerely,\nCarlo Mathiesen\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult.\nwhy would u even say that?\nBecause it’s true. He’s part of the J6 insurrection and could care less about veterans. People need to wake up and pay attention\nBecause she is correct….\nI have a honorable discharge from the army reserve and I have been trying to get help with my veterans assistance in Meridian Ms and not to forget to mention I have disabilities while serving into the army reserve due to the fact that I was transferred to the regular army bases for my terms . I have have filed a timely claim for my benefits and compensation. But I believe archive lost all my DD214 during all my tours . It’s been 2 years old and I just been forgot about because during a peaceful term. Please let me know my status of the complaint I filed.\npissed off disabled veteran cant even post her name. thats why she can comfortably say crap. I am also a female vet. I get what I need; not more than I need. I hope all vets get what they need, not what they want.

He’s a puppet of the guy who called our fallen military “suckers and losers.” A puppet of the guy who told his entourage that disfigured military veterans should not be part of veteran ceremonies. The puppetmaster has already hit the understaffed VA by firing a bunch of employees and ending contracts.

We serve, retired, got injured while serving, earned VA benefits for those injuries, paid into SS for our entire lives. It’s hard to believe that anyone would even consider looking into cutting benefits for any of us. We have paid for these benefits in ways that are not imaginable to someone that hasnt served. Take away benefits when I turn 67 seriously? I paid for one my entire life and earned the other risking my life for this country.\nDamn.. page not found. They took the budget down. Hopefully someone copied it.\nSir,\nIs DOGE, vetted?, how many actual Veterans in DOGE, if zero, they should hit the f*cking door because penny counters don’t know the journey.\nAlso could you put up photos and qualifications of the DOGE inspectors.Let be leaders by doing what is promised “transparency” and not generic statements like “hitting the ground running” when we all know the clear destination of your running matters.\nThank you for asking these very important questions!! I fear dependent Chapter 35 benefits are on the table, too.\nThis is all just messaging, not factual information. Why don’t you answer the following, Dougie:\n1. Do you support means-testing for eligibility for VA disability compensation, as outlined in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915?\n2. Do you support ending VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security as found in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60916?\n3. Do you support VA’s Disability Payments being included as Taxable Income, as found at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60947?\n4. What planned changes are you advocating for on the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities that affects our disability payments, as laid out in Project 2025 that says you want to partially cut benefits for Veterans? (See https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)\nVeterans…do not be fooled by these talking points. He wants to cut facilities and your benefits. Contact your Congressional members now to tell him cuts are a non-starter.\nExactly. So many Vets are convinced their benefits won’t be touched. Are they ok if their dependents lose Chapter 35?\nIs it possible for veterans who have retired from the military use other pharmacies than Walgreens,CVS, Walmart or Publix because they are not in the Veteran’s best interest. When I was able to use my family pharmacy never had any problems getting my medicine. The pharmacies listed above do not care about the veterans at all.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nRelevant and important information. Thanks for asking and addressing this propagandist BS\nWhat a bunch of malarkey. We’ve been lied to by this whole administration. We wanted a better economy, not this dog and pony show of renaming bodies of water and stopping benefits from other people. Every cabinet member lied bold faced to Congress, so I don’t think this secretary is any different. He’s a big fan of contracting out medical care to the public sector, which is not equipped to take on the entire veteran population. I don’t doubt he won’t start chopping out the low performing employees, but he sure won’t replace them either. You like waiting 8 months for a dependency claim? Try 2 years after they get done firing everyone. Want hour long wait time for a phone call where you get to talk to a heavy accent foreigner? Or a robot? This Secretary will be the one to do it.\nCall your Members of Congress and hold this guy’s feet to the fire.\nNotice how he first addressed the media and not veteran’s concerns? This is a fascist move…..I don’t believe a word out of this man’s mouth.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

However, men, children, and teenagers develop lupus, too.\n- Ninety percent (90%) of people living with lupus are women. Most people with lupus develop the disease between the ages of 15-44.[1]\n- People with lupus can experience significant symptoms, such as pain, extreme fatigue, hair loss, cognitive issues, and physical impairments that affect every facet of their lives. Many suffer from cardiovascular disease, strokes, disfiguring rashes, and painful joints. For others, there may be no visible symptoms.\nadults with lupus are women\nlupus patients suffer from multiple autoimmune diseases\nWhat are the 4 different forms of lupus?\n- Systemic lupus accounts for approximately 70 percent of all cases of lupus. In approximately half of these cases, a major organ or tissue in the body, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, or brain will be affected.[1]\n- Cutaneous lupus (affecting only the skin) accounts for approximately 10 percent of all lupus cases.[1]\n- Drug-induced lupus accounts for about 10 percent of all lupus cases and is caused by high doses of certain medications. The symptoms of drug induced lupus are similar to systemic lupus; however, symptoms usually subside when the medications are discontinued.[1]\n- Neonatal lupus is a rare condition in which the mother's antibodies affect the fetus. At birth, the baby may have a skin rash, liver problems, or low blood cell counts, but these symptoms typically disappear completely after six months with no lasting effects.\nDoes lupus affect different groups in different ways?\nAnyone can get lupus, but lupus doesn't affect all groups of people in the same way. To make sure that everyone with lupus has access to the best available care, it's important to study how lupus affects different groups of people.\nLupus is two to three times more prevalent among African American, Hispanic/Latina, Asian American, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander women than among White women.[2] Recent research indicates that lupus affects 1 in 537 young African American women.\nThe groundbreaking LUMINA (Lupus in Minority Populations: Nature vs. Nurture) study reported that African American lupus patients are more likely to have organ system involvement, more active disease, and lower levels of social support compared with White lupus patients.\nA 2014 study found that women from racial and ethnic minority groups tend to develop lupus at a younger age, experience more serious complications, and have higher mortality rates.\nCan people die of lupus?\n- It is believed that between 10-15 percent of people with lupus will die prematurely due to complications of lupus.[2]\n- A Lupus Foundation of America funded study found that overall, lupus was among the top 20 leading causes of death in females ages 5-64. Among black and Hispanic women lupus ranked 5th in the 15-24 years, 6th in the 25-34 years, and 8th-9th in the 35-44 years age groups, after excluding the three common external injury causes of death from analysis.[3]\nWhat are the economic impacts of lupus?\nA 2016 study published in Nature Reviews Rheumatology found that the average annual direct health care costs of a person with lupus was $33,223.[7]\nThe study also determined that the average annual productivity cost (lost hours of economic productivity due to lupus) was between $1,252 and $20,046.[7]\nThe average annual total costs for people with lupus (combining direct and indirect costs) can be as high as $50,000.[6-8] These estimates may be higher among people with lupus nephritis and more severe or active lupus.[7]\nA Lupus Foundation of America survey found 55 percent of lupus patients reported a complete or partial loss of their income because they no longer are able to work full time due to complications of lupus. One in three have been temporarily disabled by the disease, and one in four currently receive disability payments.[4]\nThis same survey found that one in four patients receive their health care through a government-sponsored program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.[5]\nlist chronic pain as the most difficult aspect of lupus\nis lost annually by each lupus patient in healthcare costs and lost productivity\nWhat is the role of genetics in lupus?\n- Genes do play a role in the predisposition to the development of lupus. There are dozens of known genetic variants linked to lupus. These genes impact both who gets lupus and how severe it is.\n- 20 percent of people with lupus will have a parent or sibling who already has lupus or may develop lupus. About 5 percent of the children born to individuals with lupus will develop the illness.[1]\nAlthough lupus can develop in people with no family history of lupus, there are likely to be other autoimmune diseases in some family members.[1]\nOne of three patients responding to our survey reported they had another autoimmune disease in addition to lupus, and almost half had a relative with lupus.\nHow long does it take to get diagnosed with lupus?\n- There are many challenges to reaching a lupus diagnosis. Lupus is known as \"the great imitator\" because its symptoms mimic many other illnesses. Lupus symptoms can also be unclear, can come and go, and can change.\n- On average, it takes nearly six years for people with lupus to be diagnosed, from the time they first notice their lupus symptoms.[5]\n- A majority (63%) of people with lupus surveyed report being incorrectly diagnosed. Of those reporting incorrect diagnosis, more than half of them (55%) report seeing four or more different healthcare providers for their lupus symptoms before being accurately diagnosed.[5]\nWhat are the biggest burdens of living with lupus?\nResponding to our survey, most lupus patients reported that they are coping well with lupus (78%), and that other family members are understanding and supportive (72%).[4]\n84% people with lupus name other family members as their primary support network.\nParticipants cited pain (65%), lifestyle changes (61%), and emotional problems associated with lupus (50%) as the most difficult parts of coping with lupus.[4]\nWhat is the state of lupus awareness?\n- While lupus is a widespread disease, awareness of the disease lags behind many other illnesses. 63% of Americans surveyed have never heard of lupus or know little or nothing about this disease and its symptoms beyond the name indicating there is significant opportunity and need for continued public education.[9]\n- Over half of respondents (61%) believed it takes six months or less for a person to be accurately diagnosed with lupus—significantly underestimating the time it takes to receive an accurate lupus diagnosis.[9]\nKey source documents:\n[1] Pons-Estel GJ, Alarcón GS, Scofield L, Reinlib L, Cooper GS.

Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care coverage to one in three with disabilities, including 2.3 million children, 8.8 million working-age adults, and 4.4 million adults ages 65 and older. Although some people with disabilities qualify for Medicaid because they receive Supplemental Security Income, most are eligible for Medicaid through other pathways, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion group.\nPolicy changes under consideration include imposing a per capita cap on federal Medicaid spending, reducing the federal government’s share of costs for the ACA expansion group, and imposing Medicaid work requirements, among other changes. Such policy changes would fundamentally alter how Medicaid financing works and federal spending reductions of this magnitude would put states at significant financial risk, forcing them to make tough choices about reducing the number of people covered, covering fewer benefits, or reducing payment rates for physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers. It is unknown how much Medicaid pays for people with disabilities because health care claims data do not include information about disabilities unless they are also a diagnosis code associated with the medical care being provided. However, Medicaid enrollees who are eligible because of disability or being over age 64 account for over half of Medicaid spending but less than a quarter of enrollees on account of their higher costs. That group includes most non-elderly adults with disabilities who qualify for Medicaid through regular eligibility pathways, such as the ACA expansion.\nBecause they have high levels of health care spending, people with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable if federal spending is capped. Loss of Medicaid coverage or benefits poses unique challenges for seniors and people with disabilities, many of whom live on fixed incomes, face barriers to employment and accessing private health coverage, have high health care needs and spending, and rely on Medicaid for coverage of long-term care and other services not available in other health coverage.\n1. Medicaid is a major source of health coverage for people with disabilities.\nMore than 1 in 3 people with disabilities (15 million) have Medicaid (35%). In comparison, only 19% of people without disabilities have Medicaid (Figure 1). Disability is defined as having any of the following difficulties: hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, or independent living. The difference in coverage rates stems from lower rates of employment and employer-based coverage among working age adults with disabilities. Among working age adults with disabilities, almost half of people with disabilities do not work at all and only one third work full time (defined as 35 or more hours per week). In comparison, over 64% of adults without a disability work full time and only 16% do not work at all. Lower rates of employment result in lower rates of employment-based coverage among working age adults with disabilities: Only 33% have insurance through an employer compared with 64% among working age adults without disabilities.\n2. More than one in five Medicaid enrollees have a disability, many of whom are non-elderly adults.\nOver 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, with the rate of disability among Medicaid enrollees rising steeply with age (Figure 2, Tab 1). Only 8% of children have a disability compared with 22% of adults ages 19 to 49 and 43% of adults ages 50 to 64. Over half of Medicaid enrollees ages 65 and older have a disability. Because disability incidence rises with age, Medicaid enrollees with disabilities tend to be older than those without (Figure 2, Tab 2). Among Medicaid enrollees with a disability, over 50% are ages 50 and older compared with less than 20% of Medicaid enrollees without disabilities.\n3. Among Medicaid enrollees with disabilities, more than half have multiple difficulties.\nNearly 60% of Medicaid enrollees with disabilities have two or more difficulties and 16% have four or more difficulties (Figure 3, Tab 1). Among the over 15 million Medicaid enrollees with disabilities, 53% report difficulties with cognition, which is defined as difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; 48% report difficulties with ambulation (defined as difficulty with walking or climbing stairs); 44% report difficulties living independently (defined as difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping); and 24% report difficulties with self-care (defined as difficult dressing or bathing). Fewer than 1 in 5 enrollees report difficulties with hearing or vision (Figure 3, Tab 2).\n4. Two thirds of Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI).\nAlthough federal statutes generally require states to enroll people who receive SSI in Medicaid, only one third of Medicaid enrollees with disabilities receive SSI income (Figure 5). That rate varies from a low of 18% in North Dakota to a high of 44% in Texas (Appendix Table 1). SSI is a disability program that provides monthly income to people who are unable to work on account of a disability and who have income and financial resources below federal limits. Receipt of SSI increases with age: Only 15% of children ages 15-19 receive SSI but close to 40% of adults ages 50 and older do. Medicaid enrollees ages 19-64 who do not receive SSI are eligible for Medicaid through other eligibility pathways, and many adults could be subject to Medicaid work and reporting requirement policies (Appendix Table 2). A smaller number of Medicaid enrollees with disabilities are eligible for Medicaid through pathways that relate to their disability or need for long-term care. Those pathways have more complex eligibility requirements than coverage for children and non-elderly adults. Most Medicaid enrollees with disabilities qualify for Medicaid under regular adult pathways, including the ACA expansion group.\n5. Medicaid enrollees with disabilities are likely to comprise most of the people who use Medicaid long-term care.\nNearly half of Medicaid enrollees with a disability (47%) report having a difficult with self-care or independent living, disabilities that frequently require long-term care. Medicaid is the primary payer of long-term care because it is generally not covered by Medicare or private health insurance. KFF estimates that nearly 6 million people use Medicaid long-term care and spending for those people is much higher than spending for other enrollees, with the costs of enrollees who use institutional care nearing $50,000 each year. In comparison, average Medicaid spending for enrollees who do not use long-term care is under $5,000. Because of the higher spending, enrollees who use long-term care comprise 6% of Medicaid enrollment but 34% of Medicaid spending (Figure 5).\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        How Many Uninsured Are in the Coverage Gap and How Many Could be Eligible if All States Adopted the Medicaid Expansion?\nIssue Brief\nSince implementation of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion in 2014, all but ten states have adopted the expansion to cover adults on Medicaid with income up to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) helping to drive the uninsured rate among the population under age 65 to record low levels. While the number of people who fall into the coverage gap has declined as more states implemented the expansion, 1.4 million uninsured individuals remain in the coverage gap in the ten states that have not expanded Medicaid.\nLimited Medicaid eligibility in non-expansion states leaves many adults without children, people of color, and those with disabilities without coverage. Most adults in the coverage gap are in working families, though about one in six have a disability that requires ongoing health care and may limit their ability to work. Using data from 2023, this brief estimates the number and characteristics of uninsured individuals in these ten non-expansion states who could gain coverage if Medicaid expansion were adopted.\nThe future of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion is uncertain as Congress considers significant changes to Medicaid financing. Some proposals under consideration would eliminate the enhanced 90 percent federal matching rate for the expansion population or make other changes to federal payments to states for this group. Any cuts in federal funding for expansion enrollees would likely lead a number of states to rollback coverage for this population and would increase the number of people who fall into the coverage gap and become uninsured.\nHow many people are in the coverage gap?\nThe coverage gap exists in states that have not adopted the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Under the ACA, Medicaid was expanded to cover adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138% FPL (or $21,597 for an individual in 2025). This income threshold applied to parents and to adults without dependent children who were previously not eligible for Medicaid. While the ACA intended to require all states to implement the Medicaid expansion, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made expansion optional for states. As of February 2025, 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted Medicaid expansion (Figure 1).\nIn the ten states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, an estimated 1.4 million individuals remain in the coverage gap. These adults have incomes above their state’s Medicaid eligibility threshold but below the poverty level, making them ineligible for ACA Marketplace subsidies (Figure 2). Because the Medicaid expansion was expected to be mandatory for states, the ACA did not provide eligibility for subsidies in the Marketplaces for people below poverty.\nMedicaid eligibility remains limited in states that have not expanded their programs. All non-expansion states, except Wisconsin (which provides coverage through a waiver), do not offer Medicaid to adults without children, regardless of their income (Figure 3). As a result, 80% of the individuals in the coverage group are adults without dependent children.\nUninsured rates in states without Medicaid expansion are nearly twice as high as those in expansion states (14.1% vs. 7.6%). People without insurance have more difficulty accessing care, with almost one in four uninsured adults in 2023 not receiving needed medical treatment due to cost. Uninsured individuals are also less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and treatment for major health conditions and chronic diseases.\nWhat are the characteristics of people in the coverage gap?\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the coverage gap live in just three Southern states. Texas accounts for 42% of individuals in the coverage gap, the highest share of any state, while Florida and Georgia account for an additional 19% and 14%, respectively (Figure 4). Overall, 97% of those in the coverage gap live in the South. Of the 16 states in the region, seven have not adopted Medicaid expansion.\nNearly six in ten people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker and over four in ten are working themselves. (Figure 5). However, these individuals work in low-wage jobs that leave them below the poverty level and often work for employers that do not offer affordable job-based insurance. Over half (53%) of workers in the coverage gap are in the service, retail, and construction industries, with common jobs including cashiers, cooks, servers, construction laborers, housekeepers, retail salespeople, and janitors. In non-expansion states, even part-time work can make parents ineligible for Medicaid.\nAbout one in six (16%) people in the coverage gap have a functional disability. The share of people in the coverage gap with disabilities increases with age (Figure 6). Over a quarter (26%) of adults ages 55 to 64 in the coverage gap have a disability compared to one in ten adults under age 25. Adults ages 55 to 64, who often face increased health care needs, account for 17% of all people in the coverage gap. Despite these challenges, many of these individuals do not qualify for Medicaid through a disability pathway, leaving them uninsured. Research shows that uninsured people in this age group may delay necessary care until they become eligible for Medicare at 65.\nPeople of color make up a disproportionate share of individuals in the coverage gap. Six in ten people in the coverage gap are people of color, a higher share than among adults in non-expansion states (49%) and nationwide (44%) (Figure 7). These differences in part explain persisting disparities in health insurance coverage across racial and ethnic groups.\nHow many uninsured could gain coverage if all states adopted the Medicaid expansion?\nApproximately 2.7 million uninsured adults would gain coverage if all states adopted Medicaid expansion. This includes 1.4 million people in the coverage gap and 1.3 million uninsured adults with incomes between 100% and 138% of the FPL, most of whom are eligible for Marketplace coverage but not enrolled (Figure 7 and Table 1). While many of these adults above poverty qualify for zero-premium Marketplace plans, Medicaid generally provides more comprehensive benefits with lower out-of-pocket costs. The potential number of people who could gain coverage through expansion varies by state.\nSammy Cervantes, Clea Bell, and Jennifer Tolbert are with KFF. Anthony Damico is an independent consultant.\nAppendix Tables\nData And Methods\nThis analysis uses data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS provides socioeconomic and demographic information for the United States population and specific subpopulations. Importantly, the ACS provides detailed data on families and households, which we use to determine income and household composition for ACA eligibility purposes.\nMedicaid and Marketplaces have different rules about household composition and income for eligibility. The ACS questionnaire captures the relationship between each household resident and one household reference person, but not necessarily each individual to all others. Therefore, prior to estimating eligibility, we implement a series of logical rules based on each person’s relationship to that household reference person in order to estimate the person-to-person relationships of all individuals within a respondent household to one another. We then assess income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies by grouping individuals into household insurance units (HIUs) and calculate HIU income using the rules for each program. For more detail on how we construct person-to-person relationships, aggregate Medicaid and Marketplace households, and then count income, see the detailed Technical Appendix A.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally-funded Medicaid and Marketplace coverage. Since ACS data do not directly indicate whether an immigrant is lawfully present, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. Al.1 ,2 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample. We apply the model to ACS, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. For more detail on the immigration imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix B.\nIndividuals in tax-filing units with access to an affordable offer of Employer-Sponsored Insurance (ESI) are still potentially MAGI-eligible for Medicaid coverage, but they are ineligible for advance premium tax credits in the Health Insurance Exchanges. Since ACS data do not designate policyholders of employment-based coverage nor indicate whether workers hold an offer of ESI, we developed a model that predicts both the policyholder and the offer of ESI based on the Current Population Survey (CPS). Additionally, for families with a Marketplace eligibility level below 250% FPL, we assume any reported worker offer does not meet affordability requirements and therefore does not disqualify the family from Tax Credit eligibility on the Exchanges. For more detail on the offer imputation used in this analysis, see the Technical Appendix C.\nAs of January 2014, Medicaid financial eligibility for most adults ages 19-64 is based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). To determine whether each individual is eligible for Medicaid, we use each state’s reported eligibility levels as of May 2024, updated to reflect 2025 Federal Poverty Levels. Some adults ages 19-64 with incomes above MAGI levels may be eligible for Medicaid through other pathways; however, we only assess eligibility through the MAGI pathway.3\nAn individual’s income is likely to fluctuate throughout the year, impacting his or her eligibility for Medicaid. Our estimates are based on annual income and thus represent a snapshot of the number of people in the coverage gap at a given point in time. Over the course of the year, a larger number of people are likely to move in and out of the coverage gap as their income fluctuates.\nStarting with our estimates of ACA eligibility in 2017, we transferred our core modeling approach from relying on the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the American Community Survey (ACS). ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates as well as longer trend analyses. Since our methodology excludes a small number of individuals whose poverty status could not be determined, our ACS-based population totals appear slightly below CPS-based totals and some ACS population totals published by the Census Bureau. This difference is in large part attributable to students who reside in college dormitories. Comparing the two survey designs, CPS counts more of these individuals in the household of their parent(s) than ACS does.\nTechnical Appendix A: Household Construction\nIn KFF’s estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, income eligibility for both Medicaid and Marketplace subsidies is assessed by grouping people into “health insurance units” (HIUs) and calculating HIU income according to Medicaid and Marketplace program rules. HIUs group people according to how they are counted for eligibility for health insurance, versus grouping people according to who they live with (e.g., “households”) or are related to (e.g., “families”). HIU construction is an important step in assessing income as a share of the federal poverty line (FPL) because it impacts whose income is counted (and thus the total income for the unit) and how many people share that income (and thus the corresponding FPL to use for comparison, since FPL varies by family size). Our HIUs are designed to match ACA eligibility rules for both Medicaid and Marketplaces. Below we describe how we construct HIUs for this analysis. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nPerson to Person Relationships\nWe construct spousal and parent-to-child person-to-person linkage variables within each household of the microdata. The American Community Survey (ACS) includes only the relationship of each person in a household to one central reference person. Using the household reference person’s known relationships to all other individuals within each household, we iterate through every pair of individuals present in each household to determine probable person to person links for possible mother, father, and spousal pairs. Our approach to determining probable family interrelationship linkages closely follows the construction documented by IPUMS-USA with the notable exception of unmarried partner relationships.4 We intentionally diverge from IPUMS-USA because the presence of an unmarried partner relationship does not impact federal program eligibility. Among individuals designated as married with a spouse present in the household, our constructed spousal pointer matches the IPUMS SPLOC variable 99% of the time in the 2013 microdata. Our construction of mother and father pointers match the IPUMS MOMLOC, POPLOC, MOMLOC2, and POPLOC2 variables for more than 99% of all person-records.\nFamily Aggregation\nSeparate from person-to-person linkage variables, we assemble individual records into family units reproducing the Census Bureau’s Family Poverty Ratio (POVPIP) variable. Although the Census Bureau does not include a unique family identifier on the ACS microdata, we approximate the groupings used to generate the ACS income-to-poverty ratio variable with the following steps:\n- Both non-relatives of the household reference person (RELP of 11-17) and all individuals in non-family households (HHT of 4-7) are categorized as single-person families.\n- Married couples and other family households without subfamilies (PSF of 0) are categorized into single-family households.\n- Married couples and other family households with subfamilies (PSF of 1) are categorized based on their subfamily number (SFN).\nThis family identifier is used in estimating family-wide statistics, such as the percent of the uninsured Americans in a family below poverty or the count of Medicaid-enrollees with one or more workers in their family. This family aggregation matches the groupings used to determine the income-to-poverty ratio variable, and estimates of health insurance presented by family poverty categories align with Census Bureau publications based on the ACS.5 Since many family members obtain health coverage separately from one another (for example, an elderly parent cohabiting with their working-age child might hold Medicare coverage and Employer Sponsored Insurance, respectively), descriptive statistics focused on family attributes rely on this family identifier but Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility determinations do not.\nOverview of KFF-HIUS\nWe construct two different HIUs for everyone in the sample: a Medicaid HIU and a Marketplace HIU. We use two HIUs because the rules for counting families and income differ between the two programs. For example, in Medicaid, children with unmarried parents have both parents’ income counted toward their income, whereas under Marketplace rules, only the income of the parent who claims the child on his/her taxes counts. In another example, certain tax dependents (e.g., a parent) are treated differently for Medicaid eligibility than they are for Marketplace eligibility. To account for these rules, we developed an algorithm for sorting people into HIUs. We construct HIUs and HIU incomes separately for each person in a household and take into account the family relationships and income of the other people in the person’s household. People in the same household or in the same family may not have the same HIU composition or income for determining either Medicaid eligibility or eligibility for tax credits.\nIn simplest terms, the HIU algorithm sorts people into tax filing units. For all people in the data set, the algorithm assesses whether they are likely to be a tax filer themselves and, if so, who they are likely to claim or, if not, who is likely to claim them. It also captures whether someone is neither a tax filer nor claimed as a dependent by someone else. Importantly, the HIU construction considers all relationships for each person within the household. This step is particularly important in correctly classifying people in non-nuclear families (e.g., households with more than one generation, with unmarried partners, or with relatives outside the nuclear family such as an aunt or uncle), which may contain either one or multiple tax filing units.\nIn counting income for both Medicaid and Marketplace HIUs, we use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), corresponding to the ACA rules. MAGI differs from total income in that some sources of income (e.g., cash assistance payments from TANF or SSI) do not count toward MAGI. We calculate HIU income as a share of poverty using the Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.6\nFor a small number of people, Medicaid HIU income as a share of poverty does not match Marketplace HIU income as a share of poverty due to the different rules between the programs. This analysis first calculates Medicaid HIU and classifies anyone who meets Medicaid eligibility into that category (including most individuals below 138% FPL in the Medicaid expansion states). We then calculate Marketplace HIU; anyone meeting subsidy eligibility is grouped into that category (above Medicaid and also above 100% FPL up to 400% FPL for most individuals). This approach follows the eligibility rules in the ACA, which specify that people are eligible for tax credits only if they are ineligible for Medicaid.\nSteps in Calculating KFF-HIUS\nBefore we group people into HIUs, we first calculate annual MAGI for each respondent. We compare each person’s income to IRS filing requirements for being a tax filer7 and for being a qualifying relative claimed by someone else.8\nWe then group people into HIUs. We begin this process by grouping everyone within a household who is related into “cohabitating families.” Cohabitating families include all family relations; they also include unmarried cohabitating partners and relatives of each cohabitating partner.\nWithin each cohabitating family, we assess whether any individual is eligible to claim any other individual as a tax dependent. People are eligible to claim others as tax dependents if their income is above the IRS filing threshold for a head of household or, if married, for a married couple. People are eligible to be claimed by others if (a) they are a child (under age 19 or, for tax credits, 23 if a full-time student), and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income, or (b) they are below the limit to be a tax filer, have income below the qualifying relative limit, and someone else in the cohabitating family has at least twice their income. Within each cohabitating family, we assess who is likely to claim whom, using the assumptions that:\n- People who are claimed by others are more likely to be claimed by close relatives (e.g., a parent) than by others (e.g., a grandparent).\n- Married couples (who file) file jointly\n- If more than one person in a cohabitating family is eligible to claim others within that cohabitating family, the wealthiest person claims the eligible dependents.\nOnce we determine who within the cohabitating family is likely to claim each other, we know the HIU size and are able to apply income rules for the HIU. We apply Medicaid and Marketplace rules for whose income counts in calculating Medicaid HIUs and Marketplace HIUs, respectively.9 People who are filers but are not eligible to claim someone else or to be claimed by someone else are an HIU of 1. People who are not filers and are not claimed by filers have their HIU size and income counted according to Medicaid non-filer rules.10\nInflation Factors\nIn order to determine ACA eligibility during calendar year 2023, we compared tax filing unit income against the most current premiums available, for open enrollment 2025.11 We relied on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI), Private Wages and Salaries to inflate the income of each HIU by approximately 8.0% to align 2023 incomes to 2025 premiums.12 Since most state Medicaid eligibility determinations through the MAGI pathway are calculated as a percent of HHS Poverty Guidelines for that year and not a fixed dollar amount, inflation was not necessary to assess the Medicaid eligibility of individuals.\nAfter inflating 2023 tax filing unit incomes to match 2025 premiums, we similarly inflated 2023 IRS thresholds for both filing requirements13 and for qualifying relative tests14 by the same factor so that these thresholds aligned with the inflated income amounts.\nLimitations\nAs with any analysis, there are some limitations to our approach due to the level of detail that we can obtain from available survey data. Key limitations to bear in mind include:\n- We currently are not able to appropriately group anyone who lives outside the household with a household that claims them as a tax dependent. For example, we are not able to connect students living away from home or children with a non-custodial parent with the people who may be claiming them (and whose income should count to their HIU). We are also not able to determine married people who file separately.\n- To group people into tax filing units, we have to make assumptions about how people are likely to file their taxes. We assume that tax filers claim qualifying relatives they are able to claim. We make this assumption based on the fact that Medicaid and Marketplace eligibility rules are determined not by who is actually claimed on the tax return but by who is allowed to be claimed. However, people may sort themselves into different tax filing units than we estimate.\nTechnical Appendix B: Immigration Status Imputation\nTo impute documentation status, we draw on the methods underlying the 2013 analysis by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC) and the recommendations made by Van Hook et. al..15 ,16 This approach uses the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants to develop a model that predicts immigration status for each person in the sample.17 We apply the model to a second data source, controlling to state-level estimates of total undocumented population as well as the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center.18 Below we describe how we developed the regression model and applied it to the American Community Survey (ACS). We also describe how the model may be applied to other data sets. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nData Sources\nWe used the 2023 KFF/LA Times Survey of Immigrants l data to build the regression model. The 2023 Survey of Immigrants dataset contains questions on citizenship and legal status at the person level. The KFF/LA Time Survey of Immigrants19 is a probability-based survey exploring the immigrant experience in the U.S. and draws on three different sampling frames including an address-based sample (ABS), a random digit dial (RDD) sample of pre-paid cell phone numbers, and callbacks to an RDD sample in which the individual did not speak English or Spanish. The survey includes interviews with 3,358 immigrant adults and was offered in ten different languages.\nThe regression model is designed to be applied to other datasets in order to impute legal immigration status in surveys that do not ask about migration status. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to either the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Core files, ACS, or the Current Population Survey (CPS). Because the SIPP Core file contains different survey questions and variable specifications from the ACS and CPS, we create unique regression models to apply the model to each dataset. For the analysis underlying this brief and other KFF estimates of eligibility for ACA coverage, we apply the regression model to the 2013 ACS and then each subsequent year of the ACS.\nDue to underreporting of legal immigration status in survey datasets, in imputing immigration status we control to state and national-level estimates of the total undocumented population and also the undocumented population in the labor force from the Pew Research Center. Pew reports these estimates for all states and the District of Columbia.20\nConstruction of Regression Model\nWe use the 2023 Survey of Immigrants to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a potential unauthorized immigrant. The dependent variable is constructed based on the following factors:\n- Respondent was not a United States (US) citizen,\n- Respondent did not have permanent resident status or a valid work or student visa, , and\n- Respondent does not have other indicators that imply legal status.21\nWe use the following independent variables to predict unauthorized immigrant status:\n- Year of US entry,\n- Job industry classification,\n- State of residence,\n- Household Income,\n- Ownership or rental of residence,\n- Number of occupants in the household (< or >= six occupants),\n- Whether all household occupants are related,\n- Health insurance coverage status,\n- Sex, and\n- Ethnicity.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents who could not be considered unauthorized. People who could not be considered unauthorized include people who are US citizens or have other indicators that imply legal status.\nImputing Unauthorized Immigrants in Other Datasets\nWe use the Pew estimates as targets for the total number of unauthorized immigrants that the imputation generates. We first apply this strategy to the 2013 ACS, which contains health insurance information prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions. We stratify the targets by state and the District of Columbia and by participation in the labor force. We impute immigration status within each of these 102 strata.22\nTo generate the imputed immigration status variable, we first calculated the probability that each person in the dataset was unauthorized based on the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model. Next, we isolated the dataset to each individual stratum described above. Within each stratum, we sampled the data using the probability of being unauthorized for each person. After sampling, we summed the person weights until reaching the Pew population estimate for each stratum. The records that fell within the Pew population estimate were considered to be unauthorized immigrants. We repeated the process of sampling using the probability of being unauthorized and subsequently summing the person weights to reach Pew targets five times, creating five different unauthorized variables per record. These five imputed authorization status variables were then incorporated into a standard multiple imputation algorithm, closely matching the imputed variable analysis techniques used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the National Health Interview Survey.23\nWe used this first pass on the ACS 2013 to inform our sampling targets for the latest available microdata (ACS 2023). Looking at the results of our undocumented imputation on the ACS 2013, we calculated the share of undocumented immigrants lacking health insurance within each of those 102 strata prior to the ACA’s coverage expansions and transferred that information into a new dimension of sampling strata for the ACS 2023. We split each of the 102 sampling strata used on the pre-ACA ACS 2013 into uninsured versus insured categories, resulting in 204 sampling strata for subsequent years. We then repeated our imputation on the ACS 2023 with the newly-divided strata, allowing for a small decline in the undocumented uninsured rate based off of the percent drop in the uninsured rate among citizens.24\nTo easily apply the regression model to other data sets, we created a function that applies this approach to a chosen data set. The function first loads the dataset of choice, then standardizes the data to match the independent variables from the 2023 Survey of Immigrants regression model, and finally applies the multiple imputation to generate a variable for legal immigration status.\nTechnical Appendix C: Imputation Of Offer Of Employer-sponsored Insurance\nAn integral part of determining ACA eligibility is assessing whether workers without employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) hold an offer through their workplace that they decline to take up. In most cases, an affordable offer of ESI disqualifies members of the tax filing unit of the worker from receiving subsidized coverage on the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace. The American Community Survey (ACS) does not ask about employer offers of ESI; however, the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) includes questions about whether each worker received an offer of ESI from his or her employer at the time of interview. We use the CPS-ASEC offer of ESI variable to inform a regression-based multiple imputation of whether each tax filing unit constructed in the ACS had at least one offer at work, and also assess affordability for the employee and, separately, for any potential dependents within the unit. Since the health insurance coverage variables available in the CPS-ASEC 2024 capture sources of coverage at any point during calendar year 2023 (versus at the time of survey, as with the offer rate variable), a subset of sampled individuals had a change in their employer-based coverage status across the two distinct time periods.25 Therefore, among workers who potentially experienced a shift in offer status across the two time periods, we recoded or imputed offer rates in 2023 using the offer status in 2024. After constructing this revised offer variable for workers in CPS, we aggregated the results at the tax filing unit level to create a prediction model to apply to the ACS. Below we describe these recodes and imputation. The programming code, written using the statistical computing package R v.4.4.1, is available upon request for people interested in replicating this approach for their own analysis.\nRecoding and Imputing Offer Rate Data in the CPS\nAs a first step in our analysis, we divided CPS-ASEC survey respondents into five distinct groups:\n- All individuals who did not work during 2023 and also did not hold an offer of ESI in 2024 were assumed not to have an offer in 2023.\n- All individuals who reported being an ESI policyholder (that is, anyone reporting having taken-up their offer of ESI) during 2023 and also reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were assumed to have an offer in 2023.\n- All workers in 2023 who held their own ESI policies during 2023 but then reported not holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- All non-workers during 2023 who reported holding an offer during 2024 were re-coded as not holding an offer of ESI in 2023.\n- Some workers during 2023 who did not report being ESI policyholders but did report holding an offer of ESI during early 2024 were imputed to not have an offer of ESI during 2023.\nFor many groups, including those in groups (1) and (2) listed above, the offer status did not change across the two time periods. In contrast, we recoded offer status for people in groups (3) and (4): every non-offered worker in group (3), which includes people who held ESI policies in their own name in 2023, were considered to have an offer of ESI in 2023, and offered workers in group (4), which includes people who did not work themselves in 2023, were considered to not have their offer of ESI in 2023. Last, we implemented a probability-based random sample imputation of offers of ESI for people in group (5), described in more detail below. Only a subset of the group was re-coded from holding an offer in 2024 to not holding an offer in 2023.The number of workers selected from this population was equal to the population size of (3) subtracted by the population size of (4), thereby assuming an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the period.\nImputing Offer Rates for CPS Respondents with Ambiguous Offer Rate Status\nThe CPS-ASEC worker-level regression model was designed to be applied to a single dataset where ESI offer status is known at one point in time but not another. The code mentioned above includes programming to apply the model to the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC) (for years 2014 on). For the analysis underlying KFF’s current estimates of ACA eligibility, we apply the regression model to workers in the 2024 CPS-ASEC.\nWe use the 2024 point-in-time worker offer variable provided by the US Census Bureau26 to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies a respondent as a recipient of an offer of employer-sponsored insurance at his or her workplace in early 2024. The dependent variable was constructed at the worker-level based on individuals not holding their own ESI policy at time of interview and also reporting an ESI offer or eligibility to be covered that was then voluntarily declined.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status in 2023 among workers not covered by their own ESI during both 2023 and early 2024 but potentially holding an offer of ESI in 2023:\n- Any public coverage,\n- Any nongroup coverage,\n- Worker earnings among all jobs,\n- Full-time versus part-time status,\n- Age of worker,\n- Work within the construction industry.\nThe regression model was sub-populated to remove respondents already covered by their own ESI and also to remove non-workers. Since this imputation does not account for the affordability of the offer or whether it meets the minimum value test, we included an assumption that workers in tax filing units with a MAGI below 250% FPL do not hold affordable offers of ESI and therefore might be eligible to purchase subsidized coverage on the Exchanges.27\nAs mentioned above, we assume an unchanging offer rate for the total worker population across the two time periods. We determined the needed size of the population to impute by subtracting the population of (4) from the population of (3) to ensure an equivalent number of offers were gained and lost. This left only workers who reported holding an offer of ESI during early 2024, since (3) represented a larger count of workers than (4). We then calculated the probability that each worker in the dataset was offered ESI during calendar year 2023 based on our 2024 CPS-ASEC regression model. Next, we selected workers within the potential population (5) using the sampling probabilities resultant from our model.\nConstruction and Application of ACS Regression Model\nFor the analysis underlying KFF estimates of ACA eligibility, we construct a prediction model of having an offer of ESI using the 2024 CPS-ASEC and then apply this regression to tax filing units in the 2023 ACS to estimate who has an ESI offer in ACS.\nWe aggregate the worker offer variables constructed the 2024 CPS-ASEC as described above to create a binomial, dependent variable that identifies each tax filing unit as either holding or not holding an affordable offer of employer-sponsored insurance.\nWe use the following independent variables to predict offer status among tax filing units:\n- Any senior citizen in the household,\n- Oldest member of the tax-filing unit,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has employer-sponsored insurance coverage,\n- Any member of the tax-filing unit has nongroup coverage,\n- Any uninsured individuals in the tax filing unit,\n- Share of adults working full-time and part-time, and\n- Highest worker earnings.\nSince the imputation of documentation status (discussed in Technical Appendix B) required a multiply-imputed approach, this secondary imputation and subsequent worker sampling was only conducted once per implicate, keeping the number of ACS implicates to five.\nEndnotes\n- State Health Access Data Assistance Center. 2013. “State Estimates of the Low-income Uninsured Not Eligible for the ACA Medicaid Expansion.” Issue Brief #35.

We base the percent drop in the uninsured rate among the undocumented on the drop for citizens (half the scale of the drop for citizens) each year until 2023, resulting in the final undocumented uninsured rate of 51% in calendar year 2023. Prior to implementing this new sampling dimension, we found unrealistic drops in the uninsured rate of the undocumented population that we largely attributed to our prediction model’s inability to discern this group from legally-present non-citizens, many of whom are eligible for assistance under the ACA’s coverage expansions. Although a few states have implemented programs that allow for coverage of the undocumented population, these programs are state-funded and relatively small in scale compared to the nationwide coverage expansions accompanying the ACA. ↩︎\n- For example, anyone who did not work during 2023 who then held an offer of ESI in early 2024 would appear incongruous in our CPS-based eligibility model. In the other direction, workers covered by health insurance through their own employer in 2023 who lost their offer of ESI during the early months of 2024 (perhaps due to a job change) would also appear incongruous due to the discrepancy across the two time periods. ↩︎\n- Available at: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/health-insurance/cps-asec-research-files.html.

Some claim that the U.S. has hundreds of billions or even trillions of barrels of oil waiting to be produced if bureaucrats will simply stop blocking development. In fact, in a recent debate between Republican candidates contending for Gabrielle Giffords' recently vacated House seat, one candidate declared \"We have more oil in this country than in Saudi Arabia.\" So, I thought it might be a good idea to elaborate a bit on U.S. oil resources.\nOil production has been increasing in the U.S. for the past few years, primarily driven by expanding production from the Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas. The oil that is being produced from these shale formations is sometimes improperly referred to as shale oil. But when some people speak of hundreds of billions or trillions of barrels of U.S. oil, they are most likely talking about the oil shale in the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Since the shale in North Dakota and Texas is producing oil, some have assumed that the Green River Formation and its roughly 2 trillion barrels of oil resources will be developed next because they think it is a similar type of resource. But it is not.\nAlthough the oil in the Bakken and Eagle Ford is being extracted from shale formations, the term shale oil has been used for over 100 years to describe a very different resource. This has led some to confusion over the differences between current production in North Dakota and potential production in Colorado. The oil in the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations actually exists as oil, but the shale does not allow the oil to flow very well. This oil is properly called \"tight oil\", and advances in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technology have allowed some of this oil to be economically produced. (For more details, I discuss resources, reserves, fracking, shale gas, and oil shale in some detail in my new book Power Plays: Energy Options in the Age of Peak Oil).\nThe estimated amount of oil in place (the resource) varies widely, with some suggesting that there could be 400 billion barrels of oil in the Bakken. Because of advances in fracking technology, some of the resource has now been classified as reserves (the amount that can be technically and economically produced). However, the reserve is a very low fraction of the resource at 2 to 4 billion barrels (although some industry estimates put the recoverable amount as high as 20 billion barrels or so). For reference, the U.S. consumes a billion barrels of oil in about 52 days, and the world consumes a billion barrels in about 11 days.\nLike the Bakken, the Eagle Ford formation in Texas consists of oil (and natural gas) in tight formations that is being accessed via fracking. The amount of technically recoverable oil in the Eagle Ford is estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy to be 3.35 billion barrels of oil.\nWithout a doubt, these two formations are a major factor in the current resurgence of U.S. oil production. But the Green River formation is the source of talk of those enormous oil resources -- larger than those of Saudi Arabia -- and it is a very different prospect than the tight oil being produced in North Dakota and Texas. The oil shale in the Green River looks like rock. Unlike the hydrocarbons in the tight oil formations, the oil shale (kerogen) consists of very heavy hydrocarbons that are solid. In that way, oil shale more resembles coal than oil. Oil shale is essentially oil that Mother Nature did not finish cooking, and thus to convert it into oil, heat has to be added. The energy requirements -- plus the fact that oil shale production requires a lot of water in a very dry environment -- have kept oil shale commercialization out of reach for over 100 years.\nThus, while the U.S. might indeed have greater oil resources than Saudi Arabia, U.S. oil reserves (per the BP Statistical Review of World Energy) are only about 1/10th those of Saudi Arabia. The distinction is important.\nSummarizing the Definitions\nTo summarize, let's review the definitions for the important terms discussed here:\nOil resource -- the total amount of oil in place, most of which typically can't be recovered\nOil reserve -- the amount of oil that can be recovered economically with existing technology\nOil shale -- sedimentary rock that contains solid hydrocarbons called kerogen (e.g., Green River Formation)\nShale oil -- the oil that can be obtained by cooking kerogen\nTight oil -- liquid hydrocarbons that are obtained by hydraulic fracturing of shale formations (e.g., Bakken Formation and Eagle Ford Formation)\nConclusion: Resources are not Reserves, and Tight Oil isn't Shale Oil\nIt is pretty clear that at current oil prices, developments in the tight oil formations will continue. It is not at all clear that even at $100 oil the shale in the Green River formation will be commercialized to produce oil, although a number of companies are working on it and will continue to do so. Oil shale is commercially produced in some countries like Estonia, but it is primarily just burned for power.\nIn order to commercially convert the oil shale into oil, a more energy efficient method of producing it must be found (or, one would have to have extremely cheap energy and abundant water supplies to drive the process). I have heard from multiple industry sources that the energy return for producing oil from oil shale is around 4 to 1 (lower than for oil sands production), and that is before refining the oil to finished products. At this sort of energy return, oil sands will continue to be a more economical heavy oil option.\nThus, my prediction is that despite having an oil shale resource that may indeed be far greater than the oil resources of Saudi Arabia, the reserve will continue to be close to zero for the foreseeable future because there are still many technical hurdles to overcome to realize a scalable, commercially viable process.\nFinally, I would say that if a commercially viable process for shale oil production from the Green River oil formation is developed, the environmental blowback will be enormous. The production of shale oil is more energy intensive (i.e., has higher carbon emissions) than for the oil sands, it has a high water requirement in a dry climate, and it is potentially a huge new source of carbon dioxide emissions. The environmental protests that would arise in response to a growing commercial shale oil operation would make the Keystone XL pipeline protests pale in comparison.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        The United States’ dependence on oil has long influenced its foreign policy. U.S. oil development spans three major periods: the rise of oil as a commodity, beginning in 1850; the post–World War II age of geopolitical competition; and the post–Cold War era of deregulation and diversification. Today, U.S. oil production is booming, drawing renewed scrutiny to the country’s climate-driven efforts to globally phase out fossil fuels.\nThe development of the Watt steam engine in the late eighteenth century spurs a wave of mechanization in Europe and the United States known as the Industrial Revolution. Coal is the main energy source driving the revolution in its beginning years. In the mid-1800s, kerosene produced from refined crude oil begins to make its way onto the market in the United States as a lighting fuel, an alternative to the dwindling supply of whale oil. Crude oil is successfully extracted using a new drilling method in Pennsylvania, which sparks a regional influx of speculative oil drilling. The first U.S. oil refinery comes online in 1861, and the United States exports its first shipment of refined oil to London. Over the next century and a half, oil supplants coal as the country’s preeminent fuel source and contributes to its emergence as a major economic power.\nIn 1880, the United States is responsible for 85 percent of the world’s crude oil production and refining, and kerosene is the fourth largest U.S. export. However, U.S. dominance of European and Asian oil markets is challenged by new oil finds controlled by Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Russia. Still, over the next two decades, major oil finds in states such as California, Oklahoma, and Texas help increase U.S. production from about twenty-six million barrels of oil annually to around sixty-four million barrels per year. By 1900, more than two hundred oil byproducts—including fuel for stoves and internal combustion engines, as well as lubricants for industrial machinery—begin to enter daily life. The 1901 Spindletop gusher—the largest to date—fuels a major oil rush in Texas, and U.S. oil production nearly triples in a decade.\nHenry Ford’s invention of the Model T in 1908—the world’s first inexpensive, mass-produced car—helps pave the way for a significant increase in auto ownership. By 1910, U.S. consumption of petrol (gasoline) surpasses kerosene. By 1927, the United States is the most motorized country in the world, with one motor vehicle for roughly every five people. Comparatively, other major industrial countries like Britain, France, and Germany have about one motor vehicle for every forty-four people. The United States continues to lead auto ownership per capita for the next century, and refined-motor fuel becomes the country’s predominant use of oil.\nBy the 1880s, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil owns 90 percent of the U.S. oil refineries and pipelines and the world’s largest oil tanker fleet. In 1906, the U.S. government takes the company to court for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of the government in May 1911. In July, Standard Oil is broken into separate entities, including those that later become Chevron, Amoco, Mobil, Conoco, and Exxon. These companies come to dominate much of the international oil market for the next six decades.\nWith the onset of World War I, oil becomes vital for modern warfare, fueling ships, land vehicles, and planes. German attacks disrupt U.S. oil exports to Britain and France, causing oil shortages in those countries. When the United States enters the war allied against Germany in 1917, the Wilson administration steps up efforts to supply oil to Britain and France. U.S. production cannot meet both domestic and war demand, so the United States begins importing oil from Mexico to close the gap. During the U.S. war effort, Mexican imports average between 2.5 million barrels and 4 million barrels of oil per month, supplementing U.S. production of about 30 million barrels a month.\nIn 1919, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates U.S. oil supplies will run out in ten years, triggering the country’s first oil security fears. Though the United States produces roughly one million barrels of oil per day, or 65 percent of global oil supplies, more than 90 percent is consumed domestically. By 1920, crude prices increase to $3 a barrel, more than double the price in 1914. Congress passes the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 [PDF], which requires leasing of federal lands for energy prospecting for the first time. In response to British and French attempts to shut U.S. oil companies out of their Middle East protectorates, the law includes a provision denying access to U.S. mineral rights by any foreign entities whose governments deny similar access to U.S. companies. U.S. oil companies also begin pursuing concessions in Latin America.\nFollowing British and French attempts to shut U.S. oil companies out of regions they control in the Middle East, the U.S. government begins active oil diplomacy, insisting on an “open door” policy that would allow all companies to compete for foreign concessions regardless of national origins. But the doctrine fails to take hold. Instead, a consortium of seven oil companies is given financial interest in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the companies agree to not independently develop oil in an area that spans from Turkey to Iraq and Saudi Arabia, but excludes Egypt, Iran, and Kuwait. This 1928 Red Line Agreement with its “self-denial clause” allows seven companies, five of which are American, to control the bulk of Mideast oil production by the early 1930s.\nTechnological breakthroughs and increasing oil production in Latin America, the Middle East, and the United States lead to overproduction. Disproving shortage projections by the U.S. Geological Survey, in less than a decade U.S. oil production more than doubles from what it was in 1920. Britain’s attempt to stabilize European oil prices through the 1928 Achnacarry Agreement, which limits sales by oil producers, is met with mixed success. In 1931, oil prices plummet to just a few cents a barrel. In 1933, the U.S. government imposes a production quota system for states and a duty tax on imported oil to keep cheap oil from flooding the market. Though the Supreme Court overturns the federal quota system in 1935, U.S. oil-producing states voluntarily continue it and prices begin to recover.\nGovernments begin to take a more active role in the oil industry. Iranian leader Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1932 cancels the concession of the British oil company Anglo-Persia but then later retreats after striking a deal for a fixed royalty and an increase in Persian laborers employed by the company. Meanwhile, European governments impose import quotas, set prices, and require fuel blending with ethanol made from excess crops, as well as requiring investment in domestic oil infrastructure. In 1938, the Mexican government nationalizes the oil industry and revokes U.S. oil concessions. The U.S. government does not retaliate, in part due to fears Mexico will align with Germany in World War II. Mexico’s actions foreshadow a wave of oil nationalizations that will follow in the decades after the war.\nAt the start of World War II, the United States is responsible for 60 percent of world production, followed by Russia and Venezuela. Japan, heavily reliant on U.S. oil imports, begins stockpiling oil and equipment shortly before it invades Indochina. In response, the U.S. government imposes controls on oil exports to Japan, effectively cutting off oil supplies in the summer of 1941. On December 7, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor but fails to target the Navy’s on-island oil storage—about four million barrels—leaving it to fuel the surviving Pacific fleet.\nBy 1941, oil shipments from the United States to allies in Europe are impeded by German U-boat attacks. When the United States enters the war, it embarks on a nationwide rationing plan that includes gas coupons and limiting driving speed to thirty-five miles an hour. Efforts also are made to bolster U.S. oil production and transport. Meanwhile, Venezuela enacts a new “fifty-fifty” oil law, which gives the country half of all oil profits but leaves U.S. concessions in place.\nIn 1938, Saudi Arabia is found to have vast quantities of oil. In 1943, with concerns growing about the diminishing U.S. oil production capacity, President Franklin Roosevelt declares Saudi oil vital to U.S. security and provides financial support. In February 1945, Roosevelt and Saudi King Abdul Aziz meet aboard a U.S. ship on the Suez Canal to discuss closer ties. A few years later, the world’s biggest oil field is found in Saudi Arabia, and the country quickly becomes the world’s largest exporter of oil—though it does not become a significant U.S. supplier for several decades.\nAt the end of World War II, the United States is an economic and military superpower. The country plays a central role in the global recovery, including providing energy aid to a devastated Europe. The war’s end also brings about the end of U.S. gas rationing. The U.S. auto industry booms, with the number of cars in the United States jumping from twenty-six million to forty million in the five years after the war. In the decades that follow, the transportation sector’s (mainly automobiles) share of oil consumption rises from about 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\nThe European Recovery Program, also known as the Marshall Plan, helps war-torn Europe get access to petroleum imports. Over the course of the forty-five-month program, the United States supplies more than $11 billion in oil aid, about 10 percent of the total aid provided by the program. The continent begins to become more dependent on oil for its energy needs as Europeans turn away from coal. But European oil needs begin to be increasingly met by the Middle East and not the United States. The United States is a net oil exporter in 1945, but by 1950 it is importing nearly one million barrels a day and within two decades the country is importing over six million barrels per day—more than a third of U.S. demand.\nIn August 1953, the Iranian military, with the help of British and U.S. intelligence agencies, overthrows Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq—who nationalized the country’s oil industry two years earlier. The U.S. government works with U.S. oil majors and the Iranian government—now run by the Shah—to bring Iranian oil back online following a British embargo of oil shipments. Iran’s oil remains nationalized, but in October 1954 the government agrees to a consortium of mainly U.S. companies to manage Iran’s oil industry. To prevent running afoul of U.S. antitrust laws, U.S. oil majors relinquish a small portion of their share in the consortium to allow independent U.S. producers to buy in.\nIn July 1956, Egypt nationalizes the Suez Canal, which has been controlled by Britain and France. The two countries, in a coordinated attack with Israel, temporarily seize the canal in October. Half the canal’s traffic is petroleum, and the ensuing crisis from its closure threatens Middle East oil shipments, which supply about eight hundred thousand barrels a day to Europe. The intervention stokes Cold War tensions, and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower compels a withdrawal to avoid a showdown with the Soviet Union. In a 1957 speech to Congress, Eisenhower says the Middle East would be a prize for international communism and asks Congress to provide economic and military support for any nation or groups of nations in the region with “governments manifestly dedicated to the preservation of independence and resistance to subversion.”\nIn 1959, the world once again faces an oversupply of oil and prices are slashed. U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower imposes the Mandatory Oil Import Program, a quota system on oil imports, so that they cannot exceed more than 9 percent of domestic consumption. The program also gives preferential treatment to Canada and Mexico. The quota lasts for fourteen years. U.S. oil prices remain stable, and eight years later are 60 percent to 70 percent above Mideast crude prices.\nArab nations, relying heavily on oil revenue, are increasingly frustrated by oil price cuts by largely Western oil companies—and by U.S. import caps, which also depress prices. In August 1960, Western oil majors once again slash prices without consulting exporting countries. In September, representatives from Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela meet in Baghdad with Iraqi officials—together they represent 80 percent of the world’s crude exports. On September 14, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Nations (OPEC) is formed with the purpose of defending oil prices. However, in its initial years, OPEC exerts little influence and is virtually ignored by the U.S. government.\nOn June 6, 1967, Israel enters into an armed conflict with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, known as the Six Day War. The next day, Arab oil ministers call for an embargo on countries friendly to Israel. Oil shipments halt to the United States and Britain. U.S. domestic production, however, surges by one million barrels a day and largely offsets the temporary loss of Mideast oil globally. By September, the embargo is lifted, and, for a short time, the world experiences another oil glut.\nIn April 1971, OPEC moves to rebalance profit sharing and oil prices and refuses to allow foreign oil companies to deal with the organization as a whole. The bloc instead forces them into separate negotiations, one for Persian Gulf producers (Tehran Agreement) and one for producers on the Mediterranean (Tripoli Agreement), resulting in higher prices. The incident marks a turning point for OPEC’s clout. Within a decade, many of OPEC’s members begin to partially or fully nationalize their oil resources and have greater influence in setting oil prices. By the end of the 1970s, international oil companies have unfettered access to just 7 percent of the world’s oil reserves, down from 85 percent in the 1960s. U.S. oil production, meanwhile, peaks in 1970 and declines about 45 percent within three decades.\nU.S. spare production capacity is evaporating. Faced with a looming gasoline shortage, in April 1973 President Richard Nixon announces he is ending the Mandatory Import Program—which sets limits on oil imports—but rejects recommendations to implement conservation efforts and develop fuel alternatives. The import mandate comes two years after Nixon imposes oil price controls as part of his anti-inflation strategy. Oil imports, representing about 30 percent of U.S. consumption in 1973, increase to nearly 50 percent of consumption [PDF] within four years.\nSyria and Egypt attack Israel on October 6, 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. On October 19, with the war still underway, the Nixon administration announces a $2.2 billion military aid package to Israel. Arab states respond by suspending oil shipments to nations supportive of Israel. The embargo reduces traded oil supplies by 14 percent internationally. Gasoline prices in the United States increase as much as 40 percent within a few months. Consumers in Europe, Japan, and the United States begin to panic over oil shortages. Hours-long lines at gas stations form across the United States as people start to hoard gas supplies following gas rationing and price controls. President Nixon on November 7 announces a swath of new energy policies and “Project Independence,” a goal of U.S. energy independence by 1980.\nWith the 1973 oil embargo after the Yom Kippur War wreaking economic havoc, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger starts “shuttle diplomacy,” helping attain disengagement between Israel and Egypt in January 1974. Arab oil ministers agree to end the embargo on March 18, 1974, on the condition that the United States also promotes Israeli-Syrian disengagement. Kissinger helps achieve an agreement between the two states in May, which includes a cease-fire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from some captured territories. The world’s top economies form the International Energy Agency to coordinate “in times of oil supply emergencies.” They also come together at a summit in France in 1975 to discuss the global economy and energy dependency. This heads-of-state forum is called the Group of Six and later becomes the G8 and then the G7.\nThe 1973 oil crisis spurs the U.S. Congress to mandate a fifty-five miles per hour speed limit on highways and to pass the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which establishes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and fuel efficiency standards for new automobiles. Nixon-era price controls remain on domestic oil, depressing production. Between 1974 and 1978, U.S. consumption of imports nearly doubles, and U.S. oil demand rises by about 2.1 million barrels per day. In 1977, the Carter administration organizes energy agencies into the Department of Energy. President Carter also puts out his first set of energy proposals focusing mainly on conservation, and signs legislation in 1978 to encourage fuel switching and efficiency by electric utilities and other U.S. industries.\nIn October 1978, thousands of oil workers go on strike in Iran, as part of a cycle of unrest protesting leader Mohammed Reza Shah. Oil output in Iran drops from more than five million barrels a day to zero by December—amounting to about a 5 percent loss in global production. The Shah is forced to leave the country in January 1979. Exiled senior Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returns to assume control of Iran under an Islamic government. A group of Iranian students takes over the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, taking sixty-three American hostages for more than four hundred days. President Carter responds by severing diplomatic relations and embargoing Iranian oil imports. Between January 1979 and December 1979, global oil prices more than double.\nIran’s revolution sparks panic over another oil-supply shortage, and oil prices double. Long gas lines return to the United States. In July, President Jimmy Carter gives his fifth major speech on energy policy, which includes announcing more energy conservation measures and a phase-out of oil price controls. A frustrated Carter admonishes the nation for worshiping “self-indulgence and consumption” and having “a crisis of confidence.” In 1980, Carter signs the Energy Security Act [PDF], which includes incentives for geothermal, solar, and biomass energy to give electricity generators new alternatives to oil. It also establishes the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corporation, intended to produce two million barrels a day in liquid fuel from non-petroleum sources like coal within five years.\nIran and Iraq go to war in September 1980. Though the United States is officially neutral, it renews diplomatic ties with Iraq, which have been severed since the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. Continuing attacks on both Iraqi and Iranian oil facilities remove four million barrels a day in oil production from the global market. The Reagan administration issues a national security directive in 1983 [PDF] to increase the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf to help protect the oil facilities and shipments to allies. The war lasts eight years.\nThe U.S. Congress imposes a moratorium on new offshore drilling off the California coast in 1981 in response to public outcry and lingering environmental concerns caused by an oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. Within a few years, the ban is extended to all new leases in U.S. coastal waters, except for parts of the Gulf of Mexico and some waters off the coast of Alaska. This ban continues to the present day. However, existing offshore drilling, from leases before the moratorium and from allowed parts of the Gulf and Alaska, represents about 8 percent of all U.S. production in 1981. Between increasing production in allowed offshore areas and a drop in overall U.S. production, offshore drilling rises to about 30 percent of U.S. production in the next three decades.\nThe Reagan administration fully deregulates crude prices in 1981, allowing U.S. producers to raise prices to market levels. Non-OPEC production begins to outstrip that of OPEC—which hinders the cartel’s influence on oil prices. Global demand begins to drop due to high prices and conservation measures, and another oil surplus ensues. By 1982, the United States imports about 28 percent of its oil, down from more than 45 percent in 1977. By 1985, U.S. fuel economy averages for automobiles reach nearly 28 mpg, up from 20 mpg in 1978, and consumer fuel switching for heating and electricity helps lower oil consumption. Oil prices drop from a yearly average of $35 per barrel in 1981 to less than $15 in 1986. The collapse in price encourages oil companies to shift to cheaper foreign exploration, and U.S. imports begin to steadily rise again.\nThe super tanker Exxon Valdez strikes a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling eleven million barrels of oil and damaging coastline and fisheries. Considered one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history, the spill—and its $2 billion cleanup cost—bolsters the environmental movement and leads to policies that further restrict offshore drilling. In 1990, Congress passes the Oil Pollution Act [PDF] for offshore accidents, which creates a three-tiered emergency response plan for spills, caps liability for operators of offshore facilities, and establishes a trust fund that makes up to $1 billion available for each spill incident.\nIraq invades Kuwait on August 2, 1990, following a dispute over the Rumaila oil field on the border. In a speech on August 8, 1990, President George H.W. Bush says Iraq’s aggression poses an economic threat to the United States, which now imports half its oil. Bush also declares the “sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia [a] vital interest” and deploys troops to the country. Nations dependent on Persian Gulf imports, such as Japan, provide much of the funding for a U.S.-led, multinational military effort to liberate Kuwait in January 1991. The Bush administration releases thirty-four million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in anticipation of an oil shock, but contrary to predictions, oil prices drop from about $30 per barrel in September to less than $20 in January. Iraq surrenders in late February 1991.\nIn 1993, the Clinton administration announces a partnership to develop and produce affordable, fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles. But inexpensive oil and a booming economy drive up consumption in the United States. While European and Japanese car companies move ahead with commercialization of the first hybrid passenger vehicle, sales of gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles (SUVs)—considered light trucks and thus exempted from tougher U.S. fuel economy standards—explode. SUVs make up a large part of the fleet of U.S. automakers, garnering significant profits in comparison to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. Between 1993 and the country’s record demand for oil in 2005, consumption increases by 3.6 million barrels a day to 20.8 million barrels per day.\nIn 1997, most of the world’s leaders sign the Kyoto Protocol, an international mechanism for countries to reduce and adapt to rising greenhouse gas levels in order to mitigate climate change. But the United States, the largest greenhouse emitter of the time, refuses to ratify the treaty and for the next decade faces international criticism for its slow adoption of emissions-reduction policies. And though a third of manmade emissions come from petroleum, U.S. policy on oil consumption remains focused on energy security and air quality. Environmental advocates target the U.S. oil and auto industries for lobbying against climate policy in the country for the next decade.\nAsia’s economic crisis in 1997 causes a drop in demand in what has been a growth region for oil markets. Though OPEC tightens its oil production quota, global prices plunge to below $10 per barrel at the end of 1998, down from nearly $20 per barrel in late 1997. The downturn, plus an increasingly constrained environment for oil concessions globally, encourages a string of oil mergers among the world’s largest private oil companies, including ones between BP and Amoco (the largest foreign takeover of a U.S. company to date), Exxon and Mobil, and Texaco and Chevron. Accused of stifling competition, these mergers face political scrutiny [PDF] in the next decade as U.S. gas prices increase significantly.\nIn February 1999, Hugo Chavez assumes office as president of Venezuela, and embarks on a social revolution that includes financing new social programs with the country’s oil revenues. Venezuela continues to be one of the largest sources of U.S. oil imports, but Chavez is increasingly critical of U.S. foreign policy over the course of the next decade and threatens repeatedly to cut off oil shipments. In 1999, Vladimir Putin takes office as president of Russia, which has the largest conventional oil reserves outside of OPEC. Both Venezuela and Russia nationalize much of their oil resources and restrict access by international oil companies.\nIn 2004, Canada surpasses Saudi Arabia as the largest single exporter of oil to the United States, providing 1.6 million barrels per day compared to the Saudi’s 1.5 million barrels. A decade before, Canada begins investing heavily to develop its oil sands, which requires more money and effort to extract and refine than conventional oil. Many estimate oil sands place the country’s oil reserves second to Saudi Arabia. In 1999, oil sands represent about 15 percent of total Canadian crude production, but by 2010 oil sand production is nearly half. Still, heavily polluting oil sand production increasingly becomes an environmental concern.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Congress passes the Energy Policy Act, which includes new incentives for transportation fuel alternatives and flex-fuel cars as well as new subsidies for domestic oil exploration. The law mandates that 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels be blended into gasoline by 2012. In his 2006 State of the Union address, U.S. President George W. Bush says “America is addicted to oil.” The law is criticized for adding billions in federal subsidies to the oil industry, and subsidies of corn-based biofuel are criticized as a threat to food security and the environment. Some energy experts criticize U.S. tariffs on Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, which is cheaper and more energy efficient to produce.\nIn 2006, a time of near record-high U.S. oil consumption and imports, oil prices begin to rise steadily, topping a record $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008. This translates to gasoline averages above $4 per gallon in much of country. Experts debate the cause of the record prices, blaming it on factors such as the economic rise of China and India, commodity market speculation, and basic issues of supply. Fuel prices and high food prices begin to cause unrest around the world. In the United States, high gas prices in a presidential election year invigorate debate about increasing domestic production, especially ending the moratorium on offshore drilling and in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. “Drill baby drill” becomes a rallying cry for the Republican Party. Shortly after the global financial crisis begins in 2008, oil prices plummet.\nIn 2007, Congress passes the Energy Independence and Security Act, which will increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards from 27.5 mpg to 35 mpg by 2020, and ends the light truck exclusion. The law also mandates greater production of non-corn-based ethanol, and requires biofuels blended with gasoline and diesel to be at least 20 percent less in greenhouse gas lifecycle emissions than the petroleum-based fuels. In May 2009, the Obama administration announces accelerated CAFE standards of 39 mpg for cars and 30 mpg for light trucks, which the administration highlighted as part of its climate change policy goals.\nIn the spring of 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama lays out his plans for U.S. energy policy, including supporting more biofuels and opening more U.S. waters to offshore oil drilling. But in April, a deepwater drilling rig explodes and sinks in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a massive, four-month oil spill. The Obama administration, in response, places a temporary ban on all new offshore drilling projects in order to review U.S. safety and environmental enforcement. Calls renew for strengthened measures to reduce U.S. oil consumption, now at less than nineteen million barrels per day, down nearly two million barrels from 2005 record levels.\nIn February 2011, Libya becomes the first major oil-producing nation to join a spate of popular uprisings in the region, which topples regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. With the largest reserves in Africa, Libya represents about 2 percent of global oil production. Global oil prices spike nearly 10 percent in one day. Though the country does not supply oil to the United States, concerns grow that the situation in Libya and potential unrest in other oil-producing nations could lead to a new global oil crisis. In a March 30 speech, U.S. President Barack Obama says: “We will keep on being a victim to shifts in the oil market until we get serious about a long-term policy for secure, affordable energy.” He pledges to reduce U.S. oil dependence by one-third within a decade.\nThe Obama administration announces it will release thirty million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve over thirty days. The administration says the move is to offset the loss of Libya’s 1.5 million bpd in output since civil war erupted in February. The U.S. release coincides with the release of another thirty million barrels from the reserves of other members of the International Energy Agency. The IEA says “greater tightness in the oil market threatens to undermine the fragile global economic recovery.” The coordinated release comes after OPEC ministers fail to agree to greater output. The U.S. reserve sale represents the fourth major drawdown since the reserve’s initiation in 1977. The administration’s decision draws criticism from some analysts and political opponents for its timing, rationale, political overtones, and uncertain impact on oil markets.\nImports of crude oil and petroleum products fall to less than 260,000 barrels per day, the lowest in almost two decades, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The reduced reliance on foreign oil is the result of both declining demand and a domestic energy revolution which, through the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, unlocked vast reserves of “tight oil” in shale rock formations. Tight oil production surges from less than one million barrels a day in 2010 to over four million barrels a day by December 2015, exceeding the individual production of every OPEC member except Saudi Arabia.\nU.S. tight oil producers contribute to a global supply glut that puts downward pressure on prices. By November, crude oil falls below $75 a barrel, down from $110 in June. OPEC members meet in Vienna, where, despite opposition from some members who want to cut OPEC oil production to halt the price slide, Saudi Arabia pushes the group to maintain a production target of thirty million barrels per day. The organization meets and regularly exceeds that target, leading to further price declines below $50 a barrel by early 2015, which squeezes the finances of oil-exporting countries and forces unconventional drillers in the United States to curb costs and sharply cut production.\nPresident Barack Obama rejects the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported more than eight hundred thousand barrels of oil per day from Canada to Texas. Subject to multiple rounds of State Department review since its conception in 2008, supporters said it would have created jobs and enhanced energy security, while opponents worried about potential damage to the environment from spills and increased carbon emissions. Debate over the merits of the cross-border pipeline will continue, as TransCanada, the company behind the project, files a lawsuit against the U.S. government charging discriminatory treatment under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nCongress votes to lift four-decade-old restrictions on U.S. crude oil exports, and a shipment immediately leaves the port of Corpus Christi, Texas, for sale in Europe. The shipment consists of light sweet crude oil drawn from south Texas’s Eagle Ford shale deposits. Even as the United States continues to import oil, opportunities for exports will arise since many of the country’s existing refineries are not optimized to process the type of light crude drawn from shale. However, most analysts believe that the impact on production, prices, and geopolitics of lifting the restrictions will be modest.\nThe Paris Agreement—signed by more than 190 countries, including the United States—enters into force. The most ambitious climate accord to date, the agreement requires all parties to set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of arresting the rise in the average global temperature. Countries also agree to aim for net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century. The United States pledges to cut its emissions by more than 25 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, a move that requires transitioning away from fossil fuels, including oil. Although the accord does not include enforcement mechanisms, there are periodic performance reviews meant to encourage countries to adopt more ambitious targets.\nAfter campaigning on a promise to boost U.S. oil production and achieve energy independence, President Donald Trump begins rolling back his predecessor’s policies. In June, Trump announces the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which takes effect in November 2020. His administration later scraps Obama’s tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, which the Environmental Protection Agency says will result in about two billion more barrels of oil consumed. The U.S. fracking boom continues, with the administration leasing four million acres of federal land to fossil fuel companies. Trump also revives the Keystone XL pipeline and, with support from the Republican-controlled Congress, opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska for oil drilling despite opposition from Democrats, environmental activists, and some Alaska Native groups. Alaskan lawmakers and other Alaska Native groups support the move due to the expected revenue and job growth.\nThe world is rocked by the emergence of a new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that quickly becomes a global pandemic. Response measures, including stay-at-home orders, trigger a sharp drop in the demand for oil. Falling oil prices create a rift within OPEC and lead to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, with Riyadh ramping up production to further slash prices in an effort to force Moscow to the table. Oil prices hit rock bottom; in April, a major benchmark price for U.S. crude oil briefly falls below zero for the first time in history. After Whiting Petroleum Corporation, a major U.S. producer, declares bankruptcy, President Trump attempts to broker an OPEC deal to prevent further damage to the U.S. industry. After Trump intervenes, OPEC and Russia agree to curb production and raise prices.\nPresident Joe Biden is sworn into office and promises to take aggressive action on climate change. He rejoins the Paris Agreement and pledges to cut U.S. emissions by at least 50 percent of 2005 levels by 2030—and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, Biden calls for a return to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, as well as measures to spur the use of electric vehicles, among other proposals. Biden cancels the Keystone XL pipeline and suspends drilling leases in the ANWR. However, approval for drilling on other federal lands continues at a record pace. As the pandemic abates in the United States, demand for oil rebounds and gas prices surge to a seven-year high.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine causes turmoil in global oil markets. Biden blocks U.S. imports of oil from Russia, and Western sanctions cause energy companies to withdraw from the country. Oil prices, already rising in the wake of the pandemic, surge to their highest level since 2008. In response to near-record gasoline prices, U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle call for boosting domestic oil production, though some in Congress urge a quicker transition to renewable energy. The United States and other members of the International Energy Agency announce plans to collectively release sixty million barrels of oil from strategic reserves. Meanwhile, the Biden administration considers smoothing rocky relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela in the hope that those countries will supply more oil. Senior U.S. officials travel to Caracas for the first time since 2019, and the Biden administration pushes to finalize negotiations on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and lifting U.S. sanctions on Tehran.\nU.S. crude oil production surpasses thirteen million barrels a day for the first time, making the United States the world’s largest producer of the commodity. The surge in production keeps U.S. gasoline prices low despite several rounds of voluntary production cuts by the OPEC+ coalition, which includes Russia. However, the United States still imports more than it exports amid high domestic energy demand and a mismatch between refining capacity and the type of crude oil produced by U.S. shale fields. Meanwhile, some governments push for a global deal to phase out fossil fuels at the year-end COP28 summit, citing their contribution to climate change and the year’s record heat.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        MIA: History: ETOL: Newspapers & Periodicals: International Socialist Review: Issue 26\nInternational Socialist Review, November–December 2002\nSaman Sepehri\nThe Geopolitics of Oil\nFrom International Socialist Review, Issue 26, November–December 2002.\nDownloaded with thanks from the ISR Archive.\nMarked up by Einde O’Callaghan for the ETOL.\nIf you want to rule the world you need to control the oil. All the oil. Anywhere.\nMichel Collon, MonopolyTHE REGION that comprises Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia is at the epicenter of the pending U.S. war on Iraq. Despite all the rhetoric about weapons of mass destruction, one glaring fact stands out: These four countries have more proven oil reserves under their soil than the rest of the world combined.\nA quick glance at the Bush administration’s corporate ties reveals close connections to virtually the whole oil and gas industry. Vice President Dick Cheney was the head of Halliburton, the world’s largest oil services firm. Secretary of Commerce Don Evans was a partner at Tom Brown, a Denver-based oil exploration firm. Exxon, the world’s largest corporation in terms of revenue, was second only to scandal-ridden Enron in contributions to the Republican Party, and National Security Advisor Condeleezza Rice, the administration’s “Russian expert,” was on the board of directors of Chevronóthe contractor for the development of the Caspian’s largest oil field and pipeline network in Kazakhstan. Yet, the coming war with Iraq is less about satiating the U.S. thirst for oil and lining the pockets of Bush administration croniesóthough it will help do bothóthan it is about the control of oil.\nOil is the world’s most important commodity. Without oil, today’s industrial society would simply be impossible. Oil and natural gas are the fuel for the engine of modern capitalism, with Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations accounting for two-thirds of all oil consumed in the world.1\nOil and gas are not only the source of 62 percent of the energy used in the world, they are integrated into the production of many goods and products that we take for granted.2 But just as important, every tank, every airplaneófrom the B-52 to the stealth bomberóevery cruise missile, and most war ships in the U.S. or any other nation’s military arsenal, rely on oil to wage their terror. In fact, the U.S. Department of Defense is the consumer of over 80 percent of all the energy used by the U.S. government.3\nOverall, oil and gas make up 65 to 70 percent of all the energy consumed by the three largest economies in the worldóthe U.S., Japan, and the European Union. And many of the industrializing countries of the Third World, such as South Korea, China, Brazil, and Mexico, have seen their oil and gas consumption skyrocket.\nFirst World War: Blood and oil\nThe importance of oil to modern industrial society grew rapidly with the proliferation of automobiles in the early 1900s. But the turning point for oil’s importance was the First World War. By switching the British navy from coal to oil, British Secretary of the Navy Winston Churchill gave Britain and its allies a crucial advantage over their enemies. After the Allied victory, British foreign secretary Lord Curzon stated, “The Allies floated to victory on a wave of oil.”4\nAfter the war, the epicenter of oil production shifted from Texas and the Caribbean basin to the Middle East, where vast oil reserves were discovered. From that point on, yesterday’s alliesóFrance, Britain, and the U.S.óbecame competitors in the carve up of what was to become the greatest prize of the century. Britain, which already had control of all of Iran’s oil (won through a concession in 1901), emerged initially as the best-placed contender. Frustrated with the British government’s attempt to block every American company’s efforts to obtain concessions in Iran and Iraq, the president of Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon) complained that “British domination would be a greater menace to [Standard Oil of] New Jersey’s business than a German victory would have been.”5\nSecond World War: The U.S. becomes top dog\nThe U.S. government waged a hard battle to gain a foothold for U.S. oil companies in the region. But it was the Second World War that tipped the balance in the race for oil completely in the favor of the U.S. By the end of the war, Europe was devastated and Germany was destroyed. France and Great Britain, the major imperial powers, emerged much weaker from the war, while the U.S. emerged relatively unscathed and controlling over half the world’s industrial output. This helped the United States claim the mantle of the dominant power in the West, while France and Britain became its junior partners.\nThis change in the pecking order of the world’s imperial powers was reflected in the control of oil resources after the Second World War. In 1940, the U.S. share of Middle East oil stood at 10 percent. By 1950, it had jumped to 50 percent.6 Some of this was due to new concessions gained by the U.S. However, the U.S. took over Britain and France’s oil holdings, busted up the British monopoly in Iran, and made France marginal in Iraq. For example, after Iran’s nationalist Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq nationalized the British-controlled Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) operations in 1951, the American CIA organized a coup to overthrow Mossadeq, replacing him with the Shah, who became a staunch ally of the U.S. Once Mossadeq was overthrown, Iranian oil was not returned to the British AIOC. It was divided up among Exxon, Mobil, Gulf Oil, and other American companies, which took their share for services rendered by the CIA, with AIOC now holding a minority share of 40 percent.\nThe freebee and the fix\nThe United States used the Marshall Plan (the U.S. aid program to rebuild Europe after the Second World War, officially known as the Economic Cooperation AdministrationóECA) to take control of European energy markets and to open access to raw materials in Europe’s colonial holdings. Walter Levy, a Mobil Oil economist, and later the head of the Marshall Plan’s oil division, noted in 1949 that “without ECA American oil business in Europe would already have been shot to pieces.”7 Of $13 billion in Marshall Plan aid, fully $2 billion was slated for oil imports, while the Marshall Plan actually “blocked projects for European crude oil production and helped American oil companies gain control of Europe’s refineries. All this was done without regard for the effects on domestic employment in coal or loss of internal self-sufficiency.”8 The net effect of this aid was that petroleum replaced Europe’s domestic coal as Europe’s main source of energy.9\nThe post-war era saw an enormous expansion in petroleum’s share of world energy usage. In 1929, oil and gas had accounted for 32 percent, and in 1939, on the eve of the war, it accounted for 45 percent of all energy used in the United States. But by 1952, petroleum’s share had risen to 67 percent and by the 1970s it had gone up to over 70 percent, where it has remained until today. Japan and Europe have shown a similar pattern of growth, with Japan relying on oil and gas for 63 percent of its energy needs and Europe for 65 to 70 percent today.10\nSuper-profits\nCorporate oil giants led by American firms extracted unbelievable profits from their investments after the Second World War. In Iran, between 1954 and 1964, Western companies earned a compounded interest rate of profit of 70 percent per year!11 And in the Middle East as a whole, at the height of the oil companies’ power in 1970, net assets of petroleum industries valued by the U.S. Commerce Department at $1.5 billion yielded $1.2 billion in profitsóa return of 79 percent.12 It was no wonder that in the 1970s, 40 percent of all U.S. investments in developing countries, and 60 percent of all U.S. profits from developing countries, were oil related.13\nThe great wealth extracted from Middle East countries helped oil corporations become massive edifices that dominated the world economic terrain. By 1973, seven of the world’s 12 largest companies were oil corporations.14 Known as the “Seven Sisters,” these oil giantsóExxon, Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, Gulf, Shell, and BPóhave dominated the world oil industry ever since.\nSurrogates\nBy the mid 1960s, the U.S. had control of Middle East oil, and U.S. corporations had cornered the world market and were raking in immense profits. With what turned out to be two-thirds of the world’s oil under its control, what strategy did the U.S. use to protect its prize?\nThe U.S. strategy, known as the Nixon Doctrine relied on building surrogate states in the area, which would be the executors of U.S. policy and guardians of Middle East oil. U.S. policy had three pillars in the Middle East: 1) Saudi Arabia, home to the world’s largest oil reserves; 2) Iran, where the CIA had organized a coup in 1953 to install a U.S. ally, the Shah, to power; and 3) Israel, formed in 1948 and built as a colonial settler state based on the expulsion and brutal oppression of the native Palestinian population. Israel became the biggest recipient of U.S. aid, and wholly dependent on the U.S. for its existence. Each state was to perform a different role in the region.\nThe Saudi state was by and large the creation of the U.S. oil companies and the United States government. In the 1920s, Saudi Arabia was a feudal society with different families ruling various regions. It was forged into a nation in 1932 when Ibn Saud and his clan defeated the other families and unified the country, naming it after themselves.\nTexaco and Standard Oil of California (SOCALólater renamed Chevron) won a concession to drill for oil in Saudi Arabia in 1936óa mere four years after the country had been formed. To share the exploration, and marketing of their new Saudi oil concession, a new company named ARAMCO (Arab American Oil Company) was formed, which over the next two decades would become the largest oil producer in the world.\nSaudi Arabia at the time had no government to speak of. There was no state structure, no ministries, no state budget, or army. Much of what became the Saudi state, in fact, was created by the United States and ARAMCO. Ghassane Salameh explains that:\nIn return for royalties, the government had nothing to give ARAMCO, but the signature on the bottom of the contractóno armed forces to defend the [oil] installations, no administration, no skilled labor, no educated personnel, no real infra-structure of any sort, much less a government capable of regulating the corporate giant at the heart of kingdom. As a result ARAMCO engaged in not only all aspects of Saudi oil production but also built housing, airports, schools, dug for water, and above all invited the U.S. military to install a base near the oil fields to protect [them].15\nIn fact, it was the installation of this American base in Dharan in 1944, which prompted the Saudi king to form a ministry of defense.\nWhatever may have changed since then, Saudi Arabia retains certain defining features. With 25 percent of the world’s reserves and the largest oil production facilities in the world, oil defines the state, and Saudi Arabia is the Mecca of world oil. The Saudi state functions as a family businessóin effect an extended family endeavor, ruled by the Ibn Saud family. Oil is the main source of state funding and the majority of the population is either directly or indirectly dependent on the state for employment for its livelihood. Finally, the survival of the state continues to depend on U.S. support, which, paradoxically, is also a major source of its internal instability.\nSaudi Arabia was the economic prize. But Israel became the main security asset, the watchdog of the region. Its role was to challenge, check, and if necessary destroy any challenge to the U.S.ómostly threats from Arab nationalist regimes which had taken power in 1950s and 1960s in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Israel was supported to the tune of $4 to $5 billion in U.S. aid and armed with U.S. weapons. Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson summarized the U.S. strategy:\n[S]tability as now obtains in the Middle East is, in my view, largely the result of the strength and Western orientation of Israel on the Mediterranean and Iran on the Persian Gulf. These two countries, reliable friends of the United States, together with Saudi Arabia, have served to inhibit and contain those irresponsible and radical elements in certain Arab statesósuch as Syria, Libya, Lebanon, and Iraqówho, were they free to do so, would pose a grave threat indeed to our principal sources of petroleum in the Persian Gulf.16\nIran, the third pillar of the U.S. strategy, acted as the policeman of the Gulf. Iran had the population, state structure, and infrastructure that Saudi Arabia lacked, and the Shah of Iran, using Iran’s oil income, built a formidable military with one of the world’s most up-to-date air forces. Between 1970 and 1978, the U.S. exported over $20 billion worth of arms to Iran, amounting to what U.S. Representative Gerry Stud of Massachusetts called, “the most rapid buildup of military power under peacetime conditions in the history of the world.”17 The Shah himself was arrogantly blunt about his role stating in 1974: “Without Iran to defend them the Arab states in the Gulf would be dead.”18\nOPEC’s rise\nThe 1970s also saw the rise of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC was founded in Baghdad in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, and was later joined by Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, and Nigeria. It was originally formed as a way for these countries to try to negotiate a better share than the 10 to 15 cents on every dollar of immense profits the giant oil multinationals were making from the marketing and sale of their oil.\nBut soon, its member countries realized that they could coordinate the amount of oil exported, not only to get a larger share of their own oil revenue, but as a means to control the supply, and therefore the price, of oil. Each country received a quota, negotiated within OPEC, of how much oil it could produce. If they would stick to these production quotas, OPEC countries could manipulate prices. Holding 40 percent of world’s production and a 50 percent share of oil available for export, OPEC has had a great leverage on oil supplies worldwide.\nMoreover, OPEC also controls 90 percent of the world’s excess oil production capacityówith Saudi Arabia holding more than half of that. While most other producers are nearly at the maximum of their production capacity, OPEC, limiting production through its system of quotas, is producing at about 80 percent of its full capacity. OPEC can easily ramp up production, to make up for shortages, in cases of emergency such as serious military conflicts.19\nThough the U.S. gets less than a quarter of its oil from OPEC, OPEC still has great influence on all oil importers worldwide. Its excess production capacity makes OPEC (and especially Saudi Arabia) of great strategic importance to the U.S.\nOPEC’s presence was especially felt with the 1973 oil embargo, organized by OPEC’s Arab countries as a protest of Israel’s war against Egypt and Syria. The embargo was organized against Israel, but also against the United States which was funneling arms and aid to Israel, ensuring an Israeli victory. During the embargo the price of oil tripled in a matter of weeks, increasing from $4 a barrel to $12 a barrel. However, more importantly than the increase itself, was the realization by OPEC of its power over oil markets.\n1979: A blow to U.S. imperialism\nThe United States faced serious problems in the region by the end of 1970s. It had to contend with OPEC’s control of oil supplies. Real disaster struck, however, when the Iranian revolution of 1979 overthrew the Shah. The “Policeman of the Gulf” was gone, replaced by an Islamic regime hostile to the United States. If the defeat in Vietnam had been a disaster for America’s sense of invincibility and military might, seriously limiting its ability to commit troops abroad, the 1979 Iranian revolution struck a blow to U.S. policy in the most strategically prized region for the United Statesóthe oil producing Persian Gulf.\nThe Iranian Revolution toppled the Shah, one of the three pillars of U.S. policy, a blow from which the U.S. has yet to fully recover. And in December 1979, the USSR invaded Afghanistan, adding to Washington’s concerns in the region. Saudi Arabia was also shaken at roughly the same time. A military coup attempt took place in September 1979, followed in November by an armed takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam’s holiest site, by those opposed to Saudi family rule, and riots by the Shiite minority in the oil rich Eastern Province in December.20\nA glance at two factors underlines the importance of the loss of Iran and the turbulence in Saudi Arabia. U.S. aid to Israel doubled in 1980, bolstering Israel after the loss of the Shah in Iran, and the price of oil tripledórising from $12 per barrel to its highest price ever, $35 per barrel (equal to over $65 per barrel in 2002 dollars). The U.S. sent massive amounts of arms to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, and urged the formation of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as a way to coordinate the efforts of Saudi Arabia with the Gulf’s weaker states–Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates–to build a common front against Iran.\nWith the loss of the Shah, the U.S. no longer could rely on surrogates to police the Gulf. So in 1980, President Jimmy Carter, announced Washington’s intention and willingness to interfere directly in the area under the new Carter Doctrine. The United States formed its new Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) with a mission ostensibly to guard against “any attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region [which] will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States.”21\nThe outbreak of war between Iran and Iraq in 1980 provided the perfect opportunity for the U.S. to not only contain Iran and cement its ties to the Gulf States, but to reinsert its military more fully in the Gulf. The U.S. now set up a string of bases and command centers in the Gulf states, stationing the U.S. Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. By 1983, the RDF had been expanded into Central Command (CENTCOM), now a permanent military presence in the region, with 17 ships under its command and the authority to requisition 35,000 troops.22\nMoreover, with the GCC’s help–and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia footing the bill–Iraq’s army under Saddam Hussein was built up to force a retreat of Iranian forces, which by 1985 looked to be winning the war. Tilting towards Saddam Hussein against Iran, the U.S. approved and even oversaw the transfer of some of the chemical and biological weapons and missile technologies which Bush today is accusing Iraq of having secretly developed. With U.S. backing, Iran lost the war, and the Iranian threat was contained. But with Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the U.S. now turned on its erstwhile ally. In a brief and completely one-sided bombardment and invasion, the U.S. killed at least 200,000 Iraqis–there is nothing close to an accurate count–many while they were retreating after the war was lost.\nBy 1992, the situation in the Gulf had been stabilized. The Iranian Revolution had been contained, and Iraq was left decimated and hampered with economic sanctions which were to kill more than a half million Iraqi children in the next decade. But regimes hostile to the U.S. were still in power in Iran and Iraq. Saddam Hussein had been left in power by the U.S., which feared an uprising from below would be more damaging and destabilizing than leaving the Iraqi regime intact, but caged and weakened. And the Iranian regime, although weakened and now more accommodating to the West, was still a source of concern for the U.S. The U.S. now moved from a policy of containment (of Iran) to that of dual containment (of Iran and Iraq).\nFurthermore, Saudi Arabia was facing internal problems, both economic and political. The Saudi economy, wholly dependent on oil revenues, was facing serious challenges. Lower oil prices brought falling revenues and increasing government debt through the 1990s, and the U.S. military presence and bases in Saudi Arabia, used to launch the invasion of Iraq, were becoming a source of public resentment towards the U.S. and Saudi regimes. The Gulf region may have been temporarily stabilized for U.S. interests, but it was not by any means permanent.\nDiversification\nThe U.S. quickly set out to strengthen its web of security arrangements in the region. The U.S. encouraged cooperation between Israel and Turkey, who signed military pacts and engaged in joint military training exercises. In the early 1990s, Turkey become the third largest recipient of U.S. military aid (behind Israel and Egypt), receiving as much as $700 million a year, using much of it to buy $2.3 billion worth of arms from the U.S. in just two years.23 Turkey’s Incirlik air base was modernized and became home to the U.S. F-16 jets used to bomb Iraqi forces under the excuse of protecting Iraq’s Kurdish minority in Iraq’s northern “no-fly zone.” Yet the U.S. has turned a blind eye when Turkey’s F-16 jets, sitting on the same tarmac at Incirlik, have bombed the bases of the Kurdish minority in Turkey.\n“Diversification of oil resources” became the motto for the United States. Sources other than the Persian Gulf; from Africa, to the North Sea to Canada, were tapped to diversify the source of U.S. oil imports. By U.S. calculations, this would not only cushion the U.S. (albeit temporarily) from any possible disruption from the Gulf, but just as importantly it would reduce the market share of OPEC, and therefore weaken its influence on oil supplies and prices.\nOPEC had already lost market share during the 1973 oil boycott. While the boycott had established OPEC as the force that had effective control of world oil supplies and therefore oil prices, it had sent oil consumers to look for sources of oil other than OPEC’s, such as Norway’s North Sea, as they came on line. Under these pressures, OPEC’s share, which had been about 50 percent of total world oil production in 1970, plummeted to a low of 31 percent by 1985. Since then, OPEC has managed to recoup some of losses, and raise its share to about 40 percent in 2000.24 But the push for diversification continues. For example, after over a decade of letting Africa rot in poverty, there is again interest and investments in Angola, Chad, and even Sudan to explore and develop oil resources, while in the Western Hemisphere, Mexico and Canada are chipping away at OPEC’s share.\nThe Caspian’s black gold\nThe Caspian Sea’s oil riches, opened to Western markets only after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, have shown the greatest promise as a potential alternative to Persian Gulf oil.\nThe oil and natural gas reserves in the former Soviet Union republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, are estimated to hold about 70 billion barrels of oil, or three times the reserves of the United States. Some estimates put the reserves of oil as high as 200 billion barrels, making this potentially the second largest oil and gas reserves in the world after the Gulf.25 The American Petroleum Institute has called the Caspian region “the area of greatest resource potential outside of the Middle East.” And Vice President Dick Cheney, while he was the CEO of Halliburton, stated that “I can’t think of a time while we had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically as significant as the Caspian”26\nWith its oil and gas riches potentially worth as much as $4 trillion, there has been a frenzied scramble to get a piece of the Caspian by all major oil companies. Chevron, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, BP-Amoco, Shell, and Unocal have all made bids for development of Caspian oil. But the competition is not limited to the oil majors. Japanese and Chinese companies have taken stakes in the oil consortiums, trying to secure oil shares, and Iran and Russia have been competing to become the main transport route for Caspian oil out of the area.\nThere are however, problems facing the development of Caspian oil and gas. There has been tension among the five countries bordering the Caspian over how to divide the sea. But the biggest problem is transporting its oil and gas to the world markets. Because the Caspian is actually a lake, pipelines have to carry its oil and gas to ports or through any number of nations to reach consumers. These transport routes have been the source of competition, since these pipelines are not only a source of revenue, but the transportation routes are of strategic importance.\nA number of pipelines have been proposed, with the cheapest and the most viable passing through Iran or using Russia’s existing pipeline system. The U.S. considers it strategically imperative to prevent most of the oil from running through Russian and Iranian pipelines. It has officially announced its desire to build multiple routes, but in practice the U.S. has thrown its weight behind the Baku-Ceyhan and Trans-Caspian pipelines, which will cross the Caspian under the sea and carry oil and gas to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean. Given the huge costs involved, major oil companies have balked at this proposal, questioning whether they can recoup investment and operation costs.\nOnly a few years ago, BP-Amoco, the major player in Azerbaijan, and other oil executives had expressed skepticism at the economic viability of this pipeline, despite U.S. and Turkish promises of subsidies. And analysts were suggesting that “the U.S. policy is built on a false promise toÖtorpedo major Russian and Iranian influence in the region–implying a much stronger commitment to the Caspian states than the U.S. really intends or even is able to keep.”27\nBut the September 11 attacks, and the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, have completely changed this. The U.S. is now firmly planted on both sides of the Caspian. Not only has the U.S. government signed security pacts with Azerbaijan and placed troops in Georgia, but it now has bases and troops on the Eastern Caspian shores, in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. With U.S. troops well in place, the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline’s construction started officially in October, 2002.\nThe concerns of economic viability however, are real. If oil prices drop, the Caspian’s oil will become less attractive. And, even though the Caspian may easily contain the estimated 200 billion barrels of oil, during the past three years the estimates of proven reserves have actually been reduced from 45 to 10 billion barrels.28 No doubt, with more exploration, much more than 10 billion barrels of oil will be found. However, at the end of the day, there may not be too little oil but too many pipelines to carry the volume of oil and gas eventually produced in the Caspian.\nGrowth\nThe world’s energy consumption has increased by 84 percent since 1970 (from 207 to 382 quadrillion BTUs) and it is expected to increase by another 60 percent over the next twenty years.29 The industrially advanced countries have been using the lion’s share of this energy: The U.S. uses 25 percent of all the energy consumed in the world, Japan 5 percent, and Western Europe 18 percent.30 Today, the U.S. is the biggest consumer of oil in the world, using 19 million barrels of the 77 million barrels used in the world daily.\nBut the rate of increase in energy consumption has not been uniform across the world. Industrialization and integration into the new global economy has meant an increase in energy usage in developing countries at a pace three times that of the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe. While the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan have seen their oil consumption increase by an average of 12 percent, Central and South America have seen an increase of 40 percent since 1990. Developing Asia has seen a 44 percent increase in energy õonsumption over the same period, led by South Korea and India, which have seen their energy grow by an astounding 84 percent and 59 percent, respectively.31ªEnergy demand in Latin America and developing Asian nations is expected to more than double by 2020. This growth will account for half of the total growth in energy demand in the world.\nThe biggest increases are expected to come from Asia. Asian economies are expected to overtake the United States as the biggest consumers of energy in the next twenty years. By 2020, these economies are expected to account for 27 percent of world energy consumption, while the U.S. is expected to consume 25 percent; Western Europe, 18 percent; Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, 13 percent; and Latin America, 5 percent of the world totals.\nThe biggest gains in Asia are expected to be in China, whose economy doubled in size the 1990s.32 Over the next 20 years, energy consumption in China is expected to grow at a rate four times the rate of the growth in Europe and the U.S. In less than 10 years China is expected to become the largest oil consumer in Asia, surpassing Japan as the world’s second largest consumer of oil after the United States.33 Oil consumption is expected to increase by 150 percent by 2020, and China’s natural gas usage is estimated to increase by 1,100 percent.34\nRussia: The new silk road?\nThe anticipated growth in energy demand has fueled the entry of new producers into the energy market. But the biggest entry in the oil markets, after a long hiatus following the collapse of the USSR, has been Russia. Before the 1991 collapse, the Soviet Union was the largest producer and the third largest exporter of petroleum in the world. While production is not at the preñ1989 levels, there is now enough excess production to resume oil and gas exports.\nTwo factors have allowed Russia’s bounceback: The stabilization of oil prices (up from $9 per barrel in 1998, to $28 per barrel today) has made oil exports much more lucrative. And ironically, Russia’s economic collapse has not only reduced internal demand, but with the devaluation of its currency, has made investment costs and Russian oil much cheaper.\nRussia does not have huge oil reserves–no more than 45ñ50 billion barrels. But it is the world’s second largest producer, and has made a serious bid to gain market share. With oil prices back above OPEC’s target of $20 per barrel, the Russian economy has shown strong growth in the past few years. Russian gross domestic product has grown by 8.3 percent in 2000 and 5.1 percent in 2001.\nThe Russian economy is extremely sensitive to oil prices. With energy accounting for 40 percent of its exports, fully 90 percent of Russia’s GDP growth has been due to oil and gas.35 Given Russia’s reliance on oil income, it has had an interest in working with OPEC to stabilize oil prices by limiting production along with OPEC’s production quotas. But, since oil prices had stabilized at $25 per barrel in early 2002, Russia has refused to continue any coordinated cuts with OPEC.\nHard up for foreign currency, and weighing its relations with the U.S. in the aftermath of September 11, Russia has tried to maximize its profits by winning market share from OPEC–a plan which fits well with the desire of the U.S. to diversify its sources of oil and reduce OPEC’s control on oil markets.\nDespite the show of cooperation between the U.S. and Russia, however, the September 11 attacks and U.S. invasion of Afghanistan have seriously undermined Russia’s position and plans in the Caspian region and Central Asia.\nBut Russia’s plans go beyond the Caspian. Although Russia is a major player in oil, it is natural gas which is Russia’s strong suit. World natural gas reserves are even more geographically concentrated than oil, with Russia and Iran accounting for half of the world’s reserves. Holding 32 percent of the world’s reserves, Russia is to natural gas what Saudi Arabia is to oil.\nWhile oil is expected to remain the dominant energy source in the world, natural gas consumption, however, is expected to grow at a faster rate. In fact, Jeroen van der Veer, president of Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum, stated that “Increasingly, the 21st century will be seen as the century of gas.”36 Demand for natural gas in Korea, Taiwan, China, and India is expected to triple over the next decade.\nAnd Europe’s natural gas needs will rise rapidly as well, as Europe switches over from oil. Europe already uses natural gas for 22 percent of its energy needs. Yet, this share may rise to as much as 60 percent, over the next decade.37 Russia is planning to secure its position as an oil and gas supplier to Europe and East Asia. Russia’s largest oil companies, Lukoil and Yukos, and the state-owned gas giant Gazprom which already supplies Europe with 25 percent of its natural gas, have been busy building the infrastructure to ensure their domination of European markets.38\nRussia’s biggest investments however, are in the East. The largest single foreign investment in Russia has been Exxon-Mobil’s $4 billion commitment to develop oil and gas at Sakhalin Island.39 Philip Watts, chairman of Shell, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, has called Sakhalin “the most ambitious green field project undertaken during my 30 years at Shell” 40 Sakhalin, located between Russia and Japan, holds 10 billion barrels of oil and even bigger gas reserves. Yet this modest amount alone cannot justify the interest. Sakhalin does provide an easily accessible source of oil and gas for the markets of China, Korea and Japan. It can serve as the eastern transportation hub for Russia’s oil and vast gas reserves elsewhere, and is an important part in Russia’s bid to become a player as an energy supplier to the growing markets of developing Asia.\nRussian companies have been joined by such regulars as Shell, Exxon-Mobil, BP, Texaco, Marathon Oil, Arco, and Halliburton, committing as much as $50 billion to the Sakhalin project.41 The proximity of Sakhalin to Eastern markets has also attracted interest from Japanese and Asian oil companies. Japan’s Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and SODECO own about a 25 percent share in Sakhalin’s projects. And India’s ONGC has made major investments, to meet India’s gas needs which are expected to quadruple in the next 50 years.42\nFor any of these projects to come to fruition, major investments are needed. Russia’s future may be in its natural gas but it needs oil income now to finance any future plans. Russia has to balance two contradictory factors: It needs market share and therefore is willing to increase production to take markets away from OPEC countries, but it needs oil prices to be high enough to make its oil exports be profitable.\nOne solution for Russian oil companies has been to look for cheap sources of oil–and Iraq has provided that. With the U.S. sanctions against Iraq in full force, Russian companies (and French companies to a smaller extent), have made inroads in Iraq. Russian companies have been a major outlet for Iraqi oil sold under the United Nation’s oil-for-food program–buying Iraqi oil and then reselling it on the world markets.\nBut more importantly, while the American and British oil corporations have been kept out by the U.S. sanctions, Russian oil companies have signed multi-billion dollar agreements with the Iraqi government to develop Iraq’s vast oil fields.\nLukoil, Russia’s largest oil company, has signed a $20 billion deal to develop the West Qurna field with a potential 15 billion barrels oil, and Zarubezhneft is closing on a $90 billion of concession for Bin Umra fields. And the giant Majnoon field with a potential 30 billion barrels of oil (bigger than the total proven reserves in the U.S.) is still up for grabs. Russian President Putin’s resistance to a UN-supported resolution effectively authorizing U.S. military action in Iraq is mainly to ensure that, with or without Saddam Hussein, Russian oil interests (as well as Iraqi debts to Russia) will be recognized.\nNot quite dead yet\nSince the 1991 Gulf War, diversification of oil resources and containment of threats to U.S. hegemony in the Middle East have served their purpose, but they have also created serious tensions and problems–for U.S. allies and foes alike–which are destabilizing the region. The presence of U.S. troops and dwindling oil income have undermined key U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia, and isolation and economic pressures have unleashed a reform movement in Iran which could spin out of the control of the reformers themselves. In addition, the growing unpopularity of the sanctions, and the continued survival of the Iraqi regime, remain a thorn in U.S. Middle East policy.\nLower oil prices and decreasing oil income–coupled with a rising population–have had serious consequences for Saudi Arabia. This has put enormous strain on the Saudi state/family’s ability to maintain the standard of living that most Saudi’s have been used to for years. According to World Bank estimates, Saudi Arabia’s oil dependent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dropped from $156.5 billion in 1980 to $125.5 in 1995, a drop of 25 percent. In the same period, Saudi Arabia’s population more than doubled, growing from 9 million to over 19 million. This translates to a per capita GDP drop of 62 percent. Per capita income has dropped by about 60 percent since 1970s oil boom.43\nThese problems are not limited to Saudi Arabia. Even though a number of Gulf economies have rebounded since 1990, the same pattern of declining income has been the rule in much of the Gulf. The Gulf economies have actually shrunk at a rate of 2.5 percent per year over the 1980s, shrinking twice as fast as the crisis-ridden African economies.44\nSaudi’s economic difficulties, combined with the presence of the U.S. military, are fertile ground for opposition to the Saudi regime. They are also behind the Saudi cooling of relations with the U.S. and increased cooperation with Iran’s reformers.\nIran, OPEC’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, relies on oil for 70 percent of it foreign exchange income. Yet its production has dropped by 45 percent since the 1979 revolution. Lack of investment has continued to take a toll on production numbers, aging wells and field are producing less, and new discoveries cannot be brought on line. Iran needs to invest $90 billion just to maintain production volume at current levels.45 Unable to internally finance these investments, Iran has been opening its oil industry to foreign investments for the first time since 1979.\nJust as damaging to Iran’s oil income is the rise in internal energy consumption. Over the past 20 years, Iran’s population has doubled, increasing energy consumption rapidly. If present trends continue, Iran, today the world’s fourth largest oil exporter will be a net importer of oil in 15 years. This would be disastrous to the Iranian economy and regime. In spite of U.S. economic sanctions, Iran has been fairly successful in attracting major oil companies to develop new oil and gas fields. Today, Shell, BP, France’s TotalFina, Italy’s AGIP and ENI, Russian Gazprom, Malaysia’s Petronas, and Japan’s Mitsui are involved in various projects in Iran.\nJust as Russia’s oil firms have been more than happy to exploit the vacuum left behind in Iraq’s oil production, U.S. “allies” in Japan and Western Europe have been keen to use the U.S. absence to form their own independent relations with Iran and secure their own oil and gas deals, outside of U.S. control.\nIronically, Saudi Arabia, the product of American imperial might in the Gulf, and the Iranian regime, the product of a revolution against that imperial might, are facing similar problems. Their cooperation is a product of economic necessity, to stabilize their blood line, and secure income for oil.\nBack to the Gulf\nNew players may have weakened OPEC, but Persian Gulf producers–and by extension OPEC–still hold all the advantages in oil production. Gulf oil is the cheapest to produce, the Gulf’s reserves are the biggest in the world, and the Gulf contains the world’s greatest excess production capacity, allowing it to control oil supplies and prices better.\nNew discoveries in the Caspian Sea, Africa, and South America have increased the amount of oil outside of OPEC’s quota system, providing alternative sources for the gargantuan American oil market as well as other growing markets. But even bigger discoveries in the Persian Gulf have actually increased both the Middle East’s and OPEC’s share of world reserves. In 1980, the Middle East held 55 percent of the world’s proven reserves and OPEC, 66 percent. Today, the Middle East’s share has increased to 69 percent, while OPEC countries now hold 80 percent of the world’s reserves.46 And since non-OPEC countries’ smaller reserves are being depleted much faster, their reserves will be depleted in, on average, 15 years; while OPEC’s oil is forecast to last for another 80 years.47\nGulf oil is also much cheaper to produce, making it much more profitable. Production costs for Persian Gulf OPEC nations are about $1.5 per barrel compared to about $4.5 in the U.S., $5.5 in Canada,$7 in the Caspian Sea, and as high as $10 a barrel in Russia.48 With worldwide imports from the Gulf expected to double in the next two decades, there is no way around the Gulf’s domination of oil markets. The Persian Gulf is still the world’s strategic prize.\nIraq: Too many birds with one stone?\nThe events of September 11 have provided the Bush gang with the unique opportunity to move from containing the tensions in the Persian Gulf to resolving them once and for all in its favor. It now wants to settle its “Iraqi and Iranian problems,” bring Saudi Arabia back into orbit, and roll back OPEC to its preñ1970s irrelevance. In the words of one recent Pentagon presentation, Iraq is seen by the U.S. as “the tactical pivot” for re-molding the Middle East on Israeli-American lines.49\nIn the event of a U.S. invasion, Iraq would become a vast source of cheap oil under U.S. control which could be used to undermine OPEC, provide the battering ram to deal with Iran and Saudi Arabia, and be a lever against Washington’s potential political or economic rivals.\nAt some 112 billion barrels, Iraq now has the second largest proven reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia’s 265 billion barrels. And like all other Middle East oil, Iraqi oil is cheap to produce. Iraq’s oil, just like the Saudi’s, is geographically concentrated, with fields containing as much as 10 to 30 billion barrels in one location. This translates into low production and exploration costs.\nIn addition to giving the U.S. leverage over the price of oil, control of Iraqi oil will also be an economic boon to U.S. oil giants. After the last Gulf war in 1991, there was a bonanza for American oil companies such as Dick Cheney’s Halliburton, to rebuild Kuwaiti and Saudi oil infrastructure damaged in the war. The same will be repeated in Iraq. The only question is how many of the contracts will go to American companies, and which crumbs will be thrown to the Russian and French companies to win their acquiescence.\nLower oil prices will tighten the noose around Iran’s ailing oil-dependent economy. Why not let economics soften up Iran, and make of the job of regime change in evil number two on Bush’s “axis of evil” list easier? The same economic pressures, combined with enough “diplomatic” persuasion, could also force Saudi Arabia back under U.S. control.\nIraqi oil could also be a lever against stronger opponents of the U.S., providing a useful tool to undermine competitors such as Russia and China, and hampering Russia’s bid to expand its oil development plans. The U.S. can also keep France, Germany, and Japan, who could pose a threat to its undisputed dominance, in check. As Asia Times writer Pepe Escobar put it: “Oil and gas are not the U.S.’s ultimate aim. It’s about controlÖ. If the U.S. controls the sources of energy of its rivals–Europe, Japan, China, and other nations aspiring to be more independent–they win.”50\nThe naked fist\nBut there is also a political dimension to the United States push to invade Iraq, which is just as important as control of oil. And that is simply the fact that the new Bush Doctrine cannot be considered “credible” so long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. As Angelo Codevilla, professor of International relations at Boston University put it: “Anybody who hates America can look at Iraq and say, ëThey have successfully thumbed their nose at America and lived to tell about it.’”51 The concern, then, is not that Iraq poses a real military threat, but that it has “thumbed its nose” at the U.S.\nThe point is underscored by Gregory Copley, head of the International Strategic Studies Association: “Iraq is a stage on the way to securing U.S. interests, and U.S. credibility will be absolutely lost unless it follows through effectively. The U.S. has got to be perceived to have had its way with the world community. This is the reality of historic power.”52\nToday, the United States is leading with its strongest suit, its unchallenged military might, to maintain its advantage over rivals and friends (who may be tomorrow’s rivals). While in peacetime, agreements, treaties, and trade pacts are negotiated over a period of months, even years, to settle disputes on how to carve up the world markets, in war the questions are settled faster and more directly. One first occupies, then gets whatever treaties one wants. In war, possession is nine-tenths of the law. If U.S. oil firms are behind their Russian and French competitors in scoring oil concessions in Iraq, or if they have been kept out of Iran by U.S.-imposed economic sanctions while European, Japanese, and Russian firms have been signing lucrative deals, “regime change” can change all that.

The health portion of the bill, which would also impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, has drawn criticism and opposition from Democrats and abortion advocates.\n“You know the saying, ‘women and children first’? Well for Republicans, billionaires go first, and women and children go overboard,” Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said in a Wednesday afternoon news conference. “That is essentially the principle that they are writing into their reconciliation bill right now.”\nPlanned Parenthood is one of the largest providers of family planning services to low-income patients. One in 10 Medicaid recipients aged 15-49 who received family planning services went to a Planned Parenthood clinic in 2021, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy, research and polling organization.\nFederal funds allocated through programs like Medicaid and Title X are already prohibited from directly paying for abortions, except in limited cases. With the bill, congressional Republicans are seeking to bar clinics and providers that offer abortions from accepting Medicaid for the other family planning and reproductive health care services they provide. The language of the measure, while not addressing Planned Parenthood by name, is written as to apply only to the organization.\n“Make no mistake, Planned Parenthood is being targeted,” Alexis McGill Johnson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, said at the news conference. “Just like any other health care provider, Planned Parenthood health centers get reimbursed by Medicaid for the care that they provide. This is nothing more than an attempt to end abortion in the United States, and they are willing to take away birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment and more to do it.”\nDemocrats attempted to block the provision in committee during a marathon 26-hour session of weighing and voting on amendments. On Wednesday morning, Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, a member of the Energy and Commerce panel, put forth an amendment to strike the measure from the bill.\n“Defunding Planned Parenthood is an assault on the health, freedom and dignity of women across this country,” Fletcher said, citing her home state, which has seen increased maternal mortality rates, as a “cautionary tale” of what happens when women’s health services are cut.\nSeveral Republican women on the committee spoke up in defense of the provision to cut off Planned Parenthood from Medicaid, which remained in the bill after members voted down several Democratic amendments to the health care section, including Fletcher’s.\n“In this bill, we’re not saying we’re outlawing abortion,” said GOP Rep. Erin Houchin of Indiana. “We’re just saying that tax dollars shouldn’t pay for big abortion. But let’s be very clear: you can’t pour water into only one part of a bucket: the American taxpayers should not be subsidizing abortion, we should be focusing our efforts on maintaining the solvency of health care programs that support moms and babies at every stage of life.”\nSupport The 19th\nYour donation will allow us to maintain our independence and remain true to our mission to represent women and LGBTQ+ people. Together, we’ll continue to cover this ongoing American story — without fear or favor.\nSome moderate House Republicans representing blue states have expressed unease at stripping Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, and the bill as a whole faces opposition from hardline Republicans concerned about its impact on the deficit. The measure could also come under scrutiny when it reaches the Senate: when Republicans tried to include a similar provision in the first round of Trump tax cuts in 2017, the Senate parliamentarian ruled it violated upper-chamber procedural requirements.\n“I think that this particular provision is going to run into procedural trouble,” House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark said at the Democratic Women’s Caucus’ Wednesday morning news conference.\n“Not only is this attack on reproductive health, it is just a continuation of taking away health care from Americans, in particular American women, in order to pay for tax cuts for those who will have no problem paying any medical bill,” she added.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        By Jessica F. Simmons\nMay 13, 2025\nThe budget package proposes steep health care cuts—and includes a new push to block patients from accessing reproductive care.\nIn a 30-24 party-line vote, cancer screenings, STI treatments, birth control, and other routine health care services are now one step closer to being cut off for millions of low-income Americans, after the US House passed a Republican-backed budget bill, Wednesday afternoon.\nThe bill is known as a reconciliation bill, a type of legislation Congress uses to fast-track major changes to federal spending and tax policy. Because of a special set of rules, reconciliation bills can pass the US Senate with a simple majority, bypassing the 60-vote threshold that typically blocks partisan legislation.\nRepublicans are using this process to advance a broad proposal that aims to extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which primarily benefited corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and make at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to key programs like Medicaid. Tucked inside the bill’s pages are major changes to how Medicaid operates—including a provision that would block Medicaid patients from receiving care at Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest provider of reproductive health services.\n“Defunding Planned Parenthood would be catastrophic to communities, put countless lives at risk, and wreak havoc on our public health system,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in a statement. “They’re set on depriving patients—particularly people who already have the hardest time getting health care—of access to affordable cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and many other essential reproductive health care services.”\nPlanned Parenthood is a national network of nonprofit clinics that provide reproductive and preventive health care. Most patients use Planned Parenthood for services like birth control, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and annual wellness exams. The majority of Planned Parenthood patients are low-income and use Medicaid to pay for care.\nThe organization also provides abortion services at many of its centers, but federal Medicaid dollars are already not allowed to cover abortion care except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment—a restriction known as the Hyde Amendment.\nWhat the bill would do\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce began the formal process of marking up the reconciliation bill. Tensions flared almost immediately after the hearing began. Just as Republican Chairman Brett Guthrie finished his opening remarks, five demonstrators—three in wheelchairs—began chanting “No cuts to Medicaid” from the gallery floor. They were quickly taken and escorted out of the room by Capitol Police, who ultimately arrested 26 people for protesting the proposed Medicaid cuts.\nAmong the dozens of health care changes included in the bill, Section 44126 directly targets Planned Parenthood and similar providers.\nThat section would prevent Medicaid funds from going to any nonprofit that:\n- Primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services,\n- Provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions, and\n- Received over $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024.\nWhile the bill does not name Planned Parenthood directly, the organization is the only national provider that fits all three criteria.\n“This section prohibits Medicaid funds to be paid to providers that are nonprofit organizations, that are essential community providers that are primarily engaged in family planning services or reproductive services,” the bill states.\nIf enacted, the measure would block Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed for any Medicaid-covered care, even though abortion services are already excluded from federal funding. That means the Republicans’ reconciliation bill would only serve to prevent low-income Americans from accessing routine and preventative health care.\nNearly two hours into the hearing, just after opening statements concluded, Democratic New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., a ranking member on the committee, motioned to adjourn the markup. The motion failed in a 29-24 vote, with all Republican members present voting against adjournment.\nEleven hours into the hearing, as the committee prepared to take up Subtitle D—the health section of the bill—Pallone motioned to delay debate on the final section until Wednesday morning at 9 a.m. The motion was denied in a 29–24 vote, with all Republicans present voting against it.\nThe hearing continued through the night and into the afternoon, ultimately stretching to 26.5 hours, ending around 4:30 p.m.\nHow this would affect patients\nAccording to internal emails released Sunday night by Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and brought into the hearing by Democratic California Rep. Nanette Barragán, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the reconciliation bill would leave at least 13.7 million more people uninsured by 2034.\nThat includes millions who would lose coverage due to Medicaid restrictions, reduced eligibility, and the defunding of providers like Planned Parenthood. The estimate also accounts for separate changes the bill would make to Affordable Care Act subsidies and marketplace access. The CBO noted that some of the losses are already expected under current law, but the reconciliation bill would significantly increase the damage.\nIt is also likely that Planned Parenthood patients would feel the impact immediately.\nPlanned Parenthood serves more than 2 million people per year, and more than half of those patients rely on Medicaid or other government programs to access care. For many, a Planned Parenthood clinic is their only nearby provider.\nThe organization reports that 64% of its health centers are in rural or medically underserved areas—regions where patients already face long waits, limited transportation, or few providers that accept Medicaid.\nIf the bill passes, those patients would no longer be able to use their Medicaid coverage to access services like wellness exams, annual check-ups, birth control, STI testing, or cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood.\nThe bill would not stop Planned Parenthood from providing care—but it would cut off federal funding, likely forcing clinics to reduce hours, cut jobs, scale back services, or even shut down.\nIn Virginia, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia officials said nearly 25,000 patients relied on Planned Parenthood health centers for care last year, including STI treatment, cancer screenings, and birth control. The organization also plays a key role in reaching rural and underserved communities that often lack other providers.\n“This isn’t about Planned Parenthood,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of PPAV. “It’s about whether tens of thousands of Virginians can keep getting the care they count on. No politician should decide who gets health care and who doesn’t. These are personal, private decisions between patients and their providers.”\nIn 2023 alone, Planned Parenthood centers in Virginia treated 673 chlamydia cases, flagged 53 potential cervical cancer diagnoses, and provided birth control to over 12,000 patients.\n“Defunding Planned Parenthood doesn’t save money—it costs Virginia more and leaves people without care,” Lockhart said.\nDuring the House committee hearing, Democratic Texas Rep. Lizzie Fletcher introduced an amendment to strike Section 44126—the provision that would block Medicaid funds from going to certain nonprofit reproductive health providers, such as Planned Parenthood. Fletcher warned that Texas offers a preview of what could happen nationwide.\n“Defunding Planned Parenthood is a terrible idea, and sadly, my home state of Texas provides a cautionary tale,” she said.\nFletcher noted that after Texas removed Planned Parenthood from its state Medicaid program in 2021, enrollment dropped by 24%, access to care fell by 39%, and Medicaid births increased.\n“The care could not be replaced,” she said. “This is just another way people will lose access to health care.”\nThe amendment went to a vote but was rejected in a 28–24 party-line decision, with all Republican members present voting against it.\nWhy this is happening now\nThe reconciliation bill stems from a budget resolution passed earlier in April that instructed House committees to reduce federal spending across multiple agencies. The Committee on Energy and Commerce was tasked with submitting “changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not less than $880 billion for the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.”\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said earlier this month at the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America’s gala that the legislation would “redirect funds away from big abortion and to federally qualified health centers,” referring to other types of clinics that provide primary care but often don’t specialize in reproductive health.\nIn response, McGill Johnson said the idea that other providers can “fill the gap” is unrealistic.\n“Planned Parenthood doesn’t get a blank check from the federal government,” she said. “Like other health care providers, Planned Parenthood affiliates are reimbursed for services provided to patients. If Trump and his allies get their way and ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood, thousands of patients who use Medicaid…would not be able to get services at Planned Parenthood health centers.”\nWhat happens next\nThe House passed the reconciliation bill Wednesday afternoon, in favor of a Republican majority. The legislation now moves to the Senate, where it could be approved with a simple majority under reconciliation rules. If the Senate makes changes, the bill would need to return to the House for final approval. If both chambers pass the same version, it would then go to the White House.\nRepublican leaders have said they hope to move the bill through the Senate by Memorial Day, with the goal of getting it to President Trump’s desk for a signature by July 4.\nDemocrats are expected to oppose the provision targeting Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, McGill Johnson said Planned Parenthood is preparing for a nationwide fight.\n“Nineteen million Planned Parenthood supporters in all 50 states are prepared to fight like hell to stop this egregious attack on their health care,” McGill Johnson said. “We’re not going anywhere.”\n[Editor’s Note: This article was updated to include local quotes from Planned Parenthood and additional details in length of the House committee hearing.]\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Governor Newsom launches statewide response to Trump rigging Texas’ elections\nWhat you need to know: Governor Newsom, alongside state and legislative leaders and advocates representing the Golden State, announced plans to introduce a legislative package next week for a state constitutional amendment to enable California voters the opportunity to fight back against Trump’s attempted power grab in Texas.\nLOS ANGELES — Alongside state leaders and advocates representing the Golden State and our values, Governor Gavin Newsom today officially announced the launch of a statewide effort that will enable Californians to fight back against President Trump’s attempts to rig Texas’ elections next year — gerrymandering democratically elected representatives out of office to immunize Trump from the unpopularity of his policies and keep Trump’s power unchecked by Congress.\n“California will not sit idle as Trump and his Republican lapdogs shred our country’s democracy before our very eyes. In just six months, Trump’s unchecked power has cost Americans billions and taken an ax to the greatest democracy we’ve ever known. This moment calls for urgency and action – that is what we are putting before voters this November, a chance to fight back against his anti-American ways.”\nGovernor Gavin Newsom\nAs part of today’s announcement, Governor Newsom unveiled the framework for the proposed constitutional amendment — which will be known as The Election Rigging Response Act — that would go before California voters this November. The key provisions are:\n- Retains California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission and declares state policy supporting the use of fair, nonpartisan redistricting commissions nationwide.\n- Temporarily adopts new California congressional districts for use in congressional elections through 2030.\nPreserves California’s current congressional maps if Texas or other states also keep their original maps.\nThe legislative package announced today will also include: 1) a bill calling a special election on November 4 for the voters to decide whether to adopt the corresponding proposed constitutional amendment and establish timelines and procedures for that election; and 2) a bill that established the new congressional map that could be triggered to take effect under the proposed constitutional amendment if other states engage in redistricting; and 3) a bill authorizing reimbursement of costs to administer the election.\nIn July and in August, Governor Newsom hosted Texas state leaders to discuss the special session currently underway in the Lone Star State, the real threats to democracy Governor Abbott is pursuing behind closed doors at the request of President Trump, and the need for real action to help survivors of the deadly storms earlier this summer — the original intent of the special session. However, President Trump has publicly and repeatedly pressured an uneasy state legislature to redraw their congressional map — mid cycle — to more favorably support Republicans. And, recent polling found 63% of likely Texas voters view its Trump-backed redistricting plan as unnecessary.\nEarlier this week, Governor Newsom offered President Trump an off-ramp, a chance to de-escalate. Rather than put this country and our founding values first, Trump chose personal power, and Californians will now be presented with the chance to nullify any gains he seeks from Texas, or any other state that tries to rig its congressional maps. In the coming week, Governor Newsom will work closely with state legislative leaders to ensure California voters have a voice in this fight to defend our nation’s democracy.\n“California Democrats will not allow Trump’s Republican Party to rig the system and take permanent control of the U.S. House of Representatives,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas. “We are prepared and we will fight fire with fire. We will do whatever it takes to defend our democracy. We will do whatever it takes to protect the voices, the votes, and the rights of every American.”\n“President Trump and Texas Republicans are responsible for all of this. This is not a fight California chose, but it’s a fight California can’t run from,” said Senate President pro Tempore Mike McGuire. “Trump chose to rewrite the rules and Texas Republican leaders are all too happy to do his dirty work. We’ve seen this playbook. When Trump doesn’t have the votes to win an election, he orders others to manufacture them. Trump’s cynical ploy is rotten to its core. It is our sacred responsibility to defend the people of California and our democracy from this madness, so if Texas moves forward, we will be forced to do the same.”\n“The damage the Trump administration is causing to our country is clear: masked agents terrorizing communities, tax dollars wasted on military stunts, allies alienated, and loyalists hired to replace public servants,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “This administration is out of control—and the Election Rigging Response Act is how California defends our democracy and fights back. I am proud to stand alongside Governor Newsom and California leaders in supporting this critical measure.”\n“Donald Trump is terrified of facing voters in the midterms after taking away their food and healthcare, and failing to bring down prices. In a fair fight, he knows he will lose his majority in Congress,” said Senator Adam Schiff. “That’s why he’s demanded that Republicans in Texas further gerrymander their lines in a state that is already badly gerrymandered. California will not stand idly by while Donald Trump tries to dictate the result of the next election in advance. If Texas moves forward with their new lines, California must respond. We will ask voters to fight fire with fire, and ensure they are not made irrelevant by the pernicious actions of Trump and Texas Republicans.”\n“Republicans know their agenda is unpopular, but rather than responding to the voices of the voters, Donald Trump and Republicans in states like Texas are engaging in a blatant power grab to rig the 2026 election before a single vote has been cast. I am proud to stand strongly to resist this power grab with our state legislative partners, the entire California Democratic Congressional Delegation and our Governor,” said California Democratic Congressional Delegation Chair Rep. Zoe Lofgren. “If Republicans continue along this path, they will be met with the full force of California. We are united in this because we know what is at stake. California cannot stand idly by and watch as Republicans and Donald Trump strip food programs from California schools, cut millions of Californians from their health insurance, do permanent damage to California’s clean air and clean water, make life more expensive for working Americans through their hairbrained tariff scheme, and defund Planned Parenthood. If Texas and other Republican states move forward with their efforts to redraw the maps mid-cycle, so will California. We are ready to fight back.\n“President Trump has said that Republicans are ‘entitled’ to five more congressional votes in Texas. Well, they aren’t entitled to steal the 2026 election. California’s unions refuse to stand by as democracy is tested,” said Lorena Gonzalez, President of the California Federation of Labor Unions, AFL-CIO. “California Labor is unified in our resolve to fight back against President Trump’s anti-worker agenda. We are 2.3 million union members strong and we will use our collective power to campaign for this redistricting effort and win.”\n“Over the past several months, we have seen the Trump administration freeze funds for critical education programs, cut healthcare for millions of our students and their families, attempt to dismantle the Department of Education, and pass a new voucher program designed to destroy public education entirely,” said California Teachers Association (CTA) President David B. Goldberg. “It is clear that we are also now facing an unprecedented power grab by Texas and other states to steal congressional seats and rig the 2026 election in favor of the current federal administration. This is a direct and urgent attack on our democracy. If this power grab goes unchecked, we will only see more drastic cuts to public education, healthcare, and other critical services and a further erosion of basic civil and human rights in our communities. California union educators will fight back against any and all attacks on our democracy and public education.”\n“Trump and his MAGA loyalists are trying to steal the next election and establish one-party rule, but California has a way to respond, and SEIU members stand ready to defend our rights,” said SEIU California President David Huerta. “We did not choose this path, but we’re not going to let Texas and Trump manipulate our Democracy. We will fight fire with fire. SEIU members and our communities have worked too hard to protect and strengthen our democracy to stand by while President Trump attempts to silence our voice – we are ready to move forward now and lead this fight for California and every American whose voices and votes are at stake.”\n“The reality is reproductive freedom and abortion access in California is on the line every election, every time. Just six weeks ago, the Trump administration and its backers in Congress ‘defunded’ Planned Parenthood — severely threatening sexual and reproductive health care access in our state,” said Jodi Hicks, CEO and President of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. “If Republicans continue to consolidate federal power, a nationwide abortion ban is not off the table. Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California is all in on supporting the state’s plan to counter Texas’ redistricting efforts and stop Republicans’ unprecedented power grab. As a reproductive freedom state that values democracy, we simply have no other choice.”\n“In the current mid-decade redistricting battle, we recognize that President Trump and Republican leaders are pursuing a calculated, asymmetric strategy to redraw districts mid-decade in states like Texas, to lock in unaccountable power and silence voters,” said Common Cause. “This is not an isolated political tactic; it is part of a broader march toward authoritarianism, dismantling people-powered democracy, and stripping away the people’s ability to have a political voice and say in how they are governed.”\n“I stand with Governor Newsom, Speaker Rivas, and legislative colleagues in supporting redistricting efforts and its importance in protecting our democracy. We didn’t ask for this fight and need to be prepared to fight back against President Trump’s power grab. This is more than lines on a map—it’s about defending our democracy and making sure every voice counts. This is our chance to stand up, raise our voices and defend the future of fair representation. The stakes couldn’t be higher: President Trump and Congressional Republicans are denying wildfire relief, targeting our diverse immigrant communities, and pulling millions off health care. We will stand up and defend the Voting Rights Act and protect historically marginalized communities,” said Assemblymember Mike Fong, Chair of the California Legislative AAPI Caucus.\n“California will not sit idly by while Republicans attempt to rig the electoral system to continue pushing the policies of an administration that has made life less affordable, worsened public health, weakened our educational system, and made it harder for our most vulnerable communities to get ahead,” said State Senator Akilah Weber Pierson, M.D., Chair of the California Legislative Black Caucus. “Instead of proving to voters that its policies are working, the Trump administration is trying to silence dissent by directing Texas to gerrymander the state and create five new Republican congressional districts. That is why California is responding to this attack on our democracy by giving voters the opportunity to weigh in, protect our democratic process, and preserve the will of the people.”\n“The Californian Latino Caucus has always fought to ensure a fair redistricting process that respects voter interests and promotes greater opportunities for greater Latino representation,” said Senator Lena Gonzalez. “We will continue to work hard to further these goals, uplift Latino voices regardless of immigration status, and fight to protect hard fought gains in every corner of California.”\n“As Vice Chair of the Latino Caucus, I believe that any redistricting effort must ensure our Latino communities are not just represented on paper, but truly empowered at the ballot box,” said Assemblymember Juan Carrillo, Vice Chair of the Latino Caucus. “With more than 22 million voters in California, these changes must re-engage our communities, strengthen our voice, and protect the progress we’ve fought for.”\nThis historic response by the Golden State comes as key leaders from across the country have voiced interest in fighting back as well.\n- AZ Senator Ruben Gallego: “It’s time for Democrats to understand the existential threat.”\n- MI Senator Elissa Slotkin: “I’m not going to … fight with one arm tied behind my back”\n- NY Governor Kathy Hochul: “All’s fair in love and war. We are following the rules. We do redistricting every 10 years, but if there are other states that are violating the rules and trying to give themselves an advantage, all I say is I’ll look at it closely with Hakeem Jeffries.”\n- IL Governor JB Pritzker: “We all ought to stand up against it”\n- NJ Governor Phil Murphy: “if that’s the way we’re going, we’re from Jersey, baby, and we won’t be laying down.”\nMD House Majority Leader: “I’m introducing legislation to redraw Maryland congressional districts if any other state cheats & draws new maps outside of the census period.”\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero.

Like all of us, people with disabilities are supported by their families and communities who should also be recognized for their hard work, selflessness, and dedication.” -Senator Sherrod Brown Fighting For Ohioans With Disabilities Sherrod has worked to strengthen and modernize the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and has opposed efforts to weaken or undermine this critical legislation. He has pushed to break down barriers to information and communications technologies for people with disabilities. He’s opposed legislation that would have made it easier for businesses to discriminate against people with disabilities. Sherrod voted to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2012, affirming his commitment to protecting the rights of all people with disabilities. Creating Opportunities For People With Disabilities Sherrod voted for the bipartisan Workforce Innovation And Opportunity Act, which created job training programs for Ohioans of all abilities. With Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sherrod sponsored legislation to help veterans with service-related disabilities find good jobs. Sherrod has fought to make sure that Ohioans with disabilities connected to their work, whether veterans wounded in service or miners with black lung, have access to the best possible care. Championing Healthcare Access For All Ohioans Throughout his career, Sherrod has worked to make sure every Ohioan, regardless of income, can get the healthcare they need. He helped pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has extended healthcare coverage for 5 million Ohioans with preexisting conditions and expanded access to community-based care and habilitative and rehabilitative services like occupational therapy and speech pathology. Sherrod also fought for nearly two decades to establish parity for mental health coverage, which he helped codify as part of the ACA. Sherrod supports ending limits on Medicaid coverage for mental health care and has joined Governor Kasich in fighting back attempts to gut the Medicaid expansion, which has helped nearly 500,000 Ohioans get mental and behavioral health treatment. Advocating For Children With Disabilities No one has fought harder than Sherrod to protect the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which serves nearly half of Ohio’s children with disabilities. Sherrod has worked for years to pass long-term funding for CHIP. In 2018 he co-sponsored the bill that successfully extended the program for the next six years. Sherrod has worked to give children with disabilities the support they need in the classroom by supporting the Individuals With Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act, which benefits one in seven Ohio students, and by securing and protecting millions of dollars in funding for staff and services to help students with disabilities. Making Social Security More Accessible Sherrod has worked with Republicans and Democrats to decrease the backlog and wait times for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). He joined Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) in calling for full funding for the Social Security Administration and teamed up with Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) to do away with the five-month waiting period for individuals with terminal illnesses to access SSDI benefits. Sherrod and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have worked together to expand Supplemental Security Income, which benefits nearly 300,000 Ohioans with disabilities. CARING FOR OUR VETERANS “We have no more important moral obligation than supporting the men and women who risk their lives in service to our country, and the family members who sacrifice so much to support their loved ones who serve.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Protecting Veterans’ Healthcare Sherrod is committed to making sure that those who have put their lives in harm’s way to defend our country have access to the best healthcare possible. He helped secure the largest-ever increase in VA funding and has held the VA accountable for the disability claims backlog, long wait times, understaffing, and inadequate care. Sherrod knows that comprehensive care for our veterans must include mental and behavioral care, and he helped pass the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act and the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act to expand treatment and support for those struggling with trauma and mental illness. Creating Opportunities For Veterans Sherrod is working to help servicemembers and veterans rejoin the civilian workforce, introducing and co-sponsoring the Wounded Warrior Employment Improvement Act, the VOW To Hire Heroes Act, and an expansion of the Yellow Ribbon Program to provide veterans with job training and placement services. Sherrod’s Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act would reward companies that hire veterans and servicemembers. Solar by Soldiers, which he helped launch, trains veterans to succeed in Ohio’s clean energy economy. Sherrod has secured millions of dollars for career services and related support programs for Ohio’s veterans, and passed legislation that gives hiring preference to Gold Star families. Investing In Veterans’ Education For many who enlist, the military offers a pathway to an education that may otherwise be out of reach. In the Senate, Sherrod co-sponsored a law that permanently expanded GI Bill education benefits for post-9/11 veterans. He has passed legislation that makes these benefits more flexible and accessible to the families of fallen soldiers. Sherrod has stood up for veterans targeted by shady for-profit colleges and worked to stop them from preying on those who have served in our military. As part of his bipartisan GI Bill expansion, Sherrod saw to it that the veterans and servicemembers who had been taken advantage of by failed for-profit schools had their education benefits restored. Working To End Homelessness For Veterans Sherrod has secured millions of dollars to end homelessness and expand access to affordable housing for Ohio veterans. Working with Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jack Reed (D-RI), Sherrod passed key provisions to ensure that no servicemember is discharged into homelessness. Sherrod also worked with Senator Reed to introduce the Military Consumer Enforcement Act, which would protect veterans and their families from foreclosure and eviction. Honoring Those Who Served Sherrod is making sure we recognize the courage and sacrifice of those who serve. He has joined the entire Ohio congressional delegation to introduce bipartisan legislation to allow the battlefield cross to be displayed at the graves of fallen soldiers and presented long-overdue military medals to Ohio veterans. Sherrod and Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) have honored the legacy of Ohio veterans by pushing to designate the Ohio Veterans Memorial and Museum in Columbus as the National Veterans Museum and Memorial. The Columbus Dispatch wrote that Sherrod was “responsible for legislation requiring the Department of Defense to deliver the remains of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan to airports convenient to their families, not just major hubs often hundreds of miles away.” COMBATING THE OPIOID CRISIS “Eleven Ohioans will die today of an opioid overdose, and Congress must be doing everything in our power to fight this epidemic on all fronts.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Working for a Comprehensive Response to the Opioid Crisis Sherrod knows that there’s no one solution to the opioid addiction epidemic. That’s why he is proposing a comprehensive public health campaign to combat the crisis. Sherrod is calling on the federal government to launch a long-term campaign that includes widespread education and prevention efforts, expanding access to affordable addiction treatment, and recovery that includes better screening and protections against relapse. Championing Efforts to Keep Opioids Out of Ohio Sherrod and Senator Portman are united in working to prevent opioids from getting into Ohio. Together, they pushed Sherrod’s INTERDICT Act through Congress and signed into law by President Trump, giving law enforcement the tools to intercept opioids and synthetics before they enter our country. Sherrod and Portman are now working on new legislation, the POWER Act, to give local law enforcement officers access to the same fentanyl detection equipment to help them keep these drugs out of Ohio communities. Sherrod has fought to lower the amount of prescription drugs that manufacturers and distributors pump into our healthcare system, and to make their these processes more open and transparent. He has advocated for programs that let people safely dispose of expired or unused prescription drugs to ensure they don’t end up in the hands of someone who could misuse or abuse them. Investing In and Expanding Treatment Any long-term solution to ending the opioid crisis must include providing people suffering from addiction and mental health issues with the tools to get their lives back on track. Sherrod supported Governor Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid, which funds treatment for more than 150,000 Ohioans, and worked with Portman on legislation to grant more Ohioans access to healthcare professionals and facilities. Sherrod knows that for infants and newborns affected by prenatal opioid addiction, treatment is especially critical, which is why he and Senator Portman have fought for measures to give affected newborns the best care available. Bringing Vital Resources to Ohio Communities Sherrod is working hard to make sure Ohio’s communities have the funding necessary to adequately address the opioid crisis. He supports a number of proposals, including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, that would give local communities the aid they need to effectively fight this epidemic. Sherrod was also a vocal opponent of the administration’s 2018 budget proposal, which called for slashing hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to programs Ohio counts on to combat opioid addiction. And when the White House dragged its feet in declaring the crisis a national emergency, Sherrod held the Administration accountable for their inaction — and applauded them when they finally heeded his call. Senator Brown Is Working To Engage Communities In Awareness And Prevention Sherrod believes that community engagement is crucial to this fight. By holding roundtable discussions with Ohio law enforcement, healthcare professionals, and those affected by the opioid crisis, Sherrod works with community leaders to help raise local awareness and understanding of the epidemic. He has also championed successful legislation that provides opioid prescribers with the training to identify warning signs before addiction occurs. FIGHTING FOR AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL COMMUNITIES “Our state’s farms are an important economic engine, and as we work together to move this economy forward, I will continue to fight for the needs of our farmers.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Advocating For Ohio Farmers Sherrod understands the importance of Ohio’s farming communities—one in seven Ohio jobs depend on agriculture and more than half of Ohio’s land is used for farming. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he’s played a critical role in crafting comprehensive, bipartisan Farm Bills. Sherrod travels across Ohio to hear directly from farmers and local stakeholders to effectively advocate for them in the Senate. He’s secured a number of legislative victories for Ohio farmers across multiple Farm Bills, including his approach to farm risk management, which Reuters called the “centerpiece” of the 2014 Farm Bill. Sherrod has held roundtables on rural development and farming across the state to ensure that Ohioans’ priorities are represented in the 2018 Farm Bill. Sherrod has been recognized by a host of leading rural policy and agricultural groups, including the National Farmers Union, which has honored his tireless advocacy with the prestigious “Golden Triangle” award. Spearheading Efforts For Ohio’s Rural Development Sherrod fights to expand access to broadband for Ohio’s rural communities, securing more than $2.5 billion for underserved areas so they can compete and thrive in the 21st century. Sherrod’s work has secured more than $150 million to advance critical rural development programs that support rural businesses, infrastructure projects, and communities in Ohio and across the country. Protecting Healthcare For Rural Ohioans Sherrod supports the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and has fought against repeal efforts that would hit rural communities hard. Ohioans living in rural communities have seen significantly expanded healthcare coverage under the ACA, and the already-shrinking pool of rural hospitals could suddenly become even smaller if repeal attempts succeed. Sherrod continues to fight to give Ohio’s rural communities every possible tool and resource to fight the devastating opioid epidemic. He opposes the administration’s efforts to gut critical opioid and substance abuse programs, and has pressed the White House to give communities the necessary resources to combat this crisis. He led the passage of the bipartisan INTERDICT Act to help border agents intercept opioids as they enter the country and supports better education for doctors on addiction prevention and identification. EXPANDING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE “Instead of repealing the Affordable Care Act, we should be working to improve and expand it so that every Ohioan has access to quality, affordable healthcare.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Supporting and Defending Expansion of Healthcare Coverage Millions of families across our state and country have benefited from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Instead of repeating partisan talking points, Sherrod focuses on protecting those who have benefited from the ACA, including more than four million Ohioans who no longer have to worry about hitting lifetime coverage caps, more than three million Ohioans with private healthcare plans that now include access to preventive services, and nearly two million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions. When Washington Republicans tried to gut the Medicaid expansion that allowed more than 700,000 Ohioans to access low-cost insurance coverage — including 150,000 who struggle with addiction — Sherrod stood with Republicans like Governor John Kasich to fight back. Sherrod has also teamed up with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to propose legislation to bring targeted healthcare tax credits to seniors and secure hard-earned coverage for retired miners who sacrificed their health and safety to support their families and power our nation. Taking on Rising Prescription Drug Prices Sherrod has always stood with consumers and patients in the fight for fair prescription drug prices. Whether it’s going after price-gouging drug companies or spearheading proposals that would allow Medicare to directly negotiate prescription drugs and increase competition in the pharmaceutical marketplace, Sherrod’s track record shows he’s not afraid to tangle with Big Pharma to make sure Ohioans can afford the prescription drugs they need. Fighting for Ohio’s Children Last year’s Republican-led attempt to allow the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to expire demonstrated how vital it is that Ohio’s children have an advocate like Sherrod in the U.S. Senate. In addition to his relentless fight for CHIP, Sherrod is a strong supporter of policies to fund training for pediatricians and pediatric specialists. He has worked across the aisle with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) on proposals to create and fully fund a national pediatric research network, standardize care across state borders, and combat sudden childhood deaths. Championing Affordable Healthcare for Seniors Sherrod has worked throughout his career to protect and expand Medicare, beating back attacks on this essential program and advocating to lower the eligibility age to 55. He has championed proposals to allow Medicare to directly negotiate prices and increase competition through generic alternatives and to establish free preventive cancer and osteoporosis screenings under Medicare. Reaching across the aisle, Sherrod has worked with Senator Portman to introduce legislation to extend a critical healthcare tax deduction for seniors. Combating Disease and Addiction Ohio’s opioid epidemic is putting a huge strain on our families and communities. That’s why Sherrod has teamed up with Senator Portman on legislation to increase access to healthcare professionals and facilities, direct research treatment options, and prevent addiction before it begins. Sherrod is also a consistent advocate for increasing awareness and education to combat diseases from widespread ones like breast cancer to rarer diseases like Zika virus, Ebola, tuberculosis, and sickle cell anemia. ENSURING QUALITY EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN “Every student deserves a community that supports their education. I’m troubled by the lack of oversight and transparency of many charter schools -- and will continue pushing for accountability. I will also keep up my efforts to bring critical resources to K-12 schools across Ohio, along with making higher education more accessible to every American.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Supporting Ohio Students Sherrod’s record is proof of his commitment to Ohio students. He’s consistently voted to protect and expand Head Start and Early Head Start programs, spearheaded efforts for extra funding and staffing for Full-Service Community Schools, and defended federal funding for Ohio schools. He believes they should be pathways to opportunity for all students. He introduced legislation to address inequality in our public schools, and is a strong supporter of the My Brother’s Keeper program, a program launched by President Obama to mentor young African-American men. Standing Shoulder To Shoulder With Ohio Educators Ohio educators know that Sherrod has their backs. When Senate Bill 5 threatened to take away educators’ collective bargaining rights, Sherrod stood with teachers, firefighters, police officers, and organized labor to successfully overturn Ohio’s so-called “right-to-work” law. Sherrod has worked with teachers to make sure they’re paid the salaries and benefits they deserve. When teaching jobs were on the line, Sherrod rose to the challenge, fighting for funding to save and create jobs. Holding Charter Schools Accountable Oversight, transparency, and accountability are Sherrod’s focus for charter schools. When Sherrod called for additional oversight of Ohio’s charter schools, the Department of Education listened and announced it would only fund high-performing charter schools. Sherrod has also championed legislation to go after fraud and waste in charter schools by increasing community involvement and oversight. Fighting For 21st-Century Schools The discussion over infrastructure often ignores the declining state of our schools. Sherrod has introduced legislation that would repair, renovate, and build schools in Ohio and across the country, which would create almost two million jobs. He’s also proposed and helped pass a number of other proposals to bring much-needed aid to school facilities while creating good-paying jobs. Working To End Bullying No student should feel unsafe or unwelcome in their school. Sherrod is working to end bullying in the classroom and on the schoolyard. He has repeatedly co-sponsored the Safe Schools Improvement Act, which would require schools to adopt codes of conduct that prohibit bullying based on race, gender, ability, or nationality. Sherrod recognizes that some students are more vulnerable to bullying and discrimination than others. He has participated in the National Day of Silence and joined the “It Gets Better Project” to raise awareness of the bullying experienced by far too many LGBTQ students. HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES SUCCEED “Small businesses and manufacturers are the backbone of Ohio’s economy.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Fighting for Lower Taxes on Small Businesses Sherrod knows that for small business owners, expanding and investing in employees is non-negotiable. He also knows that it can be difficult to cover costs while keeping pace with bigger competitors, which is why he has voted for over $1.3 billion in tax breaks for small businesses. Sherrod has supported legislation that allows small businesses to stay competitive by writing off R&D costs and investments in business equipment and software. He was a vocal advocate for the Small Business Jobs Act, which the Akron Beacon Journal called “a most worthy response to the recovering yet still fragile economy.” Sherrod recognizes that small businesses don’t have the time or resources to spend making sense of byzantine paperwork. He co-sponsored the Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination Act of 2011, which would have cut red tape by updating tax reporting requirements for small businesses. Leveling the Playing Field for Small Businesses Since joining Congress, Sherrod has stood up for Ohio’s small businesses by opposing unfair trade deals that allow corporations to send jobs overseas, hollowing out communities and leaving small businesses struggling to compete. Sherrod voted against NAFTA in 1993 and is playing an active role in the Trump administration’s renegotiation of the agreement to deliver a better deal for Ohio. He stood up to members of his own party in opposing Trade Promotion Authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and led Democrats away from trade deals that hurt workers and small businesses. He has also opposed trade agreements with Central America, Colombia, China, and South Korea. Sherrod has helped Ohio businesses enter the global marketplace by leading the reauthorization and expansion of the Export-Import Bank, which benefited 226 small businesses in Ohio between 2007 and 2015. He has been a vocal opponent of currency manipulation by foreign countries, which undercuts international trade law and puts American businesses at a disadvantage. Sherrod and Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) wrote a letter to the Department of Labor asking Secretary Wilbur Ross to investigate and crack down on countries caught engaging in unfair practices. Helping Small Businesses Innovate Sherrod has worked with members of both parties to expand financing opportunities for small and mid-sized manufacturers, and to reward small businesses that hire more employees and invest in job training and retraining. His bipartisan SECTORS Act worked to match employees skills to existing jobs by requiring that job training programs be designed with input from partnering companies. Sherrod has worked to create business incubators and innovation hubs around the country to ensure that the America remains a leader in high-tech manufacturing. He worked with Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) to pass bipartisan legislation to create manufacturing innovation hubs across the country, the first of which was established in Ohio in 2015. Since 2013, Sherrod has secured more than $17 million in federal grants and loans to support job creation and training in Ohio. FIGHTING FOR SENIORS “We have made promises to our seniors that we must honor – Medicare, Social Security, affordable prescription drugs. These men and women have worked their entire lives, taken care of their families, and they deserve a quality of life that reflects that.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Protecting Social Security Time and time again, Social Security has been attacked by Republicans who have tried to raise the retirement age and privatize the program. These misguided efforts would enrich Wall Street by risking Americans’ savings in the stock market. Sherrod’s position on these attacks is simple: no way. He has consistently voted and spoken out against any attempt to undermine Social Security benefits and deny Americans their hard-earned benefits. Championing Affordable Healthcare Sherrod believes seniors should have access to quality, affordable healthcare. He has worked throughout his career to protect and expand Medicare, helping beat back multiple assaults on this essential program and advocating to lower the eligibility age to 55. With the cost of prescription drugs on the rise, Sherrod has championed proposals to allow Medicare to directly negotiate prices and increase competition through generic alternatives. He is also fighting to pass legislation that would establish free preventive cancer and osteoporosis screenings under Medicare. Reaching across the aisle, Sherrod has worked with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to introduce legislation to extend a critical healthcare tax deduction for seniors. Keeping Promises, Fighting For Retirement Security During the tax debate, Sherrod promised “a hell of a fight” if Republicans moved forward with their plans to penalize workers with certain retirement savings accounts. Republicans relented, and Sherrod protected millions of Americans from new taxes on the money they put away for retirement. Sherrod has also introduced a bold plan to stabilize pension funds, whose beneficiaries, through no fault of their own, often face a gap between what they were promised and what they actually receive in retirement. Sherrod will not allow mismanagement by corporate executives and Wall Street fund managers to upend workers’ retirement plans, and he’s committed to making sure promises made are kept. Sherrod was named the co-chair of a bipartisan committee in Congress tasked with developing bipartisan solutions to the pension crisis. Supporting Strong Consumer Protections For Seniors Sherrod knows scammers and criminals specifically target seniors. That’s why he strongly supported the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) fight against all shady and illegal financial practices. No one is more dedicated to protecting seniors from financial predators than Senator Sherrod Brown. LOVE AND RESPECT FOR ALL OHIOANS “It has been my honor to stand alongside you, fighting to make sure that every Ohioan is treated equally under the law and given the respect they deserve. I will never compromise on these principles and I will continue to work to drive your movement forward.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Fought For Marriage Equality Long before it was a politically popular position, Sherrod stood with LGBTQ families and couples to fight for full recognition under the law. He opposed the Defense Of Marriage Act in the 1990s and has consistently fought against legislative efforts to deny LGBTQ Americans the right to marry whomever they love. When the day finally came in 2015, Sherrod rejoiced with millions of Americans as the Supreme Court recognized the rights of LGBTQ couples and families across the nation. Standing With LGBTQ Servicemembers Any American who honorably serves our country in uniform should be treated like a patriot. Since the beginning of his career, Sherrod opposed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which he helped repeal in 2010. Sherrod has co-sponsored legislation to correct military records and reinstate benefits of servicemembers discharged on the basis on their sexual orientation. When President Trump pushed to ban transgender individuals from the armed services, Sherrod responded forcefully, saying, “I have deep respect and gratitude for anyone who volunteers to serve in our military. We should not turn away anyone who is willing and able to serve this country and help keep America safe.” Combating Anti-LGBTQ Discrimination While we have made progress toward equality, it is legal in many states to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Sherrod has led the charge to pass legislation that would expand federal civil rights protections and backed other bills to fight LGBTQ discrimination in housing, the workplace, and around the world. Advocating For LGBTQ Youth Sherrod has fought to protect LGBTQ youth because he knows they are especially vulnerable to harassment and discrimination. Not only has he called “conversion therapy” a “fraudulent, unfair, and deceptive” practice, he’s repeatedly moved to outlaw it. Sherrod has worked to raise awareness of and bring an end to the all-too-common bullying and discrimination that LGBTQ youth face. In 2014, he participated in the National Day of Silence. In 2010 Sherrod joined the “It Gets Better Project” by giving a speech on the Senate floor in memory of LGBTQ teens driven to suicide by bullying, and in 2011 he participated in a video with his colleagues in support of LGBTQ students and youth. Building a more free and equal society begins with helping those who will inherit it, which is why Sherrod has so vigorously advocated for LGBTQ youth. Reliably Partnering With LGBTQ Organizations And Leaders Regularly meeting with Ohio and national LGBTQ groups allows Sherrod to listen, learn, and discuss important issues, which makes him a more effective advocate for the LGBTQ community in the U.S. Senate. His reelection has been endorsed by Human Rights Campaign. MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE “Student loan debt shouldn’t hold students back for decades after they’ve graduated.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Standing with Ohio Students An entire generation is drowning in student debt, and Sherrod is committed to getting them relief. He has championed efforts to protect students from predatory student loan providers, called for stronger protections against unfair and abusive lending practices, and backed legislation to allow students and their families to refinance their existing student loan debt. Sherrod is also working to make college more affordable for Ohio families, fighting to expand student loan programs and pushing for tax reforms that would make it easier for middle-class families to afford higher education. Making college more accessible to veterans and servicemembers is also a top priority for Sherrod. He has worked tirelessly to pass legislation that ensures our men and women in uniform, and their families, have the resources to go to college. Supporting Ohio Colleges and Universities Sherrod is proud of Ohio’s higher education system. He consistently works to ensure that our colleges and universities have the resources necessary to continue offering field-leading educational opportunities. Every Ohioan deserves the opportunity to study at a world-class in-state institution. Sherrod has also worked to ensure recognition and resources for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Standing With Ohio Communities With Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos making it harder for Ohioans to get a college education, Sherrod is standing with students, educators, and families to fight for accessible, quality higher education. He regularly hosts educator forums and student leadership summits across the state so he can best advocate for those communities and hold the DeVos administration accountable for its anti-student actions. Fighting Predatory For-Profit Colleges Sherrod reached across the aisle to build a bipartisan plan that boosted GI benefits and provided relief to veterans who were taken advantage of by failed for-profit institutions. Sherrod has also worked towards ending deceitful marketing practices used by for-profit colleges — including some shamefully aimed at veterans — by holding high-paid executives accountable for their tactics. Sherrod has been at the forefront of efforts to identify and investigate sham for-profit colleges and recoup losses for students. He is a vocal critic of forced arbitration clauses that make it nearly impossible for students at for-profit colleges to recover their tuition dollars if they’re defrauded or the institution fails. PRESERVING OUR ENVIRONMENT “From protecting the Great Lakes from invasive species and toxic algal blooms to promoting a clean energy future, defending clean water and clean air is more important than ever.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Senator Brown Is A Fierce Defender Of Ohio’s Lakes And Waterways Sherrod is a leader in defending Ohio’s lakes and waterways. Partnering with senators throughout the region, he’s championed the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to clean up and revitalize these vital water resources, and he joined Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) in a show of bipartisanship to vocally oppose the administration’s efforts to drastically reduce support for the project. Sherrod knows the devastating effect algal blooms have on lakeshore communities. He has fought for more funding and pushed for more research to better understand their causes and consequences, to help develop new solutions. Partnering with Senator Portman, Sherrod has spearheaded legislation to coordinate federal, state, and local responses to combat Asian carp and other invasive species. The two have worked side by side across party lines to apply consistent pressure to ensure that the Army Corps of Engineers keeps the Cleveland Harbor and shipping channel clean. Senator Brown Supports Clean Energy Innovation And Job Creation Ohio has an opportunity to be at the forefront of our growing clean energy economy — that’s why Sherrod supports investing in a clean energy industry that will create good jobs for Ohioans. He’s fought for policies to give manufacturers the tools they need to not only adapt to a changing marketplace, but to shape it and lead it. In turn, strengthening this job-creating field will decrease our dependence on foreign oil and augment our national security. Sherrod believes innovation across a diverse mix of energy sources is the best path toward a clean-energy economy. He’s supported policies to encourage investment in offshore wind energy, reached across the aisle to promote ethanol and biodiesel fuel, and championed carbon capture technology. Senator Brown Fights For Environmental Protections The health of our environment has a direct impact on the health of Ohioans. Sherrod has worked to protect our drinking water and is a strong proponent of increasing funding to prevent, monitor, and eliminate lead poisoning. He has also worked with Senator Portman to protect our water from microcystin, the byproduct of the algal blooms that created the 2014 water crisis in the Toledo area. Furthermore, Sherrod has spoken out against dangerous cuts to the federal budget that would make it nearly impossible to enforce clean air and water laws. Senator Brown Has Strong Support From Environmental Groups Sherrod’s record of stewardship and commitment to the environment has earned him a 93% lifetime score from the League Of Conservation Voters. His reelection has been endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. PROTECTING THOSE WHO PROTECT US “At a time when it may seem like not much is getting done in Washington, supporting the officers who put their lives on the line each day to protect us—and the families who sacrifice alongside them—is something we can come together on in a bipartisan way.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Fighting To Keep Ohio Safe Sherrod is committed to addressing the public health and safety crisis that opioids pose to communities across Ohio. His bipartisan INTERDICT Act, which was signed into law by President Trump, gives law enforcement the tools to intercept opioids and block them from entering our country. Sherrod is also working with Senator Portman on new legislation, the POWER Act, to give local law enforcement officers access to the same fentanyl detection equipment made available through Brown’s INTERDICT Act. This will not only help officers keep these drugs out of Ohio communities, it will also protect them from accidental overdoses on the job. Sherrod regularly meets with law enforcement, healthcare professionals, and community leaders at roundtable events to help local stakeholders build coalitions and find solutions. He fights for victims of human trafficking, and supports the efforts of local, state, and federal law enforcement to root out this scourge. Inspired by retired Toledo FBI agents, Sherrod spearheaded the passage of additional funding for victims of human trafficking, with a special focus on help for high-risk runaway youth. Supporting Those In The Line of Duty And Their Families Sherrod is a loyal ally to law enforcement personnel and their families. When Ohio Senate Bill 5 threatened to strip public safety officers of their collective bargaining rights, Sherrod stood shoulder to shoulder with them and fought back. He knew the fight wasn’t just about wages and benefits—it was about the safety of first responders and their communities. Sherrod also worked to ensure that first responders and their families receive their full Social Security benefits. Sherrod helped pass “Blue Alert” legislation to help apprehend criminals who committed crimes against on-duty law enforcement officers. He’s also backed measures to help the families of fallen or disabled officers, including providing vital mental health and wellness services for members of law enforcement. Sherrod has supported numerous efforts to hire and train more officers, including the COPS hiring program that has allowed Ohio law enforcement to expand their force. Sherrod also worked to ensure that officers have access to the tools and equipment they need, including bulletproof vests, body cameras, new vehicles, and other innovative technologies. SAFEGUARDING CONSUMERS “The last thing Ohioans need is for politicians to turn back the clock to the days when Wall Street was free to prey on working families, wreck the economy, and hand taxpayers the bill.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Holding Wall Street Accountable Sherrod played an active role in enacting the Dodd-Frank regulations, standing with students, homeowners, and taxpayers, who demanded a safer financial system after Wall Street caused the Great Recession. He opposes efforts to rollback key parts of the law and has called out the the big banks for their attempts to take us back to the days when Ohioans were on the hook for Wall Street’s reckless bets. Sherrod knows the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a critical consumer watchdog, and he stood with the agency against the Trump Administration’s efforts to compromise its independence. Sherrod believes the CFPB Director must be a relentless fighter for consumers, not an instrument of Wall Street and payday lenders. He’s also a staunch opponent of financial corporations that use forced arbitration clauses to avoid accountability. These provisions prevent victims their access to court when they’re taken advantage of. Sherrod has spearheaded efforts to give these victims the chance to recover damages and seek the justice that they deserve. Fighting Identity Theft Sherrod fought for the more than 145 million Americans who were affected by the Equifax security breach. He demanded answers for the victims and worked to hold the company accountable for its negligence. After Sherrod called for a closer look at the company’s taxpayer-funded government contracts, the IRS announced it would halt its business with Equifax. Standing Up to Predatory Lenders Sherrod has been a tireless advocate for consumers who are targeted and trapped by predatory payday lenders. Payday lenders’ abusive behavior furthers a cycle that prevents consumers from escaping high-interest loans, hurting those who need help the most. Sherrod has worked to provide fair and effective alternatives to the Ohioans who find themselves forced to turn to payday loans to pay for basic necessities like food and housing. Protecting Consumers from Dangerous Products Sherrod has a long record of making sure products are safe for consumers. His legislation to apply poison packaging protections to liquid nicotine containers has helped protect children from accidental poisonings. Sherrod has also worked to bring safety warnings to everyday consumer products, including crib bumpers, caffeine, sunblock, and electronic cigarettes. STANDING UP FOR AMERICAN WORKERS “We want more trade—Ohio businesses, including our auto supply chain, rely on trade with our neighbors. But trade should happen on a truly level playing field, and that’s not what we have right now.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Opposing Unfair Trade Agreements For years, Sherrod has spoken out and voted against trade agreements that hollow out American manufacturing communities and put Ohio workers at a disadvantage. He voted against NAFTA and against trade agreements with Central America, Colombia, China, and South Korea. Sherrod stood up to members of his own party in opposing Trade Promotion Authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and led Democrats in moving away from these harmful deals. He continues to lead bipartisan efforts to secure a better deal for workers, working with the Trump administration on renegotiating of NAFTA. Sherrod is committed to making sure that those who have seen their livelihoods affected by unfair trade deals don’t get left behind. He has led senators from both parties in calling for full funding for Trade Adjustment Assistance and introduced legislation to expand this critical training and assistance program to service sector employees and workers who lose their jobs to countries like China. Leveling The Playing Field Sherrod understands that Ohio workers and manufacturers need an advocate to protect their role in the global marketplace. He has worked with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to call for greater scrutiny of and consequences for countries that engage in steel dumping and currency manipulation. He supports setting steel and aluminum tariffs to ensure that American manufacturers who play by the rules will not be undercut by cheap imports from countries like China. He played a critical role in the Trump Administration’s decision in 2017 to set tariffs that will allow Ohio manufacturers like Whirlpool to hire hundreds more workers. Sherrod has also worked to help American companies compete overseas. He led the reauthorization and expansion of the Export-Import Bank, which benefited 226 small businesses in Ohio between 2007 and 2015. Sherrod has also teamed up with Senator Portman to crack down on Chinese currency manipulation. Sherrod has asked Presidents of both parties to work with him to hold China accountable for currency manipulation, and has introduced legislation to treat currency manipulation as an unfair subsidy, which would give Ohio manufacturers and their workers new tools to fight back against Chinese cheating. Supporting Ohio Manufacturing Sherrod knows that our competitiveness depends on maintaining our leadership in innovative, high-quality manufacturing. In 2008, Sherrod fought to save the American auto industry, protecting the livelihood of more than 625,000 Ohioans. Since then, he has worked to help American manufacturers expand and innovate. Sherrod has secured millions of dollars in investment to create jobs and train workers in Ohio’s manufacturing communities. He has helped create a national network of innovation hubs and business incubators to support Ohio’s growing high-tech manufacturing field and fought to make sure that the jobs created by these innovation zones go to people in the surrounding communities. As part of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, Sherrod worked with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) to ensure that employers play an active role in workforce development programs, giving workers the skills they need to thrive in the 21st-century economy. STRENGTHENING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY “We must continue to vigorously enforce and strengthen sanctions against Russia, to send a message to its leaders and the world that the United States of America will not tolerate efforts to undermine democracy around the world.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Securing Critical National Defense Resources Sherrod advocates for Ohio’s defense industry, which creates thousands of jobs in the state and provides important equipment to our military. He’s authored and secured numerous federal funding provisions for Ohio that bolster America’s security arsenal, including billions of dollars to Lima’s Joint Systems Manufacturing Center for Abrams Tank and Stryker Vehicle manufacturing, and millions for C-130 upgrades at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station. Sherrod also champions Ohio’s military installations, and brought sustained investment in jobs and research at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and major facility improvements to the 180th Fighter Wing in Toledo to execute its Aerospace Control Alert mission. Standing Tall Against Threats to America’s Security Sherrod holds international bad actors accountable for their actions. As the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, he helped broker the bipartisan comprehensive sanctions package designed to combat Russian, Iranian, and North Korean aggression. Sherrod has repeatedly called for maintaining significant sanctions on Russia for their invasion of Ukraine, and has advocated for expanding Ukraine’s cybersecurity capacities. He’s consistently supported sanctions to pressure Iran into dissolving their nuclear weapons program, and voted in 2016 to extend Iranian sanctions for an additional 10 years. Sherrod refuses to allow the North Korean regime to escape punishment for its unconscionable crimes and human rights violations. He introduced legislation to strengthen and expand sanctions, and championed efforts to redesignate the regime a “state sponsor of terrorism” following the death of Otto Warmbier. Sherrod knows how important our international alliances are to global security and stability. That’s why he worked with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to pass a bipartisan affirmation of America’s commitment to NATO’s mission of collective defense. Working to Defeat Foreign and Domestic Terrorism Sherrod supports efforts to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism, including ensuring that law enforcement, national security, and other public safety agencies across Ohio have the resources they need to address these threats. He also worked closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to combat domestic terrorism in the wake of the attack in Charlottesville. Sherrod uses his leadership position on the Senate Banking Committee to work to defeat ISIS through financial sanctions, and supports efforts to combat homegrown recruitment and radicalization. Supporting Key Allies Like Israel Senator Sherrod Brown has an unassailable record of support for Israel — a nation he calls “our most important ally in the Middle East.” Since being elected to Congress, Sherrod has repeatedly supported aid to Israel and favored an aggressive stance towards terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and regional threats like Iran. For as long as he’s a U.S. Senator, Sherrod Brown will remain a stalwart ally of Israel. SUPPORTING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY “We have to defend the affirmation that black lives matter. In doing so, we acknowledge the disparity between African-American men and women and their white counterparts and the racism that deepens those discrepancies.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Fighting for Economic Justice Sherrod believes hard work needs to pay off for every American. No one should be denied a fair shot because of their race or their gender. Today, too many are. Sherrod is fighting to close the wage gap that puts African-American women and men at a disadvantage. He is pushing to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, protect unions’ ability to organize and bargain, and end abusive practices like tip pooling, which allows employers to keep hard-earned dollars from their employees. Sherrod defends the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, because he knows we cannot close the wealth gap in our country without cracking down on payday lenders and banks that prey on the vulnerable. Standing Up For Civil Rights Sherrod is working to expand and protect the right to vote, and to break down barriers to exercising this fundamental right. As Secretary of State, he expanded access to voter registration materials and in Congress, he helped pass the National Voter Registration Act. In the Senate, Sherrod fights back against discriminatory efforts to disenfranchise millions of Americans. He co-sponsored legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act and opposes the “Voter ID” laws that make it harder for people of color, as well as seniors, students, and low-income people to vote. Sherrod works to strengthen the civil rights of formerly incarcerated Americans by restoring the voting rights of those who have served their time and helping them find their way when they re-enter society. In 2015 and 2017, Sherrod introduced the Fair Chance Act to “ban the box” on federal government job applications. He co-sponsored the Second Chance Reauthorization Act, which invests in affordable housing and job training for the formerly incarcerated. Committed to Environmental Justice Building a more just country means ensuring every American has access to a safe and healthy environment. As part of his work to prevent disasters like the ones in Flint and Sebring, Sherrod introduced a law to invest in safe new water infrastructure and to require public officials to inform their communities if they find evidence of lead contamination. Championing Education No child should start out behind because of the school they attend. Sherrod is working to invest in our children’s future by expanding Head Start and updating our aging school buildings, creating safe, inclusive spaces for all students. He consistently calls for oversight for the charter schools that too often try to profit at the expense of our kids’ education. Fighting for Representation Sherrod knows that our institutions should look like the communities they serve. He helped confirm Judge Benita Y. Pearson, the first African-American woman ever to serve as a federal judge in Ohio. He and Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) investigated the lack of diversity in the private sector and led Congress to propose fairer hiring practices. Sherrod works to make sure his team reflects the diversity of our country and our state — more than a quarter of his office staff identify as people of color and over 20 percent of his campaign team are African-American. Sherrod supports President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative because it connects young men of color to teachers and mentors who look like them and share their experience, which makes a difference as they grow and learn. He has helped preserve historic sites, from a stop on the Underground Railroad to the homes of civil rights leaders, that make sure that Ohio’s struggle for justice is written into our national history. WOMEN’S RIGHTS “We have made great strides toward a more level playing field for Ohio women. I am proud to have helped pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and been an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. But we still have work to do.” -Senator Sherrod Brown WHERE SHERROD STANDS: Senator Brown Protects Women’s Healthcare Sherrod believes a woman’s reproductive health decisions are between her and her doctor, and he’s repeatedly opposed efforts to take away that freedom. He has also worked to maintain and expand access to affordable birth control and family planning services, including championing efforts to defeat Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood. Sherrod stands against the “global gag rule,” and has worked to both repeal the rule permanently and to protect federal funding for NGOs that provide family planning services. Senator Brown Works To Address Threats To Women’s Safety Sherrod is a strong supporter of the Violence Against Women Act, voting for its original passage and numerous reauthorizations. He’s also spearheaded legislation to tackle the scourge of human trafficking and get justice for the survivors of these heinous crimes. Sherrod has advocated for initiatives to address sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape. He backed proposals to hold powerful industries, as well as Congress, the military, and federal contractors accountable for their roles in these crimes. Senator Brown Supports Women In The Workplace Sherrod is committed to closing the gender pay gap and ending gender-based pay discrimination, which costs Ohio women nearly $30 billion every year. He’s co-sponsored all nine attempts to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and proudly helped pass the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Act, which allows victims of pay discrimination to sue after discovering they have been paid less than men for equal work. Sherrod has also voted for workers to have more paid family, medical, and sick leave benefits to help support women’s economic equality and prosperity. Senator Brown Defends Access To Comprehensive And Affordable Healthcare Sherrod has been a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act, and has resisted efforts to repeal the law and roll back protections that have benefited millions of Ohio women. He’s also a steadfast advocate for breast cancer education and research, and is committed to helping end breast cancer by 2020. Senator Brown Has Strong Support From Women' Sherrod consistently earns the support of leading women’s groups around the country. He holds a 100% voting record from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America since joining the Senate.

{"custom_id": "1_extracted-11639.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen (refugees) for religion.\n        Subject(s): foreign-policy,religion,terrorism\n        Speaker: jeb-bush\n        Speaker's Job Title: \n        State Info: Florida\n        Party Affiliation: republican\n        Barely-True: 17\n        False: 5\n        Half-True: 17\n        Mostly-True: 24\n        Pants-Fire: 2\n        Context: an interview on \"Face the Nation\"\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Refugees\nUnder United States law, a refugee is someone who:\n- Is located outside of the United States\n- Is of special humanitarian concern to the United States\n- Demonstrates that they were persecuted or fear persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group\n- Is not firmly resettled in another country\n- Is admissible to the United States\nA refugee does not include anyone who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\nFor the legal definition of refugee, see section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\nThe Refugee Process\nYou must receive a referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for consideration as a refugee. For more information on the referral criteria, see the USRAP Consultations and Worldwide Processing Priorities page.\nIf you receive a referral, you will receive help filling out your application and then be interviewed abroad by a USCIS officer who will determine whether you are eligible for refugee resettlement. For more information about eligibility, see our Refugee Eligibility Determination page.\nYour case may include your spouse, child (unmarried and under 21 years of age), and in some limited circumstances, other family members. You may include a same-sex spouse in your application provided that you and your spouse are legally married. As a general matter, USCIS looks to the law of the place where the marriage took place when determining whether it is valid for immigration law purposes. Same-sex partners who are not married but who are qualified to access the U.S. Refugee Admissions under one of the three designated worldwide processing priorities may have their cases cross-referenced so that they can be interviewed at the same time and, if approved by USCIS, resettled in the same geographic area in the United States.\nThere is no fee to apply for refugee status. The information you provide will not be shared with your home country.\nFor more information about USRAP and the referral process, see our USRAP Consultations and Worldwide Processing Priorities page.\nComing to the United States\nIf you are approved as a refugee, you will receive a medical exam, a cultural orientation, help with your travel plans, and a loan for your travel to the United States. After you arrive, you will be eligible for medical and cash assistance. For more information on benefits available to refugees, please see the Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement page.\nBringing Your Family to the United States\nIf you are a refugee in the United States and want your family members who are abroad to join you, you may file Form I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, for your spouse and unmarried children under 21. You must file within two years of your arrival to the United States unless there are humanitarian reasons to excuse this deadline. For more information about bringing your family to the United States, see our Family of Refugees and Asylees page.\nYou may also be eligible to file an Affidavit of Relationship for your spouse, child (unmarried, under 21), or parents. The Affidavit of Relationship is the form used to reunite refugees and asylees with close relatives who are determined to be refugees but are outside the United States. The Affidavit of Relationship records information about family relationships and must be completed in order to begin the application process for relatives who may be eligible to enter the United States as refugees through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. For information on the current nationalities eligible to file, see U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees & Migration.\nWorking in the United States\nAs a refugee, you may legally work as soon as you arrive in the United States. When you are admitted to the United States, you will receive a Form I-94 containing a refugee admission stamp. We will also create a digital Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, for you if you have an approved Form I-590. After you are admitted to the United States, we will adjudicate your Form I-765. We will generally produce your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) within approximately 2 weeks after we approve your application. We will mail your EAD via U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail to your address of record.\nThe time frame for you to receive your EAD card may vary, depending on delivery times. While you wait for your EAD, you can present your Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, to your employer as proof you can legally work in the United States. If you were admitted to the United States as a following-to-join refugee beneficiary of an approved Form I-730, we will process your paper Form I-765 after we receive it.\nIf you do not receive your EAD card within 90 days of your admission into the United States as a refugee based on approved Form I-590, you may call the USCIS Contact Center. When you call, indicate that you are calling about an auto EAD. You may also contact us by clicking on “Connect to Live Agent” in the Chat with Emma feature on our website. When you contact about your EAD, you must have your A-Number and Form I-765 receipt number available. You can find your Form I-765 receipt number on the Form I-765 receipt notice we mailed to your address of record.\nFiling for a Permanent Residency (Green Card)\nIf you are admitted as a refugee, you must apply for a Green Card one year after coming to the United States. To apply for permanent residency, file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or to Adjust Status. There is no fee for refugees to file the Form I-485. In addition, refugees do not have to pay for fingerprinting/biometrics fees.\nFor more information on obtaining a Green Card, see our Green Card for Refugees page.\nTraveling Abroad\nIf you have refugee status and want to travel outside the United States, you will need to obtain a Refugee Travel Document in order to return to the United States. If you do not obtain a Refugee Travel Document in advance of departure, you may be unable to re-enter the United States. If you return to the country from which you fled, you will have to explain how you were able to return safely.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Special Immigrant Religious Workers\nMinisters and non-ministers in religious vocations and occupations may immigrate to or adjust status in the U.S. for the purpose of performing religious work in a full-time compensated position.\nSunset Date for Non-Minister Religious Workers Program\nOn Nov. 12, 2025, the president signed into law H.R. 5371, extending the EB-4 non-minister special immigrant religious worker program through Jan. 30, 2026. The law allows these workers to immigrate or adjust to permanent resident by that date, also known as the sunset date. Non-minister special immigrant religious workers include those within a religious vocation or occupation engaged in either a professional or non-professional capacity. This date on which the program will end also applies to accompanying spouses and children of these non-minister special immigrant religious workers.\nSpecial immigrants entering the U.S. solely to carry on the vocation of a minister, and their accompanying spouses and children, are not affected by the sunset date.\nReligious Worker Expedite Requests\nThe decision to accommodate an expedite request is at USCIS’ sole discretion. We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis. To increase efficiency in the review and processing of expedite requests, we are not required to provide justification regarding decisions on expedite requests.\nA nonprofit organization whose request furthers the cultural or social interests of the United States may request expedited processing. For petitioners who are selected for a pre-adjudication compliance review site visit, USCIS cannot process the petitioner's request for expedited processing of Form I-360 Special Immigration Religious Worker petition until a successful compliance review is completed.\nThe request must demonstrate the urgent need to expedite the case based on the beneficiary’s specific role within the nonprofit in furthering cultural or social interests (as opposed to the organization’s role in furthering cultural or social interests). Examples may include a medical professional urgently needed for medical research related to a specific “social” U.S. interest (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other socially impactful research or project). As another example, a religious organization may urgently need a beneficiary’s specific services and skill set to continue a vital social outreach program. In such instances, the religious organization must explain why the beneficiary is specifically needed, as opposed to pointing to a general shortage.\nGeneral Eligibility and Filing Process\nA special immigrant religious worker is a alien who is coming to the United States to work full time (an average of at least 35 hours per week) in a compensated position as a minister or in a religious vocation or occupation and be employed by a:\n- Non-profit religious organization in the United States;\n- Religious organization that is authorized by a group tax exemption holder to use its group tax exemption; or\n- Non-profit organization which is affiliated with a religious denomination in the United States.\nTo qualify, you must have been a member of a religious denomination having a bona fide non-profit religious organization in the United States for at least two years immediately before filing the petition. In addition, you must have been working in one of the positions described above after the age of 14, either abroad or in the United States, continuously for at least two years immediately before the filing of a petition with USCIS. The prior religious work does not need to correspond precisely to the type of work you will perform. A break in the continuity of the work during the preceding two years will not affect eligibility so long as:\n- You were still employed as a religious worker;\n- The break did not exceed two years; and\n- The nature of the break was for further religious training or sabbatical. However, you must have been a member of the petitioner’s denomination throughout the two years of qualifying employment.\nA U.S. employer, or you on your own behalf, must file Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, to request special immigrant religious worker classification. Both you and the employing non-profit religious organization must satisfy the requirements listed below. If a petitioner believes that one of these requirements substantially burdens the organization’s exercise of religion, the petitioner may seek an exemption under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). A written request for the exemption should accompany the initial filing, and it must explain how the provision:\n- Requires participation in an activity prohibited by a sincerely held religious belief; or\n- Prevents participation in conduct motivated by a sincerely held religious belief.\nThe petitioner bears the burden of showing that they qualify for a RFRA exemption and must support the request with relevant documentation. We decide exemption requests on a case-by-case basis.\nThe below table provides an overview of the evidentiary requirements for this classification. For further information about eligibility requirements and USCIS policy related to the special immigrant religious worker classification, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Immigrants, Part H, Designated and Special Immigrants, Chapter 2, Religious Workers.\n| Supporting Documents Required for the Religious Organization | Supporting Documents Required for the Religious Worker and Position |\n|---|---|\nProof of Tax-Exempt Status If the religious organization has its own individual IRS 501(c)(3) letter, the petitioner must provide a currently valid determination letter* from the IRS showing that the organization is tax-exempt. If the organization is recognized as tax-exempt under a group tax exemption, the petitioner must provide a currently valid IRS group tax-exemption determination letter and documentation that the organization is covered under the group tax exemption. Examples include a:\nIf the IRS determination letter does not identify the organization’s tax exemption as a religious organization, then the petitioner must submit evidence establishing the organization’s religious nature and purpose. This may include, but is not limited to, the entity’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, flyers, articles, brochures, or other literature that describes the religious purpose and nature of the organization. If the organization is affiliated with the religious denomination, the petitioner must provide:\nProof of Salaried or Non-Salaried Compensation The petitioner must submit verifiable evidence showing how the prospective employer intends to compensate the religious worker, including specific monetary or in-kind compensation. Evidence may include:\nW-2 form or certified tax returns. If IRS documents are not available, the petitioner must explain why and provide comparable, verifiable documentation. For additional information about USCIS policy related to the compensation requirements, see the USCIS Policy Manual. | Proof of Denominational Membership and Evidence Regarding the Prospective Position The petitioner must submit:\nIf the denomination does not require a prescribed theological education, the petitioner must provide:\nProof of Previous Religious Work (Abroad or in the United States) If the requisite previous employment was in the United States and the religious worker received salaried compensation, the petitioner must provide documents showing they received a salary. This documentation may include, but is not limited to, Form W-2 or certified copies of filed income tax returns reflecting such work and compensation for the prior employment. If the requisite previous employment was in the United States and the religious worker received non-salaried compensation, the petitioner must provide:\nIf the religious worker received no salary but supported themselves and any dependents, the petitioner must provide verifiable documents to show how the religious worker maintained support. This may include, but is not limited to, audited financial statements, financial institution records, brokerage account statements, trust documents signed by an attorney, or other verifiable evidence. If the requisite previous experience was gained abroad, the petitioner must provide comparable evidence of the religious work. |\n* The IRS determination letter must be valid and cover the petitioning organization at the time the religious organization files Form I-360. A valid determination letter may include a letter that the IRS issued before the effective date of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or may be issued under subsequent Internal Revenue Code revisions.\n** The religious denomination certification should be signed by an organization other than the prospective employer, and attest that the prospective employer is part of the same religious denomination as the attesting organization.\nOn-Site Inspections\nUnder the regulations at 8 CFR 204.5(m)(12), USCIS may conduct on-site inspections of the petitioning organization either before or after a final decision is made on the petition. If we decide to conduct a pre-approval inspection, satisfactory completion of such inspection will be a condition for us approving your petition.\nThe religious organization must provide the physical address where you will work, even if that address is not the same as the mailing address, so we may conduct an on-site inspection, if we determine it necessary to verify information and supporting evidence submitted in the petition.\nIn addition, we may inspect your work location after adjudicating the form to verify your work hours, compensation, and duties. We may also complete a post-adjudication inspection in cases of suspected non-compliance with the terms of the visa classification or where the petitioning entity has undergone substantial changes since its last filing. We closely monitor all on-site inspections to ensure program integrity and to prevent undue delays in the adjudication process.\nFamily of EB-4 Special Immigrant Religious Workers\nYour spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 may accompany or follow to join you or adjust status in the United States.

In a crisis requiring a draft, men would be called in a sequence determined by random lottery number and year of birth. Then, they would be examined for mental, physical, and moral fitness by the military before being deferred or exempted from military service or inducted into the Armed Forces.\nA CHART of who must register is also available in PDF.\nImmigrants & Dual NationalsUS Territory ResidentsHospitalized or Incarcerated MenDisabled MenMen in the Armed ForcesConscientious Objectors\nImmigrants\nU.S. immigrants are required by law to register with the Selective Service System 30 days after their 18th birthday or 30 days after entry into the United States if they are between the ages of 18 and 25. This includes U.S. born and naturalized citizens, parolees, undocumented immigrants, legal permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees, and all males with visas of any kind which expired more than 30 days ago.\nThe few individuals who are exempt from this requirement are those on current non-immigrant visas, as long as they remain on a valid visa up until they turn 26. If you have received a letter from us requesting that you register, please send us copies of supporting documentation to show you are exempt.\nDual Nationals\nU.S. dual nationals are required by law to register with the Selective Service System within 30 days of their 18th birthday, regardless of whether they live inside or outside of the U.S. Dual nationals residing outside of the U.S. can register using a foreign address here.\nResidents of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands are US citizens. Citizens of American Samoa are nationals and must register when they are habitual residents in the United States or reside in the US for at least one year. Habitual residence is presumed and registration is required whenever a national or a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau, resides in the United States for more than one year in any status, except when the individual resides in the US as an employee of the government of his homeland; or as a student who entered the US for the purpose of full-time studies, as long as such person maintains that status.\nYou are exempt from Selective Service registration if you can prove you were continuously institutionalized or confined from 30 days before you turned 18 through age 25. If you were released for any period longer than 30 days during this window, you were required to register with the Selective Service System.\nFor Selective Service to determine this exemption, the following supporting documentation is needed when you mail your status information letter request form:\nDisabled men who live at home must register with Selective Service. A friend or relative may help a disabled man fill out the registration form if he can’t do it himself.\nMen with disabilities that would not qualify for military service are still required to register with Selective Service. There is a difference between exemption from registration and classification in the event of a national emergency. Selective Service does not have authority to pre-classify men for service if there is not an active draft. All men, or their parent or legal guardian, are able to submit a claim for exemption from service in the event of a draft. The criteria for exemption from registration are:\nMen serving in the military on full-time active duty do not have to register if serving continuously from age 18 to age 26. Those attending the service academies do not have to register. However, if a man joins the military after turning 18 or leaves the military before turning 26, he must register.\nNOTE: If a man fails to register, Section 12(g) of the Military Selective Service Act allows non-registrants to receive benefits under specific conditions. As long as the man has proof of his active duty military service, such as his DD 214, or current military ID card if still on active duty or a member of the National Guard or Reserves, his subsequent failure to register should not be a bar to any benefits or programs, contingent upon registration compliance, for which he is otherwise qualified.\nMembers of the Reserve and National Guard not on full-time active duty must register.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
